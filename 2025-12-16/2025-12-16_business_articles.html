                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has an "alcoholic's personality" and has engaged in legal "retribution" against his enemies since his return to office, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in a remarkably candid series of interviews with Vanity Fair published Tuesday. Wiles said in March that she and Trump had a "loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over." But she admitted, "In some cases, it may look like retribution. And she said that the administration's attempted prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who helmed a business fraud case against Trump and was seen as one of his most reviled political foes — "might be the one retribution." The case against James on mortgage fraud-related charges was dismissed in November, after a judge ruled Trump's pick of prosecutor was invalidly appointed. Wiles' eyebrow-raising remarks came during 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple, conducted over the course of Trump's first year back in the White House. Wiles, who enjoys unparalleled influence and power in Trump's orbit, mostly operates behind the scenes. But in the conversations with Whipple, she offered blunt descriptions, and occasionally criticism, of many of the administration's highest-profile officials. Wiles — whose father, former New York Giants kicker Pat Summerall, is described as an alcoholic and an absentee parent — said her difficult upbringing made her "a little bit of an expert in big personalities." She also spoke about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering behind some of Trump's biggest agenda items, including his global "reciprocal" tariff policy. The early April tariff rollout, which Trump touted as America's "Liberation Day," was the product of what Wiles described as a divided White House that could not agree on the policy's impact. "So much thinking out loud is what I would call it," Wiles said in an interview at the time, recalling that she urged advisers who doubted the tariff plans to get on board, but "they couldn't get there." Wiles pushed back on Vanity Fair's reporting in an X post later Tuesday morning, calling it "a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history." I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team," she wrote. She added that she has been "honored" to work for Trump for nearly a decade, and declared, "None of this will stop our relentless pursuit of Making America Great Again!" "President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. Whipple also reported Wiles saying that Vice President JD Vance, once a Trump critic who became a leading figure of the MAGA movement, had "sort of political" motivations for changing his viewpoint. She said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the government-reform  guidebook known as Project 2025, was "a right-wing absolute zealot." Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, "completely whiffed" on her early handling of government records related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Wiles said. Trump said on the 2024 campaign trail that he would support declassifying files from the federal investigations of Epstein, a well-connected money manager who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. But the Trump administration later said it determined that no more disclosures were warranted, sparking outrage from many MAGA supporters. Bondi, who in February gave binders with old information labeled "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" to a group of conservative influencers, failed to appreciate that those people were "the very targeted group that cared about this," Wiles said. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk," Wiles said, adding, "There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk." As for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who briefly ran Trump's controversial government-slashing group known as DOGE, Wiles accused him of being "an avowed ketamine [user]" and "an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are." She said that she "was initially aghast" when DOGE moved to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk has claimed was rife with fraud. "I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work," she said. "Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. "And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Databricks is raising $4 billion in a funding round that would value the data analytics software company at $134 billion, the company announced Tuesday. At the time, Databricks became one of a handful of private companies to surpass a $100 billion valuation, after SpaceX, ByteDance and OpenAI. Databricks said it plans to use the capital to support customer app building as artificial intelligence accelerates development. ET as Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joins CNBC TV to discuss the latest funding round and valuation. Watch in real time on CNBC+ or the CNBC Pro stream. The company said it topped a $4.8 billion revenue run-rate during the third quarter and is growing 55% year-over-year. That figure is also up from the $4 billion revenue run-rate announced earlier this year. Databricks is among a growing list of companies that have opted to stay private for longer as private markets offer more funding opportunities. Insight Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company and JPMorgan Asset Management led the round, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz. Databricks was founded in 2013 in San Francisco and ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, one of the finalists for the Federal Reserve chair job, showed support Tuesday for central bank independence. With President Donald Trump apparently in the final days of picking a successor to Jerome Powell at the Fed, Hassett declined in a CNBC interview to directly address his own candidacy but said forging consensus is an important part of the job. Prior to last week, Hassett had been considered the leading contender for the job to take over for Powell, who is nearing the end of his second term as head of the central bank. However, Trump said last week that former Governor Kevin Warsh has come to the front of the pack as well, following an interview between the two last Wednesday. There has been some pushback against Hassett in recent days. Sources told CNBC that the president's advisors worry that Hassett will be perceived as too close to Trump and will do his bidding rather than seek to set interest rates in line with the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and full employment. However, Hassett said his relationship with Trump shouldn't be held against him. "The idea that someone isn't qualified for the job because they are a close friend who's worked well with the president is something that I think the President rejects," he said. Though he appointed Powell, Trump has been a constant critic of the Fed chief. Trump has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts, unsatisfied even as the FOMC has approved three consecutive cuts since September totaling three quarters of a percentage point. Governor Stephen Miran, a Trump appointee who came on board in September, has voted against each of those reductions in favor of half-point cuts. Trump has advocated that the Fed should consult the president when making rate decisions. So that's the way it moves forward. But the President is a seasoned observer of the economy, and if he has a good point, then I'm sure others will recognize it as such." Hassett and Warsh were part of five finalists for the job. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the process, said Tuesday morning on Fox Business that the decision likely will come in early January. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky sees a lot of career advice on the site every day, but he doesn't always agree with every piece that's shared. One common tip that Roslansky said is "a little bit outdated" is that "you have to have a five-year plan," he told content creator Erin McGoff in an interview for her YouTube channel AdviceWithErin. In Roslansky's view, having a five-year plan is "a little bit foolish," he said: given how rapidly technology and the workplace are changing, it's not realistic to "chart out what the next five years of your life are going to look like." "I think that's the right mental model in this environment," he said. "If you focus on those shorter steps, gaining learning, gaining experience, a lot of your career path will open up for you." According to Roslansky, having a linear career path isn't realistic anymore. Many people think "you graduate high school and then go to a certain college and then become a consultant and then get an MBA," he said – but "that's not how it happens at all for most people." Once you let go of that idea, "you can take your own career into your own hands," he said. "No one is trying to figure this out for you. Roslansky also shared his best advice for young people navigating their careers right now. His first tip is to "learn the tools" and experiment with using AI at work, he told McGoff. "Whether or not you like it, whether or not it's a good fit for what you're trying to do, that mental model – like, 'I'm going to use this tool and learn it to help me do something' – I think is the most important thing," he continued. Still, "it's not just about the tools and technology," Roslansky said: skills like empathy, judgment and communication are still "critical" in the modern workplace. "In a world where everyone is kind of, you know, focused more on the technology, if you really work on a lot of those human skills, it can be a great differentiator for you," he said.

In its push to create an "AI-first" workplace, Meta is expanding employees' access to tools from rivals such as Google and OpenAI, Business Insider has learned. The social media giant has been encouraging employees to integrate AI tools into nearly everything they do, according to multiple internal documents and posts seen by Business Insider. One of the company's priorities is to "make AI core to how we work," Meta's chief information officer, Atish Banerjea, told employees in a June memo outlining a plan to use Meta's own models — which use the naming convention "Llama" — alongside products from other firms. The post included a list of AI tools Meta employees have access to, including their use cases. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the revamped suite of AI tools and pointed to an earlier comment shared with Business Insider about AI adoption, stating: "It's well-known that this is a priority, and we're focused on using AI to help employees with their day-to-day work." Among those is an internal coding tool called Devmate that uses Anthropic's Claude, Business Insider previously reported. Google's Gemini and NotebookLM Pro are also available across the company to help employees "work smarter and have more impact," Banerjea told employees in the June memo. Meta has invested tens of billions into its own consumer-facing AI models, and employees have access to an internal AI assistant called Metamate, which is built on its Llama models. On the engineering side, Meta has expanded access to agentic coding systems, adding Google's Gemini 3 Pro and exploring new integrations with tools like OpenAI's Codex CLI and Google's Gemini CLI. "Rather than focusing on specific solutions, our strategy centers on outcomes: increasing productivity, accelerating development, and ensuring you have access to the best agentic coding experiences," Reality Labs executive Maher Saba told employees in a November memo seen by Business Insider. To encourage adoption and experimentation, Meta has gamified the use of AI, Business Insider previously reported. Earlier this year, it launched an internal game called "Level Up," which rewards employees with badges for using AI in different ways. Leaders are also tying performance to results achieved through AI, rewarding those who can prove "AI-driven impact" this year, and including it as part of performance reviews in 2026.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Sudan has grounded four aircraft linked to United Nations operations, citing security risks and suspected involvement in smuggling, in a move that has raised fresh concerns over aviation safety and relations with international partners. South Sudan's government has grounded four aircraft contracted to the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), accusing them of operating with undisclosed surveillance equipment and engaging in the smuggling of natural resources, a move that has heightened tensions between Juba and the UN peacekeeping mission. Addressing heads of foreign missions in Juba, Foreign Minister Monday Semaya Kumba said authorities had uncovered evidence that two of the aircraft were fitted with reconnaissance and surveillance systems that had not been declared to the government. He said the equipment went beyond what had been approved under existing aviation agreements, raising concerns about sovereignty and national security. The foreign minister added that two other aircraft are suspected of being used to smuggle sandalwood, a high-value natural resource, between South Sudan and neighbouring Sudan. Kumba said investigators have “preliminary evidence” supporting the claim, though further verification is ongoing. Authorities said a special investigation committee has submitted its findings to relevant agencies, and appropriate action will follow. Juba reassured international partners that the move does not signal a rejection of peacekeeping operations. The mission maintains that it operates within its mandate and coordinates with national authorities. The UN has faced repeated criticism in Africa for inadvertently fueling insecurity. In South Sudan, Mali, and the Sahel, operations have sometimes disrupted political dynamics or provoked armed groups. Allegations of trafficking, abuse, and corruption by UN personnel have further eroded public trust, highlighting the challenges of large-scale peacekeeping in fragile states. The grounding occurs amid ongoing internal security challenges, humanitarian pressures, and strained international relations.
