President Donald Trump has escalated threats against Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks, and reports now say the Trump administration is preparing for the days after a potential Maduro overthrow. In November, Michael Crowley at The New York Times pursued this question by reminding readers that, during Trump's first term, U.S. officials were asked to run a war game to examine what Venezuela in a post-Maduro era would look like. According to Douglas Farah, a national security consultant who specializes in Latin America, the war game showed that the overthrow of Maduro would yield “chaos for a sustained period of time with no possibility of ending it.” Crowley, at his end, adds that the results of the exercise note that “chaos and violence were likely to erupt within Venezuela, as military units, rival political factions and even jungle-based guerrilla groups jockeyed for control of the oil-rich country.” Currently, no such chaos has erupted in Venezuela despite at least 95 people having been killed by the United States military in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific as of December 16. Meanwhile, a recent poll conducted by CBS News concluded that 70 percent of people in the United States are opposed to the Trump administration taking military action against Venezuela. Inside Venezuela, the people Truthout spoke to for this article said that, while they are certainly following the crisis, most people are continuing with their daily lives. Living in a state-built apartment, which she is paying off at affordable rates though the government's massive housing program known as Gran Misión Vivienda Venezuela (Great Mission Housing Venezuela), Chacón used to live in New Horizon, which is part of Catia, one of Venezuela's largest, poorest and most densely populated areas. People are focused on their own stuff: working, making ends meet, and now, even more so, getting Christmas ready for the kids. With life continuing largely as normal, Márques notes the recent November election in which more than 5,300 community circuits (communes) voted to pick which community proposed projects will obtain state funding. According to Márques, the election saw “civic participation” as “several communal councils renewed their spokespersons through secret ballots.” Subsequently Chávez proceeded to purge the army and cement his doctrine of Latin American-style socialism. From 2007, Venezuela's armed forces adopted the slogan: “Patria, socialismo o muerte! With a different perspective from those of Chacón and Márques, Antonio Gonzalez Plessmann, a human rights activist in Caracas and militant leftist since the 1980s, no longer supports Maduro. Plessmann thinks Venezuelans' main anxiety remains “economic precariousness” and says household incomes for an average family of four cannot cover the cost of food and basic necessities. As a result, Plessmann told Truthout, many people have “several jobs to make ends meet,” a situation that is not uncommon throughout many Latin American countries. “Madurismo is a mutation of Chavismo, which separates from the strategic postulates of the Bolivarian Revolution: popular participation, democratic radicalism, and anti-capitalist orientation,” Plessmann says. Former President Chávez, in his view, “was hated by Fedecámaras [the main business association] and loved by the poor” while Maduro is “loved by Fedecámaras” and “despised by the majority of the popular sectors, many of whom were once Chavistas.” While Washington has attempted “regime change” on several occasions against Venezuela's head of state, Plessmann says, Maduro now finds himself “at one of his weakest moments: He lacks popular support and real backing from much of Latin America.” Colombia's second-largest guerrilla movement, the Army of National Liberation (ELN) has yet to reach an agreement with the administration of Gustavo Petro, who presides over a broad-left coalition. According to a report from the International Crisis Group, whose analysis is often in line with U.S. political establishment, the ELN “has repeatedly stated its commitment to defend the Maduro government, and has promised to turn its fire on any foreign forces that intervene in the region; its expertise includes use of improvised explosives and, more recently, armed drones.” González also noted that China has become an important factor in Washington's calculations and aggression toward Venezuela, given that it has become the main purchaser of the country's oil. “At one point, something like 70 percent of Venezuela's oil was going to China,” says González, with that figure now down to “about 45 percent” However, it still remains the largest buyer of the South American country's oil. As with the case of Panama, where the government ended the Central American country's participation in China's Belt and Road Initiative after Trump issued a series of threats ranging from increasing trade tariffs to an outright military invasion to take back the Panama Canal, Trump's advisers cannot be looking at Beijing's growing economic presence in Latin America kindly. At Washington's end, Tinker says Trump's new approach “involves efforts to isolate China, which has gained an important foothold in the past 20 years” while “investing close to a billion dollars to produce oil in Lake Maracaibo,” — a region located in the northwest of Venezuela in the state of Zulia, which accounts for most of the country's oil production. Tinker told Truthout he thinks U.S. military forces are aiming for an extended stay in the Caribbean as part of a “Western Hemisphere Strategy.” The problem, he says, is that “U.S.-led efforts at regime change have been disastrous” and any administration imposed through force will face a “crisis of legitimacy, especially if they begin to implement neoliberal economic policies as they have proposed.” He adds that while “important segments of the population may be critical of Maduro,” these Venezuelans “will not stand idly by and allow their rights to be subverted.” Steve Ellner is a retired professor of economic history and political science from the Universidad de Oriente in Venezuela, where he lived for over 40 years. From a political viewpoint it's unlikely that Trump would just pull out, since he would face intense criticism and a loss of MAGA support given everything that has been done up until now. “Maduro,” claimed Ellner, “is willing to make concessions … which would allow Trump to spin a narrative that the U.S. got what it wants.” Such concessions might include handing over individuals accused of being involved in the drug trade as well as “concessions regarding Venezuela's oil reserves.” “It has taken so much effort to achieve our independence, and we cannot believe that a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela would bring stability,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Officials said they were considering such a move last week, but the plan was widely condemned by health experts. If you value progressive media, please make a year-end donation today. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) top official Marty Makary announced that the agency has opted not to put “black box” warnings on coronavirus vaccines, despite reports that FDA officials were considering such a move last week. Such warnings are placed on opioid medication, for example, to warn users about the risks of overusing the drug, including addiction, overdose, and death. A recently leaked FDA memo, authored by Prasad, announced that the agency would investigate whether there is a link between COVID vaccinations and deaths in the U.S. The memo sparked concerns from medical experts, who noted that many of Prasad's claims are not backed by evidence. Prasad claimed, for instance, that COVID itself “was never highly lethal for children” and that its effects “are comparable” to other respiratory viruses — despite one study indicating that the virus was more lethal to children than the flu. The memo also claimed that the agency has found “at least 10 children [who] have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination.” But an investigation from Inside Medicine discovered that Prasad's statement was made before a preliminary examination of deaths — and that the actual number of deaths from adverse reactions to the vaccine could be as high as seven or as low as zero. Notably, a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report has demonstrated, like many others before it, that vaccines are both safe and beneficial for children. That report examined hundreds of children who had received dosages of COVID vaccines and compared outcomes with children who hadn't received them. Researchers found that “vaccine effectiveness…was an estimated 76 percent against COVID-19-associated emergency department or urgent care visits” among kids 9 months to 4 years old. The vaccines also had 56 percent effectiveness against such visits for kids 5-17 years old, versus those who did not receive a vaccine. In both places, low mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates have likely led to the outbreaks. Spartanburg County, South Carolina, for example, has an MMR vaccine rate around 90 percent — 5 points below the 95 percent vaccine rate that health experts say is needed to protect against community-level outbreaks. Mohave County, Arizona, has a 79.4 percent rate of MMR vaccination, while Washington County, Utah, has a rate of 82.7 percent. As of December 9, there have been 1,912 measles cases confirmed across the U.S., a 570 percent increase from the total number of cases counted in 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Staff at the Ashland animal shelter sold merch of raccoon they cared for after he was found passed out in a liquor store Merchandise commemorating the raccoon that gained international fame by barging into a Virginia liquor store, smashing bottled spirits and passing out drunk in a bathroom on Black Friday has raised more than a quarter-million dollars for the local animal shelter where he slept off his bender. Proceeds from the campaign anchored by those limited edition items “directly support shelter animal care and enrichment”, according to Bonfire's website. “While this raccoon gave us all a much-needed laugh, our officers handle hundreds of calls each year involving wildlife, stray animals, and emergencies requiring specialized training and equipment,” said a message from the shelter on Bonfire's website. “Your support helps us continue providing compassionate, professional service to both animals and residents of Hanover county.” An ABC store employee found what Bonfire's website referred to as “our unexpected raccoon celebrity” next to a toilet the day after Thanksgiving. Hanover county animal protection officer Samantha Martin more recently told the local government's official podcast that the raccoon had at least two other break-ins on his rap sheet. Martin told Hear in Hanover that the raccoon had previously broken into a karate studio and a department of motor vehicles office, all on the same block of businesses. She made it a point to say that the raccoon had eaten some of the DMV's snacks, calling him “a smart little critter”. “I think he's living his best life,” Martin joked on the podcast. News of the raccoon's liquor store banditry spread worldwide after a study recently concluded that his brethren had adapted to living in urban areas so well that they had been developing certain physical signs of domestication, including shorter snouts and smaller teeth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>News of Ahmed al-Ahmed's selfless act quickly reached al-Nayrab, where locals say it proves religion or birthplace no barrier to heroism “His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” said farmer Mohammed, a 60-year-old uncle of Ahmed. On Sunday, two gunmen, alleged to be 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, attacked a Hanukah celebration on the Sydney beach, killing 15 people. One of the alleged gunmen also died. Upon hearing the shots, Ahmed crept closer using cars for cover, before launching himself at one of two gunmen. The act of heroism has made him famous in Australia and in Syria, where Syrians have been widely sharing the video of him disarming the gunman with pride. Ahmed's own home is ruined, with the roof still patchy from bombs and no windows or doors surviving. Another relative recalled Ahmed as a heroic man and praised him for saving “innocent lives.” “We are proud of what Ahmed, the son of our village did … his act was heroic and no one else could have done it,” Abdul Rahman al-Mohammed, a 30-year-old resident of Nayrab, told AFP. I have passed through a very difficult phase, but thank God for everything,” Ahmed says while wishing specific family members well. Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, visited Ahmed in the hospital, shaking his hand and telling him that his “bravery is an inspiration for all Australians”. An online fundraiser to pay for his medical bills has received more than £1.2m in donations, with the GoFundMe being shared around the world. The attack on Bondi beach, allegedly carried out by a father and son who reportedly underwent military training in an Islamist militant hotbed in the southern Philippines, seemed to be “motivated by Islamic State ideology,”, said Albanese. The PM went on to say that Ahmed's heroism proved that coexistence, not extremism, was the essence of Australian society. “At the best of times, what we see is Australians coming together. And what I want is for Australians to come together, for this to be reinforcing the need for us to promote national unity, and that is critical. There is no place in Australia for anti-semitism. There is no place for hatred,” Albanese said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>District attorney's office has until Wednesday to file charges against Nick Reiner following deaths of his parents Los Angeles investigators are expected on Tuesday to lay out their case against Nick Reiner, who was arrested on suspicion of murdering his parents, the actor-director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner. Detectives from the Los Angeles police department's (LAPD) homicide division took Nick, 32, into custody on Sunday night, hours after his parents were found dead in their Brentwood home, the department announced on Monday. The police said that on 14 December, around 3.40pm local time, LAPD officers responded to a call of a death investigation in the 200 block of South Chadbourne Avenue. They said that once inside the residence, officers discovered two victims, who were later identified as Rob and Michele. Alan Jackson, Nick Reiner's defense attorney, told reporters that his client had not received medical clearance to appear in court and would not do so before Wednesday. On Monday, the Los Angeles police chief, Jim McDonnell, confirmed that Nick had been “booked for murder” in connection with his parents' killings and called the deaths “very tragic”. Nick Reiner had previously struggled with addiction and mental health, and co-wrote a screenplay based on his experiences that was made into a 2015 film directed by his father. A family friend told the Los Angeles Times that Nick was living at the family property in Brentwood and that Michele Reiner was recently worried about his mental health. The evening before the killings, Rob and Nick Reiner were heard arguing at a Christmas party at comedian Conan O'Brien's home, media outlets reported.</p>

The “Tech Prosperity Deal,” covering artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy, was agreed during President Donald Trump's state visit to Britain in September, in a celebration of the countries' close ties and ability to work together on trade and technology. Talks on sectors such as steel stalled, though the two sides agreed a framework pharmaceutical deal earlier this month. U.S. and Britain to announce tech, nuclear energy deals during Trump visit A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment in detail on what he said were “live negotiations,” adding that the relationship with Washington was still strong. Both parties obviously want what's best for their countries, but ... we remain in active conversations,” he told reporters, adding it was “natural and normal” for countries to prioritize their own interests. Under the Tech Prosperity Deal, Britain and the United States agreed to work together on quantum computers and artificial intelligence, while the likes of Microsoft, Google, Nvidia and OpenAI pledged to invest tens of billions of dollars in Britain. The White House did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. The U.S. is Britain's largest trading partner, and its big tech companies have already invested billions of dollars in their U.K. operations.

Aging doesn't happen in a straight line. One moment, you feel strong and energetic; the next, fatigue, stress, or hormonal shifts seem to age you overnight. But what if aging follows predictable milestones—and you could adjust your habits at each stage to stay younger, sharper, and more resilient?

Dr. Tsung-Han Chou, an attending physician at Taiwan's Mingtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic, said that wellness is never one-size-fits-all. In an episode of “Health 1+1” on NTD, a sister outlet of The Epoch Times, he explained that each decade of life brings unique biological and emotional challenges—and requires its own strategy for preserving vitality.

Chou identifies two major turning points in the aging process: “The first comes after having children, and the second is menopause.”

For both men and women, the years following parenthood demand extra support to maintain energy and hormonal balance. Later, menopause—driven by dramatic hormonal shifts—ushers in the next major stage of aging.

In traditional Chinese medicine, the spleen and stomach represent the body's digestive and metabolic strength—the ability to convert food into energy. A strong digestive system buffers against stress, supports immunity, and helps maintain stable energy throughout demanding work years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canada's main stock index dipped for the third successive session on Tuesday, as heavyweight energy stocks followed oil prices lower. ET, the S&P/TSX Composite index was down 144.46 points, or 0.46 per cent, at 31,338.98, and was set for its lowest close in a week. Canada's energy sector tumbled 3 per cent as oil prices sank below US$60 after prospects of a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen. Meanwhile, shares of cannabis firms Canopy Growth (WEED-T), Trulieve Cannabis (TRUL-CN) and Curaleaf Holdings (CURA-T) rose between 4.8 per cent and 9.3 per cent, extending their recent gains, after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering an executive order to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday after data showed jobs growth rebounded in November, but the unemployment rate stood at 4.6 per cent. Canada's retail sales data for October is due later this week. Macklem is set to speak later in the day. “It's just going to be a data-driven market for a little while,” said Ian Chong, portfolio manager at First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc. After a strong year, doubts about valuation could prompt investors book profits, he said. Wells Fargo global investment strategist Douglas Beath explains why it's completely reasonable to be worried about market concentration in AI-related stocks, “1 .The world's largest company and Al bellwether has a market capitalization higher than the Energy, Materials, and Real Estate sectors combined (in addition to the Utilities sector as of this writing). Earnings concentration: The two dominant sectors related to the Al theme (Information Technology and Communication Services) have accounted for 27.4 per cent and 10.6 per cent of S&P 500 earnings to date this year through November 30. Since ChatGPT was released on November 30,2022, the three-year total return through November 30,2025 for Al-related stocks has dominated that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index He notes that the S&P 500 equal weight index is closing in on an all-time high and the number of stocks above their 50 day moving average is steadily increasing. Pfizer's (PFE-N) profits will fall short of Wall Street estimates next year, as it faces weaker sales of COVID products and squeezed margins stemming from its deal with the U.S. government to lower prescription drug costs. The stock fell nearly 5 per cent in Tuesday trading. Pfizer shares have dropped more than 50 per cent since early 2023 as demand for COVID vaccines and treatments waned, leaving the company trailing peers in performance. Its pipeline has not produced a game-changing drug since it helped to develop COVID vaccine Comirnaty and produced COVID treatment Paxlovid. Wall Street's main indexes were little changed in volatile trading on Tuesday as healthcare and energy stocks led losses, while investors assessed a jobs report that signaled a cooling labor market and kept hopes for future interest rate cuts alive. Policymakers broadly acknowledged signs of a weakening jobs market when the central bank lowered rates last week. Investors raised expectations for rate cuts next year, according to data compiled by LSEG, and are now pricing in at least 58 basis points of reductions, higher than the 25 bps signaled by the central bank last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.66 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 48,406.44. The S&P 500 lost 1.97 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 6,814.54, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 33.47 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 23,090.89. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hovered near their three-week lows as persistent uncertainty over rate cuts and concerns about lofty tech valuations continued to weigh on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 fell 16.4 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 6,800.12​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 75.6 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 22,981.819. ET, Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.3 per cent at 31,399.073 points.

U.S. retail sales were unexpectedly flat in October, though consumer spending appears to have remained on a solid footing at the start of the fourth quarter despite the rising cost of living that is forcing some households to scale back. The unchanged reading in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department's Census Bureau on Tuesday followed a downwardly revised 0.1-per-cent gain in September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, edging up 0.1 per cent after a previously reported 0.2-per-cent rise in September. Americans are facing higher prices for food, furniture and a range of other imported goods, the result of President Donald Trump's sweeping import duties. Economists say lower- and middle-income households have been disproportionately impacted by the soaring cost of living. Trump, who last year swept to election victory on promises to tame inflation, has in recent weeks alternated between dismissing affordability problems as a hoax, blaming former President Joe Biden, and promising his economic policies will benefit Americans next year. U.S. stock index futures turned positive on Tuesday, as investors assessed a long-delayed jobs report and prospects of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. A Labor Department report showed nonfarm payrolls increased 64,000 in November, compared with an estimated 50,000 rise, according to economists polled by Reuters. A separate reading from the Commerce Department also showed retail sales for October were flat, compared with an estimate of a 0.1 per cent increase. U.S. job growth rebounded in November after nonfarm payrolls declined in October because of government spending cuts, but the unemployment rate was at 4.6 per cent as the labour market weakens against the backdrop of economic uncertainty stemming from President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 64,000 jobs last month, the BLS said. The unemployment rate was at 4.4 per cent in September. The BLS made changes to weights for labor force estimates because no data was collected in October. BMO chief economist Doug Porter highlighted climbing food costs, The good news on that front is that home prices continue to drift down nationally, market rents are easing, and of course interest rates have come down heavily since spring 2024. Housing affordability is not yet back to ‘normal', but it's moving into the same hemisphere. Grocery inflation has been slowly building over the past year, after holding almost steady in 2024. BofA Securities investment strategist Michael Hartnett compiled the results of his monthly survey of global fund managers with his usual punchy writing style, “Most bullish FMS [fund manager survey] of past 3½ years, macro optimism highest since Aug'21 on ‘run-it-hot' belief, allocation to stocks+commodities highest since Feb'22, cash level at record-low 3.3 per cent (down from 3.7 per cent); Dec FMS pushes BofA Bull & Bear Indicator up to 7.9, v close to ‘sell signal'; bullish positioning remains biggest headwind for risk assets. Citi strategist Adam Pickett compiled what he believes will be the 12 most important market themes in 2026, While diversification is likely still helpful next year, tech should be part of the longs … #2 Sector rotation around reflation — It will not be only about AI in 2026. We think cyclicals can do well in a reflating economy, as shown by our regime work … #4 Global cyclical strength — We see long copper as a clean expression of global cyclical strength, and is an all-weather trade, somewhat independent of US growth developments. #7 ‘Tis the season for more spending —We think the European continent offers some opportunities on fiscal, monetary and political divergence, particularly in UK and France … We see the run-it-hot stance as an H2 risk to term premia and inflation expectations (both higher). USD correlations fall as we move into the ‘recovery' regime, so we sell USD correlations in dual digitals to leverage up our pro-cyclical view. Power pricing more in-line with datacenter costs can add more than $1,000/t to aluminium production costs and will filter through to prices. #12 Europe energy rotation – We see strong micro and macro fundamentals for European carbon credits next year, and risks of an imminent EU intervention may be overstated." National Bank Financial analyst Richard Tse sees “more risks” for Canada's technology sector heading into 2026 than a year ago, believing “uncertainty around AI's potential disruption ... won't abate until there's short-term proof one way or the other around the pace of potential disruptions. “We think the opportunities at the time of writing will continue to be narrow and likely come from firm market leaders and inflection candidates — the latter being names with inflecting revenue growth and operating leverage, or earlier-cycle sensitivity to IT spending recoveries," he added. Global fund managers are the most bullish in three and a half years this month, Bank of America's survey showed on Tuesday, as optimism over a “run-it-hot” macro backdrop and policy expectations drove allocations to risk assets. Cash holdings tumbled to a record low of 3.3 per cent from 3.7 per cent in November, as exposure to equities and commodities hit the highest since February 2022, the bank said. The survey's “Bull & Bear” indicator climbed to 7.9, close to a “sell signal”, suggesting that bullish investor positioning remains the biggest headwind for risk assets. Profit expectations are at their strongest since August 2021, with 57 per cent of respondents predicting a soft landing for the global economy and just 3 per cent bracing for a hard landing, according to BofA. Private credit and hyperscaler spending were seen as the most likely sources of a credit event, which ranked fourth among tail risks. 203 participants with US$569-billion in assets under management responded to the global survey. European stocks fell in early trading on Tuesday, struggling to make gains as traders took a cautious position ahead of key U.S. jobs data, while the dollar stayed near its lowest in two months. The data could influence expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy next year, after the Fed's commentary when it cut rates last week was interpreted as less hawkish than anticipated, strengthening expectations for more rate cuts in 2026. Stock markets fell during Asian trading, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropping to its lowest in three weeks. European indexes also opened lower, before edging slightly higher. “Either you get strong numbers, so the economy re-accelerates. Or you have not that good of a number and hence expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates even more,” said Kevin Thozet, a member of Carmignac's investment committee. Global markets were lower amid investor caution ahead of a slate of U.S. data, including the jobs report, that may help signal the path for Federal Reserve policy next year. TSX futures followed sentiment lower after sagging oil prices weighed on Canada's main stock market yesterday. On Wall Street, markets are watching earnings from Lennar Corp. “As it stands, the Fed have only signalled one further cut for 2026 in the dot plot, but we've repeatedly seen in this cycle how a softer labour market has pushed them back in a dovish direction.” Overseas, the pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.09 per cent in morning trading. Oil prices fell on Tuesday, adding to the previous session's losses, as prospects for a Russia-Ukraine peace deal appeared to strengthen, raising expectations of a potential easing of sanctions. Both contracts were near their lowest since May this year. “Brent has dropped this morning to below $60 per barrel for the first time in months, as the market assesses a potential peace deal resulting in additional Russian volumes becoming available and oversupplying the market further,” said Rystad analyst Janiv Shah. Russia, meanwhile, said it was not willing to make any territorial concessions in talks on ending the Ukraine war, state news agency TASS quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying. “The grind in talks will be matched with the continued grind lower in prices as we enter 2026 with all it associated predictions of ‘glut.' Brent will make a fresh year-to-date low, but will not break below $55 a barrel before the year is out,” said PVM Oil Associates analyst John Evans. Adding to the pressure, soft Chinese economic data released on Monday further fueled concerns that global demand may not be strong enough to absorb recent supply growth, said IG market analyst Tony Sycamore in a note. China's factory output growth slowed to a 15-month low, official data showed. Retail sales also grew at their slowest pace since December 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic Stocks closed lower on Monday as investors braced for a slew of U.S. economic data later this week while assessing reports on Federal Reserve candidates and commentary from policy makers for clues on the interest-rate outlook. The non-farm payroll figures for October and November are due later this week, along with reports on retail sales, business activity and inflation. October's jobs data was delayed by the government shutdown earlier this quarter. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq had logged their steepest daily declines in more than three weeks on Friday amid concerns about inflation and debt-fuelled AI investments. Traders also assessed Monday a report that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett's candidacy for the Fed chair role received some pushback from people close to U.S. President Donald Trump. Speculation has been rife over a possible frontrunner as Jerome Powell's term ends in May. Also on Monday, New York Fed President John Williams said the central bank's interest rate cut last week leaves it in a good position, while Fed Governor Stephen Miran argued that current inflation does not reflect the true supply-demand dynamics. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.49 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 48,416.56, the S&P 500 lost 10.90 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 6,816.51 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 137.76 points, or 0.59 per cent, to 23,057.41. The S&P/TSX Composite Index ended down 43.95 points, or 0.1 per cent, at 31,843.44, slightly extending its pullback from a record closing high on Thursday.

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Moscow will under no circumstances agree to the deployment of Western troops in Ukraine in any form, including within the NATO framework, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in an interview with ABC News.

"We are open-minded in terms of what decisions might be made. We definitely will not at any time subscribe to, agree to, or even be content with, any presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian territory," the senior diplomat said.

When asked further whether Russia would be prepared to agree to the deployment of European forces in Ukraine outside the NATO framework, Ryabkov replied: "No, no, no. The coalition of the willing is just the same. May be even worse, because it may be arranged without usual NATO procedures that are more or less stable. Nothing is stable in the Western world these days. So, no confidence, no trust, rather total and dominating mistrust to anything that comes from major NATO capitals."</p>

MOSCOW, December 16. /TASS/. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has set off for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian officials in Moscow, Iranian Ambassador to Russia Kazem Jalali announced.

"Stable relations between Iran and Russia are getting stronger thanks to continued high-level meetings. Following last week's consultations between the two countries' presidents in Ashgabat, Dr. Araghchi set off today for a meeting with this country's foreign minister and other officials in Moscow," the Iranian embassy quoted the ambassador as saying on its Telegram channel.

At present, the agenda includes a wide range of political issues and economic projects, as the two countries maintain regional and international cooperation to promote shared goals and approaches designed to take bilateral relations to a new level, he emphasized.

Earlier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the two top diplomats will discuss in detail current international issues, including the situation around the Iranian nuclear program, and exchange views on regional topic of mutual interests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of the Nazi party, which causes much concern, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview with the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). He also noted that the situation around Russia's frozen assets made it clear that "stealing is in the Europeans' blood." Politicians in Germany and other European countries are starting to remember their ancestors who were active members of Nazi party, which "causes much concern." "The ideas and practices of Nazism" are being revived in Europe as efforts are being made to unite it and send it to fight against Russia the way Hitler and Napoleon did in the past: "It's about openly Nazi approaches and flagrant disregard for what the Nazi regime in Ukraine is doing." Europe, united "under the Nazi flag," is once again waging a war against Russia, which involves "European money and European instructors," but Ukrainians are being used as proxies. Europe has had a lot of opportunities to become part of the process to resolve the Ukraine conflict, but it ignored them all. Russia has nothing to communicate about with the current European leadership. Western media allegations that Russia cannot be trusted are "empty words." In its new National Security Strategy, the US is telling Europe, "Go about your own business and don't expect the US to keep supporting your reckless ventures because it has more important affairs to attend to, primarily in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region." US sanctions on Russia's oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft stem from the desire "to suppress its competitors by using dirty methods." The US is pursuing a policy of confronting China, which is becoming economically and politically stronger with every year, but "competition must be fair." Imposing tariffs of 100% and 500% to suppress competitors runs counter to the principles of globalization, which is what the US promoted for Russia after World War II: "When sanctions are introduced and no one is hiding that the political positions of countries and individuals are the reason, it's not even inequality, it's disrespect for human rights." "Our Western ‘colleagues' seem to have a bent towards stealing in their genes." Reasonable people in the US and Europe call for restoring "the principle of arms control," and Russia shares this approach. Russia seeks to boost security cooperation with Iran, particularly through the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO): "We are open to cooperation." Western countries seek to divide the five Caspian nations "in order to impose decisions that won't be based on a consensus."</p>
