NEW YORK (AP) — An on-duty Customs and Border Protection officer fired his gun several times during a confrontation with another motorist Tuesday on an access road for New York's Kennedy Airport, police said. The CBP officer told authorities that he pulled his weapon after the other driver attacked him over a minor traffic crash, Port Authority police said. It wasn't clear if the shots hit anything. The two-vehicle crash happened shortly before 5 a.m. near the airport's main car rental facilities on the tangle of roads and ramps that lead to the airport's terminals, administration buildings and cargo areas. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports a Customs and Border Protection officer fires a gun in dispute with a driver. JFK's roadways are currently undergoing a major construction overhaul and navigating the thicket of detours and traffic changes has been a source of frustration and confusion for many drivers. The Port Authority didn't say if the officer was driving an official vehicle. His name has not been released.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Authorities knocked on doors and scoured yards Monday in search of any video or other evidence that might lead them to the Brown University gunman after a weekend attack killed two students and wounded nine others. Authorities believe they are looking for a person shown in a short clip of video footage walking away, but the person is not facing the camera. Police renewed their search Monday for the gunman who killed two Brown University students and wounded nine others.

Bukaty) A memorial of flowers and signs lay outside the Barus and Holley engineering building at Brown University, on Hope Street in Providence, R.I., on Tuesday, Dec 16, 2025. PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Additional police were sent to Providence schools on Tuesday to reassure worried parents that their kids will be safe with the Brown University shooter on the loose and no indication yet that investigators have zeroed in on a specific suspect. Authorities on Monday released several new videos of the man suspected in Saturday's mass shooting inside of a Brown classroom, which killed two students and wounded nine others. With the investigation in its third day Monday, officers were still knocking on doors and poring through dumpsters and backyards near the Ivy League campus in search of additional video evidence or other clues. But at the same time, I think that if the person really wanted to scare us, we shouldn't allow him or her to win,” said Tatjana Stojanovic, a Providence parent who lives next door to the Brown campus. “Despite all of that, we should just go about our lives. I mean, obviously, you cannot forget this. But I think we shouldn't cower and just sort of stop living despite what has happened. In the five videos authorities have released of the suspect, he was wearing a mask or his face was turned. The FBI described him as about 5 feet, 8 inches (173 centimeters) tall, with a stocky build. The attack and the shooter's escape have raised questions about campus security, including a lack of security cameras, and led to calls for better locks on campus doors. Others pushed back, though, saying such efforts do little to address the real issue. “And all of this, like, ‘Oh, the doors need to be locked.' After spending of her life in schools where every door was locked and school shootings continued to persist, Kass said such security measures only created “the illusion of safety.” Jacob Spears, 18, a freshman from Evans, Georgia, was shot in the stomach, “but through sheer adrenaline and courage, he managed to run outside, where he was aided by others,” according to a GoFundMe site organized for him. The other student killed was, MukhammadAziz Umurzokov, an 18-year-old freshman from Brandermill, Virginia, who was majoring in biochemistry and neuroscience. His family immigrated to the U.S. from Uzbekistan when he was a kid. “He had so many hardships in his life, and he got into this amazing school and tried so hard to follow through with the promise he made when was 7 years old,” she said.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. founder Corey Brooks discusses the strengths he has seen in North Carolina as he continues walking across America. As I continue my Walk Across America through the great state of North Carolina, I have heard from folks up north that "the South is America's problem." These friends of mine, who are not so familiar with this region, often think of it as the nation's hotbed of backwardness, where the lingering echoes of slavery, segregation and Confederate nostalgia fuel divisive debates over race, guns and social progress. They believe this region is mired in poverty and prejudice and forever locked into battles over old monuments. But they're outsiders who've never walked the backroads I have. I have met farmers, factory hands, professors, business people, churchgoers, chefs and veterans, and I am calling it like I see it: These outsiders are flat-out wrong. People forget that I spent the first 12 years of my life in the South, in Kenton, Tennessee. We believed in rock-solid families, a work ethic that doesn't quit, and a resilience that sees us through adversities of all kinds. Volunteers from all around saved what could be saved, tarped the roofs and cleared debris. I met a retired couple, and they told me that their home sat under nine feet of mud and water. A team of church folks they had never met came and prayed over the ruins. The wife told me, "Pastor, we lost our home but never our faith, and it is because of that that God's people showed up." I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families. I've also seen great family values in this state. One morning in a diner, I read in the local paper that the North Carolina House of Representatives created Opportunity Scholarships for every family, using a sliding scale based on income. The aim of this program is to free kids from failing schools. As the state's website explains, "The Opportunity Scholarship helps North Carolina families pay for tuition and other required fees to attend registered private schools." When I talked about this with a family that I met, they informed me that there were also programs like All Pro Dads & Responsible Fatherhood that teach men to step up for their families. On the cultural front, the legislature has kept girls' sports for biological girls only, yanked explicit books from elementary shelves, and cut taxes so hardworking moms and dads keep more of their paycheck — personal income tax is down to 4.25% this year, with triggers for further cuts if revenues hold. I have long hated the government for the dependency it created in communities like mine on the South Side of Chicago, but this feels different. It's our money being used to create agency, responsibility and accountability. And, in the end, it is up to the individual to take advantage — or not. I've walked through factory towns where folks don't chase viral fame — they chase the ability to provide for their families. North Carolina's manufacturing jobs hit 473,000 last year, and they say there will be 3.5% growth through 2032, adding more than 16,000 jobs. Over 20,000 veterans are transitioning out of the armed forces this year, and they bring that military discipline straight to the shop floor. This is a record year for jobs — 33,745 new ones announced, with $23 billion invested. JetZero is dropping $4.7 billion on an airplane plant in Guilford County for 14,500 jobs; Vulcan Elements, $918 million in Benson for 1,000 magnet factory spots; Novartis, $771 million in Durham for 700 pharma roles. These aren't handouts — they're jobs for men and women who show up on time, work overtime and thank God for the opportunity. The South has its sins and struggles like anywhere. As 2 Chronicles 7:14 says, if my people humble themselves and pray, God heals the land. North Carolina is living that out, and it's a model for the nation. This is where America's heart still beats strong. Pastor Corey Brooks, known as the "Rooftop Pastor," is the founder and Senior Pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago and the CEO of Project H.O.O.D. (Helping Others Obtain Destiny), the church's local mission. He gained national attention for his 94-day and 343-day rooftop vigils to transform the notorious "O-Block," once known as Chicago's most dangerous block, into #OpportunityBlock.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After months of speculation about his future on the radio, Howard Stern has signed a new contract with SiriusXM. “I'm happy to announce that I figured out a way to have it all, more free time, and continuing to be on the radio,” Stern said. “So, yes, we are coming back for three years.” Stern, 71, had been the subject of rumor-mongering because his current five-year deal is due to expire in a couple of weeks. In August, the US Sun claimed that “The Howard Stern Show” was “set to be canceled after a stunning 20-year run.” The story also suggested that Stern's exit might be related to his outspoken criticism of President Trump. The Sun story drew a lot of attention despite its thin sourcing. A SiriusXM executive then said of Stern and his crew, “We'd love them to stay,” but “it certainly has to make sense” financially. When Stern returned to his mic after Labor Day, he punked his listeners by having Andy Cohen pretend to take over the show. Several news outlets fell for the prank, much to Stern's delight. When he returned to the air, Stern said his deal talks have been “fantastic,” but didn't address his future beyond that. The contract talks continued out of public view. Stern said Tuesday that he feels “very loyal” to SiriusXM, which has paid him hundreds of millions of dollars for exclusive rights to his content over the years.

NFL legend Brett Favre lamented in a recent podcast episode the culture of instant satisfaction that has been created in society as a result of the social media age. Favre and his co-host David Kano talked on "4th and Favre" about the lack of loyalty in college sports with the advent of name, image and likeness deals and the transfer portal, coupled with coaches leaving schools without consequences. Kano compared what he believed was going on in college sports with the state of society. "I think that's more matter of opinion – what you're exposed to. There's some people who don't watch YouTube. There's some people who don't have TikTok. I am one of those," Favre said in response. But I think, presently, in this world, or this country, it's about how many clicks you can get immediately. Like, what can I do to get the most followers? It's sort of like what we just talked about. Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre calls signals against the Oakland Raiders at Lambeau Field on Dec. 9, 2007. It's more about how popular I can get instantaneously rather than really good content. He added that college athletics is about "how well you can do now as a player or as a coach and move on to bigger and better things."

Fox News political analyst Lisa Boothe discusses Democrats' outrage over President Donald Trump's ballroom construction during the ongoing shutdown. The Trump administration argued in a court filing on Monday that pausing construction on the new White House ballroom would undermine national security, citing a Secret Service declaration warning that halting work would leave the site unable to meet "safety and security requirements" needed to protect the president. The declaration says the White House's East Wing, demolished in October and now undergoing below-grade work, cannot be left unfinished without compromising essential security measures. "Accordingly, any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled in this regard and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission," reads the filing in part. The government's memorandum was in response to a lawsuit filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit that says it advocates for preserving historic sites of national importance and protecting the public's role in that process.

(Eric Lee/Getty Images) It argues that pausing the Trump administration's ballroom project is essential to prevent irreversible changes while the required oversight and public involvement procedures are carried out. The White House announced President Donald Trump's plans in July to move forward with a 90,000-square-foot state ballroom that would cost an estimated $200 million. That figure has now risen to at least $300 million, and while the project is backed by some private donors, Trump has also insisted it will be funded "100% by me and some friends of mine." In its filing, the administration emphasized that key regulatory reviews are forthcoming, saying it plans to submit draft architectural drawings and materials to the National Capital Planning Commission and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in the coming weeks. The government argued the lawsuit is premature because above-grade construction is not scheduled to begin until April 2026. Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff gather for a family photo at the Chancellery in Berlin, Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a deal to end the fighting in Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion of his country could be finalized within days, after which American envoys will present them to the Kremlin before possible further meetings in the U.S. next weekend. A draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin on Monday is “not perfect” but is “very workable,” Zelenskyy told reporters hours after the discussions. He cautioned, however, that some key issues — notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by Russian forces — remain unresolved. But as the spotlight shifts to Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy said that after the Berlin talks, “we are very close to (a deal on) strong security guarantees.” The security proposal will be based on Western help in keeping the Ukrainian army strong, an official from a NATO nation said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. “We want peace — we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,” he told reporters. “We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.” American officials said Monday there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, notably the land issue. Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either but Trump has previously indicated that Ukraine will have to cede territory. “They are proposing a ‘free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a ‘free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.” Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense, such as enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons. Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said. “Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,” Zelenskyy said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Police are pursuing a new lead based on photos and videos of an individual taken around 2 p.m. Saturday, hours before the deadly mass shooting at Brown University, authorities said today. • Earlier, a person of interest detained in connection with the attack was released, and has been cleared in the investigation, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. • The shooting left two students dead and nine others injured at the Ivy League school, where classes and exams have been canceled. But when Umurzokov didn't respond during the lockdown, Manns began to worry. I texted him and he didn't text back,” Manns told CNN affiliate WBZ. I am grieving,” he said, adding that Umurzokov was a “ball of joy” and that his absence is felt throughout the Brown community. “His soul truly did reverberate throughout the community,” he said. Dan McKee has ordered a sweeping review of school safety measures after the Brown University shooting left the campus on edge. “As a parent who has sent my children off to college – I can only imagine how families are feeling right now. He directed the state's top education officials to “work with both K-12 and higher education to conduct a full review of their school safety and security plans.” He also called for an increased police presence at schools to steady anxious students, families and educators. “I know that many people are feeling anxious right now,” McKee added. “Given the emotional toll that a tragedy like this can take, it is essential that mental health resources are visible, accessible and responsive.” The images show an individual dressed in dark clothing and masked. The person's distinctive gait and consistent rhythm could be recognizable to someone close to them, a CNN senior law enforcement analyst said. “We ask that anyone who was in Barus & Holley building on Friday or Saturday, Dec. 12-13, immediately contact the Providence police to arrange for an interview,” the university said in an update Monday evening. “Even what seems like an incidental detail may ultimately be helpful in law enforcement's efforts to protect our community.” The university also emphasized that campus safety remains its foremost priority. Brown has also experienced an uptick of “swatting” calls, it said. The university said it has put in place additional safety measures, including an enhanced security presence on campus and restricted building access. Brown University student Annie Johnson's sense of security was “completely destroyed” after news that an initial person of interest was released from custody, she told CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday. “It felt like just the smallest amount of comfort to know, well, like, at least they found the guy and they have him and they know who it was, but now it's like that one sense of sort of security was just completely destroyed,” she said. Johnson said being in the airport to fly home “was a really weird experience” as she was surrounded by people who may have read about the university shooting on their phones and likely “didn't understand what it was like to live through it.” New videos of an individual police are calling a person of interest provide a fresh look at the person's size, how they walk and other details that may help the public to identify them, CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe said. “He kind of walks the same way when he's on the sidewalk or crossing the street, and he appears to favor his left leg just slightly, not so much that it would be indicative of any sort of permanent disability, but maybe the remnant of an old surgery or a knee injury or something like that,” McCabe said. “It's those kind of details that I think could maybe trip somebody's recollection that this is someone they know in their lives,” McCabe said. The agency sent additional resources to the area today “to help track down leads, canvass neighborhoods, and develop intelligence,” and the Evidence Response Team is still helping to process evidence, he said. “Anything Rhode Island authorities need from this FBI, we will be there,” Patel said. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha told CNN's Erin Burnett that he was “confident” law enforcement would be able to find the person of interest in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University. “Hopefully very quickly, we can get this person identified, detained, questioned if possible, but certainly he is our primary person of interest right now,” the attorney general said. Responding to comments President Donald Trump made about Brown University being to blame for the failure to quickly identify a suspect, Neronha said the shooting was instead a symptom of a greater problem. “What we're focused on here is solving this crime. The shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University, Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr. CNN's Danya Gainor, Zoe Sottile and Michelle Watson contributed to the report. Surveillance video shown during the Monday press conference showed an individual wearing what appears to be a mask crossing a street. Additionally, officials displayed photos of the individual, who appeared to be wearing dark clothing. The FBI released a description of a person they described as the suspect in Saturday's deadly shooting at Brown University, along with photos. “Unless there is official notification or official guidance, we shouldn't be guessing or making assumptions about what the motive might have been or who the shooter might be,” Magaziner, a Democrat, told CNN's Jake Tapper. The photos were released Monday, two days after a gunman opened fire in the Ivy League school's engineering building, killing two students and injuring nine others. “It takes time,” Providence police chief  Oscar L. Perez Jr.  said. Asked a pointed question about surveillance footage at Brown University, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley emphasized the hard work all agencies were putting into tracking down the suspect and their commitment to transparency. “We continue to answer your questions,” he said during a tense moment. Mayor Brett Smiley said Providence officials will not provide another news briefing Monday unless there is a “significant update” to the situation. Chief of Police Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said Monday the shooter in Saturday's attack “definitely” targeted Brown University. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he and other officials have “all been working for 49 hours, we're tired – we're serious about the task at hand.” “I know that people are weary, and so I'm asking please for a little bit of patience and grace,” the mayor said. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said authorities are working to reconstruct the person's movements both before and after Saturday's shooting. “What's critical here is that we reconstruct … this man's movements, both before and afterwards,” Neronha said Monday. Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. said reports that a second person of interest was taken into custody in connection to the shooting at Brown University were false. One person was taken into custody Sunday before later being released and cleared. Providence Police Chief Oscar L. Perez, Jr. told reporters on Monday that investigations can take different paths. “All detectives throughout this nation and in the world understand that when you investigate in a case, it takes different paths,” Perez said.</p>

One by one, they are singing, the men who used to do dirty deeds for the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez and his successor, Nicolas Maduro. But these Venezuelans sniff change in the air. Two of the men are in prison here in the U.S.: Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, the former spy mastermind, and Cliver Alcala Cordones, a former general, both of whom have written letters to President Donald Trump airing bales of dirty laundry regarding narco-trafficking to the U.S. A third is a top official who has defected and is cooperating with the U.S. government, to whom I spoke a couple of months ago. Over in Bolivia, where change has already begun, information regarding that government's involvement with narco-terrorism may soon see the light of day as well. The new president, Rodrigo Paz Pereira, elected earlier this year and sworn into office last month, had his predecessor, Luis Arce, arrested on Wednesday. Many members of Arce's government may follow him into the clink, and they may soon start “cooperating” by airing dirty laundry as well. Even Spain, currently run by the Left, may soon start producing information. Last week, the Economic and Fiscal Crime Unit searched the offices of an airline run by people with close ties to Venezuela and Cuba, Plus Ultra. The firm is also close to former Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, an anti-American socialist who advocates on behalf of Venezuela and China in Madrid. The Venezuelan regime itself forms the Cartel de los Soles, a narco-trafficking, terrorist group that helped flood our streets with drugs. Maduro and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, in fact, lead it, something we already knew, but which Carbajal confirmed in his letter to Trump. Grouped in a regional Marxist bloc called the Foro de Sao Paulo, founded by Cuba's dead dictator Fidel Castro and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, these Marxist parties swept to power in a second wave — the first was in the early 2000s — four or five years ago in Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Brazil, etc. Voters in Ibero-America are now bringing this era to a screeching halt, which means that many more narco-terrorist secrets will surely come out. In Chile on Sunday, Jose Antonio Kast romped to victory, defeating the communist candidate Jeannette Jara by 20 points. Castro and her Marxist husband, Manuel Zelaya, will try everything not to hand power to a Trumpian, but they will only be inviting trouble if they do. All these Marxist presidents who were unable to help their chosen candidates get elected, or may be about to meet the same fate, as Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, is certain to face in elections in May, came to office in our hemisphere under unusual circumstances. This new pink tidal wave was unleashed by the seismic force of Venezuelan-organized riots in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and other South American countries between 2019 and 2022. Most of these new governments then aided Venezuela's narco-terrorist activity. America, too, was rocked in 2020 by nationwide riots organized by Black Lives Matter, whose leaders were close to Chavez and Maduro. According to the defector who spoke with me, at least one of them received financial assistance from Chavez. If you pull the information together, a picture emerges of a Cuban-led plan to create disarray inside the U.S., both by flooding U.S. streets with drugs that would undermine the fiber of this country or with street mayhem. Venezuelan gangs and Colombian guerrillas carried out the plan. For many years, I was a high-ranking member of the Venezuelan regime. … Today, I sit in an American prison because I voluntarily plead guilty to the crimes charged against me: a narco-terrorism conspiracy. Carvajal clearly does not want to spend the rest of his days in an American prison and is seeking a better deal by revealing what he did. Carvajal explained that he “personally witnessed how Hugo Chavez's government became a criminal organization that is now run by Maduro, Cabello, and other senior regime officials.” The purpose of this criminal organization, “now known as the Cartel of the Suns, is to weaponize drugs against the United States,” he wrote. The Venezuelan regime, Carvajal wrote, “has provided weapons, passports, and impunity for these terrorist organizations to operate freely from Venezuela against the United States.” Then Carvajal let dangle that he could furnish more information: “U.S. The letter by Alcala Cordones, dated Dec. 8 and revealed by Venezuelan investigative journalist Maibort Petit, confirms most of the information contained in Carvajal's own missive. Whether this emerging picture provides a casus belli for Washington to act against Maduro by hitting targets inside Venezuela is unclear. In October 2019, Cabello already put the world on notice that Venezuela's regime would destabilize our hemisphere. “We are headed towards a Bolivarian hurricane,” Cabello warned. While all the media attention here has been devoted to whether War Secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to shoot at one of these boats a second time, the so-called double tap, while some survivors were still swimming in the Caribbean, less attention has been paid to the singing Venezuelans. That may soon be seen to have been a case of journalistic malpractice.</p>

This month, a video of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. popped up on my feed. Wearing a blue dress shirt and tie, the bronzed, tin-voiced secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services began doing pull-ups. While videos of septuagenarians doing body-weight might be rare if not odd, performing exercises on film has sort of become Kennedy's modus operandi. Watching this man, who was born in 1954, push and pull his body in aggressive ways is supposed to underscore his job as the man in charge of the country's health. But what made this particular video strange was that he was doing these pull-ups at Reagan airport in Washington, DC. Even farther back are restroom and defibrillator signs. His video is papered with the sounds and sights of hapless travelers rolling their carry-ons through the terminal. The stunt was part of a press conference in which Kennedy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that they would invest $1 billion in making airports a wellness space. That would include, the administration says, installing gym equipment, more children's play areas, and healthier food options. More broadly, the investment follows proclamations from Duffy that he wants to bring more “civility” to the flying experience, and as a first step in that mission, he encouraged travelers to dress better. This didn't go over too well, and it's not difficult to understand why: Airports are a bad place and exercises or dressing better will not fix their badness. In fact, people spend money to make the entire process less miserable. They'll shell out money for TSA PreCheck, a feature that shortens the security lines and let you keep shoes on (before TSA got rid of that policy this year). They'll spend money for access to already-crowded lounges, just so they don't have to kill time at the even-more depressing gates. The only time a gym may come handy is in the event of a major delay or if the gym inadvertently becomes a more humane place to wait for your flight than the airport bar (lying down on a yoga mat in peace and quiet might be nice!). Healthier options at a liminal space like an airport are nice in theory, but one of the few joys is that food rules don't apply. You can have alcohol in the morning, eat at a place that advertises itself as an abbreviated version of Chili's, and even test your luck with sushi. Adding gyms and healthy food to make air travel better isn't directly making air travel better. Getting upset over a gym you're never going to use, or a bad salad you're never going to eat, or watching an old tan man struggle to do some jungle gym exercises, draws attention away from the things Duffy and his cohort won't fix. In the event of flight delays, Duffy and Trump's administration dissolved a Biden-era initiative for airlines to compensate passengers for lengthy delays. Additionally, airfare is more expensive compared to a year ago and those figures don't include all the upcharges (e.g., sitting toward the front of the main cabin, checked baggage, etc.) that customers choose to make flights more bearable. Go to the airport right now, ask anyone waiting for their flight to board, and they will tell you ways it could improve. Bigger seats, better deals, less delays, more compensation for delays, not being treated like cattle — these are the things people want. AI has changed the hiring process, and one way to stand out is to be as human as possible. A strange porn subculture reveals what life online is doing to us.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Democrats and Republicans are hurtling toward the New Year's expiration of Obamacare subsidies but both have decided doing nothing is better than reaching a deal. Neither supports the other's demands, bringing Congress to an impasse. Democratic leaders have issued a scathing rebuke of the Lower Health Care Premiums for All Americans Act, calling it “unserious,” which signals they will not encourage their caucus to vote for the bill. Meanwhile, Republican leaders have stated they do not support Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries's (D-NY) three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies, instead arguing that their bill will provide “clear, responsible alternatives” to lower healthcare costs. Bipartisanship appeared to be on the horizon last week, after centrist Republicans and leadership worked out a deal to amend the legislation and extend the Obamacare subsidies for two years with some reforms. GOP leadership aides told reporters Friday that they expected a vote on an amendment to extend the Obamacare subsidies to come this week. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told reporters Monday that a final decision had not yet been made on whether an amendment would be allowed on renewing the subsidies.If leadership and rank-and-file members cannot come to an agreement, the centrist lawmakers will have to find their own way to get a vote to extend the tax credits. Given that the Rules Committee is largely a cudgel of leadership and has conservatives such as Reps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC), it is unlikely their proposal will pass. Given that 12 Republicans have signed Fitzpatrick's discharge petition, and 11 Republicans have joined the petition led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ), there are a few options for the GOP. One option for Democrats is to band together and join either of the discharge petitions. Gottheimer's extends the Obamacare subsidies for one year and sets up for a vote on a longer extension or reform process in the second year. But leaders have dragged their feet on wholeheartedly endorsing either petition, including the one led by their own Democratic caucus member. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement Saturday that anything less than a clean three-year extension of the subsidies is a “waste of time.” On Monday, Jeffries said he reviewed the discharge petitions. “We have a position: a straight three-year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the minority leader said. Rep. Greg Landsman (D-OH) predicted that “anything” that extends the Affordable Care Act subsidies will “ultimately get enough support,” if it's able to make it on the schedule or through the Rules Committee for a vote. “So I'm supporting any and every attempt to do that, because they come first.” Another option for centrist Republicans is to join Jeffries's three-year extension of the Obamacare subsidies. All Democrats have signed Jeffries's discharge petition, so only four Republicans are needed to reach the 218 threshold. Four of you, who seem to now be very concerned about what is happening in their communities as they see their political numbers failing.' …The [American people] deserve so much better than what they are getting from this Republican Party,” House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-MA) said. However, centrist Republicans, although they favor a smaller extension of the tax credits, are not budging on signing the three-year extension at this time and say it is up to Democratic leadership to make a move. Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE), who has signed both Fitzpatrick and Gottheimer's petitions, said he is not supportive of a blanket, three-year extension. “I don't like it,” Bacon said, arguing some of the provisions of the subsidies are “very wasteful.” “Why should somebody earning $600,000 get these tax credits, and why do we want a third of all the tax credit money, not go to individuals' premiums? … I think Hakeem Jeffries and his team should get on one of the two discharges we have, because we deal with both those issues,” Bacon added. “We have two discharges that already have more than enough Republican signatures on them, and that's really up to the Democratic leadership, whether or not they truly want an extension or they want the issue,” Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) told reporters Monday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) said Monday that there is not enough support to have a “straight-up extension” of the tax credits without some significant reforms, essentially putting Capitol Hill at a standstill. Still, they described their conversations as a step in the right direction, following the Senate's failure last week to pass a Democratic-backed extension.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Retiring Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Monday her engagement to Brian Glenn, a pro-Trump pundit who works for the far-right news network Real America's Voice. !” Greene posted on X. Glenn, who is chief White House correspondent for the MAGA-aligned network, also shared the engagement on social media with a photo of him embracing Greene while she shows off her engagement ring. The announcement comes weeks after Greene had a public falling out with President Donald Trump an dsaid she would resign from office in January, noting that she wanted to avoid a nasty primary. Trump has called her a “traitor” and said he'd support a GOP challenge to her House seat. Greene, who had been an ardent Trump supporter since arriving on Capitol Hill in 2021, now insists the president has been too focused on foreign policy in his second term and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home. She, along with fellow Republican Rep. Thomas Massie has been one of the most vocal critics of the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case files. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene will leave Congress after five turbulent years Glenn notably called out Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for not wearing a suit to the White House, at a contentious Oval Office event in February. Greene and Glenn met in 2022 and began publicly dating early the next year, after both had begun divorce proceedings for their first marriages, according to the Washington Post. The next steps in Greene's career remain unclear. CNN has previously reported that the Georgia congresswoman, who earlier this year had been discussed as a potential candidate for her state's high-stakes Senate race, currently has no known plans to run for office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Secret Service official involved in the construction of President Donald Trump's massive new White House ballroom said Monday that any temporary pause on the project could hamper the agency's ability to carry out its protective mission. The warning – made in a sworn statement by USSS Deputy Director Matthew Quinn – comes a day before a federal judge in Washington, DC, is set hold an emergency hearing to consider whether to order the White House to pause work on the ballroom pending a lawsuit challenging how the project has unfolded thus far. Quinn, who oversees USSS' role in the ballroom project, said a contractor involved in the construction is still working to provide temporary security and safety measures around the site and that “any pause in construction, even temporarily, would leave the contractor's obligation unfulfilled … and consequently hamper the Secret Service's ability to meet its statutory obligations and protective mission.” The lawsuit filed last week by the nation's top historic preservation group claims Trump is pursuing the project unlawfully because he hasn't gotten approval from Congress or submitted his plans to the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts for review, which would give the public a chance to weigh in. The National Trust for Historic Preservation is asking Judge Richard Leon, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, to issue a temporary restraining order that would pause any further work on the ballroom until Congress authorizes it, the commissions review it and environmental assessments are completed. That official, John Stanwich, noted that the Commission on Fine Arts does not currently have a quorum but that “plans are underway to appoint new members” to it. The White House fired all six members of the commission in October, CNN previously reported, amid Trump's push to impose his style on the nation's capital through a slate of construction projects, including the ballroom. Stanwich said that in August and September his staff worked with the White House to “identify and remove museum objects, including paintings and historic furniture, from the East Wing, East Colonnade, and the Ground Floor State Rooms of the White House to be stored or curated” off-site. Crews also worked to salvage “historic materials” from the East Wing before it was torn down, Stanwich said, which included “stone columns, doors, and other items that are planned to be reincorporated into the new facility.” Extensive documentation of the East Wing was undertaken pre-demolition, he told the court, through photography and the creation of a 3D scan of the building to create “a digital twin … for future preservation and interpretive purposes.” The massive project, Stanwich said, has caused a ripple effect across the White House's professional and historic spaces. Public-facing parts of the building that used to be stops on White House tours, including the famous China Room, are now being used as office spaces.</p>
