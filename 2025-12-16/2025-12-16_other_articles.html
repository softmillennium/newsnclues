                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disclosure Day is coming, and it ain't like E.T. At long last, we know what Steven Spielberg's next movie is. Now, we finally have a trailer for the film, titled Disclosure Day, which is attached to screenings of Avatar: Fire and Ash. The Disclosure Day teaser trailer sets the stage for what looks to be an alien invasion, though whether it's a peaceful one or not remains to be seen. This first look at the film looks less at the invaders themselves, who may be acting through Earth's fauna, but a world of seven billion people learning what's happening to their planet. The inciting incident, of all things, seems to be a newscast. A character played by Emily Blunt is about to give the weather report when she starts emitting a strange and intense set of gurgles and clicks. From there, the world slowly finds out what's happening as characters played by Josh O'Connor (Challengers), Colin Firth (the Kingsman movies), Colman Domingo (Sing Sing), and Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters, daughter of Bono) come to grips with extraterrestrial intelligence. A proper synopsis for the film hasn't been released. It appears to be yet another take on Spielberg's fascination with how alien life would interact with the people of Earth, which he's previously explored in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. Koepp's non-Spielberg writing work includes Sam Raimi's Spider-Man (writer), Stir of Echoes (writer/director), Mission: Impossible (co-writer), and 2025's critically acclaimed Black Bag (writer) from director Steven Soderbergh. Legendary composer John Williams is once again teaming up with Spielberg to score Disclosure Day. Disclosure Day will arrive in movie theaters on June 12, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural, the long-running CW horror series about brothers Sam and Dean Winchester hunting monsters and solving mysteries, is officially leaving Netflix on December 18. Supernatural first aired in 2005, and at the time, few could have guessed that it would go on to be one of the longest-running live-action shows in history. Supernatural has been a part of the Netflix package for a staggering 13 years, and so many subscribers are used to having it and all 327 of its episodes at their fingertips. Unfortunately, Supernatural's time on Netflix is coming to an end. Fans of Supernatural can also enjoy shows like Grimm and The X-Files, which feature similar adventures with paranormal creatures in the modern world. Supernatural is leaving Netflix due to an expiring deal with the streamer, and it's definitely going to mark a sad end of an era for fans of the show and Netflix subscribers in general. But while it's sad to see Supernatural leave Netflix after spending such a long time on the platform, the good news is that the show is still going to be readily available to stream on other platforms. Supernatural is coming to Peacock and Amazon Prime Video on December 22. So there will be a few days when Supernatural isn't available to stream on any of the major platforms (without buying the episodes on Prime), but at least it won't take long for it to end up somewhere else. When Supernatural joins Peacock and Prime Video, it will do so with all 15 seasons intact and all the classic episodes that they entail. There are definitely long stretches of Supernatural where it dips in quality, but the overall package is a fun time and definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it before. Considering Supernatural's longevity, some may be wondering if we will ever see the franchise expanded in a serious way, whether through a revival or new spin-off series. There were multiple attempts at a Supernatural spin-off while the show was still on the air, with multiple backdoor pilots filmed, but nothing took off. , but there's always the chance that the show could make a comeback somehow, especially with how many people still love it to this day. With Supernatural creator Eric Kripke's time on The Boys coming to an end, perhaps the time for a Supernatural reunion will come sooner rather than later. Relive the epic battles between good and evil in Supernatural with this stellar deal. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Pictures has released the first trailer for Steven Spielberg‘s next film, “Disclosure Day.” The movie stars Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, Wyatt Russell and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Rian Johnson Says He Has 'Conceptual Ideas' For Fourth 'Knives Out' Movie: 'It'd Be Interesting If it Were This Kind of Thing' The 24-Movie 'James Bond' Blu-ray Collection Is Only $55 for Black Friday This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. “Disclosure Day” is the 37th film that Spielberg has directed since his (partially lost) debut in 1964 — coincidentally, that initial feature, “Firelight,” was also a science fiction film. The cumulative box office gross of Spielberg's directing filmography is over $10 billion worldwide. His most recent film, 2023's semi-autobiographical “The Fabelmans” grossed $45 million and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Universal will release “Disclosure Day” in theaters on June 12. It is produced by Spielberg alongside Kristie Macosko Krieger at Amblin Entertainment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a major year for blockbusters, from Christopher Nolan to Denis Villeneuve, there's none we are anticipating more than Steven Spielberg returning to the realm of extraterrestrial sci-fi. After Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and War of the Worlds, the legendary director is back to exploring alien life with Disclosure Day, which opens in theaters on June 12. Ahead of that summer release, the first trailer has now arrived. With a cast featuring Emily Blunt, Josh O'Connor, Colin Firth, Eve Hewson, Colman Domingo, and Wyatt Russell, much of Disclosure has been kept under tight wraps. Last week, mysterious billboards started popping up around the country for the film written by David Koepp and featuring a score by John Williams. Now this trailer finally grants our first peek. This summer, the truth belongs to seven billion people. We are coming close to … Disclosure Day.” Jordan Raup is the founder and editor-in-chief of The Film Stage and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LAWRENCE — When Superman became popular in the 1940s, he originally fought more conventional villains of the era such as gangsters, pirates and Nazis. But one of his foes led to a legendary encounter that may provide strategies for dealing with troubling concerns affecting the society of today. His chapter titled “A Symbol for Hope: Superman's Battle with the KKK as a Model for Effective Cultural Engagement with Conspiracy Theories” appears in “The Lizard People Don't Want You to Read This: Essays on Conspiracy Theory in Popular Culture.” The new book is published by McFarland & Company. My chapter is trying to convince the writers of modern mass media to consider doing the same thing and use their stories to tell what conspiracy theories actually do in the real world,” McRoberts said. “Here, I'm not talking about the rare ones that turn out to be true, but the ones that are much more dangerous, like anti-vaccine, antisemitic, January 6 types of things. The chapter noted, “If these episodes lacked genuine secret passwords, they revealed something just as real and even more devastating: The Klan wasn't just hateful and un-American, it was a scam. Despite its pomp and circumstance, it wasn't an ancient and impressive organization — it was just a club that milked its thuggish members to make money.” The professor emphasized conspiracy theories may often seem silly, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less threatening. “What's usually at the heart of a conspiracy theory is a powerful group we can't see and access that is out to get us,” McRoberts said. Muddying the concept even further, he said, is that people are often confused by how to apply the term conspiracy theory. “I don't think of things like the Tuskegee Airmen as a conspiracy theory; I think of it as a conspiracy fact. The “Lizard People” book of which his chapter is a part of delivers a collection of essays examining topics ranging from clandestine societies to dog whistles to pop culture media such as “The X-Files” and “The Da Vinci Code.” McRoberts said, “It's a fantastic analysis of how conspiracy theories ripple through mass media and what mass media can do about it. I appreciate how they picked a bunch of different experts in different fields to reflect their facet problem, which is really difficult for the world to get its head around.” As for his focus on Superman, McRoberts said he was more of an X-Men fan growing up. McRoberts said he hopes the tactic used by Superman's bygone show might work against other groups whose lives revolve around harmful conspiracy theories. I love the fact that you've got comic book fans and Jane Austen fans and documentary fans, and everybody's got a healthy media market for whatever floats their boat,” he said. “But such fragmentation is not great for the power of fiction to actually change public opinion. I don't know if mass media now has one singular show that makes the same impact.” The University of Kansas prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, status as a veteran, sexual orientation, marital status, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, and genetic information in the university's programs and activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The plant world is full of wonders that often seem too strange to be real. Some species have evolved unique shapes, colours, and behaviours that challenge our expectations of what a plant should look like. From ghost-white blooms to giant flowers with eerie scents, these plants blur the lines between fantasy and reality, showcasing nature's most astonishing creativity. The corpse flower (Titan arum) boasts the world's largest unbranched inflorescence, towering over 10 feet with a reddish-brown spadix emitting a rotting flesh odour to lure flies. It grows from a massive underground corm, with huge leaves dominating its cycle, blooming rarely after years of storage; not parasitic. Also known as Indian pipe, this "ghost plant" does not have chlorophyll in it, so it doesn't undergo photosynthesis, unlike other green plants. But instead, it gets nutrients from a symbiotic relationship with fungi. This plant takes its name from a pair of bright white berries contrasted with dark purple spots to create a resemblance of hanging eyeballs. Native to Southeast Asia, this unusual flower has bracts and whiskers evoking bat wings poised on its stem. This ornamental grass looks like streaks of crimson fire rising from the earth, with vibrant red-tipped blades that evoke an almost mystical aura. Though more common in gardens, its bold colour gives it a surreal, otherworldly look that seems pulled from a dreamscape.The garden cultivar 'Rubra' is sterile and non-invasive. As indicated by its name, because of flowers with a heart-shaped appearance which seem to have drops of ‘bleeding' petal flesh, the bleeding heart plant provides a dramatic and enchanting visual effect. Nature always has a way of growing things that appear more fantasy than reality.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erika Kirk and Candace Owens met on Monday, days after Charlie Kirk's widow joined a CBS town hall and said she wanted Owens to stop peddling conspiracy theories about her late husband's assassination. Both Kirk and Owens confirmed Monday evening that they had spoken, referring to the conversation as "productive" in separate posts on X. They did not share details from the meeting, but Owens said it lasted four and a half hours, and they "agreed much more than I had anticipated." Kirk previously said on X Sunday that she and Owens would have a "private, in-person meeting" Monday. Owens wrote on X that she's "very much looking forward to this discussion." Erika Kirk sat down with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss last week for a town hall that aired Saturday on CBS. Weiss asked Erika Kirk what she would want to say to Owens, who has been amplifying conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk's assassination. Owens, a onetime friend of Charlie Kirk's and a former employee of his conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA, previously compared their relationship to that of a "brother and sister." The day after his assassination, she posted a lengthy video, saying she wanted him to be remembered for his career and ideas. In the months since, Owens has pushed conspiracy theories about his murder and made unfounded fraud allegations about the finances at Turning Point, which Erika Kirk now runs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Misha Collins originally auditioned to play a demon on "Supernatural," so he can be forgiven for needing some time to get acquainted with Castiel, the angelic character he ended up playing in Eric Kripke's horror drama. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Collins and his co-stars, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki, looked back at his "Supernatural" debut, with Collins sharing an interesting detail about having to reshoot his first scene. The character's grand entrance sees him storm into a building where Dean and Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver) are holding up, absorbing a hail of bullets as he walks toward them, looking completely unfazed. It's a great scene, but the creators weren't happy with Collins' early takes. "My debut performance on 'Supernatural' was so substandard that we did a reshoot the next day, because they got the dailies back of my creepy performance and they were like..." Despite being heavily involved in the scene, Ackles didn't recall being summoned back for reshoots, suggesting that Collins was the only actor who didn't live up to expectations at the time. However, reshoots pale in comparison to Collins' worst experiences on "Supernatural," as playing Castiel caused permanent damage to his health. Misha Collins' first outing as Castiel didn't please the creators of "Supernatural," but he got better, and he took the role very seriously from that moment on. I was literally causing damage to my vocal cords. Collins noted that he never expected to become a "Supernatural" mainstay following his debut, so he might have taken precautions to protect his vocal cords if he knew how long his tenure would last.</p>
