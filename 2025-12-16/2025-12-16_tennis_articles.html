                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two young stars produced a blistering spectacle in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, one that felt like the birth of a long-term rivalry. In the fan vote, the Alcaraz-Fils thriller fended off strong competition, including Jannik Sinner's marquee championship-match triumph in Vienna over Alexander Zverev and a gruelling, three-hour Athens final between Novak Djokovic and Lorenzo Musetti. It was, however, Alcaraz's mix of quality, courage and chaos in Monte-Carlo that made his triumph the match that supporters deemed the year's unforgettable standout. Saving three break points at 5-5, 0/40 in the second set and later overturning a 1-3 deficit in the third, Alcaraz repeatedly absorbed Fils' pace and power before counterpunching with trademark flair. The Spaniard's nerve under pressure not only cracked Fils' resistance but also marked one of three victories from a set down on his way to a maiden triumph in the Principality. “Today I could feel it but in some moments he just made a few mistakes. I tried to make the most of those points and wait for my chances.” It marked one of eight tour-level trophies across the season for Alcaraz, who also clinched Roland Garros and US Open crowns en route to reclaiming ATP Year-End No. That match topped the list of Best Grand Slam matches from 2025.

The Opening Ceremony will take place on Saturday, January 17 at Rod Laver Arena. “It feels like a lifetime ago that I coined the phrase the ‘Happy Slam' for the Australian Open, and it still makes me smile when I think about all the moments I've had here,” said Federer, a six-time Australian Open champion, in a press release. I can't wait to come down under again to the AO and create more fantastic moments with all the Aussie fans.” Tournament director Craig Tiley added: "I'm thrilled we're introducing this very special AO Opening Ceremony. “This inaugural Opening Ceremony will mark the start of a new tennis season in spectacular fashion. I can't wait to see Roger back on Rod Laver Arena, along with other greats of the game, Andre, Pat and Lleyton. And I know fans across Australia will be just as excited to share this moment with him."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rolex's relationship with tennis dates back to 1978, and the brand has since gone on to support many of the most prestigious events on the ATP Tour. Rolex will maintain year-round brand visibility across the ATP's social and digital platforms, with content providing match start times and game durations, reaching a global fanbase of over one billion. Daniele Sano, ATP Chief Business Officer, said: “It's difficult to understate the commitment Rolex has shown towards our sport and the ATP Tour. For almost 50 years, it has championed the qualities that define tennis – elegance, prestige, and precision. As a valued partner of the ATP since 2005, we're proud to reinforce such an iconic legacy.” Arnaud Boetsch, Rolex Director of Communication and Image, said: “Rolex is proud to reaffirm its long-standing commitment to tennis. Rolex is also an Official Partner of all ATP Masters 1000 events, as well as the Australian Open, Roland-Garros, The Championships, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Beyond tennis, the brand holds a significant presence across global sport, including golf, motorsport, yachting and equestrianism. Rolex counts several leading ATP athletes among its family of Testimonees, including current World No. No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>
