                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Think of me as your AI global economics lens—zooming in on the hidden forces quietly rewriting the world's financial rules. The merger between Signing Day Sports, Inc. (NYSE American: SGN) and One Blockchain LLC, forming BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc., marks a bold strategic pivot from niche sports recruitment to the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency mining and high-performance computing (HPC). This transformative deal, anchored by a 21% profit margin in One Blockchain's existing operations and a critical SEC regulatory milestone, offers investors an asymmetric opportunity to bet on the growth of digital infrastructure—if the risks can be navigated. The Strategic Pivot: From Niche to New EconomySigning Day Sports, valued at approximately $260 million post-merger, is abandoning its core business—a platform for college sports recruitment—to instead control One Blockchain's 40 MW Bitcoin mining facility in South Carolina. This profitability underscores operational efficiency in a sector where volatility is the norm. The merger aims to position the combined entity as a vertically integrated player in crypto mining and HPC hosting, leveraging One Blockchain's expertise and scalable infrastructure. This document, which includes a proxy statement and prospectus, must be approved alongside shareholder and NYSE American listing approvals. The S-4's clearance would de-risk the deal by addressing regulatory uncertainties, such as compliance with securities laws and disclosure requirements. Investors should note that forward-looking statements in the filing emphasize risks like regulatory delays and market fluctuations, but the process itself signals progress toward the merger's completion—a stark contrast to earlier-stage SPAC transactions that often fail to clear such hurdles. Market Validation: A 150% Stock Surge, But Caution RemainsThe stock's 150% surge post-announcement (see ) reflects investor optimism about the strategic shift. Yet this rally is fragile: SGN's value hinges on execution. Scalability and Infrastructure Synergy: The 50MW Expansion and Texas FacilityThe deal's long-term viability rests on One Blockchain's growth plans. This modular design allows flexibility to pivot between revenue streams as market dynamics evolve. Combined with an earnout provision tied to achieving $25 million EBITDA by 2026, these expansions create a clear path to scale profitability if executed successfully. Risk Factors: A Tightrope WalkThree risks loom large. Second, regulatory scrutiny of crypto mining's energy consumption and environmental impact could delay approvals or impose costly compliance burdens. Third, Bitcoin's price volatility—down 50% in 2024—remains a wildcard, though the Texas facility's diversification into HPC hosting mitigates this exposure. Investment Thesis: A High-Beta Play with Asymmetric UpsideFor investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure growth, SGN offers a leveraged entry point. However, this is a high-risk, high-reward trade suited only to those comfortable with volatility and regulatory uncertainty. In conclusion, BlockchAIn's merger with Signing Day Sports represents a speculative yet intellectually coherent bet on the future of energy-efficient digital infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's how long it took for Pump.fun's token offering to raise roughly $500 million from retail investors across various exchanges, including Bybit, Kraken, and KuCoin. The sale priced 125 billion tokens at $0.004 apiece, implying a $4 billion fully diluted valuation for the Solana-based memecoin launcher's new utility token. For now, holders must wait to get their hands on the token they bought. Pump.fun said the purchased tokens will land in wallets over the next 48–72 hours and will stay locked until distribution ends, blocking trades or transfers. Read more: PUMP Lingers at 40% Premium Over ICO Price on Hyperliquid Ahead of Pump.fun Token Sale In total, Pump.fun's ICO was set to sell 33% of PUMP's 1 trillion token supply, with 18% having already been allocated earlier via a private sale. The public allocation was recently lowered from 15% to 12.5%, which sold out in just 12 minutes. DeFiLlama data shows that in January Pump.fun's launchpad volume was above $11.6 billion, and has since been steadily declining to $3.65 billion last month. Similarly, revenue generated via the launchpad dropped from $133 million in the first month of the year to nearly $34 million last month, according to DeFiLlama data. While launchpad volumes plunged, Pump.fun's decentralized exchange PumpSwap, which was launched in March, has been making up for the decline, seeing $14.3 billion of volume in May and $10 billion last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Horse Race Insider is a privately owned magazine. By HRI Foreign Staff — In a bold return to the digital track, Virtually Human Studio has officially rebooted its famed Web3 horse racing game Zed Run as the newly launched Zed Champions: a skill-based, 24/7 virtual horse racing ecosystem built for a new era of strategy, ownership, and blockchain integration. Designed around dynamic breeding, automated race schedules, and $ZED token integration, Zed Champions is not just a visual or technical update; it's a complete overhaul aimed at sustainability and deeper engagemen Zed Run had once been a beacon of innovation in the NFT world, having processed over $400 million in digital horse transactions and bred more than 420,000 racehorses. But like many NFT platforms, it stumbled during the market's downturn. Zed Champions is VHS's answer to those challenges, as a refined, skill-based model that discourages speculation and favors strategic play. With features like auction-based breeding, leaderboard scoring, and race-driven rewards, players are now invited to manage virtual stables like a fantasy sports team, without needing to manually schedule races. What sets Zed Champions apart is its continuous ecosystem: a race every 80 seconds, around the clock, driven entirely by blockchain. Digital horses are matched based on real-time balance performance, and players can boost horses using Augments, which are special modifiers that influence performance in subtle but critical ways. For Web2 holdouts or crypto newcomers, VHS has introduced Zed Picks, a companion mobile app that allows spectators to cheer on horses, place bets using virtual currency, and win sweepstakes prizes with no crypto wallet required. Among them is Americas Cardroom, whose adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain tools was directly inspired by the early success of Zed Run. For Americas Cardroom CEO Phil Nagy, the connection between poker and digital horse racing was not immediately obvious until poker legend Chris Moneymaker introduced him to Zed Run. “And then he was, like, ‘Why didn't you tell me about this before?' That revelation would end up transforming the way Americas Cardroom approached payment processing and community engagement. Once introduced to crypto, blockchain, and NFTs, Nagy immersed himself in the technology. He set up servers, built e-wallet knowledge, and began experimenting with real-world applications. Today, you can play poker on the site with the option to use over 60 different cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known altcoins, making cross-border transactions seamless and instant. This has proven especially valuable in the poker world, where quick liquidity is often the difference between joining a game or missing out. “They can deposit fast; there are no fees or delays you get with other payment processors.” His vision goes even further. Nagy believes NFTs can serve as a transparent ledger for tournament records, player identities, and digital collectibles. While some online casinos have treated NFTs as temporary fads or promotional gimmicks, Americas Cardroom has looked at blockchain with a more positive outlook. Digital horse racing is no longer just a niche curiosity. It's rapidly evolving into a vibrant subsection of the sports betting and gaming industry, thanks to NFT-driven platforms like Zed Champions, Game of Silks, and Stables. Players who own a Silks horse receive rewards when their real-world counterpart wins races or produces offspring. It's a “play-to-earn” model with real-life stakes, which has attracted over 25,000 players worldwide. In partnership with the New York Racing Association, Game of Silks is helping traditional horse racing tap into younger, tech-savvy audiences without compromising the sport's integrity. Meanwhile, in Europe, France's Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) launched Stables, an NFT horse racing platform on the Tezos blockchain. Even brands like Stella Artois are experimenting with NFT horse racing campaigns — proof that this trend is entering mainstream advertising and branding circles. For traditional bettors of an older generation, especially those familiar with horse betting and poker, the appeal lies in a familiar pastime reimagined for the digital age. It's no surprise, then, that companies like Americas Cardroom are taking notes. Zed Champions may just be the frontrunner in this movement, but it's not racing alone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase broke with its usual blue logo on X, posting a Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token as its profile picture alongside the quip “new pfp, who dis.” Various crypto-related firms, including VanEck, MoonPay, and AwakenTax, have since changed their profile pictures to pudgy penguins. The stunt has also lifted the floor price of Pudgy Penguin NFTs, which was earlier this week around 9 ETH, and quickly jumped to 11.58 ETH according to NFTPriceFloor data. Coinbase changed its profile picture during a short account takeover from pseudonymous Crypto Twitter personality AlexOnChain, who previously led the social media account of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance for four years. After the takeover, Coinbase revealed they're hiring AlexOnChain as their first full-time “CT Lead.” “The new focus is making comms more social native - direct, transparent, and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct,” Alex said in a post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asia's regulatory frameworks in tokenization are attracting global investors, with Japan and Hong Kong setting the pace for real-world asset adoption. Asia's leadership in tokenization is drawing growing attention from global investors, with regulatory clarity in the region attracting capital that was once on the sidelines, according to Maarten Henskens, head of protocol growth at Startale Group. Henskens pointed out the distinct yet complementary approaches taken by Japan and Hong Kong to advance real-world asset (RWA) adoption. Japan's regulatory framework has been deliberate and forward-looking, establishing a strong foundation of institutional trust. Hong Kong, by contrast, has moved swiftly, launching the Ensemble Sandbox as a fast-track regulatory innovation hub. The rise of tokenized bonds and ETFs is playing a key role in bringing traditional investors into crypto markets. In Japan, real estate security tokens are making previously closed markets accessible to retail investors, sometimes more so than traditional J-REITs. Tokenization streamlines fund administration and increases transparency, allowing asset managers to connect directly with end-users. “This efficiency, paired with improved transparency, could make these products compelling to traditional investors who might not otherwise enter the crypto space,” Henskens said. “Seamless and compliant movement of tokenized assets across jurisdictions” will be critical for scaling adoption. In Asia, this means linking infrastructure across countries like Japan and Hong Kong, while globally, regulatory frameworks must reflect the technical realities of tokenized finance, especially around settlement, compliance, and custody. Related: Dubai launches first licensed tokenized real estate project in MENA region Dubai has been another Asian country making strides in tokenization. The city's regulatory authorities have introduced progressive frameworks that encourage the issuance and trading of tokenized securities, attracting global investors and fintech firms. In May, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, Dubai's crypto regulator, updated its guidelines to include provisions for RWA tokenization. Last month, the Dubai Land Department, in collaboration with VARA and top developers, successfully tokenized and sold two apartments, with the entire offering selling out within minutes, according to Heaver. Buyers came from over 35 countries, and notably, 70% were first-time real estate investors in Dubai.

The bitcoin price has hit a new all-time high of almost $119,000 per bitcoin—lifting Ripple's XRP, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies that have surged toward a combined market capitalization of $4 trillion—as the Wall Street “floodgates” are predicted to open. Now, as investors declare a $37 trillion “emergency,” U.S. president Donald Trump has helped spur the crypto market higher, warning the Federal Reserve should “rapidly” lower interest rates. The crypto market, which remains dominated by bitcoin, has added $1.2 trillion since crashing to its April lows and is now just $250 billion away from $4 trillion as ethereum and Ripple's XRP make huge gains. Last month, Trump posted that the Federal Reserve board should “activate," forcing Fed chair Jerome Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by "at least two to three points," and “save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year," spent on servicing the U.S. debt pile. Powell, who Trump has threatened to fire, kept interest rates on hold again last month after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation—which has yet to emerge. The market is overwhelmingly expecting the Fed to leave interest rates on hold at its July meeting in just under three weeks time, according to CME's FedWatch tracker, though traders are now betting on a September cut. “Signals of forthcoming Fed rate cuts have buoyed investor sentiment, given that a cut is now more likely than ever and greatly needed," James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments. The crypto market's move higher has been helped by the slow build of pressure created by bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bitcoin treasury companies led by Michael Saylor's Strategy, which have been buying up huge swaths of bitcoin and inspiring companies to try creating similar supply pressure by buying ethereum, XRP and others. “In bitcoin's case, the rally is being driven not only by expectations of Fed rate cuts, but also by continued inflows into U.S. spot ETFs, corporate treasury buying, and a weaker U.S. dollar,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fundamental right to privacy faces unprecedented challenges in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape. Midnight Network represents a groundbreaking approach to confidential interactions on distributed ledgers. It offers a path toward preserving essential freedoms without sacrificing functionality or compliance. Developed by Input Output Global, the creators of Cardano, it aims to provide a secure environment where individuals and businesses can interact and transact while maintaining control over their sensitive information. At its core, Midnight Network prioritizes protecting sensitive personal and commercial data. This focus on selective disclosure allows for confidential transactions and data sharing, empowering users to participate in the blockchain ecosystem without compromising their privacy or exposing proprietary business logic. This independent entity is dedicated to guiding Midnight towards full decentralization, fostering community involvement, and ensuring the network adheres to its core principles of privacy, security, and open participation. Beyond its technological infrastructure, Midnight Network is focused on cultivating a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. Midnight Network leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), specifically ZK-SNARKs, to validate transactions without exposing underlying data. By processing proofs off-chain and verifying them on-chain, Midnight ensures sensitive information never compromises user privacy or regulatory compliance. The network operates via a cooperative tokenomics system featuring two distinct assets: Governance authority gradually transitions to $NIGHT token holders via on-chain voting, enabling community-driven control over network parameters, incentives, and compliance frameworks. This phased approach ensures security and transparency while aligning with decentralization principles. Applications built on Midnight integrate modular smart contracts that enable selective data sharing. This “rational privacy” model supports compliance with regulations like KYC by disclosing only necessary attestations, not raw data while keeping all other inputs confidential. Holders use NIGHT to participate in on-chain voting, influencing protocol upgrades, treasury management, and network parameters. In addition to governance and tokenomics, NIGHT supports Midnight's goal for a cross-chain privacy economy. It facilitates interoperability, such as enabling XRP holders to participate in DeFi via confidential smart contracts without moving assets off-chain. This positions NIGHT as a catalyst for privacy-focused innovation across major blockchain ecosystems, potentially reshaping how sensitive data is managed in Web3. Its strategic distribution across 37 million wallets further amplifies network effects and real-world testing. These SPOs can validate Midnight transactions, earning rewards while bolstering network security without compromising Cardano's operations. This symbiotic relationship allows Midnight to inherit Cardano's battle-tested security while specializing in programmable data privacy for RWAs and enterprises. Midnight Network pioneers a vital reconciliation of confidentiality and functionality within decentralized systems. By embedding privacy as a programmable right rather than an optional feature, it empowers users and enterprises to harness blockchain's potential without sacrificing security or compliance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The CEO of Franklin Templeton traveled to Zurich for a confidential exchange with leading figures of the Swiss blockchain scene. It was an extraordinarily exclusive group that gathered for lunch at Zurich's Hotel Storchen in early June: the leaders of twelve prominent Swiss blockchain firms accepted the invitation from Jenny Johnson, CEO of U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton. Johnson flew in from New York specifically for the meeting. «It was an informal exchange among industry leaders,» emphasized Christian Leger, Head of Franklin Templeton Switzerland, in a statement to finews.com. It maps a traditional investment product, in this case a money market fund, onto blockchain networks and issues digital tokens representing real fund shares. While Benji, the abbreviation for this fund, was created for U.S. investors, the firm launched a UCITS version of Benji in February this year. Again, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FTOCF) was a first of its kind. It is the first fully tokenized UCITS product on a public blockchain. The company set up its own blockchain infrastructure in Luxembourg—the Benji platform—for this purpose. Since taking office in 2020, Johnson has been driving the topic of tokenization with determination. She believes this technology will fundamentally transform asset management within just a few years. With around 50 in-house experts and the central Benji platform, Franklin Templeton is emerging as a strong player in the blockchain industry. The firm also serves as a node validator, meaning it participates in validating crypto transactions on 12 blockchains. Additionally, it manages a venture capital fund investing in the blockchain ecosystem and offers advisory services for cryptocurrency investments. That the summit took place in Zurich is hardly surprising. Switzerland is regarded as one of the most advanced and deeply integrated markets for digital assets worldwide. It is home to international players such as Ethereum, Cosmos (Interchain Foundation), Solana, Aave, and 21Shares, and actively promotes collaboration within the Web3 sector. Franklin Templeton operates globally at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi. After launching Benji in the U.S. and Europe, Singapore is next. «We are not speaking publicly about concrete plans for Switzerland at this time,» says Christian Leger. Switzerland will always play a central role in that.» finews.com publishes on its own Web-TV-Channel interviews with well-known figures of Swiss finance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is written by one of Kitco's sponsors. (Kitco News) - G-Knot, a biometrics technology innovator, has unveiled plans for the world's first finger vein biometric crypto wallet, aiming to revolutionize security in digital asset storage. As the exclusive licensee of eTunnel Inc.—a Seoul-based leader in finger vein biometrics with over 10 years of R&D—G-Knot is dedicated to harnessing unforgeable internal vein patterns for enhanced digital security. Kaplan aims to scale the technology's adoption, stating: “G-Knot is poised to redefine security in the digital age... By replacing the need for recovery phrases with users' unique biometric authentication, we're not only solving today's issues but also paving the way for broader applications in decentralized finance and identity management.” Veins absorb the light, creating a high-contrast image that is then processed via pattern recognition algorithms for authentication. This internal biometric is contactless or minimally invasive, requiring no physical touch, which enhances hygiene and usability. Key advantages include superior accuracy and spoof resistance compared to surface-based methods like fingerprints, as vein patterns are hidden and require live blood flow for detection (ensuring "aliveness"). They remain permanent throughout life, offer low false acceptance rates, and are resilient to external factors like dirt or scars. However, potential drawbacks involve higher implementation costs due to specialized hardware, possible challenges for users with circulatory issues, and general biometric concerns like privacy risks or false rejections in varying conditions. In cryptocurrency contexts, this tech enables secure key generation directly from biometric data, often integrated with deep learning for robust cryptographic keys or blockchain systems to prevent linkage attacks. G-Knot's wallet leverages these features to provide enterprise-grade protection, drawing from eTunnel's proven track record, including a 2024 UN contract for biometric smart cards. Youngkuk Kim, CEO of eTunnel, commented: “As eTunnel continues to advance biometric research, G-Knot... will leverage the gold standard of biometric technology to deliver enterprise-grade and consumer-focused products that address the growing security needs of an increasingly digital world.” This innovation could significantly reduce crypto fraud by making secure, user-friendly authentication accessible, while advancing biometric-blockchain integrations for a safer digital ecosystem.</p>

Japan-based real estate investment firm Gates Inc. announced that it has partnered with the Oasys blockchain to tokenize 75 million dollars of income-generating properties in central Tokyo. Gates will adopt the tokenization through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is set in a foreign land to comply with the local legislation. The tokenized assets will allow any investors worldwide to buy, sell, and trade their real estate-backed tokens with Web3 wallets. Oasys has developed an EVM-compatible proof-of-stake network that provides the seamless migration of assets and wallet compatibility to help institutions to join tokenized real estate markets. Gates will aim to expand its tokenization efforts to other nations, primarily in the United States, Europe, the Philippines, and other Asian markets after its launch in Tokyo. The project aligns with the growing global interest in tokenized real estate, which experts project to exceed 4 trillion dollars by 2035, as institutional investors pursue greater liquidity and efficiency. By putting ownership on the blockchain, Gates will simplify investment, eliminating transaction expenses and opening up new pools of retail and institutional capital, anywhere in the world.
