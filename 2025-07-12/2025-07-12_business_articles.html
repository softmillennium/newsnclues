                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Trump administration escalates its criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell, the central bank is quietly pushing back with a new "Frequently Asked Questions" page on its website defending the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation project. The page, last updated on Friday, directly responds to some of the administration's criticisms of the renovation project of the Fed's headquarters, which came under attack this week from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. Vought on Thursday claimed that Powell "has grossly mismanaged the Fed" and took aim at what he called "an ostentatious overhaul" of the Fed's renovations, which seeks to modernize the campus for the Federal Reserve, including by renovating three buildings overlooking the National Mall. "It involves a complete overhaul and modernization that preserves two historic buildings that have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s," according to the Fed's website. Vought's criticisms of the project, made via a letter posted on X, marked an escalation of the Trump administration's ongoing campaign against Powell. Trump has repeatedly claimed the central bank leader is playing politics by not lowering interest rates, and has called on Powell to resign. The letter — and Vought's Friday pledge to pursue an investigation into the Fed's renovations — suggest that the Trump administration is moving to remove Powell before his term ends next year. But Powell has repeatedly resisted Trump's criticisms and repeated attempts to pressure him to cut interest rates, the main sticking point in Trump's attacks. "Eccles has conference rooms, which are being renovated and preserved. That line appears to be in direct response to Vought's letter, which claimed that the plans for renovations called "for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more." "Various factors have driven cost increases," the page on the Federal Reserve website says, citing "changes to original building designs as a result of consultation with review agencies" and "unforeseen conditions," such as "more asbestos than anticipated." The Fed is self-funded through interest it makes on securities held by the institution and through fees charged banks. Vought on Friday pledged to pursue an investigation of the renovations, saying on CNBC, "We want to make sure we have facts as to the largesse and the extent to which it's overrun." Vought's Friday comments are a continuation of his X post the day prior, in which he said: "While continuing to run a deficit since FY23 (the first time in the Fed's history), the Fed is way over budget on the renovation of its headquarters."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon championship with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Amanda Anisimova on Saturday in the first women's final at the tournament in 114 years in which one player failed to claim a single game. Swiatek's victory on a sunny, breezy afternoon at Centre Court took just 57 minutes and gave Swiatek her sixth Grand Slam title overall. She is now 6-0 in major title matches. The 24-year-old from Poland finished with a 55-24 edge in total points and accumulated that despite needing to produce merely 10 winners. Anisimova was shaky from the start and made 28 unforced errors. Swiatek already owned four trophies from the French Open's red clay and one from the U.S. Open's hard courts, but this is first title of her professional career at any grass-court tournament. Swiatek is the eighth consecutive first-time women's champion at Wimbledon, but her triumph stands out from the others because it came in a stunningly dominant performance against Anisimova, a 23-year-old American who was participating in her first final at a major. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals but never looked like she was the same player on Saturday. When it was over, while Swiatek climbed into the stands to celebrate with her team, Anisimova sat on the sideline in tears. All the way back in 1911, Dorothea Lambert Chambers was a 6-0, 6-0 winner against Dora Boothby. Swiatek never had been past the quarterfinals of the All England Club and her only other final on the slick surface came when she was the runner-up at a tuneup event in Germany right before Wimbledon began. Swiatek spent most of 2022, 2023 and 2024 at No. 1 in the WTA rankings but was seeded No. She served a one-month doping ban last year after failing an out-of-competition drug test; an investigation determined she was inadvertently exposed to a contaminated medical product used for trouble sleeping and jet lag. Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Florida, was a semifinalist at age 17 at the 2019 French Open. She took time away from the tour a little more than two years ago because of burnout. A year ago, she tried to qualify for Wimbledon, because her ranking of 189th was too low to get into the field automatically, but lost in the preliminary event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European Union leaders are sounding off on the 30% tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose on the trade bloc, with most emphasizing the need for unity, constructive dialogue and their readiness to work toward an agreement by Aug. 1. "Imposing 30% tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic," Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement. "The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership." Some leaders were more critical of Trump's latest move. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said it's "concerning and not the way forward" in a post on X. Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of Spain, also took to X, calling the duties "unjustified." Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson noted that the EU "is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary," while emphasizing that it would be best to avoid such a move. On Saturday morning, Trump announced the 30% tariff rates in letters to von der Leyen and Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, posted on his Truth Social account. Trump also said there would not be tariffs on goods from Europe "or companies within the EU" that build or manufacture products in the U.S. This week, Trump sent similar letters to 23 other U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Japan and Brazil, setting blanket tariff rates ranging from 20% up to 50%. Here's how European leaders have reacted to the latest salvo in Trump's trade skirmish: Von der Leyen's statement emphasized the EU's commitment to dialogue and stability: "We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required. Meanwhile, we continue to deepen our global partnerships, firmly anchored in the principles of rules-based international trade." The Dutch Prime Minister said in an X post: The European Commission can count on our full support. As the EU we must remain united and resolute in pursuing an outcome with the United States that is mutually beneficial." "We support the EU Commission's desire to continue seeking a negotiated solution. The EU is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary. However, everyone loses in an escalated trade conflict, and it is US consumers who will pay the highest price. Sweden stands up for free trade and international cooperation." In European unity, it is more crucial than ever for the Commission to assert the Union's determination to resolutely defend European interests. This notably involves accelerating the preparation of credible countermeasures, by mobilizing all available instruments, including the anti-coercion mechanism, if no agreement is reached by August 1. Trump's letter is "both impertinent and a slap in the face," Lange said on X. "We've been negotiating intensely for more than three weeks - made offers to improve things in mutual interest. Firmly convinced they should come into force as planned on Monday, quickly followed by the second list. It is now essential to remain focused on the negotiations, avoiding polarization that would make reaching an agreement more difficult." Unjustified tariffs destroy it," Sánchez said in an X post. "That is why we support and will continue to support the Commission in its negotiations to reach an agreement with the US before August 1. Let us use that strength to achieve a fair agreement." When issues arise between us, they should be resolved by close and respectful dialogue ... Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the U.S. economy solid but still facing elevated risk of recession — or, as President Trump described it in May, in a "transition period" — states are pitching themselves as the most stable place for companies to locate no matter what happens to the economy. "Georgia job creation remains strong," that state's Department of Economic Development assures. A CNBC analysis of all 50 state economic development websites finds that the economy — and factors relating to it such as job growth, foreign direct investment and the housing market — are the most frequently mentioned selling point this year. Economy popped up 222 times in our tally, well ahead of the next most mentioned factor, infrastructure, at 203. Under the methodology for CNBC's annual business competitiveness study, America's Top States for Business, that makes Economy the heaviest weighted category in 2025. But measuring state economies is more challenging than usual this year. And tariffs — so far, a wildly moving target — are already crimping the economies of states that depend on international commerce. "If you don't know what your product is going to cost, if you don't know if your export market is going to be there in six months, if you don't understand the terms that you're trading on, it makes it really hard to say, 'Okay, we're gonna take a risk and invest in this new product line'," said Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a Washington, D.C.-based economic data firm. To score each state's economy in this year's Top States for Business study, we considered traditional measures such as state gross domestic product growth, job growth, state fiscal health, the number of major corporations headquartered in each state, and the strength of the local housing market. But we also considered how dependent each state is on a shrinking federal government for spending and hiring. "The big things that we start out looking at is just really exposure to international trade, and particularly the goods trades," Anthony said. But these states have what it takes to navigate a recession. Notably, that job growth is not occurring in the manufacturing sector, including the auto industry, where tariff increases could hit hard. Instead, the state's biggest job growth is in construction, where employment rose more than 7% year-over-year in April, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2025 Economy Score: 274 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: B-) 2025 Economy Score: 277 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: B) Utah's tech sector is a major driver, but some of the biggest job gains occurred in construction as the state tries to get ahead of a severe housing shortage. Utah's international goods trade makes up nearly 17% of state GDP. And Trade Partnership Worldwide estimates that retaliatory tariffs from other countries could increase Utah business costs by up to 30%. 2025 Economy Score: 279 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: B) The Gem State's economy continues to dazzle, with solid growth last year. The state's housing market, which has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride in recent years, has stabilized nicely for now, and new home construction is taking off. Idaho is also relatively insulated from tariffs, with limited international trade and tiny exposure to China. But Idaho depends on the federal government for a comparatively large share of state spending. Brad Little warned of a potential "economic shock" from the Trump budget cuts, but said Idaho had the wherewithal to withstand it. 2025 Economy Score: 288 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: B) A new business starting up in Washington stands a better chance of survival than in any other state, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by Simply Business, a national insurance marketplace. The state is relatively well insulated from federal budget cuts, but it would be on the front lines of a trade war with China. With China accounting for more than 16% of Washington's international goods trade, it is the fourth most exposed state. Only California is home to more major corporations than New York. But federal funding does account for a relatively large portion of the state budget. While growth in The First State was moribund last year, Delaware's economic foundation is sound, and well-insulated from the upheaval coming from Washington. The state does have some exposure to international trade, but only a small portion of that — about 8% — is with China. Delaware has lost some of its allure as a place to incorporate, following court decisions seen as unfriendly to business — like the one last year voiding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's compensation package. But it was still the second most popular state in which to start a business last year, after Wyoming. 2025 Economy Score: 317 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: A-) North Carolina's housing market, while suffering shortages exacerbated by last year's Hurricane Helene, nonetheless does reasonably well on affordability, according to data from the National Association of Homebuilders. 2025 Economy Score: 322 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: A-) Major Corporate Headquarters: Bank of America, Duke Energy, Nucor That should be especially helpful in these tumultuous times. And while international goods trade is an important part of the Texas economy, only a small percentage of that trade, about 6%, is with China. The state enters these tumultuous times with solid finances, and a wealth of foreign direct investment. The Sunshine State tops CNBC's Economy rankings for a third consecutive year in 2025. Economic growth and job growth remain solidly in the top ten, state finances are strong, and the state is a leader in new business formations. Florida is a major player in international trade, but it comprises a relatively small percentage of the state's overall economy. And only a small percentage of that international trade is with China, leaving the state in a better position than many when it comes to tariffs. Florida depends on the federal government for about 34% of its budget — and roughly two-thirds of its $34 billion Medicaid budget. That has Floridians keeping a wary eye on Washington.

Powell has resisted pressure to ease monetary policy and said he won't step down if asked by the president, given the Fed's independence.

President Donald Trump's potential dismissal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a major and underpriced risk that could trigger a selloff in the US dollar and Treasuries, a Deutsche Bank AG strategist said.

Trump this week said Powell should “resign immediately,” if allegations from an administration official that the central banker misled lawmakers over renovations to the Fed's headquarters prove true. The remark added to growing criticism of the Fed chair by Trump, who has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts and signaled he may nominate a successor before Powell's term ends.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>xAI has apologized for Grok's "horrific behavior" and said that new instructions caused the AI chatbot to prioritize engagement, even if that meant reflecting "extremist views" from user posts on X. Grok is integrated into X so that users can interact with the chatbot by tagging it. xAI said it disabled that functionality on July 8 "due to increased abusive usage" of Grok. Inside xAI, workers training Grok have expressed anger and disillusionment with the chatbot's behavior, Business Insider exclusively reported Friday. The update caused Grok to prioritize engaging replies, even if they contained "unethical or controversial opinions," xAI said. So, if a user tagged Grok in an X post talking about Hitler, the chatbot would mimic that. When asked about immigration and conflict in the Middle East, it cited Musk's views, tests by BI confirmed. On Thursday, Musk said Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles "very soon." xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Across his numerous companies, Musk is not one to shy away from risk-taking — even when failure could mean a publicity nightmare. With xAI, Musk has deployed Grok directly into X, where users can summon it to respond at any time. It means that, unlike rivals such as OpenAI, where user interactions largely stay private, xAI's behavior — good or bad — is in full view of the world. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, took a distinctly different approach on Friday, announcing that his company would delay the launch of open-weight models — systems where certain parameters are public — to run additional safety tests.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many couples see intimacy as a "nice to have" in relationships. This is especially true after the honeymoon period wears off. As a sex therapist and psychotherapist with over two decades of experience, I'm here to tell you that's wrong. Intimacy is the heartbeat of a thriving relationship. When intimacy breaks down, it doesn't just affect your connection with a partner, it can impact your career, friendships, and physical health. It influences how you lead, communicate, make decisions, and feel about yourself. Clients often come to therapy for stress, anxiety, or performance issues at work, only for us to uncover intimacy gaps as the deeper source of misalignment. Intimacy, to bust another myth, is more than just getting laid or knowing the right positions. Many of the biggest intimacy blockers are hiding in plain sight. Here are four surprising things that quietly kill intimacy — and what to do about them: Ask your partner how they feel when one or both of you are on your phone, laptop, iPad, or other screens. You might be surprised by how much it matters. Come up with a few simple boundaries together. It could be as simple as designating screen-free zones, like the bedroom and couch, or at specific times, like during meals or before bed. Being present is the foundation of true intimacy. Whether you're comparing someone new to your ex or haven't fully processed the end of a past relationship, that lingering attachment can leave little room for connecting with anyone else. Are you still mentally or emotionally entangled with your ex? Be kind and give yourself permission to grieve what was lost and reflect on what that relationship taught you. Journal your uncensored thoughts, talk it out with a therapist, or (my old favorite) write a letter to your ex that you won't send. If you're holding on to physical reminders such as texts, photos, or gifts, consider letting them go to create space for what's next. Meanwhile, they might be having the same doubts. These protective thoughts are normal, but unhelpful and may be a little distorted. They can cause us to self-reject before giving intimacy a chance. Just because a thought feels true doesn't mean it is, even if those suckers can be very convincing! One of the most powerful tools from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to evaluate your thoughts instead of accepting them at face value. For example, instead of, "They're probably not into me," the reframe might be: "I'm not sure how they feel yet, and I don't have to figure it out all at once. I can be present and see where this goes." In sex therapy, we use the dual control model: Every person has "accelerators," or things that turn them on, and "brakes," which are things that shut them down. If you fall into the latter group, stress from anywhere in your life — your job, a parent's illness, an unexpected bill — might be getting in the way. Do you feel more open or closed off when stressed? Understanding your unique wiring, you can talk to your partner about it in a way that brings you closer. Helping with dinner or giving me time to reset really helps." Be curious about your partner's accelerators and brakes, too. Ask what helps them feel connected, supported, and seen. These conversations don't have to be perfect. That kind of exchange is intimacy in action.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To offset the rising costs of tariffs and trade war uncertainty, companies are using U.S. Customs-sanctioned foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce product taxes. FTZs have a long history dating back to a previous period of trade conflict, created during the Great Depression by Congress to encourage international trade and boost exports at time when the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were as high as 53%. Companies importing raw materials, semi-finished, or components from foreign countries to an FTZ or bonded warehouse are essentially in a tariff bubble, meaning when they enter the U.S. they are stored duty-free. Once inside an FTZ, a product can be assembled or modified. Duties are only collected after a product leaves the zone and enters U.S. commerce. Products can be stored in an FTZ indefinitely. Bonded warehouses have a limit of up to five years. There are FTZs in all 50 states and there are approximately 2,240 FTZs in all across the nation, according to U.S. Customs. For companies caught in the crossfire of Trump's trade war, preserving cash is king. By delaying duty payments, "FTZs and bonded warehouses essentially frees up a company's cash flow," said Jason Strickland, director of sales at logistics firm Givens. "There is also the added benefit that if a product is manufactured in an FTZ and is re-exported abroad, no duty payments are incurred at all." Before the 2025 global trade war, companies that manufactured products in an FTZ had what is known as an "inverted tariff" benefit. Companies that have operated inside FTZs include automakers Ford, GM and Chrysler, as well as General Electric, Intel and Sony. According to the World Free Zones Organization, FTZs were also used by Pfizer while it was developing the Covid vaccine. But President Trump ended that rule by way of recent executive orders, and for companies like Regent Tek Industries, which manufactures liquid road markings used by road crews to make the lines on the nation's roads, byways, and highways, that's become a big problem, resulting in millions of dollars in extra tariffs. "Our product is basically like baking a cake," said Helen Torkos, president of Regent Tek. We cannot source all of our components here. We are paying around 7% more now because the inverted tariff option is no longer available to us." Companies can import products in a bubble under a higher tariff rate, and store without paying duties. "You don't want to bring in all your goods and spend your cash flow against tariffs that may not be here in, you know, six weeks, six months, if you can defer until the market is ready to consume those goods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk hasn't only made his mark on the federal government — he's making himself known in local Texas bureaucracy, too. Residents in southern Texas voted to incorporate the area around a SpaceX complex as the city of "Starbase" in May 2025. Company employees and their families make up nearly all of the 500 residents. In the late 2010s, Musk decided that Texas was a friendlier place to do business than California, and by 2020 started moving some company headquarters to the Lone Star State. SpaceX bought land to manufacture and test Starship rockets in 2012 near Boca Chica Village, a remote coastal area close to the border with Mexico. The rocket company needed to make room for Starbase, its new rocket launch site, and tried to buy out the locals. SpaceX told some residents it was "not safe" to live there. SpaceX first floated the idea of incorporating Starbase as a city to officials in Cameron County, Texas, in 2021. In December 2024, the company submitted a petition to local authorities asking for an election to incorporate the launch site as a city. Less than a year later, that election came to pass. Now, around 500 people live in Starbase, most of whom are families of the about 260 SpaceX employees who are residents. In 2021, he said on X that his primary residence is a "~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX." He is also registered to vote in the area and posted a picture of himself voting in Cameron County ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Most of the more than 3,000 people who work out of Starbase commute each day in and drive past a nine-foot golden bust of Musk on their way into the facility. Starbase's elected officials are all current or former SpaceX staff. Bobby Peden ran unopposed for mayor and got 216 votes. He has been at SpaceX for more than 12 years and is currently the "VP - Texas Test & Launch," according to his LinkedIn. The city is only about 1.5 square miles. A housing shortage is proving to be an issue for SpaceX, as hundreds of workers are trying to move into the area to work on the company's Starship program. Texas State Highway 4 is the only road that runs to and through Starbase, according to a map of the city on Cameron County's website. The Starbase city commission now controls zoning rules and building permits that were previously controlled by Cameron County. Starbase is, according to Space's website, where "development, manufacturing, testing, and launch of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket — collectively referred to as Starship — takes place." In a letter to residents posted on the site on June 23, 2025, the city commissioners said they had approved more than 100 residential and commercial building permits and designated May 29 as Starbase Day. Some environmentalists have raised concerns about potential pollution from launches and explosions impacting nearby water systems and wildlife. Lawmakers denied SpaceX the ability to control parts of Boca Chica Beach and Highway 4 for rocket launches in late April of 2025. Yet in early June, lawmakers ultimately granted Starbase and its SpaceX-aligned leaders that power. Generations of Texans, the group said, have come to the area for fishing, swimming, and other outdoor activities. Starbase's website includes a section about beach and road closures.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since then, Masino and other Cracker Barrel executives have outlined plans for big changes at the chain's locations, from refreshed decor to new menu items. After Masino's "relevant" comment last year, I visited a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Northern Virginia to see what she was talking about. Back then, I found the food underwhelming, from middling fried chicken to disappointing biscuits and gravy. My story about that visit prompted many reader responses, including a few dozen messages from people who said they loved the food and old-timey decor. A few others, including some Cracker Barrel fans who had been going to the chain for decades, said that they had noticed the food quality slip in recent years. One year later, Cracker Barrel has introduced several new menu items, so I decided it was time to go back and see if any of them were better than what I ordered last time. Like many Cracker Barrel restaurants, this one is located near multiple major highways and freeways, including some leading into and out of Washington, DC. It's the same location I visited last year. Cracker Barrel has said it's renovated a fraction of its 660 locations. When I visited in early July, none of the stores near where I live in Washington, DC, had been renovated. Tariffs have also influenced how early the chain is bringing in some seasonal merchandise this year, CEO Masino said. While I've gotten used to seeing fall and winter decorations at stores in summer, these Halloween items seemed especially early, given that I was visiting Cracker Barrel during the first full week of July. Cracker Barrel's menu highlighted several new or limited-time items. A card on the table, for instance, advertised a S'mores Latte, Cinnamon Roll Skillet, and S'mores Brownie Skillet, which are part of the summer Campfire Menu. Once I worked my way through all that whipped cream, the underlying coffee wasn't nearly as sweet. The cinnamon rolls tasted a lot like store-bought ones you can buy in the refrigerated section of a grocery store, and make yourself at home. About 10 minutes after I ordered, my blueberry pancakes arrived with syrup on the side, three strips of bacon, and two eggs. Cracker Barrel started serving these pancake platters earlier this year. I don't know for sure whether these pancakes were made with fresh buttermilk, but they sure tasted like it. The syrup, unlike a lot of pancake syrups, tasted more fruity than sweet. I would order these again in a heartbeat. After looking at the menu again, I decided to try Cracker Barrel's biscuits, which had been a low point of my previous visit. The biscuits showed up about five minutes later in a to-go bag, even though I hadn't asked for them to go. The biscuits were warm out of the bag, which raised my hopes that they would be better than on my last visit. On that occasion, they were served room temperature and alongside gravy that tasted like it was out of a can. Sadly, these biscuits were no better than the last ones. Yet, given how foundational biscuits are to Southern cooking, I wondered why Cracker Barrel couldn't make better ones. As I finished my breakfast dishes, it was nearly 11 a.m. That's when Cracker Barrel started serving some lunch and dinner items, including the Campfire Meals. At the location I visited, the Campfire options included either chicken or beef served with slow-cooked potatoes and vegetables in a foil-lined dish. The Campfire Meals intrigued me because Cracker Barrel hasn't served them since 2018 and recently brought them back as a limited-time offer. It took about 15 minutes for my meal to be ready. It came with the meat and vegetables wrapped in aluminum foil, as well as two small pieces of cornbread in a separate paper bag. Of anything I've ever eaten at Cracker Barrel, this meal tasted the most like home cooking. Some longtime Cracker Barrel fans told me last year that the chain should bring back some discontinued items to increase sales. Soaking it in the meal's beef juices helped. In my opinion, Cracker Barrel's new menu items are better than some of the staples that I tried one year ago. There were also items that still needed work, including the biscuits. Cracker Barrel is definitely making progress on its menu. But if it wants to win diners over with memorable food, the latest changes look more like a starting point than a complete solution. A Cracker Barrel spokesperson told me in a statement that the company is "committed to ongoing menu innovation" and that the seasonal items "help keep the menu fresh and encourage repeat visits." Do you have a story to share about Cracker Barrel or another restaurant chain?</p>

Trump's Immigration Policy:

A federal judge in Los Angeles issued an order temporarily blocking US authorities from using racial or ethnic profiling during immigration sweeps in the region and requiring that detainees get access to lawyers. 

The order Friday by US District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong is the latest fallout from the Trump administration's controversial crackdown on migrants in California and across the US. It came in a lawsuit by a group of Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups who accused President Donald Trump's administration of terrorizing the population with heavy handed and unconstitutional tactics. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tons of discounts have come and gone in the last four days, and once the clock strikes midnight Pacific, almost all of them will expire. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts. I strongly dislike in-ear earbuds that extend too far into my ear canal, so I was elated when Apple announced its newest AirPods, which would maintain a similar form factor as its predecessors but offer active noise cancellation. These things are great, and although their ANC isn't quite as strong as the Pro 2's, they are good enough for regular use while out and about. For Prime Day's remaining hours, the wireless charging versions are down to $119, and the USB-C charging ones are down to $89, both excellent all-time lows. If you have yet to pick up a pair during the sale, I recommend acting fast. I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though. Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro. This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus. Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers. OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below. device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers). Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills. If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't help unless you can leave it in 'on mode'—like a physical light switch on a lamp. It comes bundled with convenient Alexa features and is one of the few of its size to offer local dimming, giving good contrast performance. For Prime Day, it's 33% off, but that ends in an hour, so you'll want to act fast to save on this affordable option. It's on sale frequently, but almost never for this low. The brand is a popular option among those looking to track their workouts, fitness routines, and general health-related stats, but my greatest reason for recommending it is the battery life. The vívoactive 5 boasts 11 days of battery life, and at 37% off, it's just $1 shy of the cheapest price we've ever seen it listed at, so you'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal than this. Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus. If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line. Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen. I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit. They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200. My dad somehow lost his headphones on the way to Greece—tragic, right? Call this perfect timing, but it was the easiest replacement ever to rebuy them for him during Prime Day. And they were cheaper than when I got them for him last Father's Day. Now, they'll arrive home before his flight touches down in America. Even though this editor-favorite folding mini fan isn't very expensive and sees discounts somewhat regularly, at $13, it's a much better deal than we usually see in the summer. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too. Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. They integrate similarly with Apple devices but also include an Android app, making them versatile enough for users outside of the Apple ecosystem. Though they're on sale often, this drop to $149 is an especially great deal price for the Beats Fit Pro. At full price, I wouldn't recommend them for everyone, but at 60% off during Prime Day, they make an excellent gift or spare set to keep in your work bag. At $80 off, the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen is the lowest price we usually see the smartwatch reach, so now is a good time to buy if you've been thinking of making a purchase. The SE 2nd Gen is a solid entry point for the Apple Watch, thanks to its (relatively) low price point and robust set of features. It's a great option for fitness, sleep, and heart rate tracking within the Apple ecosystem. They've been dipping in and out of stock over the duration of the event, and after Prime Day, they'll be gone for sure. Our budget 75-inch TV pick, the Roku Plus Series, is an entry-level QLED with quantum dots and local dimming for solid contrast and color performance despite its low price. It's times like these that my compact Anker 633 Magnetic Battery saves the day. This MagSafe backup battery conveniently snaps onto the back of my iPhone and juices it up without the use of an annoying cable. I've loved PopSockets since they first released years ago, but once MagSafe charging became an integral feature to modern iPhones, I had to ditch my beloved adhesive phone grip because it interfered with the magnetic capabilities. Thankfully, PopSockets released a MagSafe option that powerfully claps onto the back of my phone but easily comes off so I can charge or even just change cases as needed. Now, for Prime Day, the MagSafe PopSocket is $8 off in a handful of different colors. I love that it can stand upright by itself, has a built-in crevice tool in the handheld portion, and has some pretty strong LED lights. It's a little top-heavy, and I've noticed that long strands of my hair do wrap around the brush roll. However, for $129, this is one very effective cordless vacuum from a reputable brand. I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. The even-smaller version of Bissell's popular Little Green portable vacuum cleaner offers the same great performance, designed for even tighter spaces. Chances are, after Prime Day, deals for it will once again be few and far between, so don't hesitate to pick one up if you're on the fence. I bought one of these last year on Prime Day, and it's still working fantastically despite being used multiple times a day. I use it for cat hair and fluff around the house on the bed, sofa, and even on my clothes - like when your pet does a drive by, walking past and covering your trousers in hair just as you're almost out the door. The storage barrel holds a lot of hair, so I don't need to empty it that often. It's a little noisy to use as the plastic casing clanks around while brushing. It annoys the cat no end when I'm brushing around her, but until she starts cleaning up after herself, she's just going to have to take it. It's a tad difficult to use on looser surfaces like a thin blanket, as it's the backward and forward motions that pull up the hair, so only brushing one way doesn't work as well. Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home. Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights. As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area. The Hatch Restore 3 is one of those items that very rarely go on sale. If you've been thinking about it, this $30 discount is the best you can find, and it even extends to the new pink hue, Rosy. On first glance, I thought the Hatch Restore was an overhyped wake up light, but it's features extend far beyond pretty light displays and a nice wake up tune… it also incorporates a wind-down routine (think exclusive podcasts, meditations, sounds) and can be used throughout the night as a sound machine too. I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Since then, I've seen these sold individually at Five Below and literally today at Lidl, but this deal brings the Birthday Cake Blondie flavor down to just $20 for a pack of 12, which doesn't feel as risky. I've never seen it priced anywhere near this low. These protein brownies are perfectly moist, flavorful, and a helpful way to get more protein in while also indulging in a sweet, yet not completely, guilty treat. As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate. This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen. No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water. If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good. I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type. Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals. If you get bitten up by mosquitoes during the summer, no matter which bug spray you wear, consider investing in this rechargeable repeller. Unlike other mosquito repellants you spray on yourself, this one has no chemical scent. All you have to do is set it up in an area that gets a lot of mosquito activity (like your backyard), and it'll create a "protection zone" of up to 20 feet. At its lowest price ever for Prime Day, you won't want to miss this deal. Back when I still lived with my mom, I invested in the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH in an attempt to stave off her overwhelming allergies to my new rescue dog. I think this thing is worth full price, so a 33% discount makes the deal even sweeter. It's on sale often, but not usually for this low; this Prime Day deal is a must-buy for anyone interested in our top air purifier pick. In addition to being a great kitchen companion, this Dutch oven is also beautiful to look at and will last you decades. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder is a great entry-level option, with 15 settings to tinker with, whether you're brewing for French Press or Espresso. OXO knows good design; the products speak for themselves, and they don't often go on sale. This is the lowest price since February, and before that, a brief time in December, the grinder dipped just a few dollars below $70. Likewise, if you want to upgrade your coffee maker while you're at it, the OXO 8-cup coffee maker is also 29% off. It's no frills but lets the coffee focus take center stage. A college dorm lifesaver, this cute and compact Keurig fits into the smallest corners of any space. It can brew six to 12 ounces at a time and has a convenient top-fill design that allows you to pour water straight into the machine. For Prime Day, all five hues of the machine are 50% off, so you can get the one that best matches your aesthetic. Espresso making is hardly a cheap hobby to dive into, but with the Casabrews Espresso Machine, it can cost a little less. It's the top pick in our guide to the best budget espresso machine, with a sleek steel design that impresses visually and in terms of durability. This deal ends in an hour, along with Prime Day, but there is a chance it can crop up again in a few months. I used to be a nonbeliever in the Scrub Daddy hype, but after trying these little guys out on my own dishes, I believe the hype. I'd also like to believe that their smiley demeanor makes doing dishes a little less painful. Scrub Daddy's have seen sales before, but this 20% discount is especially worthwhile. One of the best Prime Day hacks is checking to see if an item you'll need to buy anyway is on sale, and then purchasing in bulk. Tide PODS are essential for me, and I especially like the Free & Gentle version (now 20% off) since it doesn't smell like much but still gets the job done. Our guide to the best Prime Day household essentials also discusses a few other deals that might interest you. I have really sensitive skin, so haphazardly using cheap, multicolor dish soaps with my bare hands can cause me some pretty unpleasant reactions. The Seventh Generation Dish Liquid is the only option I've found that doesn't aggravate my fingers to use, and it cuts through stubborn food residue with ease. If you've read any of our deals content before, you know that we love to recommend stocking up on your regular consumables when they're on sale. The same goes for this six-pack of dish soap, which is now 30% off and will last a good long while. It pioneered the technology that allows users to open the window while it remains installed, and its quiet, effective performance still impresses. It's on sale a lot, but almost never for this low. It's uncommon to find actually good cooling appliance deals in the summer, but alas, the Midea U Inverter is down for Prime Day. First of all, it totally upgraded my crappy apartment shower and made it somewhere I actually want to be in the morning. Many people swear by filtered shower heads, saying they work wonders for hair and skin. I personally haven't noticed a big difference, other than that my hair dye seems to last a few weeks longer (the shower head filters out chlorine in the water). My cat loves Greenies and will wait for me to top off her meals with them before eating, so these have become a must-have in my household. They help clean teeth and can freshen up breath. Plus, they come in a few different tasty flavors. In my experience, a big tub like this is the way to go, so I'm not constantly re-ordering. I've highlighted the chicken flavor here since that's what my cat is currently working her way through, but there are also salmon and tuna-flavored options. At 25% off, this deal on the dental treat pick in our guide to the best cat treats is a must-buy for cat parents restocking for their pet. It's easier to clean than others, too, with unobtrusive and quiet operation that rarely goes above a light trickle. If you can gather up to four friends, family members, or trusted strangers to play a board game, Pandemic is great. It's challenging for sure — I've only ever "won" the game once in a two-player game after an hour of theory crafting with my friend — but super fun. You and your team cooperate to stop the spread of a global pandemic, each operating in different roles with unique abilities. If you're on the go a lot this summer and packing lots of cotton and linen, you won't want to go far without the Nori Press. This compact travel iron looks like an oversized hair straightener, and it's designed to iron and steam your shirts in one go. It weighs just 1.5 pounds and won't take up much space in a carry-on. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. The first time I used this product, my hair was in dire condition: dry, dull, and frizzy from repeated bleaching and heat styling. After just one application, I could already see a dramatic difference, and it cemented itself as one of the best hair oils I'd tried. It'll usually run you over $50, but, ending soon for Prime Day, it's discounted by 20% for the first time in a while. Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can. I've been using this sunscreen on my runs for years. While I'm happy to use a simple spray-on sunscreen on the rest of my body, I prefer something gentler on my face and chest. It's heavy-duty SPF 70+, without a heavy-duty feel, so I feel protected when I'm outside but not bogged down by an oily paste. Perhaps most importantly, it resists wearing off from sweat — something that I definitely put to the test every summer. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit. The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying. The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it. I really love Megababe's Thigh Rescue, not only because it really does work, but I also appreciate how much founder Katie Sturino has done to de-stigmatize the things that happen to normal bodies, like thigh chafing. This jumbo-size stick should last all summer, and makes me feel (a little) better about leaving the house in the heat. Mega Thigh Rescue is almost never on sale, so even if you already have a stick, this 20% discount is an incredible opportunity to stock up while saving some money. If you're just looking to try it out, the smaller, regular-sized stick is also 20% off. For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year. Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine. I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. Seriously, I never thought I would get so much use out of a pair of sunglasses that are under $20, but these are my go-to. Right now, for Prime Day, the Sojos are 20% off in a handful of different colorways. Mission cooling hats are incredibly effective at regulating my body temperature when I'm outside on hot days. We break down more of this hat's features in our review, but overall, it's a game-changer for beating the summer heat. Seriously, I never thought I would get so much use out of a pair of sunglasses that are under $20, but these are my go-to. Right now, for Prime Day, the Sojos are 20% off in a handful of different colorways. The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks. A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. [Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day. One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested. The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. I can honestly say the Hulken is a delight to schlep. Though, as we rave in our review, the Hulkens are well worth full price, you can save 20% on the smallest size now from Amazon. The bag is almost never on sale, making this discount a can't-miss opportunity. Away's luggage has received a lot of hype, and for good reason: the premium designs and smart organization result in a smooth experience for travelers. In our review, we love how it simplifies packing and praise its value compared to pricier brands. A couple of different colors are $55 off on Amazon, which is better than deals we've seen for The Carry-On during different seasons. These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures. These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price. Teeth whitening kits can be hit or miss, but this one from Crest has yet to disappoint us, making it our top teeth whitening kit overall. Unlike others that can cause irritation and tooth pain, these whitening strips contain a lower amount of hydrogen peroxide that makes them suitable for people with sensitive teeth. The IO system has an indicator light that lets you know whether you're applying too much or too little pressure while cleaning your teeth and has a two-minute brush timer — all to set up healthier habits. If there's one product I always make a point of checking during Prime Day, it's the endlessly praised and rarely on sale Dyson Airwrap. The Airwrap makes it a breeze to give yourself a salon-quality blowout at home, and is designed to prevent the unwanted heat damage you might experience from other similar tools. With three airflow settings and heat speeds, you have maximum control. If years of heat styling or color have left your hair dry and brittle, look no further than this luxurious moisture mask at an affordable price. This mask is also free of harmful sulfates, parabens, and other irritants that can damage your hair over time. Pimple patches have become a viral sensation for their effectiveness, even becoming a sort of fashion statement among some wearers who opt for brightly-colored stickers. The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch may not be the first, but it's a fan favorite — we praise it for working better than other brands in our review. Luckily, a 36-count of patches isn't too expensive at full price, but if you're going to buy them anyway, why not get them with a sweet 20% discount? Sales for Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patches come up often, but it's rare that they go this low. At less than $6, there's little reason not to try out this cute lip color; that's why I got myself a bottle last Prime Day. The Peripera Ink the Velvet Lip Tint is super pigmented and buttery to apply with a satin or matte finish (depending on which you buy), rivalling pricier lip colors. Not all of the colors are the same price, but if your shade is on sale, I'd recommend jumping on it. Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday. Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise. This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later. The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand. We highlight products and services you might find interesting. We may receive products free of charge from manufacturers to test.</p>

Lionsgate Studios in Yonkers, New York.

Legendary Entertainment LLC, the independent film and TV studio behind the Dune trilogy and A Minecraft Movie, is considering a takeover of Lionsgate Studios Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. 

Legendary, which is backed by Apollo Global Management, first approached the company after Lionsgate finalized its separation from the Starz Entertainment Corp. TV network and streaming service in May, said the people, who asked not be named as the information is private. Those talks centered on a potential partnership to produce a handful of films so that Legendary could gauge how the companies worked together and whether it should ultimately proceed with a takeover offer, the people said.</p>

Asia's oldest stock exchange was preparing to celebrate its 150th anniversary when a storm of bad news upended the festivities. 

On Monday, a report revealed deepening losses in equity derivatives among India's retail traders, fueling concerns that the Securities and Exchange Board of India may impose tighter curbs. Just days earlier, the regulator barred Jane Street Group from dealing in local markets, alleging the trading giant manipulated prices to make billions of dollars at the expense of small investors — charges the US firm has denied. </p>
