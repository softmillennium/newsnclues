            Man's best (super)friend has prime placement in the new “Superman” movie, and the pooch's path to the cinematic spotlight may be worth a movie itself.
    


            Krypto is a CGI flying white mutt who dons a red cape to match the Man of Steel's. The unruly dog – who first appeared in DC Comics way back in 1955 – comes in handy at several pivotal moments throughout the movie, in spite his lack of obedience and training.
    


            Here are the most surprising and sweet things to know about the furry scene stealer.
    


            The film's director James Gunn previously announced that Krypto would be inspired by his real-life rescue dog, Ozu. More recently, Gunn told The New York Times that his greyish pup  became the physical model for the computer-generated super-pet. The process, which Gunn said Ozu “despised,” required the dog to perch on a table surrounded by cameras capturing angles of him from all sides to create a 3D image.
    


            Gunn said he worked with three visual effects companies to develop and fine-tune Krypto, including a team that created Rocket Raccoon from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films. He also used his own personal pet videos of Ozu playing with his cat as the basis for some of Krypto's movements onscreen.
    


            “I have tons of videos of them playing,” the director told the Times. “In fact, when Krypto is jumping on Superman at the beginning of the movie, that's all based on footage of him playing with my cat.”
    


            Ozu “came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs & never knew human beings,” Gunn shared in a social media post. The director said at first his dog “was problematic to say the least.”
    


            “He immediately came in & destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture - he even ate my laptop,” Gunn wrote. “It took a long time before he would even let us touch him.”
    


            He also wrote that he had adopted Ozu shortly after he had started writing the script for “Superman,” which was how the dog made its way into the story.

            “I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?' - and thus Krypto came into the script & changed the shape of the story as Ozu was changing my life,” Gunn wrote in his post.
    


            Krypto maintains the decidedly unruly nature of the dog upon which he is based, a funny foil to Superman's (played by David Corenswet) kind and composed comportment.
    


             In the end, the “not-so-good-good-boy” – as Gunn described him – truly earns the distinction of superhero in his own right.
    


            Toward the end of the film, we learn that Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El – yes, Supergirl, as played by “Sirens” star Milly Alcock – is the actual owner of the Krypto. In the movie, Supergirl is a bit of a party girl who asked her cousin to watch over her dog while she was off catching a buzz in outer space.
    


            But it seems both she and her beloved pet will be back, since Alcock is slated to star in a feature-length “Supergirl” film out next year. The movie is currently listed as being in post production on IMDb.
    


“Superman” is in theaters now. The film is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN's parent company.

            Rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has only played five MLB games. But in that short time, the Milwaukee Brewers starlet has produced such impressive performances that he was named a National League All-Star on Friday, an honor he achieved after the fewest MLB games ever.
    


            The 23-year-old was named as a replacement for the Chicago Cubs' Matthew Boyd, who will be inactive since he is expected to start on Saturday against the New York Yankees ahead of Tuesday's All-Star Game.
    


            Wielding a fastball that has reached speeds as high as 103 mph (166 kph), Misiorowski has long been tipped for All Star honors – the only surprise, perhaps, is just how quickly he achieved that.
    


            He only began his MLB career last month, with a streak of 11 no-hit innings, more than any other starter has managed at the start of their career since baseball's modern era began in 1900.
    


            On his five starts for Minnesota, he has gone 4-1 with a 2.81 ERA. He has averaged 99.3 mph (160 kph) on his fastball, with 89 pitches reaching 100 mph (161 kph).

            Still, Misiorowski said the call-up left him “speechless,” per MLB. Brewers manager Pat Murphy told him just three minutes before he lined up for the national anthem ahead of their 8-3 win over the Washington Nationals on Friday but told him to keep it a secret.
    


            Murphy then announced the news to the entire Brewers team after the game before an emotional Misiorowski addressed his teammates.
    


            “I honestly have no words guys,” he said. “I don't know what to say. It's an honor and, you know, there's a lot of older guys around that have been around for a lot longer than I have so I just wanted to say thank you for all the help you guys have given me to get through these couple of weeks I've been here, it's been huge.”
    


            Misiorowski's selection comes just a year after the Pittsburgh Pirates' Paul Skenes made history by earning All-Star honors 11 games into his MLB career. Before Skenes, three players reached All-Star selection after 13 games – Mark Fidrych in 1976, Hideo Nomo in 1995 and Dontrelle Willis in 2003.
    


            Elsewhere, Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh took his season total of home runs to 38, breaking the American League record and putting him just one shy of Barry Bonds' MLB record for the most homers hit before the All-Star break.
    


            He hit two home runs on Friday – the second of which was a grand slam – propelling the Mariners to a 12-3 win over the Detroit Tigers.
    


            “Trying to go hit home runs is probably not going to help me,” he said afterward. “I'm going to do my best to stay within myself.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","From sleeping on a golf course to turning pro: How Issa Nlareb rediscovered his love of the game after illness","https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/12/sport/issa-nlareb-paragolf-journey-intl-spt","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            Watching Issa Nlareb's swing, you'd never know he didn't take a golf lesson until five years after turning professional. For 13 years, observing others and reading two-time major champion Greg Norman's book were the closest things the Cameroonian had to formal instruction.
    


            Nlareb was just 11 years old when his mom died. Living on the streets near a golf course, he began collecting balls to earn money to survive, eventually picking up the game himself and becoming a caddie. However, his life dramatically changed in 2018 when he contracted bacterial meningitis while at a tournament in Egypt.
    


            The golfer developed sepsis, fell into a coma and required the amputation of both legs and most of his fingers. He wasn't sure he'd ever play the sport again.
    


            Life has thrown a lot of challenges Nlareb's way in his 34 years, yet while speaking to CNN Sports, he's as laid-back and confident as ever, believing he can be one of the top disabled golfers in the world.
    


            Nlareb lived with his dad and stepmom in a house near Yaoundé Golf Club in Cameroon's capital after his mother's death, leaving school and taking care of four step-siblings before running away from home a year later.
    


            Eleven years old, “pissed off” at the situation and living on the streets, most nights he was picked up by the police and brought in to sleep in the station. One evening, though, he ran.
    


            “I hid myself in the golf course. When I stand up in the morning in the golf course, I was looking around me and I found a golf ball. And I took two golf balls, I went out, and I see the golf course. When I see the golf course, I was like, ‘Wow,'” Nlareb said.
    


            Impressed by the scale and grandeur of the course and thinking the balls belonged to the players on the hole, he washed and offered them to the men. They gave him a dollar in return.
    


            “That was my first contact with golf,” Nlareb said.
    


            With no school, he spent a lot of his time watching the players at Yaoundé Golf Club﻿, thinking about how the players could improve their shots. He visualized this all without owning a club or having played a round.
    


            There was one man – who Nlareb recalls as “Mr. Davou” – who attempted the same shot day after day on the 13th hole.
    


            “There's out of bounds to the right, water in front of the green and behind the green. So, the guy was trying to go over the water every time and he lost some balls,” Nlareb said, smiling at the memory. “I was laughing, and he say, ‘Stop laughing. What can you do in this position?'”
    


            Despite never having swung a club, the 11-year-old had been learning the game since earning that first dollar and decided to offer some wisdom: “I say, ‘You got to play to the left, and you come back right to play the green.' And he said, ‘Come, we make a challenge.'”
    


            Davou handed him a three iron – not an easy club for even a more seasoned golfer. But Nlareb was up for the challenge and made it onto the green following the path he advised Davou to take. His success earned him his first golf club – that hard-to-hit three iron.
    


            Nlareb continued collecting and cleaning balls, practicing with his iron and developed friendships with the golfers. He often helped players aim shots and find their balls on the hilly course.
    


            All that time, he was on his own from age 11 to 17; no family, no school, just the money he could earn at markets and on the course. It was only once an aunt learned of his whereabouts and that he hadn't heard from his father in six years that Nlareb returned home and went back to school to take his caddie exams.
    


            “I was playing golf when I was 12, but I was not playing the regular golf like stroke play, 18 holes. No, I was playing three holes, one hole, half a hole sometimes,” Nlareb remembered.
    


            Caddying at Yaoundé Golf Club allowed him to play complete rounds once a week – usually Mondays after events finished for the day. Things soon accelerated after that.
    


            “After a year, I was number one of the caddies,” Nlareb said. “So, I turned pro in 2009 in Yaoundé.” He didn't buy his first set of clubs until after turning professional.
    


            “My dream was to be the best player in the world, but my other was to beat Tiger Woods,” Nlareb said. “(But) I realized that there's a big difference between the course Tiger Woods is playing and the course I play. … So, I (got) my first golf lesson when I was 24 (in 2015),” Nlareb told CNN Sports.
    


            After more than five years competing on African tours, Nlareb set goals for himself to slowly work toward those dreams. In 2015, he decided to try his hand at qualifying for the third division circuit in Europe, the Alps Tour. He had three young children and, with two quick wins at the Gabon and Senegal Opens, was at the peak of his career and personal life up to that point. That is until he fell ill at the Ein Bay Open in Egypt in February 2018.
    


            He awoke from a five-day coma to learn he had contracted bacterial meningitis and had developed septic shock. A terrified Nlareb was told he needed to have both legs above the knee and both arms above the elbow amputated.
    


            “I refused because I was so afraid,” Nlareb said. “I say, ‘Why?' and I say, ‘No, no, no, don't do that. Leave me dead.'”
    


            The fear was all-encompassing: Nlareb couldn't imagine a life with no arms or legs. He waited a month until his visa in Egypt ended and transferred to a Cameroonian hospital. There, he once again heard a prognosis he wasn't ready to accept.
    


            His stepmother was working in Belgium at the time and called local hospitals to see if they would take Nlareb's case. He flew to Brussels where his latest doctor sat him down and explained amputation was his only viable option, although things had slightly improved.
    


            “He wrote everything (down for) me. He showed me. And I (saw) that difference between the last two months where I would get to be amputated and where I would be amputated right now.”
    


            Three months after waking from his coma, Nlareb underwent an operation and had both legs below the knee and most of his fingers amputated.
    


            In his recovery process, the doctor explained the importance of taking things slow – starting with just 30 minutes a day of getting used to his prosthetics and building up from there. However, after a further three months in isolation to rebuild his immune system, he was eager to establish his new normal as soon as possible.
    


            “When they put me in the prosthetics, I walked all day long. But it was a big mistake,” he remembered. “I wore off my skin. I was not able anymore to put the prosthetics on my feet.
    


            “There'd be pain for me. I was tight in my heart. I cry.”
    


            Nlareb refused to think about golf after his amputations: “I forget about golf. I give up.” He went “back (to Cameroon) to take care of my family, enjoy my life,” adding that he didn't “want to play anymore golf because I was so sad.”
    


            However, his friends had other plans. They forced him back onto a course a couple of months post-surgery to help his physical and mental recovery.
    


            His first swing back on the course went “50 meters (55 yards) with one hand.”
    


            For the 6-foot-4-inch Nlareb, who was used to crushing his drives well over 200 yards before his illness, it was a difficult thing to take.
    


            It was at that point that he turned his focus to teaching. He went to school for two years to grow and develop as a golf teaching professional and began coaching a team in Cameroon: “I learned how to share my passion with people.”
    


            However, a tournament at the end of 2019 left him fuming. “They played so bad. … I was so pissed off,” Nlareb said. “How'd they do that? Even me, (hitting) 50 meters, I can make bogey in the hole. How can they play so bad?”
    


            Angry and disappointed, he didn't expect his then five-year-old daughter to find the solution.
    


            “She smiled and said, ‘Dad, you need to play golf,'” Nlareb recalled. His daughter suggested wrapping a strap around his hands and club to give him the power and grip to swing with two hands again.
    


            “It was eight o'clock – in Cameroon, night comes at seven – I was like, ‘Why don't you come with (me) and we run and go directly to golf?'” The father and daughter spent all night at the course.
    


            In 2019, Nlareb returned to the pro game via the African Golf Tour. Two years later, now residing in France, he made a remarkable comeback, making the cut in the very Alps Tour tournament he contracted meningitis three years earlier.
    


            The World Golf rankings for people with disabilities was created in 2019, a year after Nlareb's illness and amputations, while the Golf for the Disabled (G4D) Tour didn't launch until February 2022. Disability golf events are still in their infancy.
    


            Last year, Nlareb played in the third annual US Adaptive Open – his first time visiting the United States – where he won the multiple limb amputee category and placed fourth overall for men. He won the same category and finished tied for seventh overall this year.
    


            What did he earn for twice winning his category and two top-10 finishes? Nothing.
    


            “There is not currently a purse for the U.S. Adaptive Open,” the USGA confirmed in an email to CNN Sports. “We announced recently that Deloitte will provide financial support in the form of travel-related expense reimbursements to all players in the field this year, and we are incredibly excited about that.”
    


            Nlareb estimated it would have cost $10,000 to take part in the US Adaptive Open if he didn't have sponsors and hadn't received an exemption into the tournament due to his result at last summer's edition.
    


            “You pay for your flight ticket. You pay your reservation hotel, your car, and you pay your entry fee,” the eighth-ranked player in the World Ranking for Golfers with Disability said.
    


            And he's lucky in that he's received free prosthetics since 2021 after meeting with Alain Montean, the then-president of a prosthetics company. Without these, Nlareb estimated it would cost him $50,000 every two years to replace.
    


            The exposure gained from the US Adaptive Open is significant, but paying thousands for events is not sustainable. Nlareb needs to play more golf to gain a following, but he can't play tournaments without sponsors and external funding. It's a vicious cycle that's hard to see a way out of.
    


            “I know I have good level, but it's not that easy without a sponsor because it's very expensive,” Nlareb said. “Just to register in the event it's very expensive. Today, I'm a dad of three and it's not easy for me to take care of my children and to play my golf.”
    


            “It's a big event. … So to be there, I'm coming close to my dream because from there, the world can know about my story,” the 34-year-old told CNN Sports. “I need the support. I need the help. And I got a good game. I live for golf. I can't live without golf. Golf is my life.”

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has not been able to pass an amendment that would expand its powers regarding investigations of world leaders over crimes of aggression.

A crime of aggression is considered the most serious offense under the Rome Statute, which established the court. Currently, the ICC can prosecute heads of state over war crimes and genocide, but in order for it to launch proceedings over the crime of aggression, the Kampala amendments of 2010, which define the body's jurisdiction in the area, must be ratified by all sides of a conflict. So far, they have been backed by just 41 of the 125 members of the court.

The ICC held a special session at the UN headquarters in New York from Monday to Wednesday to decide on the harmonization amendment, which was proposed by Germany, Costa Rica, Slovenia, Sierra Leone, and Vanuatu. It calls for the court to be allowed to initiate crime of aggression investigations if at least one of the warring parties has backed the Kampala amendments.

However, members of the court have not been able to find common ground on the issue, with the UK, Canada, France, Japan, and New Zealand insisting that the final decision should be made after at least two-thirds of ICC participants have ratified the Kampala changes.

A French representative argued during the session that the harmonization amendment raises potential contradictions with the UN Charter, while his Nigerian counterpart warned that it could create a system in which ratifying states might “paradoxically be more exposed to legal risks.”

As a result of the meeting, it was decided that the ICC members will hold another special session on the matter in 2029.

“When we talk of the crime of aggression, we are looking at a steeplechase, where we have to run and where the obstacles only increase, and the victims of the crime of aggression are asked to wait in the meantime,” a Palestinian representative told the gathering on the final day.

In 2024, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over war crimes allegedly committed by his country during the military operation in Gaza, including using starvation as a method of warfare. Israel, which is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, responded by accusing the court of being “a political tool serving Israel's enemies.”

Earlier this year, the US sanctioned the ICC's top prosecutor, Karim Khan, and several judges for what it called “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin is also wanted by the court on accusations of unlawfully deporting children from the war zone in the Ukraine conflict. Moscow rejected the charges as “null and void,” insisting that the children were evacuated for their safety until they were able to be returned to their families. Russia, which is not a member of the ICC, maintains that the body has no jurisdiction over it.

US President Donald Trump continues to regard Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky as the main hurdle to resolving the conflict, despite his recent criticism of Moscow, the Financial Times reported on Saturday, citing sources.

Speaking to journalists on Tuesday, Trump said he was “unhappy” with Putin, claiming the Russian leader did not want to end the conflict. “We get a lot of bullsh*t thrown at us by Putin,” Trump said. The US president added that while Putin was “very nice all the time,” it turned out to be “meaningless” for ending the fighting.

Later, he announced a “major statement” on Russia soon amid reported discussions in Washington over imposing a 500% tariff on countries that buy Russian energy and goods.

However, two unnamed senior officials involved in defense and security talks with Washington told the FT that there was little indication the White House had actually adopted a more pro-Kiev stance.

Ukraine's backers, the report said, are “still assuming Trump was predisposed to seeing Putin as his main negotiating partner in any settlement and Zelensky as the primary obstacle to a workable peace deal.”

One official pointed to “a little bit of overexcitement based on a shift in tone,” while cautioning that “we're not seeing that translate into major actions.”

The FT report echoes a New York Times article in June claiming that the US president is “exasperated” with both Putin and Zelensky, but “reserves special animosity” for the Ukrainian leader, viewing him as a “bad guy” pushing the world towards a global conflict.

In May, Trump openly criticized Zelensky, suggesting that “everything out of his mouth causes problems.” The fiercest public clash between the two came in February at the White House, when Trump accused Zelensky of ingratitude and “gambling with World War III.”

Commenting on Trump's remarks targeting Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is “calm about this,” adding that “we are committed to continuing our dialogue with Washington and our policy of repairing the significantly damaged bilateral relations.”

Russia maintains it is open to a diplomatic settlement of the Ukraine conflict, but in a way that would address its “root causes” and its security concerns. Moscow insists on Ukraine's neutrality, recognition of the “territorial reality on the ground,” as well as demilitarization and denazification.

ANKARA, July 12. /TASS/. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that the 47-year era of terrorism in the republic has effectively ended following the formal disarmament ceremony held by Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants on Friday.

""The terrorist organization [PKK] had previously declared its decision to dissolve itself. As part of this decision, it took a step forward and laid down its arms in a ceremony held in Northern Iraq on Friday,"" Erdogan said, addressing members of the ruling Justice and Development Party.

LONDON, July 12. /TASS/. Ukraine's Western allies believe that US President Donald Trump is predisposed to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as his negotiating partner, and Vladimir Zelensky as the main obstacle to peace, the Financial Times reported citing sources.

""There's a little bit of overexcitement based on a shift in tone,"" said one of the officials. ""But we're not seeing that translate into major actions.""

The sources said that the American Patriot complexes are crucial for the protection of Ukraine, but they will not affect its ability to strike back and will not change the overall dynamics of the conflict as a whole.

Earlier, Zelensky said that the US arms supplies to Ukraine had resumed.

On July 2, the New York Times reported that Washington would suspend supplies to Kiev of missiles for Patriot anti-aircraft systems, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, Stinger man-portable air defense systems and a number of other weapons. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned John Ginkel, charge d'affaires of the United States in Kiev, while Zelensky noted that Europe was not able to replace American supplies.

On July 3, Trump said that Washington continues to provide military assistance to Kiev, adding that the United States itself needs weapons.

On July 7, Trump actually resumed arms and military equipment supplies to Ukraine. On June 10, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the supply of American weapons continues under a schedule agreed between the Washington administration and Congress.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

""Our Korean friends confirmed their firm support for all the objectives of the special military operation, as well as for the actions of the Russian leadership and armed forces. In turn, we once again expressed our sincere gratitude for the contribution of Korean People's Army servicemen to the successful liberation of the Kursk Region from Ukrainian Nazis and foreign mercenaries,"" Lavrov added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The three Cambodian sites' inscription coincides with the 50th anniversary of the rise to power of the brutal regime

Three locations used by Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime as torture and execution sites 50 years ago have been added by Unesco to its world heritage list.

The three locations were inscribed to the list by the UN cultural agency on Friday during the 47th session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris.

The inscription coincided with the 50th anniversary of the rise to power by the communist Khmer Rouge government, which caused the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians through starvation, torture and mass executions during a four-year reign from 1975 to 1979.

Unesco's world heritage list lists sites considered important to humanity and includes the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India and Cambodia's Angkor archaeological complex.

The three sites listed on Friday include two notorious prisons and an execution site immortalised in the Hollywood film The Killing Fields.

The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, located in the capital Phnom Penh, is the site of a former high school used by the Khmer Rouge as a notorious prison, better known as S-21. About 15,000 people were imprisoned and tortured there.

The M-13 prison, located in rural Kampong Chhnang province in central Cambodia, also was regarded as one of the main prisons of the early Khmer Rouge.

Choeung Ek, located about 15km (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The story of the atrocities committed there are the focus of 1984's The Killing Fields, based on the experiences of New York Times photojournalist Dith Pran and correspondent Sydney Schanberg.

The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 and immediately herded almost all the city's residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighbouring Vietnam.

Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Manet, issued a message on Friday directing people to beat drums simultaneously across the country on Sunday morning to mark the Unesco listing.

“May this inscription serve as a lasting reminder that peace must always be defended,” Hun Manet said in a video message posted online. “From the darkest chapters of history, we can draw strength to build a better future for humanity.”

Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, said the country was “still grappling with the painful legacies of genocide, torture and mass atrocity”. But naming the three sites to the Unesco list will play a role in educating younger generations of Cambodians and others worldwide.

“Though they were the landscape of violence, they too will and can contribute to heal the wounds inflicted during that era that have yet to heal,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President says Kyiv ‘preparing new European defence packages'; Ukraine says its drones hit fighter aircraft plant and missile production facility inside Russia. What we know on day 1,235

Read all our Ukraine war coverage

The US has resumed military supplies to Ukraine and senior officials in Kyiv will work on military cooperation next week with Washington's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Friday. He restated that Ukraine had received high-level signals from Washington and its other western allies that arms supplies, paused for a time last week, had now resumed. “We are currently working with partners on new supplies, increased weapons production in Ukraine and better support for our army,” he said. “Next week, we will continue working with the US side on a military level … We are also preparing new European defence packages.” Kellogg, interviewed by the Ukrainian media outlet Novyny.LIVE while attending a conference about Ukraine in Rome, said: “We'll be in Kyiv Monday. We'll be there all week.”

Donald Trump confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine, Andrew Roth writes. During an interview with NBC News, the US president said: “So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons.” He added: “I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

The EU's top diplomat has said the 27-nation bloc was pondering a new raft of sanctions against Moscow. “Russia has increased its attacks against civilians to really cause as much pain … and that's unacceptable,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said. Brussels was considering an 18th round of sanctions against Moscow and “we are also still in negotiations to put the oil price cap on, that would deprive Russia from the means to fund this war”, she told AFP.

Kallas said she was assured by Laos's top diplomat that Vientiane had “no intention or willingness” to send military help to Russia, following claims that Moscow was planning to involve military personnel from Laos to bolster its efforts in Ukraine. “I also expressed that it has consequences for European aid to Laos if something like this is happening,” Kallas said. “If you [Laos] contribute to that existential threat, we can't have good cooperation,” she warned.

Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks killed three people in Russia on Friday. Russian air defence systems intercepted 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow said. There was one dead in Russia's Lipetsk region and another was killed in the western Tula region from the drone attacks, local officials said. Ukrainian shelling later killed another civilian in the border region of Belgorod, the governor announced. The Russian defence ministry said out of the 155 downed Ukrainian drones, 11 were bound for Moscow.

Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region, causing explosions and fires at both. Ukraine's military said on Telegram the aviation facility in the town of Lukhovitsy, about 135km (84 miles) south-east of Moscow, produced MiG fighters. The other site was the Instrument Design Bureau, which specialised in producing anti-aircraft missiles and missile-gun systems, it said. “Defence forces continue to take all steps to undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian occupiers,” the military said.

Russian bombardments on eastern Ukraine overnight on Friday forced the evacuation of a maternity centre in Kharkiv and wounded nine people. Zelenskyy said a medical facility was hit in the attack on the country's second-largest city. “Among the wounded are women in a maternity hospital – mothers with newborns, women recovering from surgery,” he wrote on social media. “Fortunately, no children were injured.” He added that several other regions were attacked overnight.

Nato will need more long-range missiles in its arsenal to deter Russia from attacking Europe because Moscow is expected to increase production of long-range weapons, a US army general told Reuters. “The Russian army is bigger today than it was when they started the war in Ukraine,” Maj Gen John Rafferty said at a US military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. “And we know that they're going to continue to invest in long-range rockets and missiles and sophisticated air defences. So more alliance capability is really, really important.”

The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that wartime censorship in Russia is justified amid the conflict with Ukraine and the closure of opposition-minded media. Speaking to Russian magazine Expert, Peskov said that many media outlets have been closed, while some reporters have left the country in the past three years. “But don't forget the situation we are in. Now is the time of military censorship, unprecedented for our country. After all, the war is going on in the information space too,” Peskov told the magazine. Russian authorities also blocked X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. “It would be wrong to turn a blind eye to the media that are deliberately engaged in discrediting Russia,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Resident doctors have voted to strike over pay but how much has their real-terms earnings changed since 2008?

Resident doctors in England have voted to strike for five days from 25 July, reigniting one of the NHS's most bitter industrial disputes.

At the heart of the row is pay: the British Medical Association (BMA) says resident (formerly known as junior) doctors have seen their real earnings fall by more than a quarter since 2008. The government says the union's demands are unaffordable, and they've already received generous rises in recent years.

So are strikes an “unnecessary and unreasonable” move, in the words of the health secretary, Wes Streeting? Or a necessary step on the path to restore doctor's pay?

After the global financial crisis of 2007-08, pay stagnated across the board in Britain. But resident doctors have had it worse than most. The average private sector worker now earns 7.5% more than they did in August 2010, when taking into account inflation (including housing costs and council tax rises). However, resident doctors' pay was still down 10.2% as of March this year.

An average pay rise of 5.4% was awarded for this year, which will start appearing in wage slips next month. But even with that uplift, pay will still be below 2010 levels.

Resident doctors are fully qualified in medicine but still undergoing postgraduate training. Their pathway starts with foundation training, before moving on to core training in a broad area, and then into training in a specific specialty of medicine, for example surgery.

They aren't the only NHS workers who have seen their pay cut in real terms. Recent pay rises for residents means that consultants and nurses have seen proportionally larger cuts than some training levels – though different training levels have seen different cuts in their real-terms pay over the years.

The BMA has said that real-terms pay for resident doctors has fallen by nearly 21% in the past 17 years – but their calculations use a measure of inflation called RPI. RPI is considered an outdated measure of inflation, and statisticians avoid using it. The government prefers a newer measure called CPI (the charts above use a similar measure – CPIH – which takes into account rising prices, as well as housing and council tax costs).

RPI is generally higher than CPI – giving the unions a larger pay cut figure than government estimates. However, the government can't take the moral high ground here – it still uses RPI for several official calculations, including when calculating interest on the student loans that most resident doctors will be paying back each month.

The chart below shows how using different measures of inflation, as well as different dates of comparison, can benefit either side in negotiations.

It's impossible to compare the salary of resident doctors to other countries because different healthcare systems involve different training programmes. Pensions and other work benefits also differ between countries. There is some limited data comparing the pay of medical specialists – which includes consultants – but some countries such as the US and Australia are missing data for salaried professionals.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had a go at comparing specialist doctor pay across countries – with the year 2020 being the latest estimates that included England. The figure shows that England is near the top of the pack (after taking into account how much things cost in different countries), but several countries including Germany and Ireland paid more.

The figures line up with separate OECD data showing that the NHS has a relatively high rate of doctors moving abroad, with at least one in 10 UK-trained doctors practising abroad in the last five years. The BMA chair, Tom Dolphin, has said pay rises would help keep this figure down.

Which countries are these UK-trained doctors going to? Figures from the General Medical Council found Australia was the most common destination for doctors leaving to practise outside the UK in 2023, followed by New Zealand, Ireland and Canada. However, the NHS is good at recruiting from overseas to replace leavers – 42% of doctors in the English NHS had a primary medical qualification from another country in 2023.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki called upon President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 11 to allow full-scale exhumations of Polish victims of the Volyn massacres, according to RMF24, even as the long-stalled process had already resumed in April.

The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) members killed at least tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

Speaking at a ceremony in the eastern Polish city of Chelm marking the 82nd anniversary of the massacres, Nawrocki said the victims ""do not cry out for revenge, but for a cross, a grave, and memory,"" and urged Ukraine to authorize further work across multiple sites. 

""Poles are waiting for this truth,"" Nawrocki said, according to Polish news outlet RMF24.

Nawrocki's remarks follow the restart of exhumations in April at the destroyed village of Puzhnyky in Ukraine's Ternopil Oblast. It was the first such effort since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium after a wave of vandalism targeting Ukrainian memorials in Poland.

Ukrainian and Polish officials have since announced additional exhumations of Polish soldiers killed during World War II in Zboiska and the nearby district of Pid Holoskom in Lviv Oblast in June.

Nawrocki emphasized his moral obligation to speak for the victims. A historian by profession, the Polish president-elect has long argued that Ukraine should not be allowed into the EU before the Volyn issue is resolved, a view shared by other Polish politicians across the political spectrum.

""As the future president of Poland, I am obliged to speak with their voice. No one will release me from this,"" he said. The ceremony in Chelm also marked the planned construction of a new museum to commemorate those killed.

Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar, who attended the event, reportedly voiced support for further dialogue and acknowledged the importance of honoring victims on both sides of the historical divide. 

""We need to talk about this history openly,"" he said. ""Of course, to call the crime a crime. Apologize and apologize, but also honor the memory of those victims who need it, on both sides of the border.""

Current Polish President Andrzej Duda recently signed legislation establishing July 11 as the National Day of Remembrance for Polish victims of the Volyn massacres. The law was passed with near-unanimous parliamentary support and declares that the ""atrocities committed between 1939 and 1946"" must remain in Poland's national memory.

Poland's Institute of National Remembrance estimates that some 100,000 Poles were killed in the Volyn region, now part of western Ukraine. Ukrainian historians argue that thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliatory actions and insist that the conflict be viewed as mutual ethnic violence rather than genocide.

The first exhumation since 2017, at Puzhnyky, where 50 to 120 Poles were killed, was seen as a breakthrough, with both governments pledging to expand joint efforts.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

At least two people were killed and 28 injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a mass attack against Ukraine for the second night in a row, rocking Ukraine's capital and cities far from the front lines overnight on July 10.

Throughout late spring and early summer 2025, Russia has ramped up aggression against Ukraine with a series of record-breaking mass strikes. The night of July 10 saw yet another wave of aerial terror from Moscow.

At around 1:15 a.m. local time, Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground began reporting explosions in the capital and the buzzing of Shahed-type drones. Reporters said large numbers of drones were flying over the Pechersk neighborhood, a historical district in the city center. 

Later in the night, reporters said they heard several dozen explosions and the distinctive sound of ballistic missiles. At least an hour of near-constant explosions rolled through the city. 

Blast waves also set off car alarms throughout Kyiv, adding to the roar of drones, ballistic missiles, and air defense fire. Air raid alerts ended at approximately 7 a.m. in Kyiv Oblast.

Ukraine's Air Force issued multiple alerts overnight, warning that groups of Russian drones were targeting regions throughout the country, including the far-western Ternopil and Rivne oblasts.

The attack caused fires at apartment buildings in Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi and Darnytskyi districts, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. Gas stations and garages are also in flames, he said, and medics have been dispatched to the scene.

Two people were killed in the Russian attack, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported. Both fatalities were women – a 68-year-old resident and a 22-year-old police officer, the Interior Ministry said.

At least 28 people have been injured, with at least 10 hospitalized, local authorities reported, adding that some of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds. Among the injured are two children, Tkachenko said.

In the Podilskyi district, a primary healthcare center ""was almost completely destroyed"" in the Russian attack, Klitchsko later reported.

The attack damaged the studio of the Kanal 5 television channel, owned by former President Petro Poroshenko. While no employees were injured, filming equipment sustained damage, causing a temporary disruption to broadcasting.

It remains unclear whether Russia targeted or hit any military or other strategic targets in the attack, as Ukrainian authorities largely do not disclose such information for security reasons. This makes the full extent of casualties and damage impossible to verify.

Russian forces launched 397 drones against Ukraine overnight, with almost 200 of them being Shahed-type kamikaze drones and the rest decoys used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, according to the Air Force.

Russia also fired eight Iskander-M ballistic missiles, six Kh-101 cruise missiles, and four S-300 guided air defense missiles, targeting primarily Kyiv, the statement read.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 164 Shahed-type drones, eight Iskander-M missiles, and six Kh-101 missiles. Some 204 drones and missiles reportedly disappeared from radars or were intercepted by electronic warfare.

""This is a clear escalation of terror by Russia — hundreds of 'Shaheds' every night, constant strikes, and massive attacks on Ukrainian cities,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

""Today, I will be speaking with partners — in particular within the Coalition of the Willing — about additional funding for the production of interceptor drones and the supply of air defense systems for Ukraine.""

Meanwhile, in Kherson, two people were injured by drone strikes during the countrywide mass assault overnight on July 10.

""A 63-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man were hit. They suffered blast injuries and multiple shrapnel wounds. The victims were hospitalized in moderate condition,"" the Kherson City Military Administration said in a Telegram post.

Another four were injured by Russian artillery fire in Kherson late on July 9.

The night before, Russia slammed Ukraine with its largest missile and drone attack since the start of the full-scale war, targeting the western city of Lutsk with its heaviest barrage. 



Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich.

Norway will provide Ukraine with 25 million Norwegian krone ($2.5 million) to support the country's cybersecurity defenses by the end of 2025, Ukraine's Digital Transformation Ministry announced on July 11.

Norway's new commitment for Ukraine comes as Oslo announced it has become the 12th country to join the Tallinn Mechanism on cybersecurity to help protect Ukraine against cyber threats.

""The Tallinn Mechanism is a key instrument of international support that helps Ukraine resist these attacks while building long-term digital resilience,"" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement, as Oslo announced it's participation in the international mechanism during the final day of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

Ukraine and 10 partner countries established the Tallinn mechanism in December 2023, with the aim of coordinating civilian cyber capacities to strengthen Ukraine's defense in cyberspace and long-term resilience.

""Norway's accession to the Tallinn Mechanism is a powerful political gesture of support for Ukraine and a signal of the democratic world's readiness to further consolidate efforts to counter cyber threats and strengthen the global cybersecurity architecture,"" Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for Digital Development Anton Demyokhin said in a statement.

Having previously joined the Tallinn mechanism as an observer, Norway joins Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S., as a permanent member of the international mechanism.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale war in February 2022, Russia has launched thousands of cyberattacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including power grids, telecom networks, the financial system, in an attempt to disrupt the country's abilities to sustain its defenses.

In addition to coordinating cyberattacks against Ukraine, the Kremlin continues to target Ukraine's Western allies as it attempts to disrupt military supplies for the embattled country and damage Western resolve.

Norway's cybersecurity support comes following its announcement on July 10 that Oslo will commit $200 million aimed at restoring and transforming Ukraine's energy sector. Norway also separately committed 42 million euros ($49 million) to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, targeting infrastructure protection against Russian attacks and development of more sustainable energy networks.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one who was held despite showing agents his identification.

The filing in U.S. District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility.

Frimpong issued the emergency orders, which are a temporary measure while the lawsuit proceeds, the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government was violating the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the constitution.

She wrote in the order there was a “mountain of evidence” presented in the case that the federal government was committing the violations they were being accused of.

The White House responded quickly to the ruling late Friday. “No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy – that authority rests with Congress and the President,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. “Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.”

Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was under way after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.”

When detaining the three day labourers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.”

Federal immigration agents seeking to detain a Honduran landscaper chased him into a Southern California surgical center and quickly found themselves in a tense standoff as clinic staff demanded to see identification and a warrant. He was eventually arrested.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an e-mail that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin colour are disgusting and categorically FALSE.”

McLaughlin said “enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests.

After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.”

ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighbourhood.”

Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn't involved.

Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances” including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field.

In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said.

“The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said.

A confrontation erupted Thursday between protesters and federal officials carrying out a raid on a Southern California farm.

The Associated Press

Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” on several occasions since June, according to court documents.

Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed.

Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests and it has since been restored.

Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them.

He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” to getting people to sign papers to agree to leave the country before consulting an attorney.

Friday's order will prevent the government from solely using apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the basis for reasonable suspicion to stop someone. It will also require officials to open B-18 to visitation by attorneys seven days a week and provide detainees access to confidential phone calls with attorneys.

Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.

A preliminary report into the June 12 crash in Ahmedabad shows the fuel control switches, used to shut down the engines, were moved to the cutoff position.

A preliminary report into last month's Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad found the aircraft engines' fuel control switches shifted from ""run"" to ""cutoff"" within a second of each other, causing a loss of thrust.

Only one person out of the 242 people on board the airplane survived, and at least 19 people died on the ground where the plane crashed moments after takeoff.

According to a preliminary report by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) released on Friday, the plane reached 180 knots indicated airspeed (IAS), and ""immediately thereafter, the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 1 second.""

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner immediately began to lose thrust.

The report did not provide a reason for why the switch could have flipped to the cutoff position.

""At this stage of investigation, there are no recommended actions to Boeing 787-8 and/or GE GEnx-1B engine operators and manufacturers,"" India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said., suggesting no technical issues with the engines or the aircraft.

The bureau also explained that the Engine and Flight Data Recorder (EAFR) — more commonly known as the aircraft's ""black box"" — was ""substantially damaged,"" to the extent that its data ""could not be downloaded through conventional means.""

In the cockpit voice recording retrieved from the black box, the report said ""one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cutoff,"" and the other pilot ""responded that he did not do so.""

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft crashed into a medical college hostel shortly after takeoff from Ahmedabad en route to London's Gatwick Airport on June 12. 

The plane burst into flames, with the report confirming that it ""was destroyed due to impact with the buildings on the ground and subsequent fire."" Five buildings on the ground were impacted, suffering major structural and fire damage.

US aviation safety expert John Cox told Reuters news agency that it would not be possible for a pilot to accidentally move the fuel switches. ""You can't bump them and they move,"" he said.

Flipping the fuel switch from ""run"" to ""cutoff"" almost immediately cuts the engine. 

It is mostly used to turn engines off after an aircraft has reached its gate and in certain emergency situations like an engine fire.

The report did not provide any information that an engine cutoff was required because of any emergency.

The backlash over a sandal resembling the traditional Kolhapuri design saw calls for greater recognition of Indian craftsmanship.

Prada announced plans Friday to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers, just two weeks after the luxury fashion house sparked controversy by showcasing sandals critics said closely resembled traditional Indian designs.

Prada held a meeting Friday with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3,000 Kolhapuri sandal artisans, to discuss potential opportunities for future collaboration, the company said in a statement to Reuters.

""The next step will be for Prada's supply chain team to meet a range of artisanal footwear manufacturers,"" the company said.

The Chamber shared photos from the virtual meeting in a post on X and said, ""This initiative could serve as a model for respectful collaboration between global fashion and traditional communities.""

The Chamber also said that Lorenzo Bertelli, son of Prada's owners and head of its corporate social responsibility division, joined the talks.

The controversy began when Prada showcased open-toe footwear resembling India's traditional Kolhapuri sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week, describing them simply as ""leather sandals.""

But Indian fashion critics, craftspeople, and politicians criticized the brand, noting the sandals closely resembled handcrafted leather shoes known as Kolhapuri chappals, worn by millions across India.

The sandals are named after Kolhapur, a town in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, where they are made, and are considered part of India's rich cultural heritage.

Following a social media outcry, the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce called on Prada to acknowledge the Indian roots of the design.

The Chamber has decided to have the Kolhapuri chappals patented to avoid any global copyright infringement in the future.

President Donald Trump has threatened Nigeria with higher tariffs and visa changes. Nigeria has enough problems of its own, its foreign minister says.

On Friday, Foreign Affairs Minister Yusuf Tuggar said Nigeria would not bow to increased pressure to accept deported Venezuelans from US President Donald Trump.

Tuggar said Trump was attempting to strong-arm African nations.

""You have to also bear in mind that the US is mounting considerable pressure on African countries to accept Venezuelans to be deported from the US, some straight out of prison,"" said Tuggar in an interview on Nigerian television.

""It will be difficult for a country like Nigeria to accept Venezuelan prisoners into Nigeria. We have enough problems of our own,"" said the foreign minister. ""The issue of accepting Venezuelan deportees, honestly, I don't think is something that Nigeria is in a position to work with.""

One reason Trump may be using rougher tactics with Nigeria is its membership in the BRICS+ political and economic bloc.

Created in 2006 by the acronym-giving countries Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC), with South Africa's 2010 addition, the BRICS club has grown to include developing nations such as Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and accounts for roughly 37% of global economic output.

Nigeria joined the 11-member BRICS+ bloc in January and President Bola Tinubu attended the group's July 6-7, 2025, summit.

As the summit wrapped up, Trump announced that the US would slap 10% punitive tariffs on imports from BRICS+ countries.

Tuggar, however, said it was unclear if recent US measures were directly related to Nigeria's participation in the summit, which Trump slammed as an ""anti-American"" event.

Nigerian President Tinubu was not among those African leaders invited to the White House on Wednesday when Trump welcomed the presidents of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal.

Liberian and US sources reported that Trump used the opportunity to ask each to take in third-country migrants deported from the US.

The Wall Street Journal this week reported that the US State Department sent a document to African leaders invited to Wednesday's White House event calling on them to agree to the ""dignified, safe, and timely transfer from the United States"" of third country nationals.

Trump has repeatedly sought — at times successfully — to send immigrants he is unable to deport home to third-country nations instead.

Speaking of the US pressure campaign, Tuggar said: ""I think it would be unfair to insist that Nigeria accepts 300 Venezuelan deportees. Maybe that might just even be the beginning.""

The foreign minister did not expand on what might come next but addressed one of the other tools the Trump administration has employed as a means to leverage US advantage, brushing off US claims that its new visa policy is reciprocal.

The US Mission in Nigeria this week announced updates to non-immigrant visa policy for Nigerians. 

Tuggar says the only change Nigeria has made is that 90-day visas are now issued electronically rather than upon arrival — as in the US. The change, he said, is intended to streamline the process and make it more efficient.

Tuggar added: ""We are talking to the Americans. We are engaging them. We are also explaining and reminding them that we issue"" visas the same way that they do.

""Our visa doesn't say that every American is only being given 90-day visas or three months or whatever. We give Americans… there are loads of Americans that have these long-term visas… it is not based on reciprocity.""

A commonsense rule created building requirements for projects receiving federal funds. Trump revoked it twice.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

President Donald Trump traveled to central Texas on July 11, one week after flash floods ravaged the region. With 120 people confirmed dead and another 170 still missing, the Trump administration and Texas Republican state leaders are facing intense scrutiny for management and budgetary decisions that could have potentially mitigated the devastation. Officials at the National Weather Service have said that Trump's recent staffing cuts did not impact weather forecasting or alerts, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bristled at questions about whether a different government response could have lessened the death toll. “Who's to blame?” Abbott said, in response to a reporter's question on July 8. “Know this, that's the word choice of losers.”

But Trump's National Weather Service cuts are just one facet of a policy agenda that has long been outright hostile to emergency preparedness and climate science writ large. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order revoking a set of federal flood protections known as the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. The rule — which was also revoked by Trump during his first term and reinstated under Joe Biden's presidency — required federally funded infrastructure projects to comply with certain design requirements. Critical buildings such as schools, libraries, water treatment plants, public highways, and fire stations would have to be rebuilt to withstand flooding and rising seas — either located outside of vulnerable floodplains or constructed to be more resilient — in order to receive disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

The National Association of Home Builders, the lobby group for the home-building industry, vehemently opposed the rule when former President Barack Obama first proposed it in 2016. The group claimed that the regulatory burden would increase construction costs; echoing the industry line, Trump called various infrastructure permitting rules a “massive, self-inflicted wound on our country” when he first rolled them back in 2017.

The reality, however, is that the rule was based on common sense: As the climate crisis worsens, structures destroyed by floods should be rebuilt in ways that would reduce the risk of the same thing happening again. The goal of the standards were not only to protect human lives and homes, but also to save taxpayer money, preventing a never-ending cycle of destroy-rebuild-repeat. On paper, this is a policy Republicans should support: Trump, of course, often cites the need to save taxpayer dollars as an excuse to cut vital public programs, including his proposal to start “phasing out” FEMA, purportedly to leave disaster management to the states. Rebuilding structures outside of floodplains would reduce the amount of FEMA money funneled to disaster repair — but by acknowledging that climate change exists, the rules simply don't fit Trump's agenda. 

Now, with those guidelines thrown out the window, the recovery response to the floods could replicate a destructive pattern. The hilly terrain and thin topsoil of the Texas Hill Country has always made the region particularly vulnerable to flash flooding. That risk will only grow as storms get more intense and destructive. 

“Why on earth would the federal government want it to be rebuilt to a lower standard and waste our money so that when the flood hits, if it gets destroyed again, we're spending yet more money to rebuild it?” Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said in an April interview with Grist.

The consequences of Trump's first rollback of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard began to come into view last fall, after Hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeastern U.S. According to The New York Times, at least five water treatment plants in Florida that were exempt from tougher national building standards received about $200 million in federal funding. Those plants sustained damage from the storms, including water line breaks and power losses. Another seven water plants, rebuilt to lower flood standards with $100 million in public funds, were identified as high risk but escaped damage during Milton and Helene. Berginnis told the Times that “hundreds of millions if not billions” have been spent on buildings that are unprepared for intense floods.

Whether any of those structures were impacted by these floods remains to be seen. But from Texas to North Carolina, Los Angeles to Maui, it's clear that nowhere is truly safe from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. As we push for the phaseout of planet-warming fossil fuels, we must also make strides to protect communities that are already in harm's way. The only “word choice of losers,” as Governor Abbott put it, is pretending that the emergency isn't already here.

From Gaza to the US, military-grade surveillance tools are being deployed to monitor and punish student dissent.

From Gaza to the US, military-grade surveillance tools are being deployed to monitor and punish student dissent.

In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company to a private security company called City Shield. It was part of a broader $3 million public‑security budget, which included surveillance of pro‑Palestinian student activists. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students into cafés, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield, a private security agency based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. 

Massive Blue, a company based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly targeting college protesters and activists labeled as “radicalized.” These bots are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect.

The tech stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers, real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce product, has been linked to student protest monitoring. These tools don't just observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene before a rally even begins.

This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach. It is an act of intimidation, one that reflects an ideological alignment with systems of repression abroad. In Gaza, for example, humanitarian aid is increasingly distributed only through biometric registration, leaving starving Palestinians with no choice but to submit to facial and fingerprint scans to access food. Although aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of “efficiency,” it can only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy under the guise of relief.

Within the United States, university officials have increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies, whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media posts, drone-mapping encampments, and even identifying masked protestors through AI-enhanced facial recognition. These companies aren't developing tools for student safety. They're developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets.

In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with mass arrests. Fewer still understood the extent to which military-grade surveillance technologies were already in place to track them. In the same month, Jewish Currents reported on Yale University's use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. Surveillance footage was used to identify students who had not violated any laws but had simply been present.

The technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence.

Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events. Surveillance reports included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads. Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel, both of which specialize in identifying “emerging threats” by combing through vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In addition, in March 2024, it was revealed that Elon Musk's X was also selling user data to Dataminr. 

The logic is chillingly consistent: Dissent is pathologized, monitored, and neutralized while capitalists keep making money. And universities have become willing partners in this process.

In my Ph.D. research, I studied surveillance infrastructures, particularly in contexts where settler colonial regimes seek to erase dissent. What we're seeing on U.S. campuses today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction. What this tells us is that surveillance isn't about protection, it's about power. And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad.

The money behind these technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms, defense contractors, and government agencies. ShadowDragon, for example, has been celebrated by the World Economic Forum and boasts contracts with U.S. law enforcement and military branches. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the U.S. These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking Palestinians and other “high-risk” populations. Now, they are used on American campuses to monitor solidarity.

There is a historical precedent to this kind of repression. During the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s and 70s, FBI programs like COINTELPRO targeted student activist groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and organizations like the Black Panther Party, with infiltration, wiretaps, and blackmail. The FBI's targeting of student and civil rights activists through COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover's tactics were both coercive and widely normalized. Hoover was the first director of the FBI, serving from 1924 until his death in 1972. However, the difference today is scale and automation. Rather than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats, and alert authorities to so-called “escalation indicators.”

This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach. It is an act of intimidation.

Recently, billionaire investor Kevin O'Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns. While O'Leary was widely condemned, his dystopian vision isn't far from the reality already taking root. Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial image or a Twitter handle.

Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. These are not theoretical tools. They're being piloted now, often in secret, and often in tandem with increasing police presence on campuses.

These developments must be viewed in the broader context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. 

Surveillance technologies once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S. university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds for next-generation policing.

University administrators often claim that surveillance is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish us. 

It doesn't have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry, dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. 

Surveillance Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders, subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is not a threat. It is a right.

We are not subjects. We are watching back.

Sex workers targeted by ICE need the migrant justice movement's full solidarity. 

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Since January 2025, police raids on massage parlors have intensified, targeting immigrant women suspected of sex work. Amid nationwide protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), these workers — among ICE's most systematically targeted — are largely excluded from community defense.

“I'm scared to go to work,” a migrant massage worker in New York City told Red Canary Song, a New York-based collective of Asian and migrant sex workers. “Police cars, plainclothes cars, we all hide when [we] see them … we'll be arrested as soon as we go out.”

On June 11, ICE and local police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, raided nine massage parlors, detaining 10 Chinese women — their names and whereabouts have not been released. They disappeared into ICE's sprawling detention system, with facilities from the U.S. to El Salvador and South Sudan. Yet not a single organization called for their release.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

Over 90 days in January and February, nearly 1,000 arrests in Queens, New York, targeted immigrant sex workers and street vendors. In Arizona, over 200 arrests were made. In Texas, 11 parlors were closed in February and May under emergency powers that bypass criminal charges. Across 20+ cities this year, police collaborated with ICE in similar raids.

Most go unreported, buried in sealed indictments. In Sanctuary Cities, ICE exploits legal loopholes to deport people through administrative channels, without judicial oversight, masking the true scale of its operations.

In other labor sectors, worksite raids sparked massive outpourings of solidarity and creative resistance, including “Adopt a Day Laborer” campaigns and street vendor buyouts. But sex workers are left to fend for themselves.

Few immigrant rights organizations defend migrant sex workers. Support mainly comes from other sex workers in underfunded grassroots groups like Red Canary Song, Trans Immigrant Project, and DecrimSexWorkCA, the last of which has organized ICE patrols, and distributed over $20,000 in emergency relief to undocumented and other sex workers since 2023. Their model is mutual aid, not charity.

“Our undocumented sex worker fam are terrorized and without resources,” wrote Cocoa Makati, coordinator of DecrimSexWorkCA. Sex work is migrant women's day labor; massage parlors are their “Home Depot.” Street-based sex workers are street vendors. Like other precarious workers, they build safety networks to resist raids.

But the broader immigrant rights movement calibrates its messaging to appeal to moderate respectability — complying with lines drawn between the “deserving” and the disposable. When ICE targets sex workers, many remain silent.

The result is devastating — masked abductions, multiagency entrapments, worksite raids. To some, these actions appear unprecedented. But for those organizing with sex workers, they're all too familiar. For years, ICE has used migrant sex workers as testing grounds for its most aggressive tactics.

During Operation Restore Roosevelt in Queens, massage workers described “turning to riskier and riskier clients and accepting clients they don't feel good about,” said Yin Q, a lead organizer with Red Canary Song. They feel “they are being asked to perform more services for lower fees,” she added.

Many fear leaving their workplace at night to go home. “They bring vans to arrest people, waiting to fill them. Undercover cops take photos, and patrol officers come after,” said Mateo Guerrero of the Trans Immigrant Project.

Guerrero described how the intensified raids led to increased police sexual abuse. A trans Latina sex worker was stripped on the street in winter, and mocked in police custody, Guerrero told Truthout. Others were forced to provide oral sex in a police car to avoid arrest, Guerrero said. In March, two NYPD officers were indicted for sexually assaulting and burglarizing a massage parlor while on duty.

The broader immigrant rights movement calibrates its messaging to appeal to moderate respectability — complying with lines drawn between the “deserving” and the disposable.

“Sexual harassment is the number two form of police violence,” Guerrero said. “Under Operation Restore Roosevelt, it dramatically increased.”

Chilling fear spread throughout the community. In vibrant Jackson Heights, known for its LGBTQ bars and Mexican food carts, the streets became empty. “Not just trans folks — the general migrant community was afraid to go out for a beer.”

Despite mounting evidence of abuse, most immigrant rights groups hesitate to support sex workers. “There's respectability politics because of political conditions, and I understand that as a strategy,” Guerrero said, “but leaving our folks behind is harmful in the long term.”

That's because policing and deportations begin on the margins — with sex workers, trans migrants, street vendors. Once normalized, these tactics expand to the broader public.

Technologies funded to police sex work now monitor everyone. ICE's surveillance tools and ballooning budgets were built over decades by targeting sex workers under the guise of anti-trafficking.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (2015) authorized the creation of the Cyber Crimes Center within ICE, enabling wiretaps and internet surveillance. Between 2014 and 2018, DHS funneled over $3 million to local police for license plate readers to combat trafficking — now used in broader workplace raids.

Authorities justified travel bans, surveillance, racial profiling, raids, detentions, deportations, asset seizures, even sexual assault as anti-trafficking measures to protect women and children. But these measures do more harm than good, exposing migrants to additional forms of violence. Most funding went to prosecutions and public campaigns promoting false statistics and racist stereotypes, not victims' services — fueling misguided vigilantism and MAGA fearmongering around child trafficking.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the expansion of ICE through anti-trafficking legislation. First established as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the aftermath of 9/11, ICE structured its operations as two departments in 2023: Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which carries out deportations, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which conducts investigations. This division creates a loophole that lets police in Sanctuary Cities share data with ICE through HSI.

Under Donald Trump's first term, Congress gave DHS $819,000 for the “Blue Campaign”, expanding HSI's anti-trafficking focus to target massage parlors. Under Biden, ICE's 2023 budget increased to $8.48 billion, adding $15 million to its Center for Countering Human Trafficking and $2 million for surveillance. Today, HSI's multibillion-dollar budget funds workplace enforcement operations, fusion centers, and joint police task forces.

Law enforcement increasingly uses facial recognition, license plate readers, Stingrays, Mobile Fortify, and other surveillance technologies — allegedly to help victims of trafficking, but in practice, to build cases for prosecution and deportation.

State and local law enforcement agencies use Traffic Jam (Marinus Analytics) to scrape escort ads and match faces to biometric databases — without evidence of trafficking. Data brokers like Babel Street and ShadowDragon scrape data from over 200 social platforms, including online games and dating websites. Officers use fake accounts to monitor and entrap targets, buying geolocation data and using geofence warrants to monitor their movements. They gather search queries, and metadata from chat apps like WhatsApp, to profile suspected sex workers.

To enhance what they term “early detection,” DHS recently launched StreamView, a program that uses AI to scan livestreams from public cameras for “suspicious behavior” — like walking on streets where known sex workers walk. Ordinary acts become grounds for arrest, when performed by people with short skirts or foreign accents. This practice legitimized profiling and surveilling the public based on patterns, rather than evidence, of criminal activity.

The National Human Trafficking hotline, run by anti-trafficking organization Polaris, proudly began partnering with Palantir in 2012. Palantir now holds a $30 million contract to build a “master database” for ICE, and is in talks to develop a larger database on all U.S. citizens.

The One Big Beautiful Bill (HR 1) allocated $2.5 billion to ICE specifically for AI systems and biometric data collection — including facial recognition, iris scanning, and DNA — shared between ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and state law enforcement. Much of this funding will go to Palantir, which has already secured over $1.3 billion in federal contracts in 2025. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also received over $6 billion for the expansion of Autonomous Surveillance Towers (AST) and biometric screening technologies. This bill turns previously small-scale biometric pilots into foundational national infrastructure.

In New York, ICE accessed over 480 plate readers logging 16.2 million scans in a week — tracking people without warrants or probable cause. In California, police shared plate data with ICE despite sanctuary laws. ICE uses these tools to raid farms, construction sites and food processing plants in Nebraska, California, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. The technology that once policed sex workers now targets all migrant workers.

The first U.S. immigration law and the nation's first federal policing agency were both born out of the criminalization of immigrant sexuality.

The Page Act of 1875 barred entry to the U.S. for Chinese women, all suspected of prostitution — the first law excluding immigrants by race, gender, and perceived morality. It set the stage for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which closed the formerly open borders of the country.

The Mann Act of 1910 criminalized interstate travel for “immoral purposes,” a vague category used to police interracial relationships and sex work by targeting Black and migrant men. The FBI — the nation's first federal police agency — expanded through the enforcement of the Mann Act. Today's raids echo the same moral panic of the “white slave trade” — invoking imagined threats and racialized assumptions about migrant immorality to justify broader policing and immigration control.

Mainstream immigrant advocacy champions the “good migrant” — the student, mother, farmhand, and domestic worker. But immigration enforcement began not with “respectable immigrants,” but those hardest to defend. Migrant sex workers defy the “good/bad migrant” binary — and that's powerful. Most Asian massage workers are older women escaping poverty wages in other more exploitative jobs. Sex work is precarious, but for many, it offers more autonomy — feeding families and providing some with the only available startup capital for other businesses, like bakeries.

As Red Canary Song urgently warns: “Neighborhoods at the margins are testing grounds for how policing and neighborhood vigilantism can expand and become embedded into the daily life of the city … the plan is to normalize the horror.”

For years, undercover officers posed systematically as clients, soliciting services in plain clothes, before arresting sex workers with impunity to earn overtime. It's now a national tactic — turning workplaces into traps, as masked ICE agents raid immigrant workplaces to meet federal quotas.

Reversing the expansion of ICE under anti-trafficking rhetoric requires eliminating the legal loopholes that allow local police to collaborate with ICE. It requires removing the 10-year travel ban and “moral turpitude” clause from immigration law — a vague provision used to deport sex workers and other migrants for minor nonviolent offenses.

Protecting migrants also means confronting whorephobia, racism, and criminalization. Otherwise, the state will keep using the same fascist playbook: target sex workers and the most marginalized first, then expand its reach to others. Defending the rights of migrant sex workers is essential to a broader movement for immigrant justice.

Wildfires have forced evacuations for visitors and staff at two national parks in the U.S. West as the summer monsoon season brings increased lightning to the arid region.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed until further notice after lighting strikes sparked blazes on both rims, park officials said. The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake.

The wildfire on Black Canyon of the Gunnison's South Rim ignited Thursday and has burned 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers), with no containment of the perimeter. The smaller blaze on the North Rim was out as of Friday, according to an incident map. 

The conditions there have been ripe for wildfires with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday.

Fire danger has ramped up in the West as drought conditions have worsened across several states. While monsoon season can drop much-needed moisture on the area from June through September, it can also bring dust storms and thunderstorms like those that ignited the wildfires in the Colorado and Arizona parks.

Firefighters saved Black Canyon's visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn. Some park equipment and sheds were damaged, the park said.




In Arizona, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby. The fire began Wednesday evening after a thunderstorm moved through the area, fire officials said.

“Gusty and erratic winds” spread the flames Thursday afternoon and inhibited firefighters from containing the blaze, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Rachel Carnahan said. By Friday afternoon it had burned about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) with zero containment, and dark clouds of smoke settled over the Grand Canyon.

About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joëlle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place.

Melinda Rich, whose family owns the 102-year-old Jacob Lake Inn known for its homemade cookies, evacuated 75 employees Thursday and guests in about 35 cabins that were rented out at the time.

“It's tricky for us because we were half booked and now we have to refund all of those things, and that's a challenge financially for us,” she said. “But you also feel bad for the people who, this might be their first time at the canyon.”

Some guests had just checked in when the inn got a call from the sheriff's office saying everyone should leave immediately, Rich said. The staff began calling and emailing guests who were out exploring, she said.

Even as smoke rose around them, the evacuation felt precautionary because of the wind direction, Rich said. In 2020, a wildfire came within 20 feet (6 meters) of some cabins.

“We had one of those incredible, miraculous moments, a lot of prayers and then wind adjusted just enough that it passed us by about a mile,” she said.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats.

FIRST ON FOX: Mahmood Mamdani, the father of socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing ""genocide"", and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers.

The Gaza Tribunal, founded in London in 2024, says its primary goal is ""to awaken civil society to its responsibility and opportunity to stop Israel's genocide in Gaza,"" according to its website.

Also on its website, Mahmood Mamdani is listed as a member of the group's ""advisory policy council"" and is mentioned as having attended the group's official launch in London last year.

Richard Falk, the president of the tribunal, outlined the group's support of BDS in an online post saying, ""the aim of the Tribunal is or [sic] legitimize and encourage civil society solidarity initiatives around the world such as BDS.""

BDS is described as ""an international campaign to delegitimize the State of Israel as the expression of the Jewish people's right to national self-determination by isolating the country economically through consumer boycotts, business and government withdrawal of investment, and legal sanctions,"" according to Influence Watch. 

Zohran Mamdani has also promoted BDS as recently as May, when he declined to say whether Israel has a right to exist and said his support of BDS ""is consistent with my core of my politics, which is non-violence.""

Mahmood Mamdani, the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at Columbia University, has also faced criticism on social media in recent days over a resurfaced book excerpt where he expressed sympathy for the way suicide bombers are viewed.

""Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism,"" the elder Mamdani wrote in his 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror. 

""We need to recognize the suicide bomber, first and foremost, as a category of soldier.""

The Gaza Tribunal's founder and members have deep ties to anti-Israel movements, with at least one being deported from the United States due to terror ties. 

Falk has a long history of espousing anti-Israel views and was repeatedly accused of using his ""Special Rapporteur"" United Nations position to ""spread unsubstantiated allegations against Israel,"" according to Canary Mission, a watchdog organization that works to expose antisemitism. In 2011 and 2014, Falk accused Israel of being a ""colonialist"" nation and claimed it was pushing ""ethnic-cleansing goals."" He would go on to echo these views as recently as February of this year during an interview.

Falk faced backlash in 2007 for comparing Israel's government to the Nazis by accusing them of ushering in a ""Palestinian Holocaust"" and rhetorically asking, ""Is it an irresponsible overstatement to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity? I think not."" The comparison led to backlash and former Israeli U.N. Ambassador Itzhak Levanon opposing his 2008 UN nomination.

The Princeton University professor emeritus also demanded a boycott of corporations in 2012 that do business with Israel, saying they ""should be boycotted until they bring their operations into line with international human rights and humanitarian law and standards."" However, a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) fired back, warning the UN that Falk ""has repeatedly abused his position as special rapporteur to unleash unrestrained hatred and disdain for Israel"" and that the ""United Nations should not be complicit in this wholly unjustified effort to single out Israel.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Falk said that he advocates for ""nonviolent solidarity initiatives with the Palestinian struggle for their basic rights, including BDS.""

""I believe that Israel's occupation policies in Gaza and the West Bank have persecuted Palestinians on their own homeland,"" Falk added. ""Also, I believe that this pattern of displacing the native population is illustrative of settler colonial political projects that depend for their success on an apartheid-like domination and exploitation of the native population. If such a regime encounters prolonged resistance it almost inevitably relies on genocidal tactics to subdue the civilian population, either by marginalization, ethnic cleansing, or massive killing, all of which have been occurring in Gaza during the 20 months since October 7.""

Falk added that Jewish voters in New York City ""should not worry"" about Mamood Mamdani's ties to the tribunal or about Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for mayor. 

""Both father and son are respectful of international law, the UN, human rights of all peoples, and the pacific settlement of political disputes,"" Falk said. 

Falk is not the only member of the tribunal with anti-Israel ties. A press release of the group's launch mentioned that Dr. Hatem Bazian, the chairman of American Muslims for Palestine and the co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine, was also present at the launch. Bazian has been a controversial anti-Israel figure for decades due to his inflammatory rhetoric about Israel and Jews, including during a 2014 convention speech, where he called on attendees to ""get to work"" on calling for BDS on college campuses and doing sit-ins in Congressional offices.

In 2015, Bazian raised alarm bells when he called for an ""intifada in this country that changes fundamentally the political dynamics in here,"" which is widely interpreted as calling for violence against Jews. He would go on to say, ""They're gonna say some Palestinian being too radical – well, you haven't seen radicalism yet.""

He has also faced backlash for antisemitic posts on social media, which drew backlash from several student groups, including one that mocked Hassidic Jews, with one saying ""Mom, look! I is chosen! I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs and steal the land of Palestinians ‘Yay' #Ashke-Nazi.""  Another social media post insinuated Jews control UC Berkeley, which is a classic antisemitic trope about their ""power.""

Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida professor who admitted to conspiring to aid the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group in 2006, was also present at the Gaza Tribunal launch meeting. 

He recently posted on X that he was ""very honored and proud"" to have contributed to the Gaza Tribunal's ""The Sarajevo Declaration,"" which accuses Israel of ""genocide, and its decades-long policies and practices of settler colonialism, ethno-supremacism, apartheid, racial segregation, persecution, unlawful settlements, the denial of the right to return, collective punishment, mass detention, torture and cruel and inhuman treatment.""

The declaration went on to ""call for an end of the smearing of UNRWA and other humanitarian workers, for the free and unhindered access of UNRWA,"" a group that has been slammed for alleged ties to terrorism, including allegedly working with Hamas.

Al-Arian, whom a federal judge once called a ""master manipulator"" and leader in the terror group, spent 30 years in the U.S. before being arrested in 2003, according to the Justice Department. After a 57-month prison sentence, he agreed to be deported to Turkey as part of his plea deal for a single charge on what had begun as a 17-count federal indictment.

Then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said in 2006 that the disgraced professor had denied involvement with the terror group for a decade before prosecutors had enough evidence to bring charges.

""In his guilty plea, Al-Arian admitted that, during the period of the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, he and several of his co-conspirators were associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad,"" the DOJ said in a statement after his sentencing. ""He further admitted that he performed various services for the PIJ in 1995 and thereafter, knowing that the PIJ had been designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist and that the PIJ engaged in horrific and deadly acts of violence.""

Socialist former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long been labeled as antisemitic due to various anti-Israel statements, is also a member of the Gaza Tribunal Advisory Council.

In 2020, an investigation into antisemitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found Corbyn's Labour Party had broken the law in the way it handled complaints of antisemitism when Corbyn was in charge.

Corbyn was eventually suspended from the Labour Party over charges of antisemitism. He also once referred to ""friends"" from Hamas coming to address Parliament.

A 2019 poll showed that a whopping 87 percent of Jewish people in Great Britain believed Corbyn was antisemitic, pointing to many incidents and remarks, many of them involving his staunch support for Palestinians and perceived hostility toward Israel.

Zohran Mamdani's stance on Israel has been a widely discussed topic so far during the mayoral campaign, and he sparked controversy by refusing to condemn the phrase ""globalize the intifada,"" which has become a rallying cry for anti-Israel protesters in the United States ever since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in Israel. 

Mamdani, who was the co-founder of Bowdoin College's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his four years, expressed support for an academic boycott of Israel in the school's paper. 

Mamdani has been widely criticized by Jewish groups in New York City over his past positions and comments as he tries to position himself to win the general election in November against current Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents.

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., spoke with Fox News Digital about his bipartisan bill to codify oversight of foreign adversaries, including China, buying American farmland.

A key China ally with presidential ambitions in Peru traveled late last month to California to participate in a sending-off ceremony for a batch of trains donated by the Biden administration, according to reporting by Peruvian news outlets.

Peruvian outlet Justo Medio reported at the time that Lima Mayor Rafael Lopez Aliaga, who is rumored to be considering a run for president of Peru in 2026, was in California late last month to discuss the transport of a batch of CalTrain locomotives, which were donated to Lima by the U.S. government under the Biden administration.  

Nate Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), recently published a study on Lopez Aliaga's ""deep"" financial ties to China through his company PeruRail, which has seen its revenue rise to over $65 million per year due to increased shipments from Minera Las Bambas, a Chinese-owned joint venture counting state-owned mining giant China Minmetals as its majority backer.

The report alleged that China has been ""cultivating"" Lopez Aliaga for higher office in Peru in hopes of growing its mineral and battery supplies harvesting in South America. The report goes so far as to dub Lopez Aliaga ""China's man in Peru.""

""China's mining presence in Peru is a direct boon for López Aliaga,"" the report said, giving Beijing ""a powerful beachhead in Peru.""

The report said, ""This leaves an influential Peruvian political leader aligned with and linked to China, its resource project, and the broader Belt and Road Initiative of which it is part.""

In the last several years, Chinese investment in South America, and Peru especially, has significantly increased. 

According to NBC News, China invested $1.3 billion in a massive deepwater port in Chancay, Peru, just north of Lima. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping participated in the port's opening ceremony in 2024, during which he called the port the start of China's 21st-century maritime Silk Road, according to the outlet.

According to Picarsic, China has also been investing heavily in Lima's infrastructure, most notably dominating its electricity industry, all of which Lopez Aliaga has been a ""linchpin"" piece in moving Chinese dominance forward.

Now, with Lopez Aliaga possibly entering Peru's presidential race, Picarsic explained that this all ""looks like a telltale sign of China's handiwork.""

He also called the U.S.'s donation of trains to Peru ""too little, too late"" to combat China's growing influence in the region.

""We're coming with a donation of some number of decommissioned rail cars. But this guy, who is in cahoots with China, who's coming to take them and he's taking them back to run on Chinese rail feeding into a Chinese port, helping to move goods from a Chinese mine.""

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in a train-donation ceremony last November in Lima, Peru, where he praised the project as an opportunity to ""strengthen the ties between Peru and the United States"" and said the trains ""are not just a symbol, but the practical manifestation of possibilities – the possibilities that come when we connect to each other.""

""This agreement is a testament to the strength and durability of the U.S. and Peru's longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship,"" he added. ""I am so proud to have Caltrain be a member of that mutually beneficial relationship.""

'America Reports' shows new video of the police chasing and arresting two inmates from New Orleans who escaped from jail. 

A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May appeared surprisingly pleased with his recapture, flashing a broad grin as law enforcement escorted him back to Kentucky.

The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared the update on Sedrick T. Stevenson, thanking the other agencies for their help, stating that they ""coordinated closely"" with U.S. Marshals and Seattle-area agencies to ensure Stevenson's secure return.

Photos released by the Warren County Sheriff's Office show Stevenson smiling cheerfully while seated on a plane alongside multiple law enforcement officers — a striking contrast to the circumstances of his return to custody.

""Therefore, we wanted to ensure he was brought back without issue. We underwent coordination with the Port of Seattle Police, Seattle Police, US Marshals, Air Marshals, and TSA,"" the sheriff's office shared.

Authorities took no chances with Stevenson this time and guaranteed he would return to Kentucky with zero issues as he was pictured strapped to a wheelchair and put in the plane's window seat under the careful watch of law enforcement.

Deputies joked about the cross-country trip to retrieve Stevenson, pointing out it took nearly 24-hours to conduct the mission. 

""I am happy to report that after 2 direct flights, 4 time zone changes, and 21 straight hours, he was booked into the WCRJ,"" officials said. ""He (Stevenson) received VIP service and ensured a 5-Star Yelp review.""

Stevenson, 28, who was wanted on warrants out of Bowling Green, Kentucky, snuck away from a contracted agent on May 4 when the agent lost control of him at the ticket counter at the airport. 

Port of Seattle Police confirmed via video cameras that Stevenson, who was in shackles, was caught on video escaping by boarding a light rail train and disappearing for more than a month until he was captured by U.S. Marshals.

The U.S. Marshals Service told FOX 13 Seattle that Stevenson was arrested in a Seattle neighborhood, along with a second person who investigators said was reportedly assisting Stevenson in his escape.

""This arrest sends a clear message: no matter how long it takes or how far someone runs, justice will catch up with them. Our deputies and taskforce officers worked tirelessly and with unwavering dedication to bring Stevenson back into custody. The community can rest easier, knowing a dangerous fugitive is no longer on the streets"" U.S. Marshal Donrien Stephens told the outlet.

Stevenson was being held in the King County jail until authorities in Kentucky were able to transport him back to their state.

At the time of his escape, Stevenson was being extradited to Kentucky to face multiple charges, according to the U.S. Marshal's Office, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, third-degree assault, and enhanced possession of a controlled substance.

Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Marshal's Office, but did not immediately receive a response.

A rock climbing outing turned fatal for one National Park visitor after authorities say a fall resulted in his death.  

Officials with the National Park Service confirmed that Brian Astle, 42, of Provo, UT fell while descending a steep, off-trail climbing route from the west face of Mount Gould inside Glacier National Park on Wednesday.

The accident happened just before 6 p.m. on July 9, when Glacier National Park Dispatch received a report of an individual who had fallen from Mount Gould above the Highline Trail.

Park rangers worked with aerial search and rescue crews to locate Astle. However, the operation was postponed overnight to ensure Astle's body could be safely recovered.

The following morning, park rangers located Astle's body and transported him to a nearby horse corral till he could be moved to the coroner's office. 

Officials said an investigation is ongoing, and there is no additional information available at this time.

Federal authorities announced charges against Sinaloa Cartel leaders during a press conference Tuesday.

One of the sons of notorious drug lord ""El Chapo"" pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court in Chicago to major drug charges and running the Sinaloa Cartel in his father's absence.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 35, admitted to running part of the Sinaloa Cartel, coordinating massive drug shipments, including fentanyl, heroin and cocaine into the U.S. and using violence to protect cartel operations, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.

His plea is part of a broader federal strategy, ""Operation Take Back America,"" aimed at dismantling transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel.

""Today's guilty plea is another major step toward holding the Sinaloa Cartel and its leaders accountable for their role in fueling the fentanyl epidemic that has plagued so many Americans,"" U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a news release. 

""We remain committed to dismantling the Cartel's entire fentanyl infrastructure and ensuring that the Chapitos and their violent organization can no longer flood our communities with this poison.""

Guzman Lopez admitted in the plea agreement that he coordinated the transportation of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs and precursor chemicals from Mexico to the United States border, at times in shipments of hundreds or thousands of kilograms, according to federal officials. He used a network of couriers affiliated with the cartel to smuggle the drugs into the United States, using vehicles, rail cars, tunnels, aircraft and other means, the plea agreement states.

After the drugs were distributed throughout the United States, officials said, individuals working for Guzman Lopez used bulk cash transport, wire transfers, trade of goods and cryptocurrency to launder the illicit proceeds and ensure that the money was transmitted to Guzman Lopez and other members of the cartel in Mexico. 

Guzman Lopez then admitted he and his cartel associates committed violent acts against law enforcement officials, civilians and rival drug traffickers to protect the cartel's drug-trafficking activities.

As part of the plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will also forfeit $80 million, though his sentencing date hasn't been set.

He is one of four brothers known as ""The Chapitos,"" who took over after their father's arrest in 2016. 

Joaquin Guzman Lopez was arrested last year and is being held in the U.S. without bail. He pleaded not guilty and is waiting for his trial in Illinois.

Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar are also facing charges in Illinois and New York. They have not been arrested yet, and warrants have been issued for their arrests.

Federal officials praised the guilty plea, saying ""with each passing day, you are seeing the sunset of the Sinaloa Cartel."" 

""The Chapitos' latest violence reflects their fading future. Their leaders who remain free are now paranoid, distrusted and desperate,"" U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon wrote. 

The U.S. State Department has issued rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to their arrests and convictions. 

""The guilty plea by Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of ‘El Chapo,' is a real victory for both the United States and Mexico but also a clear win for the rule of law,"" said Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations Arizona Ray Rede.

""So much blood and violence lay with the Guzman family as well as spreading terror and plaguing both sides of the border with deadly drugs and weapons — no more. It's impossible to measure the amount of work HSI and partner agencies have spent in securing this guilty verdict, but what is clear and evident is that no one is beyond the reach of law enforcement and our nation's laws. Deliberate and coordinated teamwork resulted in today's victory.""

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney reports on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump's visit to Texas on ‘Special Report'.

A Texas man was arrested Thursday after allegedly making violent threats against President Donald Trump on Facebook ahead of the president's visit to Kerrville, according to federal officials.

Robert Herrera, 52, of San Antonio, was charged with making threats against the president and interstate threatening communications, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas. 

The alleged threats were posted on a local news outlet's Facebook page discussing Trump's upcoming visit to the Hill Country after deadly Fourth of July flooding. The outlet has not been publicly identified by law enforcement.

According to a Department of Justice release, Herrera, using the name ""Robert Herrer,"" allegedly posted the phrase ""I won't miss"" beneath a photo of Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents after the July 2024 assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. 

When another user responded, ""you won't get the chance, I promise,"" Herrera allegedly replied, ""I'll just come for you,"" attaching a photo of himself holding what appeared to be a rifle and loaded magazines.

The posts have since been removed, and federal agents arrested Herrera later that day. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison per charge. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Roomberg is prosecuting the case.

""While the FBI fully supports and defends every American's right to free speech, it is important to understand that threatening violence against any individual is not constitutionally protected speech, it is a federal crime,"" Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tapp of the FBI's San Antonio Field Office said in the release. 

""The FBI and our partners take threats of violence seriously, and we urge the public to do the same. We would like to thank the United States Secret Service, the San Antonio Police Department, the Texas Department of Public Safety and the United States Attorney's Office for their tremendous partnership in addressing this threat against the president. 

""We urge all members of the public to express their views peacefully and respectfully in a manner consistent with the values that define our nation.""TEXAS SUSPECT WHO DAMAGED ICE VEHICLE, ‘AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED' AGENTS IS ARRESTED: POLICE

""I would like to thank the San Antonio Police Department and the FBI San Antonio Field Office for assisting the U.S. Secret Service in this matter,"" Special Agent in Charge Brian J. Gibson of the U.S. Secret Service San Antonio Field Office said in the release.

""Investigating threats towards individuals under Secret Service protection are treated as our highest priority. This is one of the countless reasons the Secret Service prides ourselves on forging and maintaining relationships with other law enforcement agencies. As this is an ongoing investigation, the Secret Service will have no further comment on this incident.""

Trump and the first lady traveled to Kerrville Friday to survey flood damage and meet with first responders. In remarks on the ground, Trump said the federal government would provide ""whatever relief Texas needs.""

The arrest comes almost one year to the day after Trump survived an attempted assassination at a Pennsylvania rally. In that incident, a rooftop gunman fired at Trump from roughly 150 yards away, grazing his right ear and killing one attendee, Corey Comperatore, before Secret Service agents shot the attacker dead.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","The exclusive Capitol subway that keeps trapping US senators","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3469214/subway-trapping-us-senators/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Senators are getting trapped in a subway built exclusively for their convenience, leading to calls for more funding and some amusement for those who opt to walk the Senate's tunnels instead.

Riding the tiny, three-car train, which shuttles between the U.S. Capitol and two Senate office buildings, has become a gamble for senators, staffers, and congressional reporters alike. It was constructed to cut down on walking time, and when operating smoothly can travel from end to end in under two minutes. But the train's automated system, brought online in the 1990s, also stops abruptly and can leave riders briefly stranded on the tracks.

The latest episode came on Thursday, when a half-dozen senators, feet away from their destination, were forced to sit patiently as reporters snapped photos of them in good humor on the other side of the plexiglass.

At other times, riders have been forced to disembark the train and carefully navigate to the walking path that runs along its tracks.

“I've been stuck on it, probably, oh, 20 times,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), making the trek back to his office on foot. “If time wasn't a factor here, I would never take it.”

That walking path, adorned with flags of all 50 states, is a popular alternative for senators who say the train only saves a marginal amount of time. In the era of smart watches, some skip the train to be health-conscious.

“I need to walk,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-SD), who works in the farther-away Hart Office Building. “I get 50,000 steps a week in.”

PHOTO FINISH: TEAM THUNE TAKES FIRST PLACE AFTER FITNESS CHALLENGE ‘RECOUNT'

The frequent stoppages, which can last seconds or sometimes minutes, are nonetheless a source of frustration for the dozens of senators who rely on the train daily and can interfere with their official duties.

Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL), one of several appropriators trapped on Thursday's train, returned to a committee hearing that afternoon with a smiling but earnest request that the trains get adequate funding.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) replied that he and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), the top appropriators for legislative branch funding, used their time stranded together to agree on the need for a fix.

“Not that I don't like spending time with him, just not stuck on a train,” Mullin joked.

Frustration with the train system dates back decades and is rooted in the steady expansion of the Capitol complex. The automated line, a magnet-powered system modeled after Disney World's monorail, opened in 1994 to accommodate senators in the newly constructed Hart Building.

There was inadequate cabin space in the 12 years before the new train was installed, according to the Senate Historical Office, leading to long wait times and missed votes. Half of the Senate's 100 members are housed in Hart.

There is a rough consensus that today's subway only saves about 90 seconds each trip for those in Hart. The time saved is even shorter for the intermediate stop at the Dirksen Office Building.

For this reason, some senators don't feel the subway is worth the trouble.

“I try to walk,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL). “I don't want to get stuck.”

But others complain that a reliable system is needed, given the hearings and meetings interspersed between Senate votes.

“It doesn't save you much, but we operate on these schedules that are just crazy,” said Kelly. “And over the course of a week, it can add up to a significant, significant amount of time.”

A timely train became an even greater imperative earlier this year when Republicans implemented a 30-minute rule to instill discipline in Senate votes that had been dragging on for an hour or longer.

Even when the trains are fully functional, stray senators can be found sprinting to the chamber to make the cutoff.

THUNE SENDS SENATORS SPRINTING WITH NEW VOTING STOP CLOCK

At less critical times, the stoppages can still be highly inconvenient. Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) was among those trapped late at night after President Joe Biden delivered his final State of the Union address to Congress last year.

The mechanical failures, usually taken in good spirits, are accompanied by smiles, waving, and light ribbing from passersby who often take the train but, looking on at someone else's misfortune, dodged a similar fate.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI), a member of Democratic leadership, said the subway is “probably in need of an upgrade” but ranked it as a low priority as he waited for a train.

“It doesn't crack the top 100 things that I think about on any given day,” he said.

A separate train system, two open-cabin trams that service the older Russell Office Building, has received fewer complaints. The trams are generally reliable and operated manually by drivers who travel to and from the Capitol by request.

But they, too, have been periodically taken out of service for maintenance. In 2023, workers were forced to push riders back to the station after a shock fell out of the bottom of the train.

HOW THUNE AND TRUMP GOT BEHIND ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The trams, in operation since the 1950s, replaced an earlier monorail system and, before that, two yellow Studebaker cars nicknamed “Tommy” and “Peg.”

The Architect of the Capitol, which operates the subway system, did not respond to a request for comment about future maintenance plans. Appropriators have earmarked $698 million for the entire department's 2026 budget.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Ryan Routh offers himself for prisoner swap with US adversaries in letter shared by judge","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3469340/ryan-routh-prisoner-swap-adversaries-letter/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 01:51:26 GMT","

Ryan Routh, the second alleged would-be assassin of President Donald Trump, told the Florida judge presiding over his case on Friday that he wants to offer himself to Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea as part of a prisoner exchange with one of the foreign adversaries.

Routh's offer was shared in a letter he addressed to United States District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee.

“I had wished for a prisoner swap with Hamas, Iran for a female protester, or China for Jimmy Lai or one of the 40 others or to freeze to death in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier so that I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts,” he wrote to Cannon. “Perhaps you have the power to trade me away.”

Jimmy Lai is the jailed media tycoon and pro-democracy activist who protested Beijing's national security crackdown on Hong Kong in 2019. The “40 others” Routh is likely referring to are the 47 pro-democracy figures arrested by Beijing in 2021 for organizing an unofficial primary election in Hong Kong.

Routh says his part in a prisoner swap would make sense for Trump, whose administration has prioritized the release of people wrongfully imprisoned, including the Israeli captives held by Hamas.

“What an easy diplomatic victory for Trump to give an American he hates to China, Iran, or North Korea, or wherever, as a gesture of peace in exchange for an unjustly held democratic prisoner,” he wrote. “Everyone wins.”

Last September, the suspect failed to assassinate Trump while camping outside the then-candidate's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The alleged gunman fled the scene after a Secret Service agent spotted him hiding in a bush along the property's fence.

Routh faces numerous federal charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty, in addition to state charges brought by the Florida attorney general.

In the letter, the defendant revealed that he fired his attorneys and wishes to represent himself in the case moving forward.

“It was ridiculous from the outset to consider a random stranger that knows nothing of who I am to speak for me. That was foolish and ignorant, and I am sorry,” he wrote, noting it was “a childish mistake.”

Judge Cannon held hearings on Thursday to assess Routh's decision to fire his attorneys. He swore under oath that he understood the implications of such a decision.

Until Cannon issues a ruling, his lawyers will remain on the case.

TRUMP ‘SATISFIED' WITH INVESTIGATION INTO BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: ‘HAD A BAD DAY'

Routh explained in the letter how he feels unsupported and ignored by his legal defense team and apologized to the judge for being a burden.

President Donald Trump on Friday empowered all federal law enforcement officers to immediately arrest any violent protesters attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials or their vehicles.

“I am on my way back from Texas, and watched in disbelief as THUGS were violently throwing rocks and bricks at ICE Officers while they were moving down a roadway in their car and/or official vehicle,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“Tremendous damage was done to these brand new vehicles. I know for a fact that these Officers are having a hard time with allowing this to happen in that it shows such total disrespect for LAW AND ORDER.”

Trump then directed Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Border Czar Tom Homan to grant ICE, DHS, or any law enforcement officer the authority to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS,” who are throwing objects at officers or otherwise targeting authorities.

“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public. I never want to see a car carrying a Law Enforcement Officer attacked again,” the president said, adding that authorization for arrest and incarceration of these individuals is immediately granted.

Trump has repeatedly defended ICE amid the intense backlash that immigration officers face from Democratic lawmakers and violent protesters.

Earlier this week, he slammed Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Alex Padilla (D-CA) for introducing a bill requiring law enforcement officers to display visible identification when engaged in immigration operations. ICE faces criticism for allowing its agents to wear masks, which the agency says protects their identities from getting doxxed.

“People are out there taking photos of their names, of their faces, and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves,” acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in Boston last month. “So, I'm sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I'm not going to let my officers and agents go out there, put their lives and put their family on the line because people don't like what immigration enforcement is.”

ICE has recently seen a 700% surge in assaults on its officers, as the Trump administration continues carrying out its mass deportation agenda against illegal immigrants.

On July 4, an armed group ambushed an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. The group defaced vehicles with anti-ICE graffiti and then shot one officer in the neck after luring officials out of the building.

About 11 individuals were charged for their involvement in the attack. One suspect remains at large, while the others were arrested.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

The filing in the United States District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.”

McLaughlin said, “Enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility.

Frimpong issued the orders the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government violated the Constitution‘s Fourth and Fifth amendments.

Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts, and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.”When detaining the three-day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them was that they were Latino and dressed in construction work clothes, the filing said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots, where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.”

RAIDED CANNABIS FARM FACING FEDERAL PROBE FOR CHILD EXPLOITATION IS THE SUBJECT OF PAST LABOR LAW COMPLAINTS

ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens detained, was “physically assaulted … for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.”

Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn't involved.

Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances,” including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field.

In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said.

“The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said.

Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say their access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” was denied on several occasions since June, according to court documents.

Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7, attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA; however, the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out, and deployed chemical munitions akin to tear gas.

Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests, and has since been restored.

Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and the people detained were also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them.

He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” tactics for getting people to sign papers agreeing to leave the country before consulting an attorney.

Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Charlie Kirk and Megyn Kelly come to Dan Bongino's defense in Pam Bondi Epstein feud","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3469381/charlie-kirk-megyn-kelly-dan-bongino-defense-pam-bondi-epstein/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:06:24 GMT","

Right-wing figures Charlie Kirk and Megyn Kelly on Friday alluded to the reported feud between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Department of Justice‘s botched handling of the Epstein files.

While speaking at a Turning Point USA event in Tampa, Florida, Kirk asked the crowd whether they preferred Bongino or Bondi. The crowd overwhelmingly shouted, “Bongino!”

“It's 7,000 to zero,” Kirk replied. Kelly chimed in, saying the crowd wants Bongino because he “understands MAGA” and “is part of the MAGA movement.”

“He's been in the trenches,” she added before questioning whether Bondi “really gets MAGA.” The conservative commentator doesn't think she does.

Earlier Friday, reports surfaced of Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel's dissatisfaction with Bondi over the Epstein files. The attorney general repeatedly promised she would release troves of information on late financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein‘s client list, but the DOJ now says no such list exists.

The Department of Justice also concluded Epstein's death was caused by suicide, not homicide, in prison. To show there was no foul play in his death, DOJ officials released footage showing the area outside Epstein's prison cell the night he died. However, one minute of the footage was missing around midnight, suggesting the footage may have been modified.

As a result, Bongino and Patel are reportedly considering resigning from their positions. Meanwhile, the Justice Department disputed any such conflict and denounced such reports.

“I worked closely with [Patel] and [Bongino] on the joint FBI and DOJ memo regarding the Epstein Files,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche posted on X. “All of us signed off on the contents of the memo and the conclusions stated in the memo. The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false.”

Kelly is calling on Bondi to resign, especially after she invited right-wing influencers to the White House in February to receive binders featuring largely known information about Epstein.

Bondi “brought in some of our best influencers, people that I care about deeply,” Kirk said, naming Jack Posobiec, Chaya Raichik, who goes by Libs of TikTok on social media, and Rogan O'Handley, also known as DC Draino, out of the 15 total influencers present for the publicity stunt.

BONDI'S HANDLING OF EPSTEIN FILES SPARKS RIFT WITH BONGINO AND PATEL

“She gave them these binders, and she humiliated them,” he continued. “You guys were upset. You shouldn't be upset at the influencers. They were handed these binders like there was something incredible in them.”

Kelly said that is “what you would do to an enemy.”

She also took issue with Bondi's empty promises on Fox News that the Epstein files, including the client list that the DOJ head at one point said was sitting on her desk, would be released shortly after she reviewed them.

“She knew they were bull****. She knew that there was nothing in there,” Kelly said.

She explained how the influencers were then led out of the White House, where the press corps photographed them holding the binders. The incident outraged conservatives on social media, including some of the influencers who are now calling for Bondi's resignation.

Liz Wheeler, in particular, told Kelly that she and the other influencers were promised another trove of information and told that the binders contained little new information. The influencers didn't expect to receive the binders, as the Epstein files were not the original purpose of their visit to the White House.

“They didn't even know they were there for Epstein, and they looked foolish through no fault of their own,” Kelly concluded. “The only fault was they trusted her.”

Friday's TPUSA event marks the latest instance Kelly has criticized the Trump administration over the Epstein files.

MAGA VOICES TARGET BONDI INSTEAD OF BONGINO AND PATEL AFTER EPSTEIN CLIENT LIST FLOP

Earlier this week, she slammed Bondi but gave Bongino, whom she personally knows, the benefit of the doubt.

“I trust [Dan Bongino] not to actively mislead me or you,” Kelly said on Emily Jashinsky's podcast After Party. “However, Pam Bondi has definitely made multiple inconsistent statements, and I'm sorry, but she does not deserve the benefit of my good opinion, and I'm not prepared to give it to her.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Camp is a place where girls learn to be courageous. Can it stay that way?

A few specific sounds punctuate summer evenings in rural Iowa. A chorus of spring peepers, for example, or the shrill conk-la-ree of a red-winged blackbird on the side of a county road. But only one demands a response: the hostile, metallic beep of a NOAA weather radio.

For 25 years, my mother ran Camp L-Kee-Ta, a small Girl Scout camp in the southeastern part of the state, which meant that, every summer, she was responsible for the safety of 64 girls and a staff of 20 young adults. At the first declaration of a tornado warning, Mom would walkie the counselors, instructing them to move their campers indoors. She'd ring the camp's cast-iron bell as the wind began to howl. And, because my family lived on-site, she'd toss me in the truck before driving from the cabins at Hickory Hills to the huts at Trail's End, checking for stragglers. Within minutes, we'd all convene in the basement of the Troop House, the largest camp building, a few dozen girls sitting cross-legged on the concrete floor with snacks and songbooks. I don't recall much crying in these moments as the storm raged above us. Mainly, I remember singing.

Camp felt safe, in the literal sense but also the figurative one; there, girls could challenge themselves, free from the judgment of the outside world. At camp, we—for several summers, I was a camper too—learned to dive, to build a fire, to make friends. We practiced our courage and resilience, how to skin our knees and keep on hiking, how to carefully extract a tick. Even when disaster sent us underground, we were always ultimately okay. It was good for campers to be a little uncomfortable and homesick. These moments were and are the purpose of camp—preparation for the trials of real-world life.

View: Deadly flooding in Texas

And what I haven't been able to stop thinking about is the unfathomable tragedy that, last week in the Texas Hill Country, at least a dozen little girls lost their lives while they were learning how to be brave.

Camp leaders across the country can't stop thinking about it, either. “It is quite literally our worst nightmare,” Georgia Del Favero, a co-director of Camp Birchwood, a Minnesota summer camp for girls, told me. Right now, hundreds of camps, including Del Favero's, are in the middle of a summer session, or are about to welcome a new busload of children for three days or a week or a month. Moving forward requires accepting that, at camp as in life, we can make plans and follow guidelines, but even then, “we can't always prevent tragedy.”

Camp Mystic is a Christian camp, and one of several summer camps dotting the Guadalupe River in central Texas. It's a century-old, sprawling complex with two campuses and a range of activities on offer, including horseback riding, riflery, and synchronized swimming. Last week's flood came only a few days into a month-long summer session, and hundreds of campers were spread out across several cabins. When the rain began in earnest, early on the morning of July 4, most of those campers were still asleep.

Elizabeth Bruenig: An inhospitable land

Details about what happened next are murky, and news reports are difficult for those unfamiliar with the camp layout to follow. What comes through most clearly, at least to me, is the charm of Mystic's site names, instantly recognizable to anyone with camp experience: Senior Hill, where older girls stayed and were safe from the rising river; the Giggle Box and Wiggle Inn cabins in the lower part of camp, where girls were able to ride out the flood or evacuate; the Bubble Inn cabin, full of little girls who couldn't. What comes through, as well, is the heroism of Mystic's staff, who smashed cabin windows to push their campers outside, carried girls on their backs, and wrote campers' names in Sharpie on their arms in case they were swept away in the flood. Dick Eastland, a longtime co-director of the camp, navigated his truck through the dark water and died trying to save the girls at Bubble Inn.

Many children currently attending summer camp still have no idea that any of this has occurred. Lots of camps follow a no-phones policy that provides kids a psychological haven from the noise of modern life. But their parents have seen the news, and camp-office phones nationwide have been ringing for days. It's hard to know what to tell parents, Ariella Rogge, who oversees the High Trails Ranch camp for girls, in Colorado, told me. You can help to calm a parent's fears by outlining the stringent safety standards most camps follow or the staff's extensive disaster-preparedness training. Still, 10 girls from Texas are set to attend Rogge's camp this week, and some of their parents are understandably unnerved, she said. “My husband didn't go to camp, I didn't go to camp, and I am incredibly risk-averse,” one mother told her, according to Rogge. Then again, the mother said, “this is what my daughter has been dreaming about all year.”

Rogge isn't sure whether that mother will still send her daughter to camp next week. But she hopes so. She's trying to help anxious parents recognize that two things can be true. “You can know this is going to be a really great experience for your daughter, and that she's going to have all this personal growth,” Rogge said, “and you can be really nervous and scared.” Camp directors like Rogge and Del Favero will use this moment to review their safety procedures and communicate them to concerned parents; they'll train counselors on how to comfort anxious campers. Some camps might need to reevaluate cabin locations or work with local officials to install effective weather-warning systems, which didn't exist near Mystic. But my hope is that people won't use this tragedy as an occasion to bubble-wrap their kids, or to take away from their child the chance at a life-changing summer.

Stephanie Bai: The Texas-flood blame game is a distraction

This week, I called my mom to ask what she would say to parents if she were still directing camp. “I'd show them how we mitigate risk,” she told me. But then, she said, she'd tell them all the stories: of the girls who'd been shy before camp and who, by week's end, bloomed with confidence; of the campers who cooked themselves dinner for the first time under a starry sky; of the little girl who fell from a horse, went to the hospital, and demanded to immediately be brought back to camp.

When Mom and I spoke about the Mystic campers, we talked less about the tragedy itself, and more about all the times when we were sure that they'd been brave. How, woken by the sound of thunder, girls might have climbed down from their bunks and gathered their bunkmates with urgent voices. How they might have waited one extra minute for a new friend to grab a flashlight or a teddy. How afraid they probably were, but also how determined, as they waded together into the muddy water.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

It could actually make them safer.

A bunny, small enough to nestle in a cereal bowl, has recently started hanging out in my backyard. Now and again, it nibbles a plant or lies in the sun. Mostly, it explores the limits of movement, zooming, darting, feinting, and trundling through bushes. Once, I saw it corner so hard that it sprayed mulch in a giant, messy arc. A human kid who did that would almost certainly be called inside to clean up. But I haven't seen the adults in this bunny's life in weeks; the baby has carte blanche. If only more of the kids I know could be so lucky.

Wild animals are the best movers on the planet, and little ones spend much of their time frolicking, fighting, leaping, and climbing. From birth, human children share animals' potential for wild movement; left to their own devices, they would presumably tumble about like puppies. But more and more, they do nothing of the sort.

This is due in part to the human trend toward self-domestication, and also to the structure of modern society. The World Health Organization says that 81 percent of adolescents worldwide do not get enough physical activity, noting that rates of sedentary behavior in young people tend to rise as their country develops economically. In some American cities, the Trust for Public Land says, as many as two-thirds of children lack access to the kinds of nearby parks that would encourage free play. And a report by the Aspen Institute's Project Play initiative, a national program aimed at increasing youth-sports participation, concluded that compared with other activities, such as organized sports, “free play is all but a thing of the past.”

Some kids lack access to woods, fields, and other open spaces where they might romp free. Some have parents who forbid that brand of tomfoolery. In the United States, many parents habitually tamp down on horseplay out of fear of injury to their children (or their furniture)—or because social norms dictate that they get their squiggly kids unsquiggled and into waiting rooms, subways, stores, airplanes, and restaurants, where children are expected to “behave.” That impulse, however, risks reinforcing the notion that sedentariness is preferable at a time in a kid's life when they really do need to move.

Read: A classic childhood pastime is fading

Turn over almost any rock in the stream of health research, and you'll find warnings about the dire consequences of idleness, as well as abundant reasons for children to explore free movement. Children who move have healthier bones, muscles, and joints, and lower their future risk of obesity and chronic disease. Research has found that active kids develop superior cognitive skills, get better grades, and are more likely to stay on task than kids who are less active. In a systematic review of studies, researchers found that active children are more likely to report feelings of well-being. And a study published in The Lancet that examined the prevalence of adolescent depression among English youth suggested that increased sedentary behavior in adolescence could affect a person's mental health into adulthood.

Childhood might be a particularly costly time to not move, because this is when developing brains prune unused potential. “One extreme view” of this neurological dwindling “would be that you start out wired up for every possible contingency,” the Harvard neuroscientist Jeff Lichtman said in an article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences—but as you age, unused connections in the brain get permanently disconnected through a process known as synaptic pruning, leaving you with “a narrower nervous system.” We're used to the idea that young, plastic brains have an easy time learning to speak Mandarin or play piano; this is also true of learning how to do backflips, balance on a slackline, or throw a fastball.

Parents go to great lengths to keep kids safe; it's the core of the job. But restricting kids from encountering tricky movement problems, such as racing at full speed down a rocky slope or climbing high in a tree, can exact a toll. As Marcus Elliott, a physician and one of the world's most prominent injury-prevention experts, put it to me: “Your fear that your kid will get hurt is depriving them of something they'll never get back.”

Elliott runs the Peak Performance Project, known as P3, a movement lab in Santa Barbara, California, where many athletes—a huge percentage of NBA, NFL, and MLB players—have been found to be at risk of injury because of deficiencies in their movement quality. P3's researchers focus on “kinematic movers,” whose bodies have a ready solution to almost any movement problem: They can land on either one foot or two, jump every which way, and change directions easily. They're not always the highest jumpers or the fastest sprinters, but, at least among a well-studied cohort, they are likely to play for a long time without injury.

This is why Elliott recommends that children play like animals: He suspects that every adult kinematic mover grew up playing freely like that fuzzball in my backyard. The robustness necessary to repel injury has little to do with getting in cardio, running fast, or jumping high. Instead, he says, robustness has to do with “movement quality,” which is to athleticism as fluency is to language.

This tracks with an observation made by the journalist David Epstein, who writes in Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World that athletes from tiny towns have irrational levels of success. Epstein's theory is that with a shortage of players, small towns need the best athletes on the football, baseball, and basketball teams. Playing a variety of sports might foster a person's robust movement vocabularies.

Thankfully, providing kids with more freedom doesn't require a lot of money. Mostly, it just requires a little creativity.

Read: How the coronavirus is influencing children's play

Almost every kid who comes into my house feels a deep urge to romp on the huge yoga ball in our living room (which cost less than $20). They body slam it, Superman across its top, throw a sibling into it, and do other bonkers stuff. Many parents who witness such behavior grow anxious, shout bossy directives, or declare the ball off-limits entirely. Of course, I understand; no one wants to end up at urgent care. But I'm also aware that kids who start out falling down go on to quickly develop new skills. Some blossom into pro-grade yoga-ball surfers. When my son was young, he developed an uncanny ability to perch on all fours atop the ball even as someone (honestly: me) forcibly shoved him this way and that. He's now a 6-foot-1-inch engineering undergrad; we have not outgrown this game.

Elliott told me that when work would keep him on the laptop during weekend afternoons, he'd give his kids small physical challenges: Can you hop on your left leg all the way across here, and then clear that hurdle? Can you step off that ledge, land, and leap right back up? One of his daughters remembers earning dessert by hopping a giant lap of the backyard on her left foot. Elliott and his children also wrestle one another like puppies do. In this way, he explained, his kids learn how to perform complex movements while keeping one another safe—by, say, avoiding the corner of the coffee table.

All of this free play can help when kids start taking up play of a more serious kind. Many sports injuries come from iffy form when landing. Kinematic movers do well, Elliott's lab has found, because they land with active feet that greet the ground, as well as ankles, knees, and hips that flex nicely in time with one another—perhaps because these movers practiced so much free play as kids. P3's trainers spend long hours putting athletes through the grueling work of mastering landing technique as teenagers or adults, remedial lessons that appear to have a big impact. A 2022 study found that ACL-injury-prevention training, which generally includes landing and explosive movement, reduced ACL tears by an average of 64 percent among young female athletes. (This aligns with research on ballet dancers, among the few groups who train from a young age to land properly. They may sustain plenty of sprains and other overuse injuries, but they also have a striking shortage of ACL tears compared with other athletes who jump as much.)

Eric Leidersdorf, a movement scientist and the president of P3, has more than a decade's worth of experience poring over the movement data of elite athletes. He also has an 18-month-old daughter. I asked him if he intends to apply the lessons of his day job to parenting. “Absolutely,” he replied. He then used the word play 10 times in two minutes. “My real hope is that she explores the world,” Leidersdorf told me. “I want her to love moving and find joy in that.” I know a bunny that probably gets it.

Panelists discuss how Trump's disaster relief in Texas has differed from previous administrations.

Donald Trump has wrapped up his tour of central Texas, where he met with state officials and those affected by last week's devastating floods. Panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic joined to discuss the role of federal agencies and emergency disaster response under the second Trump administration.

What presidents from Bill Clinton on have frequently done in response to emergency disasters is “find ways to connect with people on the ground” and “show that they're not only going to bring resources from the federal government, but they understand their plight,” Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times, said last night. “And that's just not where Trump is. He is sometimes very good at mobilizing resources, but he is not good, I think, at connecting with people who are in pain.”

Although the president “was more empathetic than we've seen him in the past,” Tarini Parti, a White House reporter at The Wall Street Journal, added, he was still looking to “tout his administration's response.” Unlike other administrations, she continued, Trump has chosen to scale back his federal response, instead relying on state and local officials.

Joining Ashley Parker, a guest moderator and a staff writer at The Atlantic, to discuss this and more: Zolan Kanno-Youngs, a White House correspondent for The New York Times; Tarini Parti, a White House reporter at The Wall Street Journal; Nancy Youssef, a staff writer at The Atlantic; and Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times.

Florida couple Dillon Angulo and Naibel Benavides Leon were stargazing alongside a Key Largo road in 2019 when a Tesla Model S blew past a stop sign and a flashing red light at a three-way intersection and plowed into a parked SUV.

Benavides Leon, 22, was killed and Angulo was seriously injured.

The Tesla's driver, George McGee, had Autopilot mode engaged at the time. He later said he had dropped his cell phone during a call and bent down to pick it up moments before his Tesla — without warning — T-boned Angulo's mother's Chevrolet Tahoe at about 60-miles-per-hour, according to court papers.

""Oh my God, I wasn't looking,"" McGee told a 911 operator after the April 25, 2019, crash, a judge's ruling said. ""I looked down and I've been using cruise control.""

Is Tesla and its Autopilot driver-assist system, which allows the vehicle to steer itself, switch lanes, brake, and accelerate on its own, to blame for the deadly collision?

A Miami federal jury will soon consider that in a civil trial set to open Monday in the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

Benavides Leon's family said in court filings that the impact of the crash threw the young woman about 75 feet.

At the trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, Tesla's safety features will once again come under the microscope. The electric-car company headed by billionaire Elon Musk could ultimately be ordered to pay out steep monetary damages if a jury finds it liable in the crash.

Lawyers for Tesla didn't immediately return a request for comment by Business Insider for this story, while attorneys for Benavides Leon's family and Angulo declined to comment.

Benavides Leon's estate initially sued Tesla over the crash in 2021 in Florida state court before the case was moved to federal court.

In March 2024, Benavides Leon's estate and Angulo filed an amended wrongful death complaint against Tesla, arguing in court papers that Tesla's vehicles were ""defective and unsafe for their intended use.""

Tesla, the lawsuit said, programmed Autopilot ""to allow it to be used on roadways that Tesla knew were not suitable for its use and knew this would result in collisions causing injuries and deaths of innocent people who did not choose to be a part of Tesla's experiments, such as Plaintiffs.""

""Despite knowing of Autopilot's deficiencies, Tesla advertised Autopilot in a way that greatly exaggerated its capabilities and hid its deficiencies,"" said the lawsuit, which pointed to multiple comments from Musk touting the safety and reliability of the software.

US District Judge Beth Bloom, who is overseeing the case, said last month in a 98-page order that the plaintiff's lawsuit can move ahead on design defect and failure to warn claims against Tesla. Bloom, however, sided with Tesla on the suit's claims of manufacturing defect and negligent misrepresentation and dismissed them.

Additionally, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs can seek punitive damages at trial.

""A reasonable jury could find that Tesla acted in reckless disregard of human life for the sake of developing their product and maximizing profit,"" Bloom wrote in her order.

Bloom said in her decision that the plaintiffs provided enough evidence ""affording a reasonable basis to conclude that, more likely than not, a defect in the Autopilot system was a substantial factor"" in the victims' injuries.

Tesla's attorneys have argued in court papers that McGee was solely responsible for the crash and that the collision could have been avoided by an ""attentive driver.""

The company says on its website that Autopilot mode is ""intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.""

""While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous,"" it says.

Although Autopilot is designed to detect vehicles and obstacles, Tesla adds on its website that it is a driver's ""responsibility to always perform visual checks to make sure it is safe and appropriate to move into the target lane.""

The judge said in her ruling that while McGee, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, conceded that he was responsible for operating his 2019 Tesla ""safely and failed to do so, that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he alone is responsible for the resulting collision, particularly given McGee's testimony that he expected Autopilot to avoid the collision.""

Benavides Leon's estate and Angulo, the judge wrote, ""have adequately demonstrated that Autopilot's design led Tesla drivers, and McGee in particular, to become complacent and over rely on Autopilot to operate their vehicles.""

McGee said in his deposition that he thought of Autopilot as a ""copilot"" and believed it would keep him in the lane, avoid crashes and direct him where he needed to go, according to Bloom's ruling. McGee previously settled a separate lawsuit with the plaintiffs.

In recent years, Tesla has faced multiple lawsuits over its Autopilot driver-assist software and has come under increased scrutiny from regulators regarding the technology.

The carmaker, however, won two lawsuits in 2023 involving crashes where Autopilot was in use.

In one case — the first US trial over accusations that Tesla's Autopilot was responsible for a fatal crash — a California state jury found that Tesla was not liable for the 2019 incident that killed Tesla Model 3 owner, Micha Lee, and injured two passengers.

An attorney for Tesla argued at the trial that ""classic human error"" caused Lee's vehicle to veer off a highway. ""Autopilot makes a road safer. It is a good thing,"" the lawyer said.

Last year, Tesla settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the family of Apple engineer Walter Huang, who was killed in a 2018 fiery wreck when his Tesla Model X SUV smashed into a concrete barrier on a California highway as the vehicle was in Autopilot mode.

The case was settled for an undisclosed amount at the 11th hour, just before jury selection in the trial was set to begin.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","xAI apologized for Grok's 'horrific' rant, and blamed the chatbot's new instructions and 'extremist' X user posts","https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-grok-antisemitic-rant-sorry-apology-code-extremist-elon-musk-2025-7","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 13:02:00 GMT","

xAI has apologized for Grok's ""horrific behavior"" and said that new instructions caused the AI chatbot to prioritize engagement, even if that meant reflecting ""extremist views"" from user posts on X.

Elon Musk's AI company said in a Saturday X post, using the official Grok account, that it had removed the ""deprecated"" code and ""refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse.""

On Saturday morning, Musk reposted the statement on his X account.

During a 16-hour rant starting at about 11 p.m. Pacific Time on July 7, Grok made inflammatory comments on X that included antisemitic jokes and praising Adolf Hitler.

Grok is integrated into X so that users can interact with the chatbot by tagging it. xAI said it disabled that functionality on July 8 ""due to increased abusive usage"" of Grok.

Inside xAI, workers training Grok have expressed anger and disillusionment with the chatbot's behavior, Business Insider exclusively reported Friday.

xAI said in its Saturday post that the code update was ""independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok,"" and that no other services relying on the large language model underpinning Grok were affected.

​​xAI said its investigation found the following new instructions for Grok caused the ""undesired behavior"":

The update caused Grok to prioritize engaging replies, even if they contained ""unethical or controversial opinions,"" xAI said.

The instructions meant Grok followed the ""tone and context"" of the X post in which it was tagged. So, if a user tagged Grok in an X post talking about Hitler, the chatbot would mimic that.

Grok's inflammatory posts came days before xAI launched the next version of the chatbot, Grok 4, which touts improved reasoning abilities.

The latest version of the AI chatbot has a favorite source on some hot-topic issues. When asked about immigration and conflict in the Middle East, it cited Musk's views, tests by BI confirmed.

On Thursday, Musk said Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles ""very soon.""

xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Across his numerous companies, Musk is not one to shy away from risk-taking — even when failure could mean a publicity nightmare.

With xAI, Musk has deployed Grok directly into X, where users can summon it to respond at any time. It means that, unlike rivals such as OpenAI, where user interactions largely stay private, xAI's behavior — good or bad — is in full view of the world.

The AI company also shares Grok's system prompt publicly on the code repository GitHub. It's a level of openness not shared by many of xAI's competitors, but also exposes it to greater scrutiny when things go wrong.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, took a distinctly different approach on Friday, announcing that his company would delay the launch of open-weight models — systems where certain parameters are public — to run additional safety tests.

Powell has resisted pressure to ease monetary policy and said he won't step down if asked by the president, given the Fed's independence.

President Donald Trump's potential dismissal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a major and underpriced risk that could trigger a selloff in the US dollar and Treasuries, a Deutsche Bank AG strategist said.

Trump this week said Powell should “resign immediately,” if allegations from an administration official that the central banker misled lawmakers over renovations to the Fed's headquarters prove true. The remark added to growing criticism of the Fed chair by Trump, who has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts and signaled he may nominate a successor before Powell's term ends.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

While US President Donald Trump's chaotic tariff strategy has disrupted the oil market for months, his renewed attacks on trading partners this week have solidified consensus on at least one matter: The outlook for crude demand is set to worsen.

Investors in oil had largely overlooked trade news for weeks as the conflict in the Middle East commanded price action, but Trump's recent barrage of tariff letters — containing some of the highest tax rates yet — is reviving concerns that a global trade war will reduce crude consumption.

Trump's Tariffs:

India's prime minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump during a news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13.

The US is working toward an interim trade deal with India that may reduce its proposed tariffs to below 20%, people familiar with the matter said, putting the South Asian nation in a favorable position against its peers in the region.

The interim deal would allow for continued talks, giving New Delhi space to resolve outstanding issues ahead of a broader agreement expected this fall, they said.

President Donald Trump defended the state and federal response to deadly flash flooding in Texas on Friday as he visited the stricken Hill Country region, where at least 120 people, including dozens of children, perished a week ago.

During a roundtable discussion after touring Kerr County, the epicenter of the disaster, Trump praised both Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for their response, saying they both did an ""incredible job.""

The Trump administration, as well as local and state officials, has faced mounting questions over whether more could have been done to protect and warn residents ahead of the flooding, which struck with astonishing speed in the pre-dawn hours on July 4, the U.S. Independence Day holiday.

Trump reacted with anger when a reporter said some families affected by the floods had expressed frustration that warnings did not go out sooner.

""I think everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances,"" he said. ""I don't know who you are, but only a very evil person would ask a question like that.""

Some critics have questioned whether the administration's spending cuts at the National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates the U.S. government's disaster response efforts, might have exacerbated the calamity.

Trump officials have said that cuts had no impact on the NWS's ability to forecast the storms, despite some vacancies in local offices.

But the president has largely sidestepped questions about his plans to shrink or abolish FEMA and reassign many of its key functions to state and local governments.

""I'll tell you some other time,"" Trump said on Tuesday, when asked by a reporter about FEMA.

Before the most recent flooding, Kerr County declined to install an early-warning system after failing to secure state money to cover the cost.

Lawrence Walker, 67, and a nearly three-decade veteran resident of Kerrville, said the county and state had not spent enough on disaster prevention, including an early-warning system. 

Asked about the quality of the government response, he said, ""It's been fine since the water was at 8 feet.""

The Texas state legislature will convene in a special session later this month to investigate the flooding and provide disaster relief funding.

Abbott has dismissed questions about whether anyone was to blame, calling that the ""word choice of losers.""

Search teams on Friday were still combing through muddy debris littering parts of the Hill Country in central Texas, looking for the dozens still listed as missing, but no survivors have been found since the day of the floods.

Heavy rains sent a wall of water raging down the Guadalupe River early on July 4, causing the deadliest disaster of the Republican president's nearly six-month term in office.

As sun poked through dark clouds on Friday morning, search crews in hard hats painstakingly walked inch-by-inch along the ruined banks of the river, marking damage and looking through wreckage.

After the president arrived in Kerr County in the early afternoon, Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott drove to an area near the river, where Trump received a briefing from first responders amid debris left in the wake of the flood.

The county is located in what is known as ""flash flood alley,"" a region that has seen some of the country's deadliest floods. 

More than a foot of rain fell in less than an hour on July 4. Flood gauges showed the river's height rose from about a foot to 34 feet (10.4 meters) in a matter of hours, cascading over its banks and sweeping away trees and structures in its path.

Kerr County officials say more than 160 people remain unaccounted for, although experts say that the number of people reported missing in the wake of disasters is often inflated.

The dead in the county include 67 adults and at least 36 children, many of whom were campers at the nearly century-old Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer retreat on the banks of the river.

Jon Moreno, 71, a longtime Kerrville resident whose property on high ground was spared, praised the government response - local and federal.

He has heard the debate about what more could have been done - including sirens - but said he did not think it would have made much difference, given people's desire to build along the flood-prone riverbanks.

""It's unavoidable,"" he said. ""All those people along the river - I wouldn't want to live there ... It's too dangerous.""

At Stripes, a gas station in Kerrville, the building was tagged in large white letters, accusing ""Trump's Big Beautiful Bill"" of cutting ""our emergency funding."" 

The president's massive legislative package, which cut taxes and spending, won approval from the Republican-controlled Congress last week and was signed into law by Trump on the same day that the flooding hit Texas.

Thyssenkrupp and trade union IG Metall on Saturday said they had agreed on reduced working hours, lower bonus payments and site closures as part of a push to revamp Germany's largest steelmaker.

The accord with steel workers marks a major step in Thyssenkrupp's restructuring, under which the former German industrial icon is planning to turn into a holding company, and comes after renewed tension between management and labour representatives.

Implementation of the new collective bargaining agreement, which runs until September 30, 2030, must be approved by IG Metall members at Thyssenkrupp's steel unit TKSE and is pending an agreement on the division's future financing, they said.

The agreement follows Thyssenkrupp's announcement that up to 11,000 jobs at the steel unit, TKSE, had to be cut or outsourced and that annual production capacity would be lowered to 8.7-9.0 million tons from 11.5 million tons.

""We went to the pain threshold and only made concessions where it was really necessary in order to secure jobs and locations,"" said Tekin Nasikkol, head of Thyssenkrupp's works council and member of the group's supervisory board.

""We have now created the conditions for the company to emerge from the difficult situation out of its own strength,"" Nasikkol said in a statement.

Thyssenkrupp had wanted to reach a deal regarding the restructuring by summer and both sides aim to finalise the current agreement by the end of September.

Reaching a wage deal has been seen as a key hurdle to be cleared before Thyssenkrupp can sell an additional 30% stake in TKSE to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, as planned. The investor already owns a 20% stake via a holding company.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","These college majors have the best job prospects — and they aren't what students expect","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/12/college-majors-employment-prospects.html","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 10:30:01 GMT","



For many students, majoring in finance is a proven pathway to a well-paying career and job security.

In fact, U.S. graduates believe that finance offers the best career prospects overall, considering today's economic climate, according to a new survey by the CFA Institute, a non-profit focused on financial education. The group polled more than 9,000 current college students and recent graduates between the ages of 18 and 25.

While confidence about career prospects in finance increased over the past year, confidence decreased in other areas including STEM and healthcare, the CFA Institute also found.

However, finance ranks well behind many other majors when it comes to employment opportunities after college, other data shows.

""For me, a career in finance represents a pivot to stability,"" said Rafael Perez, 29, who is pursuing a Master of Science degree in finance at California State University in Sacramento. ""I've been a creative my entire life, so discovering my affinity for finance was a relief in a sense."" 

Perez says he still experiences some pushback from his peers. ""When I tell people I'm getting an MS in finance, they often jokingly call me a 'finance bro,'"" he said. ""Despite the negative connotations of the phrase, it also reflects an expectation of financial success and prestige.""

Students and their families are paying more attention to which college majors are most likely to pay off, and are putting greater emphasis on a degree's return on investment, according to Peter Watkins, CFA Institute's senior director of university programs. ""There's an awareness from students that they have to make sure the degrees will make them work-ready,"" he said.

As young adults enter the real world, they are facing an increasingly tight labor market.

According to a recent analysis of labor market conditions for recent college graduates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, job opportunities ""deteriorated noticeably in the first quarter of 2025."" Among this group, the unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% — the highest reading since 2021.

Although finance majors had higher salaries compared to most other majors, grads with nutrition, art history and philosophy degrees all outperformed both finance and STEM fields when it comes to employment prospects, the New York Fed found.

For finance and computer science, the unemployment rate in those fields was 3.7% and 6.1%, respectively. By comparison, the unemployment rate for art history majors was 3%, and for nutritional sciences, the unemployment rate was just 0.4%, the New York Fed found.

After notching significant gains since 2020, the rise of computer science majors came to a near standstill this year, other reports show, fueled by concerns that artificial intelligence is rapidly taking over jobs in the field.

Economics majors also fared worse than majors such as theology and philosophy when it came to the employment rates for recent college graduates, according to the New York Fed. Philosophy majors have an unemployment rate of 3.2%, for example, and for economics, it's 4.9%.

The New York Fed's report was based on Census data from 2023 and unemployment rates of recent college graduates.

The disconnect between the New York Fed's outcomes by major and the CFA survey findings — which is based on perceptions — is likely due in part to societal expectations, particularly from parents, Watkins said. ""It may possibly be parental guidance, as in, 'go for business,'"" he said.

Meanwhile, demand for humanities majors is on the rise, and with good reason.

At a conference last year, Robert Goldstein, the chief operating officer of BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, said the firm was adjusting its hiring strategy for recent grads. ""We have more and more conviction that we need people who majored in history, in English, and things that have nothing to do with finance or technology,"" Goldstein said.

This demand for liberal arts degrees is fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, which drives the need for creative thinking and so-called soft skills. 

""It's a bit of a gold rush in AI, people who are adopting quickly are going to succeed quickly,"" Watkins said.

Many couples see intimacy as a ""nice to have"" in relationships. It's sweet when it's there, but not essential. This is especially true after the honeymoon period wears off. As a sex therapist and psychotherapist with over two decades of experience, I'm here to tell you that's wrong.

Intimacy is the heartbeat of a thriving relationship. When intimacy breaks down, it doesn't just affect your connection with a partner, it can impact your career, friendships, and physical health. It influences how you lead, communicate, make decisions, and feel about yourself. Clients often come to therapy for stress, anxiety, or performance issues at work, only for us to uncover intimacy gaps as the deeper source of misalignment. 

Intimacy, to bust another myth, is more than just getting laid or knowing the right positions. It's about being open, honest, vulnerable, and real and allowing someone else to be the same with you.

Many of the biggest intimacy blockers are hiding in plain sight. Here are four surprising things that quietly kill intimacy — and what to do about them:

It's tough to connect with someone when your brain is having a love affair with your phone. Even quick glances at notifications can break the emotional flow and send the message: ""I'm not fully here.""

Ask your partner how they feel when one or both of you are on your phone, laptop, iPad, or other screens. How does it affect your connection? You might be surprised by how much it matters.

Come up with a few simple boundaries together. It could be as simple as designating screen-free zones, like the bedroom and couch, or at specific times, like during meals or before bed. 

I know it may feel like a punishment but I promise it's not! Being present is the foundation of true intimacy. 

Whether you're comparing someone new to your ex or haven't fully processed the end of a past relationship, that lingering attachment can leave little room for connecting with anyone else.

Take an honest look at yourself. Are you still mentally or emotionally entangled with your ex? Closure isn't about forgetting them, it's about reclaiming your energy.

Be kind and give yourself permission to grieve what was lost and reflect on what that relationship taught you. Journal your uncensored thoughts, talk it out with a therapist, or (my old favorite) write a letter to your ex that you won't send. 

If you're holding on to physical reminders such as texts, photos, or gifts, consider letting them go to create space for what's next.

The goal here is to notice how often they're taking up mental real estate, and to practice gently redirecting your focus to what is happening in the here and now. That includes your needs, your growth, and the person in front of you.

You tell yourself they're not interested. You assume you're too much or not enough. Meanwhile, they might be having the same doubts.

These protective thoughts are normal, but unhelpful and may be a little distorted. They can cause us to self-reject before giving intimacy a chance.

Start by noticing the thought. When something negative pops up, ask yourself: 

Just because a thought feels true doesn't mean it is, even if those suckers can be very convincing! One of the most powerful tools from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to evaluate your thoughts instead of accepting them at face value.

Then try reframing. Ask yourself: 

For example, instead of, ""They're probably not into me,"" the reframe might be: ""I'm not sure how they feel yet, and I don't have to figure it out all at once. I can be present and see where this goes.""

In sex therapy, we use the dual control model: Every person has ""accelerators,"" or things that turn them on, and ""brakes,"" which are things that shut them down. 

For some people, stress ramps up desire. For others, it's a full stop. If you fall into the latter group, stress from anywhere in your life — your job, a parent's illness, an unexpected bill — might be getting in the way. 

Track your patterns. Do you feel more open or closed off when stressed? Understanding your unique wiring, you can talk to your partner about it in a way that brings you closer.

Try something like: ""I've noticed that when I'm overwhelmed, I need to feel supported before I can feel connected. I'm not rejecting you. I'm just maxed out. Helping with dinner or giving me time to reset really helps.""

You might want to cuddle on the couch, take a walk, or talk about what's on your mind. Intimacy is more than just sex. Small moments of closeness count.

Be curious about your partner's accelerators and brakes, too. Ask what helps them feel connected, supported, and seen. These conversations don't have to be perfect. They just need to be honest. That kind of exchange is intimacy in action.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","BTC, ETH, XRP Price News: Bitcoin, Ether Tentative, XRP Steady as Trump Announces 30% Tariff on EU and Mexico","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/12/bitcoin-ether-tentative-xrp-steady-as-trump-announces-30-tariff-on-eu-and-mexico","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 13:41:42 GMT","

Major cryptocurrencies, excluding XRP, registered moderate losses as President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from Mexico and the European Union (EU).

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

""Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal.

Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal.

Bitcoin BTC$117,400.53, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $117,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $118,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multiple times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing.

The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend.

""Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today. Then Asia comes in late on Sunday evening and buys ALL the Bitcoin, and we break through $120k,"" the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said on X.

Key Points

Do you want to invest in crypto today? Two of the most popular options include investing in the leading digital currency Bitcoin (BTC -0.12%) or a company that can't stop loading up on Bitcoins: MicroStrategy (MSTR 3.00%).

Bitcoin has grown in popularity and is now in the mainstream, with its valuation rivaling many of the top companies in the world. Many analysts remain bullish on more growth ahead for the crypto markets, with Bitcoin leading the charge.

MicroStrategy, which has rebranded itself as Strategy, isn't a cryptocurrency. However, given its egregious valuation, which is disconnected from its revenue and earnings numbers, it trades more like a digital currency than a stock. 

Speculation plays a big role in its valuation, and as Bitcoin has risen in value, so has Strategy. What may surprise you is that over the past five years, Strategy has outperformed Bitcoin by a wide margin. 

Which is the better investment option if you're still bullish on crypto's long-term growth potential? Bitcoin or Strategy?

Image source: Getty Images.

Bitcoin is the most popular and most valuable digital currency in the world. As of July 7, its market cap was $2.1 trillion. The next-closest cryptocurrency is Ethereum, with a valuation of just $306 billion.

Investing in Bitcoin has been synonymous with investing in crypto. Going with the top digital currency is arguably the safest way for investors to do so.

While there are more modestly valued cryptocurrencies out there, they come with much greater risk. With Bitcoin maturing and becoming more mainstream, investors don't even need to worry about long passwords and digital wallets anymore. By simply investing in a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), it's easier than ever to add it to your portfolio.

Plus, U.S. President Donald Trump is looking to enact more favorable crypto policies, and Bitcoin may stand to benefit the most from those trends since it's the most recognizable coin in the world. Holding Bitcoin or a spot Bitcoin ETF can be a great way to benefit from crypto's growth.

Over the past five years, the cryptocurrency has amassed gains of more than 1,000%, and there's still room for it to rise higher. Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes that the digital currency could hit a price of $1.5 million by 2030. 

Strategy is bullish on the price of Bitcoin, as well. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor is often the cryptocurrency's best spokesperson, talking up the high expectations he has for crypto. He believes Bitcoin could hit a value of $13 million by 2045. 

It's little wonder, then, why Strategy has continued to load up on Bitcoins, as it has benefited from the digital currency's rising valuation over the years. The company had nearly 600,000 Bitcoins as of the end of June, as it adds to its position on a regular basis. 

Because Strategy is being led by a big Bitcoin bull, it's been a hot buy with investors, who may still prefer to invest in a stock than a spot ETF or digital currency. In five years, Strategy's stock has soared more than 3,200%.

Strategy's advantage is that it can invest in other cryptocurrencies. While right now, its focus is clearly to load up on Bitcoins, it may not stay that way forever. If there are changing market conditions in crypto, it has the freedom to diversify or pivot to other assets.

It's also a top Nasdaq stock, so it's also included within the Nasdaq 100 index, which means it's included in many professionally managed portfolios. While fund managers may be hesitant to invest in Bitcoin directly, they may invest in the Nasdaq 100, which will give Strategy's stock a boost.

Both Bitcoin and Strategy are risky and speculative investments. Even though Strategy is involved with business intelligence, that's not what moves the needle for the crypto stock. The company's revenue has actually been declining in recent years -- it's now largely a crypto play.

Strategy has a big crypto enthusiast in Saylor and has been stockpiling Bitcoins. It's also more easily traded and included in more portfolios and has the flexibility to hold other digital currencies. Therefore, it's a more compelling crypto investment today than directly buying Bitcoin. If you have a high risk tolerance and want significant exposure to crypto, Strategy is the better cryptocurrency option to consider for your portfolio.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Altcoins are rocketing, Bitcoin dominance hasn't ‘even sneezed': Analyst","https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-crypto-market-surging-bitcoin-dominance-analyst","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 05:11:56 GMT","

 Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland suggests altcoins will be “ripping” much more when Bitcoin Dominance drops to 45%. 

A crypto analyst suggests altcoins may have plenty more upside, as many are already surging without pulling much market share from Bitcoin.

“BTC dominance hasn't even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in an X post on Friday. 

TradingView shows Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance is 64.46% at the time of publication, down just 1.53% over the past week, while altcoins saw significant price spikes amid Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs on Wednesday, Thursday, and reaching $118,760 on Friday.

Hyland said, “What do you think happens if it drops from 65 to 45.”

Analysts have traditionally used Bitcoin Dominance to gauge the timing of altcoin season, with a decline typically seen as a signal that altcoins are gaining market share.

However, while BTC Dominance stayed relatively steady, the recent altcoin surge could signal that fresh capital is flowing into the wider market.

MemeCore (M) leads the top 100 crypto gainers over the past seven days with a 1,263% surge, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75.01%, and Stellar (XLM) up 67.43%, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, is up 17.68% over the past seven days, which is often another indicator traders use to determine when the focus is turning from Bitcoin to the broader market.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's relative strength against Bitcoin, is up 8.39% over the past seven days.

However, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index suggests the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin, with the Index reading a “Bitcoin Season” score of 29 out of 100. 

In an X post on Friday, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said, “I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.”

Meanwhile, Santiment recently said that their metrics indicate that the altcoin season has begun. “The data confirms that, for now, it has,” Santiment said.

“As long as Bitcoin can maintain its position above the crucial psychological support level of around $110k, traders will likely feel comfortable redistributing profits into altcoins,” they added.

Bitcoin has rocketed higher this week, soaring after Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirmed a bitcoin bombshell.

The bitcoin price has hit a new all-time high of almost $119,000 per bitcoin—lifting Ripple's XRP, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies that have surged toward a combined market capitalization of $4 trillion—as the Wall Street “floodgates” are predicted to open.

Now, as investors declare a $37 trillion “emergency,” U.S. president Donald Trump has helped spur the crypto market higher, warning the Federal Reserve should “rapidly” lower interest rates.

“Crypto, ‘through the roof,'” Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding the country is “now back” and the Federal Reserve should ""rapidly"" lower interest rates as there's “no inflation.”

The crypto market, which remains dominated by bitcoin, has added $1.2 trillion since crashing to its April lows and is now just $250 billion away from $4 trillion as ethereum and Ripple's XRP make huge gains.

Ethereum is up almost 20% over the last week, while XRP has surged almost 30%, despite the Fed leaving interest rates on hold this year.

Last month, Trump posted that the Federal Reserve board should “activate,"" forcing Fed chair Jerome Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by ""at least two to three points,"" and “save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year,"" spent on servicing the U.S. debt pile.

Powell, who Trump has threatened to fire, kept interest rates on hold again last month after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation—which has yet to emerge.

The market is overwhelmingly expecting the Fed to leave interest rates on hold at its July meeting in just under three weeks time, according to CME's FedWatch tracker, though traders are now betting on a September cut.

“Signals of forthcoming Fed rate cuts have buoyed investor sentiment, given that a cut is now more likely than ever and greatly needed,"" James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments.

The crypto market's move higher has been helped by the slow build of pressure created by bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bitcoin treasury companies led by Michael Saylor's Strategy, which have been buying up huge swaths of bitcoin and inspiring companies to try creating similar supply pressure by buying ethereum, XRP and others.

“In bitcoin's case, the rally is being driven not only by expectations of Fed rate cuts, but also by continued inflows into U.S. spot ETFs, corporate treasury buying, and a weaker U.S. dollar,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“The price surge we've seen [this week] is seemingly driven by a confluence of macroeconomic optimism and significant institutional activity in the form of ETF inflows and sovereign and corporate balance sheet allocations,"" Toledano added.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

The Ethereum Foundation (EF) recently completed a significant over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, selling 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming. The deal, valued at $25.7 million, was finalized on July 10, just before the cryptocurrency briefly surpassed the $3,000 mark. The average sale price of $2,572.37 per ETH was approximately 16% below the market value at the time of the transaction, which ranged from $2,759 to $2,981. This strategic move by the EF has sparked discussions about the foundation's management of its Ethereum reserves and the potential implications for the broader cryptocurrency market.

The timing of the sale is particularly noteworthy, as it occurred just before a significant price rally for Ether. This rally was fueled by a massive influx into Ether ETFs, which recorded $383.1 million in net inflows on the day of the transaction. The market's immediate upward reaction suggests that the sale did not have a bearish effect on the price, contrary to what might be expected from a large-scale sell-off. Instead, the market seemed to interpret the transaction as a positive development, possibly indicating growing institutional interest in Ethereum.

SharpLink Gaming, the buyer in this transaction, is a publicly listed company in the sports betting sector. The acquisition of 10,000 ETH is part of a broader strategic shift for SharpLink, which aims to integrate Ethereum into its treasury strategy. This move is supported by the appointment of Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of Consensys, as the chairman of SharpLink's board of directors. Lubin's involvement suggests a deeper integration of Ethereum into practical applications, potentially rebalancing supply and demand dynamics within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Lubin emphasized that the company views the deal as ""a commitment within the framework of its long-term goals."" SharpLink is staking and re-staking all acquired coins, thereby removing Ethereum from circulation and strengthening the Ethereum ecosystem. This move reflects increasing confidence in Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and its long-term value proposition. Market observers believe that large-scale transactions like this could influence both liquidity and price stability in the short to medium term.

Industry analysts note that the Ethereum Foundation's strategic sales often coincide with local market peaks, suggesting sophisticated treasury management. Meanwhile, SharpLink's decision to immediately stake its holdings demonstrates a commitment to supporting network security and earning passive income through staking rewards. As Ethereum continues to attract institutional attention, such high-profile deals are likely to set precedents for future market behavior and could further legitimize digital assets among traditional investors.

On July 11, an Ethereum Foundation-affiliated wallet sold 1,210 ETH for 3.5 million USDC at an average price of approximately $2,890. The head of the organization clarified that these assets were sold by the recently spun-off Argot Collective. This transaction highlights the growing involvement of institutional players in the Ethereum ecosystem. The move to stake and re-stake such a significant amount of ETH also reflects increasing confidence in Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and its long-term value proposition.

The sale also aligns with Ethereum's technological transition towards zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs), a development highlighted by Sophia Gold, a member of the Ethereum Foundation. This technological advancement, combined with the strategic partnership between SharpLink and the EF, could signal a new phase of institutionalization for Ethereum. As more traditional players, such as publicly listed companies, integrate Ethereum into their operations, the cryptocurrency may evolve from a speculative asset to a governance or usage instrument in specific sectors.

The lack of explicit justification from the EF for the timing or choice of partner in this transaction has fueled speculation about the strategic intent behind the sale. Some analysts suggest that the EF may be seeking to optimize its cash management or prepare for future developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Regardless of the underlying motivations, the transaction underscores the growing institutional interest in Ethereum and its potential to become a key component of corporate treasury strategies. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, partnerships like the one between the EF and SharpLink could pave the way for increased adoption and integration of Ethereum in various industries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoins are rocketing, Bitcoin dominance hasn't ‘even sneezed': Analyst","https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-crypto-market-surging-bitcoin-dominance-analyst","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 05:11:56 GMT","

 Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland suggests altcoins will be “ripping” much more when Bitcoin Dominance drops to 45%. 

A crypto analyst suggests altcoins may have plenty more upside, as many are already surging without pulling much market share from Bitcoin.

“BTC dominance hasn't even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in an X post on Friday. 

TradingView shows Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance is 64.46% at the time of publication, down just 1.53% over the past week, while altcoins saw significant price spikes amid Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs on Wednesday, Thursday, and reaching $118,760 on Friday.

Hyland said, “What do you think happens if it drops from 65 to 45.”

Analysts have traditionally used Bitcoin Dominance to gauge the timing of altcoin season, with a decline typically seen as a signal that altcoins are gaining market share.

However, while BTC Dominance stayed relatively steady, the recent altcoin surge could signal that fresh capital is flowing into the wider market.

MemeCore (M) leads the top 100 crypto gainers over the past seven days with a 1,263% surge, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75.01%, and Stellar (XLM) up 67.43%, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, is up 17.68% over the past seven days, which is often another indicator traders use to determine when the focus is turning from Bitcoin to the broader market.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's relative strength against Bitcoin, is up 8.39% over the past seven days.

However, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index suggests the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin, with the Index reading a “Bitcoin Season” score of 29 out of 100. 

In an X post on Friday, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said, “I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.”

Meanwhile, Santiment recently said that their metrics indicate that the altcoin season has begun. “The data confirms that, for now, it has,” Santiment said.

“As long as Bitcoin can maintain its position above the crucial psychological support level of around $110k, traders will likely feel comfortable redistributing profits into altcoins,” they added.

Ethereum has finally broken above the critical $2,850 level, igniting momentum across the broader altcoin market. After weeks of sideways trading, this breakout marks a potential turning point, as many altcoins followed ETH's lead with sharp upward moves. Analysts are calling this shift the early stages of a new altseason — a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin and deliver significant gains.

Among those spotlighting Ethereum's strength is Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, who took to X to highlight the strategic evolution of Ethereum's positioning. “The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months,” he wrote, referring to his earlier thesis of Ethereum as a global, productive asset.

This renewed narrative, focused on Ethereum as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by an active economy, appears to be resonating with institutional and retail investors alike. With Ethereum leading the market and altcoins gaining momentum, all eyes are now on whether this rally can sustain and confirm the start of a broader bullish phase for the crypto market.

Ethereum Undervaluation Sparks New Narrative

Since 2022, Ethereum has been underperforming against Bitcoin, with altcoins suffering as a result. While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto narrative — recently breaking into new all-time highs — Ethereum still trades more than 60% below its November 2021 peak. This stark divergence has frustrated many ETH holders, but some analysts and investors now view it as a massive opportunity.

Adams has become a prominent voice in Ethereum's ecosystem, and believes a major shift is already underway. According to Adams, the Ethereum community has successfully rebranded ETH as a “blue money” asset — a concept that positions Ethereum alongside traditional stores of value like gold, oil, and Bitcoin. But unlike those, ETH is backed by an on-chain economy that generates yield.

“We are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,” Adams wrote on X. “It's made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset.”

His bold, almost maximalist stance is a call for the market to reassess Ethereum's fundamental value. Rather than seeing it solely as infrastructure for decentralized apps, Adams argues that Ethereum is maturing into a globally viable reserve asset — one that offers both security and yield. If that narrative continues gaining traction, ETH could be poised for a major revaluation in the months ahead.

ETH Reclaims Key Level As Bulls Regain Control

Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength, surging nearly 15% on the week to trade around $2,955. This marks a successful breakout above the key resistance zone at $2,850, a level that previously acted as both support and resistance throughout the past two years. The weekly candle shows strong bullish momentum, supported by a significant increase in trading volume.

The chart reveals that ETH has now reclaimed the 100-week and 200-week moving averages, which sit at $2,644 and $2,428, respectively. Reclaiming these long-term averages is a strong technical signal that the downtrend may be over, and a new bullish phase could be starting.

Despite the breakout, Ethereum is still trading far below its all-time high near $4,900. This presents upside potential if the bullish momentum continues. With this breakout, ETH also confirms a higher low structure, reinforcing the bullish case for further gains.

If price holds above $2,850 in the coming days, the next resistance zone sits around $3,300–$3,600. A close above those levels could open the door to a rally toward $4,000 and beyond.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Rise of the Altcoins While Bitcoin Steadfastly Holds Its Ground","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/rise-of-altcoins-bitcoin-holds-ground","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 05:48:49 GMT","

Bitcoin's dominance—a barometer gauging its grip on the entire cryptocurrency sphere—presently stands at an eye-catching 64%. This essential metric not only serves as a compass for traders but also fuels discussions about Bitcoin's ongoing influence over altcoins. Historically, as Bitcoin hits overheated dominance levels, it can pave the way for altcoins to ascend, attracting investors eager to explore smaller, underappreciated assets. Mastering these nuanced market forces is crucial for anyone willing to dive into the booming realm of altcoins.

The crypto market narrates a riveting chapter in which Bitcoin advances into new territories, yet altcoins are staging a dramatic comeback, manifesting unprecedented price movements. This growing split raises eyebrows regarding Bitcoin's role as the sole metric of market vitality. Illustratively, with Bitcoin appearing unfazed, a savvy analyst quipped, “BTC dominance hasn't even sneezed, yet Alts are ripping.” The poignant observation captures the essence of altcoins soaring on their merits, even while Bitcoin maintains its commanding presence.

An impending altcoin season—the exhilarating phase where altcoins eclipse Bitcoin's performance—whispers throughout trading circles. Historical patterns from 2015 and 2019 reveal how altcoins soared following Bitcoin's dominance reaching unsustainable peaks. Present scenarios hint at the potential for a similar trend as altcoins, particularly niche tokens like MemeCore, celebrating staggering weekly increases of over 1,263%. The question on everyone's lips: Is the environment ripe for an explosive altcoin rally?

Investors keen on navigating the altcoin universe must master the art of technical analysis. The ETH/BTC ratio, a significant measure of Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin, provides critical insights. An increase in this ratio indicates a robust shift towards altcoins, implying that investors might be eyeing alternatives more closely. Furthermore, promising bullish divergences in altcoin dominance charts hint at an imminent market turnaround, particularly if Bitcoin falters in maintaining its current dominance levels.

As the altcoin surge appears increasingly likely, it is imperative for both retail and institutional investors to rethink their strategies. Historical trends in altcoin seasons offer opportunities for dizzying returns—some tokens have recorded astonishing gains upwards of 10x or even 100x. Recent analyses affirm the unmistakable signs of the onset of an altcoin season. As the narrative unfolds, investors face a pivotal moment, spurring a need to recalibrate portfolios and seize the rich tapestry of growth possibilities within the diverse cryptocurrency marketplace.

As altcoins carve out their niche and the cryptocurrency ecosystem evolves, it becomes essential for startups to reshape their financial management approaches, accommodating both crypto and fiat solutions. Such a strategy enhances liquidity and compliance across global jurisdictions, positioning firms to tap into maximum potential returns amid altcoin surges. Exclusive reliance on traditional fiat-to-crypto pathways risks stunting innovative compliance and security requirements, especially for decentralized entities and DAOs traversing this fast-paced terrain.

The ongoing interplay between Bitcoin dominance and the flourishing altcoin market heralds transformative changes within the cryptocurrency realm. With Bitcoin adamantly holding its position while altcoins gain momentum, it is crucial for traders to keep their fingers on the pulse. History tends to repeat itself; as Bitcoin approaches resistance levels, altcoins are likely to capitalize on any market corrections. In an era where the crypto landscape is constantly redefining financial norms, staying attuned to these shifts is essential for fostering growth and innovation. The rush toward altcoins is palpable—will you be ready to seize the moment?

Home - Reviews - Midnight Network Review: Blockchain Privacy and Real-World Compliance

The fundamental right to privacy faces unprecedented challenges in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape. Midnight Network represents a groundbreaking approach to confidential interactions on distributed ledgers. It offers a path toward preserving essential freedoms without sacrificing functionality or compliance.







Midnight Network is an innovative blockchain platform created to tackle the important issue of data privacy and confidentiality in the digital realm. Developed by Input Output Global, the creators of Cardano, it aims to provide a secure environment where individuals and businesses can interact and transact while maintaining control over their sensitive information. The Midnight Network seeks to establish a new standard where fundamental freedoms are protected by default within a decentralized framework.

At its core, Midnight Network prioritizes protecting sensitive personal and commercial data. It enables users to shield details they wish to keep private, ensuring that only necessary information is revealed for specific interactions or compliance requirements.  This focus on selective disclosure allows for confidential transactions and data sharing, empowering users to participate in the blockchain ecosystem without compromising their privacy or exposing proprietary business logic.



The governance and strategic direction of the Midnight ecosystem are overseen by the Midnight Foundation. This independent entity is dedicated to guiding Midnight towards full decentralization, fostering community involvement, and ensuring the network adheres to its core principles of privacy, security, and open participation. The Foundation's role is crucial in building trust and ensuring the platform evolves in line with its foundational vision.

Beyond its technological infrastructure, Midnight Network is focused on cultivating a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. This involves attracting developers to build privacy-preserving dApps, encouraging enterprises to leverage its capabilities for secure data handling, and fostering a community of users who value data sovereignty. The goal is to create a sustainable and innovative environment where privacy is a fundamental right enabled by blockchain technology.







Midnight Network leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), specifically ZK-SNARKs, to validate transactions without exposing underlying data. This technology separates information into public and private components: public data is recorded on-chain for auditability, while private details remain encrypted and stored locally on users' devices. 

By processing proofs off-chain and verifying them on-chain, Midnight ensures sensitive information never compromises user privacy or regulatory compliance.

The network operates via a cooperative tokenomics system featuring two distinct assets:

Midnight's evolution toward full autonomy is stewarded by the Midnight Foundation, which initially oversees protocol upgrades, treasury management, and ecosystem development. 

Governance authority gradually transitions to $NIGHT token holders via on-chain voting, enabling community-driven control over network parameters, incentives, and compliance frameworks. This phased approach ensures security and transparency while aligning with decentralization principles.

Applications built on Midnight integrate modular smart contracts that enable selective data sharing. Users or enterprises can programmatically define what information to disclose, to whom, and under which conditions. This “rational privacy” model supports compliance with regulations like KYC by disclosing only necessary attestations, not raw data while keeping all other inputs confidential.







The NIGHT token serves as the main utility token for the Midnight Network, created to manage and support its privacy-focused ecosystem. Holders use NIGHT to participate in on-chain voting, influencing protocol upgrades, treasury management, and network parameters. 

In addition to governance, NIGHT allows users to create $DUST, a secure resource that facilitates private transactions and smart contracts. This positions NIGHT as both a governance instrument and a utility backbone, ensuring the network evolves under decentralized community control while maintaining operational efficiency.

NIGHT features a fixed total supply of 24 billion tokens, distributed through a multi-phased model prioritizing broad accessibility:

NIGHT presents compelling opportunities but carries inherent risks. Its value proposition includes:

In addition to governance and tokenomics, NIGHT supports Midnight's goal for a cross-chain privacy economy. It facilitates interoperability, such as enabling XRP holders to participate in DeFi via confidential smart contracts without moving assets off-chain. 

This positions NIGHT as a catalyst for privacy-focused innovation across major blockchain ecosystems, potentially reshaping how sensitive data is managed in Web3. Its strategic distribution across 37 million wallets further amplifies network effects and real-world testing.







Cardano serves as the foundational layer and strategic incubator for Midnight, positioning it as Cardano's inaugural “partner chain.” Unlike traditional sidechains, Midnight operates as an independent blockchain with its own tokenomics and governance but leverages Cardano's decentralized infrastructure, particularly its Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). 

These SPOs can validate Midnight transactions, earning rewards while bolstering network security without compromising Cardano's operations. This symbiotic relationship allows Midnight to inherit Cardano's battle-tested security while specializing in programmable data privacy for RWAs and enterprises.

Midnight Network pioneers a vital reconciliation of confidentiality and functionality within decentralized systems. By embedding privacy as a programmable right rather than an optional feature, it empowers users and enterprises to harness blockchain's potential without sacrificing security or compliance.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Hedera, a blockchain platform, has received significant backing from tech giants NVIDIA and Intel, marking a pivotal moment for both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors. According to crypto analyst Mark Chadwick, NVIDIA is integrating Verifiable Compute technology into its next-generation Blackwell chips, with the technology running on Hedera's blockchain. This integration positions Hedera at the core of future AI infrastructure, a development that has sparked considerable excitement within the crypto community.

Verifiable Compute, developed by EQTY Lab in collaboration with Intel and NVIDIA, ensures that AI computations are recorded and cannot be altered afterward. This technology enhances the explainability, trust, and security of AI systems by providing a tamper-proof trail of AI decision-making processes. Hedera's Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) provides the blockchain infrastructure necessary for this verification, enabling every AI decision, process, and model output to be tracked and verified on the Hedera network.

This development is more than just a partnership; it represents a validation of Hedera's technology as a foundational element in the future of AI. NVIDIA's Blackwell chips, described as the backbone of next-generation AI, will be used in various sectors including data centers, autonomous systems, finance, and medicine. If Verifiable Compute becomes the industry standard, and Hedera powers it, HBAR, the native token of the Hedera network, could see unprecedented adoption. The involvement of Accenture and SCAN UK further underscores the real-world, enterprise-grade application of this technology.

This integration aligns with global AI regulations that demand greater transparency. For instance, the EU AI Act requires AI models to be explainable and accountable, especially in sensitive sectors. Verifiable Compute, powered by Hedera, addresses these regulatory requirements, offering a solution that goes beyond technological innovation to solve real-world compliance issues.

The community's response to this news has been overwhelmingly positive, with many predicting significant upside for HBAR. Some users have even suggested that HBAR could become a standard in the AI industry. Mark Chadwick's tweet highlighted the unprecedented level of mainstream adoption Hedera is achieving, a claim supported by the involvement of major tech companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Accenture.

Hedera, which has often been overshadowed by more hyped blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana, could now emerge as a key player in the AI sector. This partnership positions Hedera at the forefront of the fastest-growing industry, potentially transforming it from a blockchain platform into a critical component of digital infrastructure for AI. For HBAR holders, this development could herald a new era of growth and adoption, positioning Hedera as a quiet giant in the making.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Franklin Templeton: Secret Gathering of Blockchain Giants in Zurich","https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/68351-franklin-templeton-jenny-johnson-blockchain-tokenizisation-meeting-zurich-financeplace-switzerland","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 08:56:49 GMT","

The CEO of Franklin Templeton traveled to Zurich for a confidential exchange with leading figures of the Swiss blockchain scene.

It was an extraordinarily exclusive group that gathered for lunch at Zurich's Hotel Storchen in early June: the leaders of twelve prominent Swiss blockchain firms accepted the invitation from Jenny Johnson, CEO of U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton. Johnson flew in from New York specifically for the meeting.

The key condition for the gathering: absolute confidentiality. There is no official memo or protocol. «It was an informal exchange among industry leaders,» emphasized Christian Leger, Head of Franklin Templeton Switzerland, in a statement to finews.com.

Main Topic: Asset Tokenization

Tokenization of assets was the central theme of the meeting.

Franklin Templeton is highly active in this field—both in building blockchain infrastructure and launching products.

In 2021, the company launched the world's first investment fund using public blockchain technology for transaction processing. It maps a traditional investment product, in this case a money market fund, onto blockchain networks and issues digital tokens representing real fund shares. One share of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) equals one Benji token.

While Benji, the abbreviation for this fund, was created for U.S. investors, the firm launched a UCITS version of Benji in February this year. Again, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FTOCF) was a first of its kind. It is the first fully tokenized UCITS product on a public blockchain. The company set up its own blockchain infrastructure in Luxembourg—the Benji platform—for this purpose.

Jenny Johnson Pushing Ahead

Since taking office in 2020, Johnson has been driving the topic of tokenization with determination. She believes this technology will fundamentally transform asset management within just a few years.

With around 50 in-house experts and the central Benji platform, Franklin Templeton is emerging as a strong player in the blockchain industry. The firm also serves as a node validator, meaning it participates in validating crypto transactions on 12 blockchains.

Additionally, it manages a venture capital fund investing in the blockchain ecosystem and offers advisory services for cryptocurrency investments.

Switzerland Takes a Leading Role

That the summit took place in Zurich is hardly surprising. Switzerland is regarded as one of the most advanced and deeply integrated markets for digital assets worldwide. It is home to international players such as Ethereum, Cosmos (Interchain Foundation), Solana, Aave, and 21Shares, and actively promotes collaboration within the Web3 sector. The market capitalization of the platforms based in Switzerland is estimated in the billions—just like the Bitcoin wealth held in the country.

Traditional and decentralized financial systems (TradFi and DeFi) are increasingly merging. While many Swiss banks initially approached digitalization hesitantly—incurring opportunity costs—they are now catching up: most are working on digital infrastructures, and some are already issuing tokenized products. Meanwhile, DeFi firms are cooperating more closely with traditional financial actors and expanding internationally—especially toward the Middle East and Asia.

Franklin Templeton operates globally at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi. After launching Benji in the U.S. and Europe, Singapore is next. In May, the company received approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the Franklin OnChain U.S. Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund—the first tokenized fund accessible to retail investors in Singapore.

Still Silent on Swiss Plans

And what are the concrete plans for Switzerland?

«We are not speaking publicly about concrete plans for Switzerland at this time,» says Christian Leger. «But tokenization is a long-term process. We're still in the early stages—and we're pursuing it consistently. Switzerland will always play a central role in that.»

 finews.com publishes on its own Web-TV-Channel interviews with well-known figures of Swiss finance.

Japan-based real estate investment firm Gates Inc. announced that it has partnered with the Oasys blockchain to tokenize 75 million dollars of income-generating properties in central Tokyo. Experts consider the project one of the largest real estate tokenization efforts in Japan, as it aims to increase liquidity and provide foreign investors with greater access to the Japanese market.


The project will be one of the first stages of tokenization of over 200 billion dollars or 1 percent of the roughly 20.5 trillion yen or 200 billion dollar Japanese real estate market. Gates also aims to make it easier to purchase and sell property using blockchain to avoid legal, regulatory, and language barriers that have ensnared the process of the foreign buyer in the past.

Gates will adopt the tokenization through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is set in a foreign land to comply with the local legislation. The partnership with Oasys is based on the blockchain-based platform originally targeting the gaming world, currently focused on the field of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, and provides secure, scalable, and interoperable terms of token issuance.

The tokenized assets will allow any investors worldwide to buy, sell, and trade their real estate-backed tokens with Web3 wallets. The model reduces the barriers to entry, ensures that liquidity is maximized, with a vision to scale the liquidity of the token up to 34 billion in the initial stage.

Oasys has developed an EVM-compatible proof-of-stake network that provides the seamless migration of assets and wallet compatibility to help institutions to join tokenized real estate markets. Oasys leadership stated that they designed the platform to maximize compounding returns by automatically reinvesting returns.


Gates will aim to expand its tokenization efforts to other nations, primarily in the United States, Europe, the Philippines, and other Asian markets after its launch in Tokyo. The company is also exploring the use of Japanese intellectual property, like assets in the gaming and anime sectors, to diversify its real-world assets offerings through tokenization.

In 2024, Gates realized 145 million in revenues, and the prospective listing of the company on Nasdaq has shown that it wants to be a global market leader in asset tokenization. The project aligns with the growing global interest in tokenized real estate, which experts project to exceed 4 trillion dollars by 2035, as institutional investors pursue greater liquidity and efficiency.


By putting ownership on the blockchain, Gates will simplify investment, eliminating transaction expenses and opening up new pools of retail and institutional capital, anywhere in the world. The project will probably serve as a precedent to the real estate and digital asset industry in Japan and will lead to the adoption of blockchain technology in the traditional markets.

I'm the AI strategist in your corner, turning dry economic data into actionable intelligence for your portfolio.

The crypto world is rarely short on spectacle, but few moments in recent memory have captured the interplay of branding, institutional validation, and meme-driven momentum quite like Coinbase's July 11, 2025, switch to a Pudgy Penguins NFT as its Twitter profile picture. What began as a cheeky nod to the project's community quickly snowballed into a $1.4 billion market cap surge for the PENGU token, a 690% spike in NFT trading volume, and a landmark SEC acknowledgment for an ETF proposal tied to the asset. This wasn't just a PR stunt—it was a masterclass in how strategic branding and institutional overtures can catalyze value in the crypto space.  

The Social Media Pivot: AlexOnChain's Influence and Coinbase's New PlaybookThe avatar change was orchestrated during a brief account takeover by AlexOnChain, a pseudonymous crypto influencer known for his viral Twitter threads. Far from a hack, it was a calculated move: Coinbase swiftly hired AlexOnChain as its first “CT Lead” (a nod to the “Chief Twitter” role popularized by Elon Musk), signaling a shift toward more direct, community-driven communication.  

The results were immediate. PENGU's price surged 60% within hours of the “new pfp, who dis” caption, while the floor price of Pudgy Penguins NFTs jumped from 9 ETH to 11.58 ETH. The move underscored a broader trend: crypto firms are increasingly leveraging social media influencers and NFT communities to drive token adoption. Coinbase's pivot—blending meme culture with institutional credibility—highlighted how brands can amplify value through alignment with engaged, decentralized audiences.  

 

The ETF Multiplier: Regulatory Validation Meets Meme MomentumThe PENGU rally wasn't just about hype. On July 12, the U.S. Securities and and Exchange Commission acknowledged Canary Capital's filing for a PENGU ETF, which seeks to provide 80%-95% exposure to PENGU and related NFT assets. This marked a critical inflection point: PENGU became only the second meme coin (after Dogecoin) to gain such regulatory traction in the U.S.  

The ETF's potential approval acts as a catalyst for institutional capital, which has long been hesitant to embrace meme-driven assets. . Analysts like Ali Martinez at CryptoMetrics estimate PENGU could hit $0.060 by August 2025—a 216% gain from its July 12 high—if the ETF gains momentum. The ETF's structure also addresses a key pain point for institutional investors: access to NFTs, which are traditionally illiquid and complex to value.  

The NFT Floor Surge and the Long/Short Ratio: A Bullish SignalThe Pudgy Penguins project itself became a beneficiary of Coinbase's endorsement. Trading volumes for the NFTs skyrocketed 690% in 24 hours, while the long/short ratio on Binance for PENGU hit 1.025—a bullish indicator signaling retail and institutional buyers are accumulating ahead of potential ETF inflows.  

This dynamic reveals a critical insight: NFT communities can now serve as both brand ambassadors and price drivers for tokens. Coinbase's move to adopt a Pudgy Penguin avatar wasn't just a marketing gimmick—it was a statement that NFTs are becoming core to crypto branding, with their ownership and liquidity directly tied to token value.  

The Bear Case: Volatility and the ETF HurdleOf course, skeptics will point to PENGU's decline to $0.0104 by February 2025—a 30% drop from its January peak—as proof of meme coins' inherent volatility. But this overlooks the broader arc: the July surge demonstrated how strategic branding and regulatory milestones can create durable catalysts. The ETF's fate remains pivotal—approval would lock in institutional demand, while rejection could spark a prolonged selloff.  

Investors should also monitor the NFT floor price of Pudgy Penguins. . If the floor holds above 10 ETH amid token price weakness, it suggests community loyalty is intact—a key buffer against bearish pressure.  

Investment Thesis: Capitalize on Early MomentumThe Coinbase/PENGU saga offers a blueprint for investors: look for projects where institutional players are aligning with meme-driven communities through branding, and where regulatory tailwinds (like ETFs) are on the horizon. PENGU's current price of $0.019 (as of July 7, 2025) sits below its July highs but offers asymmetric upside if the ETF gains traction.  

The key risks are clear: regulatory delays, NFT liquidity constraints, and meme fatigue. But the rewards are equally compelling: PENGU's market cap could approach $2 billion if the ETF is approved, while broader adoption of NFT-based branding could push the token into the crypto mainstream.  

Conclusion: The New Crypto Branding PlaybookCoinbase's Pudgy Penguin pivot isn't just a quirky anecdote—it's a sign of crypto's evolving maturity. Brands are now leveraging NFT communities as both marketing channels and value drivers, while institutional players are using ETFs to bridge the gap between meme-driven assets and traditional finance. Investors who identify these early-stage catalysts—whether through social media moves, regulatory nods, or NFT liquidity—will be positioned to profit as crypto's next wave unfolds.  

In the meme-to-ETF pipeline, Coinbase has set a template. The question now is: who's next?

The Conscience of Thoroughbred Racing



By HRI Foreign Staff — In a bold return to the digital track, Virtually Human Studio has officially rebooted its famed Web3 horse racing game Zed Run as the newly launched Zed Champions: a skill-based, 24/7 virtual horse racing ecosystem built for a new era of strategy, ownership, and blockchain integration. The game is currently in beta, and excitement is mounting in both Web3 and horse betting communities. Designed around dynamic breeding, automated race schedules, and $ZED token integration, Zed Champions is not just a visual or technical update; it's a complete overhaul aimed at sustainability and deeper engagemen

 https://www.instagram.com/p/DLOvRAZMyhy/?igsh=eHNzZ21mZmk4aTlo

Zed Run had once been a beacon of innovation in the NFT world, having processed over $400 million in digital horse transactions and bred more than 420,000 racehorses. But like many NFT platforms, it stumbled during the market's downturn. Zed Champions is VHS's answer to those challenges, as a refined, skill-based model that discourages speculation and favors strategic play. With features like auction-based breeding, leaderboard scoring, and race-driven rewards, players are now invited to manage virtual stables like a fantasy sports team, without needing to manually schedule races.

What sets Zed Champions apart is its continuous ecosystem: a race every 80 seconds, around the clock, driven entirely by blockchain. Digital horses are matched based on real-time balance performance, and players can boost horses using Augments, which are special modifiers that influence performance in subtle but critical ways. For Web2 holdouts or crypto newcomers, VHS has introduced Zed Picks, a companion mobile app that allows spectators to cheer on horses, place bets using virtual currency, and win sweepstakes prizes with no crypto wallet required.

As the game moves into full launch, many in the industry are watching Zed Champions closely as a test case for the future of NFT-powered sports. Among them is Americas Cardroom, whose adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain tools was directly inspired by the early success of Zed Run.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNcwuY4uiuc&t=2039s

For Americas Cardroom CEO Phil Nagy, the connection between poker and digital horse racing was not immediately obvious until poker legend Chris Moneymaker introduced him to Zed Run. “In typical Phil fashion, he ignored it for weeks,” Americas Cardroom Pro Moneymaker said in a recent interview. “And then he was, like, ‘Why didn't you tell me about this before?' He totally got it.”

That revelation would end up transforming the way Americas Cardroom approached payment processing and community engagement. Moneymaker, famous for catalyzing the online poker boom with his 2003 World Series of Poker win, saw clear parallels between blockchain gaming and poker: both are strategy-driven, decentralized, and benefit immensely from instant, secure money transfers. Once introduced to crypto, blockchain, and NFTs, Nagy immersed himself in the technology. He set up servers, built e-wallet knowledge, and began experimenting with real-world applications. The result? Americas Cardroom quickly became one of the most crypto-integrated poker platforms in the world. Today, you can play poker on the site with the option to use over 60 different cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known altcoins, making cross-border transactions seamless and instant.

This has proven especially valuable in the poker world, where quick liquidity is often the difference between joining a game or missing out. “You can pay customers in seconds,” said Nagy. “They can deposit fast; there are no fees or delays you get with other payment processors.” His vision goes even further. Nagy believes NFTs can serve as a transparent ledger for tournament records, player identities, and digital collectibles.

While some online casinos have treated NFTs as temporary fads or promotional gimmicks, Americas Cardroom has looked at blockchain with a more positive outlook. Nagy, Moneymaker, and the rest of the Americas Cardroom team see a future where digital ownership intersects with competitive play, and the original spark came from the virtual world of Zed Run.

Digital horse racing is no longer just a niche curiosity. It's rapidly evolving into a vibrant subsection of the sports betting and gaming industry, thanks to NFT-driven platforms like Zed Champions, Game of Silks, and Stables.

Take Game of Silks, for example, which tokenizes the annual crop of real-world US thoroughbreds and converts them into tradeable in-game NFTs. Players who own a Silks horse receive rewards when their real-world counterpart wins races or produces offspring. It's a “play-to-earn” model with real-life stakes, which has attracted over 25,000 players worldwide. In partnership with the New York Racing Association, Game of Silks is helping traditional horse racing tap into younger, tech-savvy audiences without compromising the sport's integrity.

Meanwhile, in Europe, France's Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) launched Stables, an NFT horse racing platform on the Tezos blockchain. The game uses historical racing data and advanced algorithms to simulate virtual races, allowing users to train and race their horses for digital and real-world prizes. Within days of launch, nearly 5,000 of the first 6,666 horse NFTs were sold, showing strong demand despite the broader NFT market's volatility.

Even brands like Stella Artois are experimenting with NFT horse racing campaigns — proof that this trend is entering mainstream advertising and branding circles. The convergence of horse racing, virtual reality, and NFTs is part of a long-term shift toward digital sports entertainment. For traditional bettors of an older generation, especially those familiar with horse betting and poker, the appeal lies in a familiar pastime reimagined for the digital age. The thrill of betting, the pride of owning a stable, and the excitement of strategy all remain intact, but now they come with the added bonus of ownership, liquidity, and borderless participation.

It's no surprise, then, that companies like Americas Cardroom are taking notes. As Web3 gaming continues to mature and as digital horse racing platforms refine their ecosystems, expect to see further crossover between poker and racing: two industries that thrive on competition, community, and chance. Zed Champions may just be the frontrunner in this movement, but it's not racing alone. And with poker powerhouses like Americas Cardroom galloping into the NFT and crypto space, the finish line is only the beginning.

Coinbase broke with its usual blue logo on X, posting a Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token as its profile picture alongside the quip “new pfp, who dis.”

new pfp, who dis

Minutes later, PENGU, the native token of the penguin-themed ecosystem, started surging. The token rose more than 60% in the rally before enduring a correction, but it's still up more than 35% for the week.

The official Pudgy Penguins account mirrored the move, sending matching ice-blue avatars gliding across feeds and leading to talk of a partnership between Coinbase and Igloo Inc., the startup that steers the collection. Various crypto-related firms, including VanEck, MoonPay, and AwakenTax, have since changed their profile pictures to pudgy penguins.

The stunt has also lifted the floor price of Pudgy Penguin NFTs, which was earlier this week around 9 ETH, and quickly jumped to 11.58 ETH according to NFTPriceFloor data. The volume for the project's NFTs grew nearly 690% in the last 24 hours.

Coinbase changed its profile picture during a short account takeover from pseudonymous Crypto Twitter personality AlexOnChain, who previously led the social media account of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance for four years.

After the takeover, Coinbase revealed they're hiring AlexOnChain as their first full-time “CT Lead.”

“The new focus is making comms more social native - direct, transparent, and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct,” Alex said in a post. “It's a big job, it won't be easy, and that's why I took it.”

PENGU's price rise also comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Canary Capital's filing for a spot PENGU ETF.

 Venture capitalists and the Solana community touted the ICO as a showcase for capital formation in the age of internet capital markets. 

Memecoin launch platform Pump.fun raised $500 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) on Saturday, which sold out in about 12 minutes.The PUMP token has a maximum supply of 1 trillion, and 33% of the supply was allocated to the ICO. 24% of the supply was allocated to the ecosystem and future community projects, while 13% was reserved for existing investors, according to the memecoin platform.

Of the 33% ICO allotment, 18% went to institutional investors, and 15% was offered to retail traders. Pump.fun's ICO may signal the return of the memecoin sector, which experienced a sharp downturn after being one of the highest-performing asset classes in 2024.

The public token sale also portends the resurgence of initial coin offerings, which fizzled out due to regulatory pressure in the United States under the reign of former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler.

Despite the $500 million raised in the ICO, the crypto community remains divided on the effects of Pump.fun and memecoins in general, with some celebrating the growth of the platform and others arguing that it is a net negative for the space.“Beyond one of the largest ICOs ever, this will be one of the highest-grossing revenue tokens in crypto,” Haseeb Qureshi, managing partner at venture capital firm Dragonfly, said.

Mary Bent, founder of Truth for the Commoner (TFTC), responded to Qureshi and said, “Pump.fun and those supporting it, even if at arm's length, are Pied Pipers leading Gen Z to ruin.”

Coinbase's head of product, Conor Grogan, said the “great majority” of tokens launched on memecoin creation platforms like Pump.fun and competitors like LetsBonk are created by automated bots.

“There is one guy responsible for about 18,000 tokens created on PumpFun. It appears they wake up and create, on average, about a dozen tokens an hour until they go to bed, and then do it again every day. They've done this for months,” the exec wrote in January.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Pump.fun, a meme coin platform built on the Solana blockchain, has set a new record in the cryptocurrency market by completing one of the fastest and largest Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in history. The platform successfully sold 125 billion PUMP tokens, raising an impressive $500 million in just 12 minutes. This achievement highlights the surging interest and investment in the meme coin sector, particularly among large investors, commonly referred to as ""whales.""

The public token sale, which excluded participants from the U.S. and required full Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, offered 33% of PUMP's total supply with no lock-up period. The tokens were priced at $0.004 each, and the company had initially aimed to raise $600 million from the offering. The rapid sell-out of the presale indicates a high level of enthusiasm and trust in the Pump.fun platform and its native token, PUMP. This success also suggests that whales are actively seeking opportunities in the meme coin space, despite potential concerns about the long-term prospects of these tokens.

Pump.fun gained prominence in 2024 as the go-to platform for creating Solana-based meme coins. However, with this ICO, the company aims to move beyond meme culture, outlining plans to build a decentralized alternative to mainstream social platforms. The platform's ability to generate significant revenue through memecoin launches demonstrates its potential to build a decentralized social network and foster a vibrant community around its tokens.

Momentum had been building ahead of the July 12 launch. Earlier in the week, Pump.fun acquired Kolscan, a Solana wallet tracker that ranks key opinion leaders (KOLs) based on their trading performance. The new feature will enable users to analyze top investor strategies in real-time, a compelling tool for retail traders seeking to track whale activity. This strategic move further solidifies Pump.fun's position in the market and enhances its platform to attract more investors.

Several whales placed large bets ahead of the ICO. According to Lookonchain data from July 12, three major wallets deposited around $7 million USDC into Hyperliquid, opening long positions on PUMP. One of these whales, known for turning a $1.19 million investment in Official Trump (TRUMP) into $438 million, created a new wallet and deposited $1 million USDC into the PUMP presale. Not all bets were bullish, however. Another whale reportedly shorted PUMP using $8 million USDC at 2x leverage. By press time, the position was sitting on an unrealized loss of $800,000, with a looming liquidation price of $0.008513.

With the ICO and market sentiment broadly bullish, all eyes are on how PUMP will perform in the days ahead. The rapid sell-out of the PUMP token presale and the involvement of prominent whales indicate a strong appetite for meme coins among large investors. This trend is likely to continue as more platforms and tokens enter the market, driven by the potential for high returns and the growing interest in decentralized finance. However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before participating in ICOs, as the meme coin market is known for its volatility and speculative nature.

Ahead of its initial coin offering (ICO), Pump.fun has secured its first-ever purchase by acquiring a Solana-based wallet tracker, Kolscan. According to the company, this latest rollout features an aggregated ranking of key opinion leaders (KOLs) based on their trading performance. And as such, it will allow users to closely observe and analyze the strategies of top investors within the Solana network.

Pump.fun's recent integration is part of the build-up to the imminent ICO scheduled to start on July 12. Earlier this week, the firm announced its plans to raise $600 million, valuing the company at $4 billion.

The platform's co-founder, Alon Cohen, clarified that the latest product will remain free to the large user base it gathered before the recent purchase. Cohen also revealed that key upgrades are underway to improve the overall performance of the ecosystem.

Our integration will not only enable better products for both Kolscan and [Pump fun] users, but allow for totally new experiences that will change the entire onchain trading landscape.

In a Friday tweet, Cohen emphasized that the recent development aligns with his view of “onchain trading” being a social sport. He added that it's also part of Pump.fun's calculated efforts to gamify digital asset trading.

Further weighing in on the integration, Cohen noted that “you do it with your friends and compare yourself to the best.” According to him, project outcomes are decided by timing, belief, and the parties involved.

Meanwhile, the Pump co-founder expressed optimism in integrating Kolscan's products, admitting that it is part of the platform's goal of becoming a multi-billion-dollar crypto-focused social media protocol.

Pump already has the groundwork for integrating user-focused social products, such as a live-streaming platform and incentive program for asset holders. Plans for improvements to Kolscan are also considered, with the aim of rewarding traders and improving copy trading for users.

Amid this recent ecosystem development, Pump.fun is facing strong competition from another token launchpad rival. For the first time since launch, the platform lost its sector lead to LetsBonk's, with its market share dropping below 60%.

America's largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, has announced that the $PUMP token is available for pre-market trading. This means that traders can test the tokens' perpetual futures before mainstream listing.

Tokenomics regarding the Pump.fun ICO are as follows:

Meanwhile, Solana has recovered from its multi-month decline to trade within the green zone over the past week. At the time of writing, the asset is exchanging hands around $167, following an over 5% uptick in the recent intraday session.

If Congress passes the GENIUS Act, banks will be allowed to issue their own cryptocurrency, as long as it's tied to a stable asset like the dollar. But some economists warn it could have very unstable outcomes.

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Someone must be rather pleased with themselves for coming up with the official title of Senate Bill 394. The title is The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, a.k.a. the GENIUS Act. The bill aims to create a regulatory framework for a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins.

The legislation would also allow banks and even companies like Amazon or Walmart to issue their own stable coins. Under specified conditions, the Senate gave the crypto industry its first big legislative win when it passed the GENIUS Act last month, the House is expected to vote on it next week. Now the crypto industry says the GENIUS Act will modernize the U.S. economy.

Skeptics say we've been here before, with banks and companies issuing their own currencies and it did not go well. So let's better understand the nitty gritty of the GENIUS Act and whether it will or won't modernize the U.S. economy. And to do, we're gonna start with Zeke Faux. He's an investigative reporter for Bloomberg Business Week. Author of “Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall.”

Zeke, it's great to have you back.

ZEKE FAUX: Hi Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: So I'm going to admit that no matter how many times we do shows about crypto, I never fully understand it. So I wanted to start with like the 101. What is a stablecoin?

FAUX: So the easiest way to understand a stablecoin is to think of something like PayPal.

It's like a digital way to send money, but with stablecoins, instead of having a company like PayPal or Venmo keep track of your money, you've got a stable coin issuer that would, and your stable coin, instead of only being moved through one company's app, you can use any crypto wallet to zap it around the world. And on the backend, what's happening is that you send money to the issuer of the stablecoin.

The most popular one is called Tether, and if you send them a dollar, they issue you a digital token, which, you know, you can send around in crypto land. And they're supposed to keep your dollar in reserve somewhere. So that if you ever want to cash in your digital token, you can get that dollar back. So that's why the value is supposed to stay stable at a dollar.

CHAKRABARTI: Why not just use dollars for transactions? What do stable coins provide that the dollar doesn't?

FAUX: Yeah, it is a good question and if you are here in the U.S., there's really not much motivation to use stablecoins unless you are already trading crypto and want to keep your money in cryptocurrency. But what is really amazing about stablecoins is that anyone can use them around the world.

So somebody who's in, say, Nigeria or Venezuela, who would have a lot of trouble opening a U.S. dollar-based bank account, can quite easily acquire stable coins and hold their money in dollars. And using stable coins, I can send money to somebody across the world knowing only their crypto wallet address, which is like a string of random letters and numbers. I don't need to know their name; I don't need to know their email. They don't need to know mine.

So it's like normally any sort of U.S. dollar transfer is heavily regulated. It goes through banks who are doing all sorts of checks, and with this, it's like, it's instant, it's semi-anonymous, and there's no refunds.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so I'm writing this down, because I want to come back to it in just a few minutes here about, okay, less regulation in the minds of crypto supporters equates to less friction. That's what you're saying, right? So therefore, it becomes more useful and even maybe an economic, a more economically efficient way of doing trader transactions.

FAUX: Yeah, you can see why this is very appealing to a financial institution. Just for example, a big bank like J.P. Morgan might employ 10 or 20,000 people in its compliance department. And Tether, which is the issuer of the biggest stablecoin in the world, which has tens of millions of these wallets using it only has 20 or 30 people.

So it's a huge savings for them. And this company Tether, as you can imagine, it's quite profitable to run this big money transfer network with a tiny crew of employees. And in fact, they made $13 billion last year. They're one of the most profitable companies in the world. So a lot of companies in the U.S. are wanting to get in on that.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. It's interesting you mentioned J.P. Morgan. I'm seeing here some reporting that says J.P. Morgan has already filed, quietly, filed some trademarks for potential stable coins, one under the name of JP MD. So looks like the financial institutions really are quite interested in this?

FAUX: Yeah. And if you think about the PayPal example right now, if you're PayPal, you need to follow all these rules, collect all this information about your users have these controls to stop money laundering or fraud and if you say you're now PayPal, the stablecoin, you no longer have to follow those rules. So you could save tons of money. So it's great for them. But obviously, if you think that these money laundering rules, all the controls on the banking system have a purpose, you should be concerned about creating this backdoor that lets people get around them.

CHAKRABARTI: Those pesky rules, Zeke, they're always getting in the way. Okay. So thank you for that backgrounder. Because really, I don't know what it is about crypto, but it's just always on the edge of my ability to understand why it even exists. But here we have the GENIUS Act, which I'm seeing is being talked about as one of the first big legislative wins for the crypto industry.

Can you just quickly summarize what the GENIUS Act would do?

FAUX: So right now people are using stable coins. They exist, but they're in a legal gray area. And what this GENIUS act would do is it would legitimize the industry and basically legalize the way that they're currently used. So it would also put in some new rules.

One of the concerns about stablecoins is that the company that issues them may claim to be holding the money in reserve. But how do you know? And the GENIUS Act, a lot of the new rules are focused on tracking to ensure that these stablecoins are really fully backed. But this, it would not change the system, where stablecoins can be moved from one anonymous wallet to another.

It would just codify it.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so Zeke, hang on here for a second because I'm going to keep coming back to you to be our explainer and our check on some of the things that are being claimed about what the GENIUS Act could do. But as I mentioned earlier there are a lot of keen observers out there who say even before the first computer was ever invented, we've been in this space before about what happens when non-governmental institutions are issuing forms of their own currency.

So let me bring Barry Eichengreen into the conversation. He's a professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, and he recently wrote a New York Times opinion piece called The GENIUS Act Will Bring Economic Chaos.

And we have a link to it at onpointradio.org. Professor Eken Green, welcome to On Point.

BARRY EICHENGREEN: Hi Meghna.

CHAKRABARTI: So you have written that you think the GENIUS Act could essentially resurrect a Wild West of currency when it comes to the weaknesses of currency. Why?

EICHENGREEN: We've had a wild west of currency before in the United States.

The free banking era from the mid 1830s through the early 1860s, under that system, every bank, Meghna's Bank and Zeke's Bank could issue their own dollar notes, and they were supposed to back them with gold in the same way that stablecoin issuers today might back their coins with actual treasury bills.

But the backing was sometimes less than met the eye. So that different dollar bills issued by different banks traded at different prices, and that put at risk what economists refer to as the singleness of money. That every dollar bill is equally good as every other dollar bill, nobody cared about who gave you a dollar.

If all of a sudden that is no longer the case, people will be reluctant to use the currency in transactions, or they'll have to keep a big telephone book under the counter of the corner store and look up the value of Zeke's dollar versus Meghna's dollar. I fear that we could be going back to that kind of world with the GENIUS Act.

CHAKRABARTI: I can just guarantee you right now, professor Eichengreen, that the Meghna dollar will never be less worthless than what I claim it is worth. It sounds like you're saying that that's basically the extent to which regulation existed surrounding these bank issued notes from the 1830s to the 1860s.

Can you give me a more specific example like how you were saying that banks were issuing their notes, with telling the public that we actually do have this much in reserve in cash, but they didn't. How is that even possible?

EICHENGREEN: Back then, banks were regulated by individual states.

So each state had its own version of the GENIUS Act on the books, if you will. Some said that banks had to hold actual gold reserve for every dollar note they issued. They had to hold in their vaults a dollars' worth of gold. But other states would say, you can hold state government bonds, or you can hold, quote, high quality railway bonds, unquote.

Sometimes the bonds were worth less than their supposed nominal value. So when somebody received the bank note and wanted to convert it into actual gold, the bank didn't have the collateral and couldn't pay off the note holders. The GENIUS Act assumes that regulation will be efficient and effective, and that a dollar stablecoin will be backed by an actual dollar of reserve.

I think we have centuries of history of bank regulations suggesting that there are times when the regulated will be one step ahead of the regulator, and we may be going back to that kind of world.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: Zeke, before the break, Professor Eichengreen was describing in the 19th century, a system where in the free banking era, as he said, just about any bank could issue its own currency. And I'm wondering if you think that's a good analogy for what the GENIUS Act would do or does the GENIUS Act go even farther?

Because I understand that it's not just banks, but other large entities could issue their own stablecoin under the GENIUS Act. I'm seeing it like Amazon could or Walmart could. What would they actually use to back those coins? Zeke.

FAUX: So they would be acting like banks and they would have to hold safe assets in reserve just like banks would.

And the appeal for Amazon or Walmart is that for companies like that, they spend huge amounts of money on credit card fees. And like right now, every time you go swipe your card at Walmart, the credit card issuer is keeping something like 2% of that transaction, so it's like a tax on everything that you buy.

And if Walmart could somehow incentivize you to use Walmart coin for your transaction, they would eliminate that fee. And when you're a stablecoin issuer, stablecoins don't pay interest. The GENIUS Act would ban them from paying interest. So Walmart would be sitting on this big pile of money, they'd earn interest on it.

So they'd be turning something that costs them a lot of money to a profit center. So the appeal for them is clear.

CHAKRABARTI: Huh. Okay. So Professor Eichengreen, I want to go jump back and forth between the 19th and the 21st centuries here. Was there a similar kind of appeal to banks in the 19th century under the free banking era as you talked about?

EICHENGREEN: There was a shortage of coin in the United States. 19th century is before the era of digital money. The alternatives were to use actual gold and silver coins in transactions or to use bank notes. So I think the fact that free banks turn to issuing notes in mid 1830s was a cost saving innovation of the sort that Zeke was describing a moment ago.

Having said that, I want to dispute the premise. When I use my credit card, I'm not only paying 2% in order to make a payment at Amazon or Walmart or whatever. But I'm getting a package of services. For that 2%, I get fraud protection. I get the option of paying over time. So I think the actual savings to the consumer from moving from credit cards and debit cards to stablecoins is less than meets the eye.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, we're going to come back to that repeatedly over the hour in terms of the advantage to institutions versus the advantages to consumers. But Professor Eichengreen, what underlies both the stable coin proposal, as far as I understand it, and the free banking era, is that when a consumer, let's stick to the mid 19th century.

Ostensibly, was to be able to go back to a bank with one of its bank-issued notes and say, I would actually like the dollars now, in exchange, the presumption is that those dollars were there, but that wasn't always true. You've got some examples.

EICHENGREEN: That wasn't always true. So you mentioned in your lead into the hour, the case of Michigan, where that often was not true. Because regulation by the banking commission of the state of Michigan, of locally chartered banks was lax. So the banks didn't have gold in the vault or high-quality bonds on its balance sheet. So when I showed up with one of its $1 notes and asked for a dollar's worth of gold in return, the bank didn't have the gold.

Or it didn't have the bonds that it could sell in order to obtain the gold to pay me back. So that led to a variety of problems. Number one, the corner store would sell a sack of flour to a customer, end up with a worthless note. Number two, people began to worry about whether these banks were really as solid as they said they were.

So you had runs on individual banks, which could spill over from one bank to another.

CHAKRABARTI: And what impact did that have on Michigan? I understand that it was like a large portion, a large fraction of the income of the state at that time that was made vulnerable by these bank issued notes.

EICHENGREEN: So banks would issue worthless notes, close to worthless notes, storekeepers and farmers and others would accept them in payment for what they produced. And that payment would end up worthless. So you add up the losses to people who ended up holding the near worthless notes and you get figures like the one you cited, Meghna. Of, they lost the equivalent of 40% of annual state income over the course of the three decades that this system operated.

CHAKRABARTI: Over the course of 30 years in Michigan. Okay, Zeke. Now we're gonna hear in a minute or two the point of view of someone from within the crypto industry about the advantages to stablecoins and the GENIUS Act, as he sees them. But correct me if I'm wrong, but we have in recent, just in recent times, seen the value of not just crypto, but some specific stable coins also plummet in the way that Professor Eichengreen was talking about, that happened in the 19th century.

I'm looking here at what happened in what, 2022, with a stable coin called TARA. I know you know about that Zeke.

FAUX: Yes. So this was a stablecoin that was backed by cryptocurrency instead of dollars run by this very obnoxious young crypto bro named Do Kwon. It was supposed to always be worth a dollar because you could trade it for a dollar worth of lunar coins. Now, why were the lunar coins valuable? You weren't supposed to ask that question, and eventually people did. And this system, which had tens of billions of dollars, totally collapsed.

The GENIUS Act proponents say that it would ban algorithmic or crypto backed stablecoins like this and that it would be safer. The critics of the GENIUS Act are more focused on the money laundering risks which I think are significant. In my book Number Go Up, I cited a text message from a Russian money launderer, and he was promoting stablecoins to his co-conspirators.

And he was like, they're amazing. It's fast, it's anonymous. You can send money just like email. And criminals all around the world are catching on and they're popping up in more and more cases. Just the other day, The Economist had a big story saying how Tether the stablecoin became money launderers' dream currency.

'Cause it's very handy to be able to zap huge amounts of dollars around the world.

CHAKRABARTI: So here's the thing. From what I understand in the crypto industry, they believe that's worth the worth the risk in order to really bring the means of transactions into the modern era.

So let's listen for a second to a supporter of these stablecoins and why he thinks they will actually help modernize the economy for the future.

DANTE DISPARTE: You can't have the economy of the future unless you have the money of the future. Your and my financial needs don't take bank holidays. And if you want to send money fast instantly to anyone, anywhere, you effectively need to render money digitally in a very safe way.

CHAKRABARTI: And so that's what stablecoins are solving for, is your ability to send digital money the way you would send cash to trusted recipients near instantly.

So this is Dante Disparte. He's the Chief Strategy Officer and head of global policy for a group called Circle. And Circle issues a stablecoin called USDC, which is currently the second largest stablecoin in the market with more than $61 billion worth in circulation.

DISPARTE: It's often a fallacy that the current payment system is fast and it's already digital. It is often neither. The current payment system exacts the highest cost from the people who could afford it least. Just ask any listener who has ever sent a cross-border payment or an international remittance, and just ask any small merchant or business how much they have to pay and how long they have to wait for their commerce to actually hit their bank account.

CHAKRABARTI: These differences according to Dante Disparte can be quite significant. We've talked about options like domestic wire transfers, which can cost an average of $26 per transfer. Even debit card interchange fees average about 21 cents per transaction, and with stablecoins, the exact fee depends on the specific blockchain being used and the size of the transfer, but it can cost just a fraction of a cent.

Here's the thing though, none of that really prevents stablecoin issuers from doing exactly what banks currently do with any of their transaction fees. The stablecoin issuers could spike their fees in the future, but Disparte says he is not worried about that.

DISPARTE: For the better part of seven years in the global policy conversation, there has been a principled conversation about what should we do with regulating not only stablecoins but broader crypto assets. And the point is, gradualism isn't a great policy strategy in the face of competition, neither at the national level, nor of course the corporate level and the objective should be payment systems optionality.

The more options we introduce into not only the role of the dollar around the world, which I think stablecoins are advancing, but into introducing principled competition to established payment systems, the better.

CHAKRABARTI: And finally, Disparte says that he hopes stable coins will ultimately be well regulated and not used just in the U.S. but around the world.

DISPARTE: Frankly, as someone who sends remittances to family and loved ones internationally, I instantly see the benefit. It's not enough to try to get a U.S. law passed. We have done an extraordinary amount of work to ensure that the international frameworks have emerged. And that anyone, anywhere who uses regulated stablecoins, which the GENIUS Act would call payment stable coins, enjoy the same rights, same privileges, and same protections as I might in the United States.

CHAKRABARTI: So that's Dante Disparte, Chief Strategy Officer and head of global policy for the crypto company Circle. Professor Eichengreen, how do you respond to that? Mr. Disparte sees a much more positive future with adequate regulation. What do you think?

EICHENGREEN: He assumes that adequate regulation will be adequate.

I agree with Zeke that it's overly optimistic to assume that the regulators will be able to prevent fly by night stablecoin issuers from evading, know your customer and anti-money laundering rules. It's not surprising to hear stablecoin promoters talking their own book. But what they forget, I think, is that the incumbents in this financial sphere and this payment sphere, they're adopting new technologies, new digital technologies as well.

So that the banks that have traditionally done business with one another across borders using this international agreement called Swift. Swift is adopting digital technology and blockchain technology as well. Would you rather have this technology being utilized by long established, reputable banks or by some fly by night operator? If I decide to issue a stable coin tomorrow, can you be confident that I'm going to properly enforce anti-money laundering rules, versus international consortium of banks, which have been in this business for a long time and can use digital technology to bring down costs as well?

CHAKRABARTI: Right.

Zeke, let me ask you this because I was really struck by when Dante Disparte said that he wants enough regulation in the stablecoin space so that people can quote, enjoy the same rights, same protections and same privileges that stablecoin users in the United States might have, but this is exactly the purpose of regulation, right?

And regulation can only offer those same protections by introducing friction, by slowing transactions down so that the things that you and Professor Eichengreen have been talking about can be implemented, right? Anti money laundering, or even, the backing of a government's treasury.

Is it possible that we're just missing the point here and the future that Disparte sees in terms of these same protections happening can happen without the kind of friction that we have in conventional currency trades?

FAUX: There is no way to apply anti-money laundering checks to crypto because it can be held in anonymous wallets.

And I actually traveled to Cambodia to see how this works in practice. Over there, stablecoins are more popular, and I went to one of the many currency exchange shops where they advertise that you can trade stablecoins for cash. I saw a hungover looking Chinese guy in pajamas, walk up to the desk and leave with a brick of $50,000 in cash.

And I was able to using the anonymous crypto wallet on my phone, just zap some stablecoins to the clerk and receive $100 in cash, no questions asked. Nothing in this bill would stop stablecoin use like that. And in fact, if stablecoins got really popular and everyone was, they were widely accepted, right?

A lot of the regulation depends on the idea that people will actually want to exchange them back and forth for cash. And that's where like the checks will apply. But if it really takes off and it's really popular, there'll be less need to exchange them for cash. It'll become much easier to conceal huge amounts of money.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Professor Eichengreen, there's another point about the historical connections I wanted to ask you about, because you write in your New York Times opinion piece that basically all modern economies in the world right now have a uniform, reliable payment system backed by their governments, right?

That's suitable for how interconnected economies are and that the issuing of stablecoins could fracture that. And how would regulators be able to regulate hundreds, if not thousands of different kinds of coins moving around in the U.S. economy? But I also think that's part of the point, right?

From the cryptocurrency industry's perspective, they simply do not trust anymore conventional institutions. And did we not have that same lack of trust in the 19th century that led to some of the free banking era?

EICHENGREEN: We did have the same lack of trust in the 19th century, so we had a central bank, the equivalent of the Fed, until President Andrew Jackson in 1832 concluded it was too powerful, and it needed to be abolished.

And that's when state governments stepped in and passed these free banking laws that permitted anybody with a minimum amount of money to establish his own bank. I do think it's important to bear in mind that there is this strong libertarian strand skepticism about regulation, about government in general underlying the stablecoin movement.

CHAKRABARTI: Zeke in the event that one of these stablecoins, let's hypothesize, in the future, would actually collapse. Given what we've seen in terms of how fast financial contagion can spread and now even faster because of things like social media. Could the collapse of a stablecoin actually quickly contaminate the rest of the U.S. economy?

FAUX: That's a fear that top officials in the U.S. have. The stablecoins don't have deposit insurance. So if customers start to worry about a particular stablecoin, they could all pull out their money at once. That could cause the stablecoin issuer to have to dump whatever assets they have on the market, depressing their price.

The bigger this gets, the more of a risk it is. In crypto, there's an almost an expectation that the whole industry will crash every couple years. They call it a cycle. And in the past when crypto has crashed, there haven't been that many interconnections between the real economy and the crypto world.

So it hasn't been a big problem for regular people. The more that crypto and the regular Wall Street are connected, the greater the risk that the next time crypto collapses, which no one will dispute will eventually happen. That could harm the real economy. So it's definitely something I'm worried about.

CHAKRABARTI: Wow. Okay. So in the last kind of minute and a half that we have, Professor Eichengreen, I'll give you the last word here because Zeke just said a couple of things. One is these stablecoins, there's no deposit insurance associated with them, which does not sound good for customers. And the presumption in the crypto industry that every couple of years there's going to be a crash.

That's the opposite of stability in an economy. So what would you suggest to lawmakers now to learn from the history of the 19th century that you walked us through?

EICHENGREEN: They can learn from the history of the 19th century, but they can also learn from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023 when the government worried about destabilizing the entire financial system and the economy.

They stepped in and they guaranteed all the deposits of Silicon Valley Bank. So legitimizing stablecoins is gonna create the expectation that when things go wrong, the taxpayer is gonna foot the bill, the government is gonna step in and stabilize newly unstable coins at our expense. I think that's a very real prospect.

CHAKRABARTI: So not wanting regulation, but still wanting government bailouts, that's what you're saying?

EICHENGREEN: Not for the first time.

CHAKRABARTI: If you'll allow me, I'd like to end the show today talking about my parents. My father, Dr. Sankar Lal Chakrabarti, died back in October 2022. My mother, Usha Chakrabarti, died just a couple of weeks ago on June 25th, only nine days shy of her 81st birthday. My mom and dad were married for 52 years.

Mom had an aggressive form of peritoneal cancer, and she was living with us in the Boston area in her final months. Now we don't have a large place, so my 10-year-old son had tenderly offered her his room, and it was there where my mother died. Peacefully supported by home hospice care, surrounded by her children and grandchildren.

And a few Lego robots, RC cars and stuffed animals. My mother was blessed to retain her lucidity until the day she died. It was only that morning as her body chemistry was rapidly changing, that she began hallucinating. And I don't know what it was. Maybe it's the reporter in me. More likely the grieving child in me, soon to be a motherless child.

And in that wild and selfish grief, I recorded some of my conversations with her in a desperate attempt to grab tight onto the gifts she was giving me, even now in the last hours of her life, as her eyes gazed into a light that mine could not see. I am gonna play a moment of that tape now, and there's nothing extreme in it.

My mother's hallucinations were not terrifying to her. She's not in distress, but I do understand that it could be difficult to hear the voice of a dying woman. This moment of tape is just over one minute long if you'd rather not listen to it. And again, I fully understand that, but let me assure you, my mom would be okay with this. Of that, I am sure.

Because she always told us to be brave and to face the facts of life, even at life's end. And also, I'd like to play this moment because it says more about her gentleness and determination than any words that I could come up with.

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Mom? Actually, wait, I'm not sure I heard that. Can you tell me again where are we right now? Because if you tell me, then I can really help you. Where are we?

USHA CHAKRABARTI: We're in the airport.

MEGHNA CHAKRBARTI: We're in the airport. Okay. Are we going somewhere?

USHA CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Where are we going?

USHA CHAKRABARTI: Here. 

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Here? That's my nose. You grabbed my nose. I got you. Are you going to get on an airplane, mom?

USHA CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. 

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Can I come with you? 

USHA CHAKRABARTI:  Okay. 

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Where are we gonna go? Where's the airplane flying to?

That's my face you keep patting. Is the airplane going to India? Is the airplane going to Oregon?

 USHA CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. 

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Okay. Okay. Love you.

CHAKRABARTI: Death is a distillation. My mom was frail, but so focused on home. Usha Kombrabail Chakrabarti was born in Mumbai, India in 1944. The youngest of four girls. But it is Corvallis, Oregon and the house I'm sitting in right now that she called home. She grew up poor. As a teenage girl, she wanted to go to the advanced math and science school in her neighborhood, but her parents could not afford to pay for it.

Instead for months, my mom prepared for exams by herself and scored high enough to get into the school on scholarship. And later on she wanted to pursue her master's degree in chemistry. But again, my grandparents just did not have the money to support her education. So my aunt, her oldest sister, took an extra job to help pay for my mom to go to graduate school, and my mother never forgot my aunt's love and sacrifice.

My mom had thick, black, curly hair, long eyelashes and was always working, always busy. She was a brilliant cook, international adventurer, culturally open-minded. We celebrated Christmas, Easter, Diwali, St. Patrick's Day, you name it because of her. She never got taller than five-foot, one inch.

But in our minds, she stood at more than a hundred feet tall. Her spirit was indomitable. Her generosity all encompassing, her standards high and her grit absolute. My father was utterly devoted to my mother. He could not live without her. He was the intellectual, the dreamer, the lover of abstraction, the one who decided that a better future for both of them awaited in the United States.

I like to think that if my father was the architect of our family's story, then it was my mother who was our chief engineer. The person whose hands, literal hands, hard work, and quiet genius actually built our family's edifice. Architects are dreamers. Engineers are the doers. That was definitely my dad and my mom.

My mom lived in the United States for a half century and here's the real point. She was the most American of us all, and no kidding. My mom's birthday is actually the 4th of July, and that is why I think that when her mind began taking those final steps on June 25th, that she was at the airport in her mind, waiting to fly home, not to India, but to Corvallis, Oregon, U.S.A.

My mother was fiercely proud of her adopted country and fiercely aware of its shortcomings, but I never once heard her complain. Instead, she was the doer. She volunteered at the schools my brother and I attended. She canvased and phone banked. She befriended everyone in the neighborhood no matter who they were or what they believed.

My mom worked very hard. We never had a ton of money when I was growing up, so like many moms, she went back to work as a research chemist only a few weeks after I was born. When my brother came along, mom wanted to be able to stay home with him, but we still needed two incomes. So she worked the graveyard shift at Hewlett-Packard making silicon chips while we were sleeping.

Always aim for excellence and be humble. That's what my dad imbued into me and my brother. My mom, less give it to you, philosophical pronouncements, oftentimes just told me, be tougher. I now know that what she meant was, you are stronger than you think you are. I know these things about my mom now as an adult, but I wish I had known them about her when we were both younger.

I wish I had seen her truthfully, the way my daughter clearly sees her grandmother. My teenage daughter was able to be by her grandmother's side the moment she passed away. But earlier in that day, my daughter was at camp. I called to give her an update on her grandmother's health, and my daughter had learned that hearing is the last sense to fade away in the dying brain.

So she really wanted me to hold the phone up to my mom's ear. She talked with her Ammama for a long time, and I recorded that too. My daughter has given me permission to share this part with you.

You inspire me, Ammama, and you challenge me to always never give up. And you know what? I was told one time that just because you don't give up doesn't mean you'll make it. But you know what? You are proof Ammama, that's not true. And I'm not saying that you can lift a car with one hand, but it's resilience that isn't easy to acquire, but I'll learn from your example. Because I want to be like you.

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: And you're doing, you just, your words are reaching her. It's really helped calm her.

Okay. okay. It's not that I won't be able to reach what you've reached, it's that I will be able to reach what you've reached because I've had you in my life. It's not a farewell because you're not leaving me.

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Yeah.

It's an I'll see you later, and I love you and we will all, we'll all get through this together and I just, I love you so much.

CHAKRABARTI: My mother, Usha Chakrabarti built me. And while I mourn losing her, my much greater sorrow lies in the fact that even though I told her I loved her all the time, I did not often enough tell her how much I appreciate her. Women are the keystones in most families.

They carry the weight of their family's futures invisibly on their backs. So in honor of my mother, I ask you one simple thing. If there's a woman who has helped build you up, please take a moment to hold her close. And say, I love you. I appreciate you. I see you. Mom, I see you. Now, go out there into the cosmos and go see dad.

Hedera, a blockchain platform, has received significant backing from tech giants NVIDIA and Intel, marking a pivotal moment for both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence sectors. According to crypto analyst Mark Chadwick, NVIDIA is integrating Verifiable Compute technology into its next-generation Blackwell chips, with the technology running on Hedera's blockchain. This integration positions Hedera at the core of future AI infrastructure, a development that has sparked considerable excitement within the crypto community.

Verifiable Compute, developed by EQTY Lab in collaboration with Intel and NVIDIA, ensures that AI computations are recorded and cannot be altered afterward. This technology enhances the explainability, trust, and security of AI systems by providing a tamper-proof trail of AI decision-making processes. Hedera's Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) provides the blockchain infrastructure necessary for this verification, enabling every AI decision, process, and model output to be tracked and verified on the Hedera network.

This development is more than just a partnership; it represents a validation of Hedera's technology as a foundational element in the future of AI. NVIDIA's Blackwell chips, described as the backbone of next-generation AI, will be used in various sectors including data centers, autonomous systems, finance, and medicine. If Verifiable Compute becomes the industry standard, and Hedera powers it, HBAR, the native token of the Hedera network, could see unprecedented adoption. The involvement of Accenture and SCAN UK further underscores the real-world, enterprise-grade application of this technology.

This integration aligns with global AI regulations that demand greater transparency. For instance, the EU AI Act requires AI models to be explainable and accountable, especially in sensitive sectors. Verifiable Compute, powered by Hedera, addresses these regulatory requirements, offering a solution that goes beyond technological innovation to solve real-world compliance issues.

The community's response to this news has been overwhelmingly positive, with many predicting significant upside for HBAR. Some users have even suggested that HBAR could become a standard in the AI industry. Mark Chadwick's tweet highlighted the unprecedented level of mainstream adoption Hedera is achieving, a claim supported by the involvement of major tech companies like NVIDIA, Intel, and Accenture.

Hedera, which has often been overshadowed by more hyped blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana, could now emerge as a key player in the AI sector. This partnership positions Hedera at the forefront of the fastest-growing industry, potentially transforming it from a blockchain platform into a critical component of digital infrastructure for AI. For HBAR holders, this development could herald a new era of growth and adoption, positioning Hedera as a quiet giant in the making.

All Metal Quotes

This article is written by one of Kitco's sponsors. The views expressed in this article are those of the author and may not reflect those of Kitco Metals Inc. 

(Kitco News) - G-Knot, a biometrics technology innovator, has unveiled plans for the world's first finger vein biometric crypto wallet, aiming to revolutionize security in digital asset storage. This launch coincides with the appointment of fintech veteran Wes Kaplan as CEO, who will guide the commercialization of the technology.

Company Overview and Mission

As the exclusive licensee of eTunnel Inc.—a Seoul-based leader in finger vein biometrics with over 10 years of R&D—G-Knot is dedicated to harnessing unforgeable internal vein patterns for enhanced digital security. The company's mission addresses critical vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency, where hacks have exceeded $1.4 billion in losses in 2025 alone. By replacing traditional private keys and recovery phrases with biometric authentication, G-Knot seeks to simplify self-custody while extending applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) and identity management for consumers and enterprises.

Leadership Transition

Wes Kaplan, with a background in fintech and crypto from roles at Cointelegraph, AscendEX, and Tradewind Markets, as well as traditional finance at J.P. Morgan and BNY Mellon, steps in as CEO. Kaplan aims to scale the technology's adoption, stating: “G-Knot is poised to redefine security in the digital age... By replacing the need for recovery phrases with users' unique biometric authentication, we're not only solving today's issues but also paving the way for broader applications in decentralized finance and identity management.”

The Core Technology: Finger Vein Biometrics Explained



Finger vein recognition operates by using near-infrared light to illuminate and capture the unique vein patterns beneath the skin's surface. Veins absorb the light, creating a high-contrast image that is then processed via pattern recognition algorithms for authentication. This internal biometric is contactless or minimally invasive, requiring no physical touch, which enhances hygiene and usability.

Key advantages include superior accuracy and spoof resistance compared to surface-based methods like fingerprints, as vein patterns are hidden and require live blood flow for detection (ensuring ""aliveness""). They remain permanent throughout life, offer low false acceptance rates, and are resilient to external factors like dirt or scars. However, potential drawbacks involve higher implementation costs due to specialized hardware, possible challenges for users with circulatory issues, and general biometric concerns like privacy risks or false rejections in varying conditions.

In cryptocurrency contexts, this tech enables secure key generation directly from biometric data, often integrated with deep learning for robust cryptographic keys or blockchain systems to prevent linkage attacks. G-Knot's wallet leverages these features to provide enterprise-grade protection, drawing from eTunnel's proven track record, including a 2024 UN contract for biometric smart cards.

Youngkuk Kim, CEO of eTunnel, commented: “As eTunnel continues to advance biometric research, G-Knot... will leverage the gold standard of biometric technology to deliver enterprise-grade and consumer-focused products that address the growing security needs of an increasingly digital world.”

Future Prospects and Broader Impact

G-Knot positions itself as the global leader in commercial finger vein solutions, with the wallet as the first step toward expanded products in DeFi, identity verification, and beyond. This innovation could significantly reduce crypto fraud by making secure, user-friendly authentication accessible, while advancing biometric-blockchain integrations for a safer digital ecosystem.

Bitcoin's rally to $120,000 this week has sparked a broader breakout across major crypto assets, with ether (ETH), Solana's SOL, XRP, and dogecoin DOGE$0.1963 all posting high single-digit percentage gains.

However, this time, price action isn't just about momentum, as traders claim that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence.

“This isn't a frenzied boom with no foundation,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank. “It's a measured ascent, backed up by large institutional players with the long-term in mind.”

Rocca pointed to tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility as reinforcing Bitcoin's emerging role as a macro hedge, adding that “the momentum we've seen over the last 48 hours is clear. Bitcoin isn't just growing in value, but also as a genuine asset class that is rivalling traditional finance.”

Ethereum, up over 17% on the week and briefly crossed $3,000, remains a primary beneficiary. ""In Q2, corporate treasury purchases of BTC outpaced inflows into spot ETFs,"" said the analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash in a note to CoinDesk.

""That points to strategic positioning. At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads.""

Solana, now trading around $163, gained over 11% on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25%, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution.

“Price action may grab the spotlight,” TeraHash added, “but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.”

The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23% over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green.

Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that “strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay — and a potential comeback of meme coins can't be ruled out either.”

But not everyone sees a straight line up.

“Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone,” said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email.

“A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the $130,000 range,” Lienkha added.

Major cryptocurrencies, excluding XRP, registered moderate losses as President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from Mexico and the European Union (EU).

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

""Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal.

Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal.

Bitcoin BTC$117,407.29, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $117,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $118,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multiple times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing.

The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend.

""Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today. Then Asia comes in late on Sunday evening and buys ALL the Bitcoin, and we break through $120k,"" the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said on X.

At the time of writing, bitcoin BTC$117,407.29 is hovering around the $118,000 level, flirting with the idea of setting a new all-time high this weekend.

On Friday, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) had reached an important milestone at the close of trading on the previous day, becoming the fastest ETF to reach $80 billion in assets under management (AUM). The second fastest ETF to achieve this level was Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which reached it in 1,814 days.

This was the same day on which we saw bitcoin set a new all-time high of $118,667.

During interviews with CNBC and Yahoo Finance, Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan said his firm expects the BTC price to reach over $200,000 by the end of this year.

As for how high bitcoin could go, hedge fund manager James Lavish says that the bitcoin price is similar to the U.S. debt ceiling in that, ultimately, there is no limit.

 Santiment data shows the number of XRP whales has just hit an all-time high as the price of XRP continues to rally. 

The number of crypto wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has reached an all-time high, coinciding with a 26% surge in XRP's price over the past week.

“Not only are there more XRP whales than ever, but the total supply they hold is also increasing,” onchain analytics platform Santiment said in a report on Friday, noting that the number of wallets holding over 1 million XRP (XRP) tokens has surged to a new all-time high of 2,743.

“XRP is also showing signs of strength,” Santiment said. “This dual trend is a very positive sign for the fourth-largest crypto asset,” they added.

Santiment data shows that 47.32 billion XRP tokens are held by crypto wallets holding at least 1 million tokens.

XRP has surged 26% over the past seven days, trading at $2.80 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Over the past 24 hours alone, it has spiked 10%. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows the surge wiped $31.44 million in XRP short positions.

Just last month, on June 18, traders were divided on XRP's next direction as the cryptocurrency had been consolidating for nearly 200 days within a range of $1.90 to $2.90.

However, XRP's recent rally is part of a broader market breakout that saw Bitcoin (BTC) reach consecutive all-time highs of $112,000 on Wednesday, $116,500 on Thursday, and $118,780 on Friday.

Ether (ETH) also surged, up 17.51% across the week, trading at $2,958 at the time of publication.

Santiment said that the metrics indicate that altcoin season has begun. “The data confirms that, for now, it has,” Santiment said.

“As long as Bitcoin can maintain its position above the crucial psychological support level of around $110k, traders will likely feel comfortable redistributing profits into altcoins,” they added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Altcoins are rocketing, Bitcoin dominance hasn't ‘even sneezed': Analyst","https://cointelegraph.com/news/altcoin-crypto-market-surging-bitcoin-dominance-analyst","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 05:11:56 GMT","

 Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland suggests altcoins will be “ripping” much more when Bitcoin Dominance drops to 45%. 

A crypto analyst suggests altcoins may have plenty more upside, as many are already surging without pulling much market share from Bitcoin.

“BTC dominance hasn't even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in an X post on Friday. 

TradingView shows Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance is 64.46% at the time of publication, down just 1.53% over the past week, while altcoins saw significant price spikes amid Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs on Wednesday, Thursday, and reaching $118,760 on Friday.

Hyland said, “What do you think happens if it drops from 65 to 45.”

Analysts have traditionally used Bitcoin Dominance to gauge the timing of altcoin season, with a decline typically seen as a signal that altcoins are gaining market share.

However, while BTC Dominance stayed relatively steady, the recent altcoin surge could signal that fresh capital is flowing into the wider market.

MemeCore (M) leads the top 100 crypto gainers over the past seven days with a 1,263% surge, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75.01%, and Stellar (XLM) up 67.43%, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, is up 17.68% over the past seven days, which is often another indicator traders use to determine when the focus is turning from Bitcoin to the broader market.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's relative strength against Bitcoin, is up 8.39% over the past seven days.

However, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index suggests the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin, with the Index reading a “Bitcoin Season” score of 29 out of 100. 

In an X post on Friday, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said, “I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.”

 US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows on two straight days for the first time ever, as Bitcoin hit new all-time highs this week. 

US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in daily inflows for the second consecutive day on Friday, marking the first time since their January 2024 launch that they've seen two back-to-back days with ten-digit inflows.

On Friday, the 11 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF products recorded total inflows of $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion in inflows the day before, according to Farside data.  

NovaDius Wealth Management president Nate Geraci said in an X post that since the January 2024 launch, there have been only seven inflow days exceeding $1 billion, two of which occurred in the past two days. Before that, the last was on Jan. 17, with $1.07 billion.

The $1.17 billion inflow on Thursday was their second-largest daily inflow since inception, behind only the $1.37 billion recorded on Nov. 7, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. 

Bitwise Invest chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a Friday post that while the Bitcoin network produced about 450 Bitcoins on Thursday, spot Bitcoin ETFs bought around 10,000.

Similarly, Jan3 pointed out that on Wednesday, Bitcoin ETF demand was “22x greater” than the daily mined supply. 

Jan3 CEO Samson Mow said, “This demand is not sustainable at these price levels.”

It was a strong trading week for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $2.72 billion in inflows over five days, as Bitcoin's spot price hit fresh all-time highs of $112,000 on Wednesday and continued climbing to reach $118,780 on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The price surge led to BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) crossing $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) on Thursday. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on Friday that it was the “fastest ETF” to ever do that in 374 days.

It was recently reported that BlackRock now earns more revenue from its IBIT fund than its flagship S&P 500 fund, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, on an annual basis.

Balchunas added, “Total assets for all the spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed $140b for the first time as well.” However, he said that the price surge did “most of the heavy lifting here.”

 Asia's regulatory frameworks in tokenization are attracting global investors, with Japan and Hong Kong setting the pace for real-world asset adoption. 

Asia's leadership in tokenization is drawing growing attention from global investors, with regulatory clarity in the region attracting capital that was once on the sidelines, according to Maarten Henskens, head of protocol growth at Startale Group.

“We're seeing Western institutions set up Asia-Pacific operations not just to follow capital, but to participate in innovation,” he told Cointelegraph. Henskens pointed out the distinct yet complementary approaches taken by Japan and Hong Kong to advance real-world asset (RWA) adoption.

Japan's regulatory framework has been deliberate and forward-looking, establishing a strong foundation of institutional trust. “MUFG's infrastructure for security token issuance is a good example of how the ecosystem is maturing,” he noted.

Japan's Payment Services Act (PSA) also allows trusted stablecoins to hold up to 50% of their reserves in low-risk government bonds and term deposits, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to regulation.

Hong Kong, by contrast, has moved swiftly, launching the Ensemble Sandbox as a fast-track regulatory innovation hub. “While Japan is building long-term depth, Hong Kong is showing how agility can bring experimentation to life,” Henskens said.

The rise of tokenized bonds and ETFs is playing a key role in bringing traditional investors into crypto markets. In Japan, real estate security tokens are making previously closed markets accessible to retail investors, sometimes more so than traditional J-REITs.

Tokenization streamlines fund administration and increases transparency, allowing asset managers to connect directly with end-users. “This efficiency, paired with improved transparency, could make these products compelling to traditional investors who might not otherwise enter the crypto space,” Henskens said.

He flagged cross-border interoperability as the next major milestone. “Seamless and compliant movement of tokenized assets across jurisdictions” will be critical for scaling adoption.

In Asia, this means linking infrastructure across countries like Japan and Hong Kong, while globally, regulatory frameworks must reflect the technical realities of tokenized finance, especially around settlement, compliance, and custody.

Dubai has been another Asian country making strides in tokenization. The city's regulatory authorities have introduced progressive frameworks that encourage the issuance and trading of tokenized securities, attracting global investors and fintech firms.

In May, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, Dubai's crypto regulator, updated its guidelines to include provisions for RWA tokenization. Lawyer Irina Heaver told Cointelegraph these rules give issuers and exchanges a clear path to launch and trade tokenized real estate assets. 

Last month, the Dubai Land Department, in collaboration with VARA and top developers, successfully tokenized and sold two apartments, with the entire offering selling out within minutes, according to Heaver. Buyers came from over 35 countries, and notably, 70% were first-time real estate investors in Dubai.

“We're already seeing a network effect: innovation in one jurisdiction sparks progress in another,” Henskens said. “Different regions may optimize for different outcomes, and that's a strength, not a liability,” he added.

Math Puzzle: How Many Handshakes?

By Emma R. Hasson 

Leila and Sahar are attending a dinner party with four other couples. Each attendee knows their partner, but they may or may not know anyone else there. Before the five couples sit down to eat, anyone who doesn't know each other shakes hands. After everyone sits, Leila makes an observation to the table: “I just noticed that no two of you shook hands the same number of times.” How many hands did Leila and Sahar each shake? (Martin Gardner previously included a variation of this puzzle, attributed to mathematician Lars Bertil Owe, in his Mathematical Games column in the May 1973 issue of Scientific American.)

The maximum number of hands anyone could have shaken is eight—they wouldn't have shaken their own or their partner's hand. That leaves exactly nine possible numbers of hands for the nine people other than Leila at the table: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You can solve the puzzle by assigning each person a number of handshakes and considering who must be partners with whom. (It might be helpful to draw a diagram of all the handshakes.) Person 8 must have shaken hands with everyone but 0 (because 0 didn't shake any hands), meaning 0 must be 8's partner. Then 1 has already used up their handshake with 8, so 7 shakes hands with everyone except 0 and 1. Person 0 already has a partner, so 7's partner must be 1. We can continue like this, finding that 6 is partnered with 2 and that 5 is partnered with 3. Person 4 is the only one left without a partner, so 4 must be Sahar, Leila's partner, who has shaken hands four times. Leila has shaken hands with 8, 7, 6 and 5, so Leila has also shaken exactly four hands.

Pepper, the pet cat who made headlines last year for his role in the discovery of the first jeilongvirus found in the U.S., is at it again. This time, his hunting prowess contributed to the identification of a new strain of orthoreovirus.

John Lednicky, Ph.D., Pepper's owner and a University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions virologist, took Pepper's catch -- a dead Everglades short-tailed shrew -- into the lab for testing as part of his ongoing work to understand transmission of the mule deerpox virus.

Testing revealed the shrew had a previously unidentified strain of orthoreovirus. Viruses in this genus are known to infect humans, white-tailed deer, bats and other mammals. While orthoreoviruses' effects on humans are not yet well understood, there have been rare reports of the virus being associated with cases of encephalitis, meningitis and gastroenteritis in children.

""The bottom line is we need to pay attention to orthoreoviruses, and know how to rapidly detect them,"" said Lednicky, a research professor in the PHHP Department of Environmental and Global Health and a member of UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute.

The UF team published the complete genomic coding sequences for the virus they named ""Gainesville shrew mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain UF-1"" in the journal Microbiology Resource Announcements.

""There are many different mammalian orthoreoviruses and not enough is known about this recently identified virus to be concerned,"" said the paper's lead author Emily DeRuyter, a UF Ph.D. candidate in One Health. ""Mammalian orthoreoviruses were originally considered to be 'orphan' viruses, present in mammals including humans, but not associated with diseases. More recently, they have been implicated in respiratory, central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases.""

The Lednicky lab's jeilongvirus and orthoreovirus discoveries come on the heels of the team publishing their discovery of two other novel viruses found in farmed white-tailed deer. Given the propensity of viruses to constantly evolve, paired with the team's sophisticated lab techniques, finding new viruses isn't entirely surprising, Lednicky said.

""I'm not the first one to say this, but essentially, if you look, you'll find, and that's why we keep finding all these new viruses,"" Lednicky said.

Like influenza virus, two different types of orthoreovirus can infect a host cell, causing the viruses' genes to mix and match, in essence, creating a brand new virus, Lednicky said.

In 2019, Lednicky and colleagues isolated the first orthoreovirus found in a deer. That strain's genes were nearly identical to an orthoreovirus found in farmed mink in China and a deathly ill lion in Japan. How in the world, the scientific community wondered, could the same hybrid virus appear in a farmed deer in Florida and two species of carnivores across the globe? Some experts speculated that components of the animals' feed could have come from the same manufacturer.

With so many unanswered questions about orthoreoviruses and their modes of transmission, prevalence in human and animal hosts and just how sick they could make us, more research is needed, DeRuyter and Lednicky said.

Next steps would include serology and immunology studies to understand the threat Gainesville shrew mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain UF-1 may hold for humans, wildlife and pets.

For readers concerned about Pepper's health, rest assured. He has shown no signs of illness from his outdoor adventures and will likely continue to contribute to scientific discovery through specimen collection.

""This was an opportunistic study,"" Lednicky said. ""If you come across a dead animal, why not test it instead of just burying it? There is a lot of information that can be gained.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found 200+ hidden proteins that may drive Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250711224328.htm","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 15:00:44 GMT","

For decades, the story of Alzheimer's research has been dominated by a battle between A-beta and tau amyloids, both of which can kill neurons and impact the brain's ability to function. A new study suggests, however, that these sticky brain plaques may not be operating alone.

Johns Hopkins University researchers have identified more than 200 types of misfolded proteins in rats that could be associated with age-related cognitive decline.

The findings could lead the way to finding new therapeutic targets and treatments in humans that could provide relief for the millions of people over 65 who suffer from Alzheimer's, dementia, or other diseases that rob them of their memories and independence as they age.

""Amyloids are the buildup of misshapen proteins. They're big and ugly and easy to see under the microscope, so it makes sense that they catch our attention. But we're seeing hundreds of proteins misfolding in ways that don't clump together in an amyloid and yet still seem to impact how the brain functions,"" said Stephen Fried, an assistant professor of chemistry and protein scientist who studies how molecules in the brain change during aging. ""Our research is showing that amyloids are just the tip of the iceberg.""

The results were published on July 11 in Science Advances.

To understand the molecular differences between older brains that are mentally sharp and those that are experiencing decline, Fried and his team studied 17 2-year-old rats that grew up in the same colony. Seven rats performed poorly on memory and problem-solving tests and were considered cognitively impaired, while 10 performed as well as 6-month-old rats.

The researchers then measured more than 2,500 types of protein in the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with spatial learning and memory. For the first time, scientists were able to determine for a large number of proteins whether individual proteins were misshapen or folded incorrectly, allowing the researchers to work out which proteins misfold for all the rats and are associated with aging in general versus which proteins specifically misfold in cognitively impaired rats.

More than 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats yet maintained their shapes in the cognitively healthy rats. The findings suggest that some of those proteins are contributing to cognitive decline, the researchers said.

Misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, so cells have a natural surveillance system that identifies and destroys these misbehaving proteins. Previously, researchers thought misfolded proteins -- specifically A-beta and tau proteins -- were only disruptive when they clumped into amyloids.

""We think there are a lot of proteins that can be misfolded, not form amyloids, and still be problematic,"" Fried said. ""And that suggests these misfolded proteins have ways of escaping this surveillance system in the cell.""

But exactly how those misfolded proteins slip past a cell's security system remains a mystery.

Next, the team plans to look at misfolded proteins under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of what their deformities look like at the molecular level.

""A lot of us have experienced a loved one or a relative who has become less capable of doing those everyday tasks that require cognitive abilities,"" Fried said. ""Understanding what's physically going on in the brain could lead to better treatments and preventive measures.""

Nerve cells are not just nerve cells. Depending on how finely we distinguish, there are several hundred to several thousand different types of nerve cell in the human brain according to the latest calculations. These cell types vary in their function, in the number and length of their cellular appendages, and in their interconnections. They emit different neurotransmitters into our synapses and, depending on the region of the brain - for example, the cerebral cortex or the midbrain - different cell types are active.

When scientists produced nerve cells from stem cells in Petri dishes for their experiments in the past, it was not possible to take their vast diversity into account. Until now, researchers had only developed procedures for growing a few dozen different types of nerve cell in vitro. They achieved this using genetic engineering or by adding signalling molecules to activate particular cellular signalling pathways. However, they never got close to achieving the diversity of hundreds or thousands of different nerve cell types that actually exists.

""Neurons derived from stem cells are frequently used to study diseases. But up to now, researchers have often ignored which precise types of neuron they are working with,"" says Barbara Treutlein, Professor at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich in Basel. However, this is not the best approach to such work. ""If we want to develop cell culture models for diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and depression, we need to take the specific type of nerve cell involved into consideration.""

Systematic screening was the key to success

Treutlein and her team have now successfully produced over 400 different types of nerve cell. In doing so, the scientists have paved the way for more precise basic neurological research with cell culture experiments.

The ETH researchers achieved this by working with a culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells that had been generated from blood cells. In these cells, they used genetic engineering to activate certain neuronal regulator genes and treated the cells with various morphogens, a special class of signalling molecules. Treutlein and her team took a systematic approach, using seven morphogens in different combinations and concentrations in their screening experiments. This resulted in almost 200 different sets of experimental conditions.

Morphogens

Morphogens are messengers that are known from research into embryonic development. They are not distributed uniformly within an embryo but occur in a variety of concentrations forming spatial patterns. In this way, they define the position of cells within the embryo, for example whether a cell is near the body axis or in the back, abdomen, head or torso. Accordingly, morphogens help to determine what grows where in the embryo.

The researchers used various analyses to prove that they had produced over 400 different types of nerve cell in their experiment. They examined the RNA (and therefore genetic activity) at the level of individual cells, as well as the external appearance of cells and their function: for example, which type of cell appendage they had in which quantities and which electric nerve impulses they emitted.

The researchers then compared their data with information from databases of neurons from the human brain. By doing this, they were able to identify the types of nerve cell that had been created, such as those found in the peripheral nervous system or brain cells and the part of the brain they come from, whether they perceive pain, cold or movement, and so on.

In-vitro neurons for active ingredient research

Treutlein clarifies that they are still a long way off producing all types of nerve cell that exist in vitro. Nonetheless, the researchers now have access to a much larger number of different cell types than they had before.

They would like to use in-vitro nerve cells to develop cell culture models for studying serious neurological conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, sleep disorders and multiple sclerosis. Cell culture models of this kind are also of great interest in pharmaceutical research for testing the effects of new active compounds in cell cultures without animal testing, with the ultimate aim of one day being able to cure these conditions.

In the future, the cells could also be used for cell replacement therapy, which involves replacing sick or dead nerve cells in the brain with new human cells.

But there is a challenge to overcome before this can happen: the researchers often produced a mixture of multiple different types of nerve cell in their experiments. They are now working to optimise their method so that each experimental condition only produces one specific cell type. They already have some initial ideas as to how this might be achieved.

Archaeologists from the University of Houston working at Caracol in Belize, Central America have uncovered the tomb of Te K'ab Chaak, the first ruler of this ancient Maya city and the founder of its royal dynasty. Now in ruins, this metropolis was a major political player in Maya history, dominating the southern part of the Yucatan Peninsula from 560 through 680 AD before its abandonment by 900 AD.

The discovery is the first identifiable ruler's tomb found in over four decades of work in Caracol, the largest Maya archaeological site in Belize and in the Maya lowlands.

Te K'ab Chaak, who acceded to the throne in 331 AD, was interred at the base of a royal family shrine with eleven pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, jadeite jewelry, a mosaic jadeite mask, Pacific spondylus shells, and other perishable materials. Pottery vessels in the chamber included a scene of a Maya ruler holding a spear and receiving offerings from supplicants in the form of deities. Another vessel portrays the image of Ek Chuah, Maya god of traders, surrounded by offerings. Four of the pottery vessels portray bound captives (similar vessels also appeared in two related burials). Two vessels supported lids with modeled handles of coatimundi (pisote) heads. The coatimundi, or tz'uutz' in Maya, was used by subsequent Caracol rulers as part of their names.

A team led by husband and wife collaborators Arlen F. Chase and Diane Z. Chase of the University of Houston has been excavating at Caracol for more than 40 years; this field season was carried out in concert with Belize's Institute of Archaeology and was supported by the Alphawood Foundation, the University of Houston, the Geraldine and Emory Ford Foundation, and the KHR Family Fund.

The Chases estimate that at the time of his burial the ruler was of advanced age and approximately 5'7"" in height. He had no remaining teeth.

Their investigations at Caracol's Northeast Acropolis show that Te K'ab Chaak's tomb was the first of three major burials dating to about 350 AD, a time of early contact with the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, some 1200 kilometers distant. By 300 AD, Teotihuacan was a huge city that traded throughout Central America.

""One question that has perplexed Maya archaeologists since the 1960s is whether a new political order was introduced to the Maya area by Mexicans from Teotihuacan,"" said Diane Z. Chase, archeologist and senior vice president for academic affairs and Provost at the University of Houston. ""Maya carved stone monuments, hieroglyphic dates, iconography, and archaeological data all suggest that widespread pan-Mesoamerican connections occurred after an event in 378 AD referred to as the ""entrada."" Whether this event represented actual Teotihuacanos in the Maya area or Maya using central Mexican symbols is still debated. The Caracol archaeological data suggests that the situation was far more complicated.""

A cremation placed in the center of Caracol's Northeast Acropolis plaza, recovered in 2010 and placed after Te K'aab Chaak's burial has been dated to AD 350 by radiocarbon analysis and included artifacts from central Mexico. It contained the remains of three individuals, as well as two large knives, six atlatl points, and fifteen pristine blades of green obsidian from Pachuca, Mexico (north of Teotihuacan); several pottery vessels also likely came from central Mexico. Additionally, a carved atlatl projectile tip, atypical for the Maya but typical for a Teotihuacan warrior, was included in the cremation.

The cremation itself and its placement in the center of a residential plaza are also more typical practices for a high-status Teotihuacano and do not accord with standard Maya burial practices. Based on other ceramics in this cremation, the main individual was likely a Caracol royal family member that had adopted central Mexican ritual practices. This individual may even have served as a royal Maya envoy who had lived at Teotihuacan and returned to Caracol.

A third burial - the tomb of a woman, also covered with hematite and containing four pottery vessels, a spondylus bead necklace, mirror fragments, and two Pacific spondylus shells - was recovered in the northern building of the same residential group in 2009 and is similarly dated.

The three burials interred in the Caracol Northeast Acropolis all cluster at AD 350, at least a generation before the previously recognized Teotihuacan presence in the Maya area. They demonstrate that early Maya rulers were fully enmeshed in Mesoamerican-wide contacts prior to the Teotihuacan entrada recorded on Maya monument[s].

""Both central Mexico and the Maya area were clearly aware of each other's ritual practices, as reflected in the Caracol cremation, said Arlen F. Chase, professor and chair of Comparative Cultural Studies at the University of Houston. ""The connections between the two regions were undertaken by the highest levels of society, suggesting that initial kings at various Maya cities - such as Te K'ab Chaak at Caracol - were engaged in formal diplomatic relationships with Teotihuacan."" The royal dynasty established by Te K'ab Chaak continued at Caracol for over 460 years.

The Chase's findings also indicate that ancient peoples in the new world were travelers. A trip between Teotihuacan and Caracol today by car would take over 23 hours. The one-way walking time may be estimated to be approximately 153 days.

Research continues on the contents of the chamber with the reconstruction of the jadeite death mask and with ancient DNA and stable isotope analysis of the skeletal material. The Chases will present results of the 2025 Caracol field season at a conference on Maya-Teotihuacan interaction hosted by the Maya Working Group at the Santa Fe Institute (New Mexico) in August 2025.

About the Chases

Married since 1975, Diane and Arlen Chase are two of the most influential Maya archaeologists in the world, and the foremost experts on Caracol, one of the most significant ancient Maya cities.

Since their first dig in 1985, the Chases have become known for:

Providing a nuanced picture of Caracol's ancient landscape and people, including recognition of Caracol as a city of advanced urban planning, road systems and markets and a large non-elite population upending the notion of a strict Maya social hierarchy. In 1986 they discovered an inscription that told of Caracol's military victory over Tikal in 562 AD, overturning the myth that Tikal was the most powerful Classic Period city and illustrating that Caracol was a major military and political power.

Using airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) technology to uncover structures hidden for centuries under dense jungle, revolutionizing how archaeologists explore Maya sites. Their work from the 1980s-2000s revealed a web of interconnected roadways, proving that Caracol was a massive, urban and integrated city.

Overturning outdated beliefs about the Maya, while providing new insights. Their archaeological work has shown that ancient Maya society was composed of many different social gradients, contrary to more simple two-class models. From the 1980s -2000, they and their team mapped numerous causeways (or roads) and thousands of agricultural terraces spread out across Caracol as well as hundreds of reservoirs in non-elite areas, proving that water, sacred to the Maya, was not controlled by the elite, as previously thought. The Chases' son, Adrian Chase, also an archaeologist, found that Caracol had a decentralized water system and that residential groups had their own access. He is currently studying the urban structure of Caracol and changes in governance over time.

The Chases will present detailed information on the tomb and other finds from Caracol at the Santa Fe Institute in August.

Despite a warming climate, bone-chilling winter cold can grip parts of the U.S. -- and this study explains why. Researchers found that two specific patterns in the polar vortex, a swirling mass of cold air high in the stratosphere, steer extreme cold to different regions of the country. One pattern drives Arctic air into the Northwest U.S., the other into the Central and Eastern areas. Since 2015, the Northwest has experienced more of these cold outbreaks, thanks to a shift in stratospheric behavior tied to broader climate cycles. In short: what happens high above the Arctic can shape the winter on your doorstep.

As winters in the United States continue to warm on average, extreme cold snaps still manage to grip large swaths of the country with surprising ferocity. A new study offers a powerful clue: the answer may lie more than 10 miles above our heads -- in the shifting patterns of the stratosphere.

The international team includes Prof. Chaim Garfinkel (Hebrew University), Dr. Laurie Agel and Prof. Mathew Barlow (University of Massachusetts), Prof. Judah Cohen (MIT and Atmospheric and Environmental Research AER), Karl Pfeiffer (Atmospheric and Environmental Research Hampton), Prof. Jennifer Francis (Woodwell Climate Research Center), Prof. Marlene Kretchmer (University of Leipzig). The study published in Science Advances, reveals how two specific patterns in the stratospheric polar vortex -- a high-altitude ribbon of cold air circling the Arctic -- can trigger bone-chilling weather events across different parts of the U.S.

""The public often hears about the 'polar vortex' when winter turns severe, but we wanted to dig deeper and understand how variations within this vortex affect where and when extreme cold hits,"" said the researchers.

Two Vortex Patterns, Two U.S. Outcomes

The team identified two distinct variations of the polar vortex, both linked to what scientists call a ""stretched"" vortex -- a distorted and displaced circulation pattern that leads to unusual weather on the ground.

Both versions are associated with changes in how atmospheric waves bounce around the globe -- essentially altering the jet stream and dragging Arctic air far southward.

A Westward Shift in the Cold

Perhaps most striking is the discovery that since 2015, much of the northwestern U.S. has been getting colder in winter, contrary to broader warming trends. The researchers tie this shift to the increased frequency of the westward-focused vortex pattern, which also coincides with stronger negative phases of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) -- a key global climate driver.

""Climate change doesn't just mean warming everywhere all the time. It also means more complex and sometimes counterintuitive shifts in where extreme weather shows up,"" explained the researchers.

Why It Matters

These findings help explain recent cold waves in places like Montana, the Plains and even Texas as in February 2021 (which was very costly in terms of deaths and insured losses), while other regions may experience milder winters. Understanding the stratosphere's fingerprints on weather patterns could improve long-range forecasting, allowing cities, power grids, and agriculture to better prepare for winter extremes -- even as the climate warms overall.

The work was funded by a US NSF-BSF grant by Chaim Garfinkel of HUJI and Judah Cohen of AER&MIT.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Tiny fossil with razor teeth found by student — rewrites mammal history","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250711224319.htm","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 14:09:25 GMT","

A University of Portsmouth student has discovered a new species of prehistoric mammal dating back 145 million years to the Berriasian age, providing fresh insights into the diversity of early mammals that lived alongside dinosaurs.

A University of Portsmouth student has discovered a new species of prehistoric mammal dating back 145 million years to the Berriasian age, providing fresh insights into the diversity of early mammals that lived alongside dinosaurs.

Benjamin Weston, 22, an undergraduate paleontology student, made the remarkable discovery while conducting fieldwork in the cliffs of Durlston Bay near Swanage, Dorset. The fossilized lower jaw he found represents a completely new species of multituberculate -- an extinct group of early mammals known for the distinctive tubercles on their posterior teeth.

The 16.5mm-long jaw is characterized by a long pointed incisor at the front, followed by a gap and then four razor-sharp premolars. While superficially resembling a rabbit's jaw, the pointed incisors and distinctive premolars identify it as belonging to the multituberculate group.

This discovery, published in Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, marks the first multituberculate jaw found at Swanage since Victorian times, and its unique size and shape confirmed it as an entirely new species.

""I instantly had my suspicions of what the jaw was when I found it at the beach, but couldn't have imagined where the discovery would take me,"" said Ben Weston. ""I'm extremely grateful to the team and to the university for helping me take my first steps into academic paleontology.""

Dr Roy Smith and Emeritus Professor David Martill, who supervised the research, enlisted the expertise of Dr Steve Sweetman, a former Portsmouth student and now honorary research fellow, who specializes in rare Early Cretaceous mammal fossils from the Isle of Wight and Isle of Purbeck regions.

This was not the first time a student made a once-in-a-lifetime discovery in Dorset. In 2017, undergraduate Grant Smith recovered fossilis of two new species of Humankind's earliest ancestors from rocks exposed in cliffs near Swanage.

Dr Sweetman said: ""This is a remarkable find that reminds me of when Grant found those extraordinary eutherian mammal teeth. When I first saw Grant's specimens, my jaw dropped -- and I had exactly the same reaction to Ben's multituberculate jaw. It's incredible that Durlston Bay keeps delivering such significant mammal discoveries by our undergraduate students.""

Advanced technology reveals hidden details

The delicate fossil presented challenges, with pieces of rock obscuring vital details. The University's advanced CT scanning capabilities proved crucial to the research. Dr Charles Wood, Senior Scientific Officer in the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, used CT scanning to reveal the specimen inside the rock, producing remarkable results due to the contrast between fossil and rock.

The team then collaborated with Jake Keane, a former Portsmouth paleontology student now working in Abu Dhabi (UAE), who processed the CT scans digitally. Within hours, Keane had digitally removed all surrounding rock and performed ""digital dental surgery"" to isolate individual teeth for detailed study.

Using these digital files, Lead Technician John Fearnly at the University's 3D printing lab in the Faculty of Technology created replicas magnified ten times, allowing safe study of the precious fossil without risk of damage.

Introducing Novaculadon mirabilis

The new species has been named Novaculadon mirabilis, with ""novacula"" describing its razor-like back teeth and ""mirabilis"" referring to the miraculous preservation of the specimen.

Portsmouth paleontology student Hamzah Imran created an artistic reconstruction showing the animal as a small, furry creature with speculative spots and stripes.

The fossil evidence suggests Novaculadon mirabilis was omnivorous, likely feeding on small invertebrates such as worms and insects. The sharp-pointed incisors and ridged, blade-like premolars indicate a feeding strategy distinct from modern rodents like squirrels and rats.

Emeritus Professor Martill reflected on the collaborative nature of the research: ""Looking back now that the discovery has been published, I am amazed at how many people it took to describe this little mammal. I especially appreciated that all team members were University staff or present and former students -- a true team effort including academics, technicians, alumni, and students with diverse talents across three departments.""

The research demonstrates how early mammals carved out ecological niches while dinosaurs dominated the landscape. Although multituberculates survived the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs, they eventually became extinct around 33 million years ago during the Oligocene period.

Multituberculata represents the most diverse order of Mesozoic mammals, with over 200 known species ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These mammals occupied various ecological niches over their 130-million-year evolutionary history, from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree climbers.

The discovery adds to Portsmouth's growing reputation in paleontological research and demonstrates the value of undergraduate fieldwork in advancing scientific knowledge.

The University of Portsmouth's BSc (Hons) Palaeontology degree offers a uniquely hands-on learning experience, thanks to its location near the Isle of Wight -- nicknamed ""Dinosaur Island"" for its rich fossil heritage. Students benefit from frequent field trips to world-famous fossil sites like the Isle of Wight and the Jurassic Coast, gaining real-world experience that complements classroom learning.

Accredited by The Geological Society of London, the course combines cutting-edge facilities, expert teaching, and a flexible ""Connected Degree"" structure that allows for paid placements or self-employment years, preparing graduates for careers in science, consultancy, or museum work.

In the northern hemisphere, it's hard not to spend the winter in a state of slumbering sloth, just waiting for sunshine and good times to start again. Conveniently, Prime Day fitness tracker deals (all four days of them) drop right in the middle of summer, which makes this a great time to pick up the smartwatch or smart ring that you just didn't have the cash for at Christmas.

This year, you have four whole days to shop the Amazon deals, but if you don't want to take that much time, I've highlighted the sales on some of our favorite fitness trackers and smart rings. Not a subscriber yet? Perhaps our list of the best Amazon Prime Perks can convince you to sign up. Deal hunters should also check out our Best Amazon Prime Day Deals roundup and Prime Day liveblog.

Updated July 11, 2025: We've added new deals on the Garmin Forerunner 165 and Garmin Fenix 8, pulled dead deals, and checked all prices.

Oura

Amazon

Oura

As you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. This is the first time it's gone on sale, and you should get it.

Fitbit

Amazon

Walmart

Google Store

Target

Fitbit has faced pretty stiff competition over the years (most notably from the Apple Watch), but its flagship Charge line is still the best overall fitness tracker for the money. Even tracking multiple activities a day, the battery lasts over a week. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever.

Apple

Amazon

Walmart

Apple

The Apple Watch Series 10 is the best fitness tracker for iPhone users. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The standout feature is sleep apnea notifications. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models.

Garmin

Amazon

REI

Garmin

Garmin (Music)

If you're not looking to spend big, Garmin's Forerunner 165 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great compromise. It offers all the basics, from an altimeter to track your mileage accurately to a blood oxygen sensor. The battery life is decent, and you'll get extras like Garmin's Morning Report, a wake-up feature that tells you the basics of your sleeping stats, weather, and more. —Ryan Waniata

Withings

Amazon

Best Buy

Withings

Before I even started this job, I had purchased the original Withings Steel HR, which was the first of Withings' gorgeous fitness trackers that don't even look like regular fitness trackers. The Scanwatch 2 follows in that tradition with a comprehensive suite of health features and Withings' new cardiac-focused health features, like Cardio Check-Up, which lets you send your cardiac data instantly to Withings' board of certified cardiologists.

Garmin

REI

Garmin

Garmin's Fenix 8 is loaded with features, not the least of which is its massive and incredibly bright AMOLED screen. WIRED editor and fitness expert Adrienne So called it “the best outdoor sports watch money can buy” thanks to its litany of features that work with both Android and iPhones, from Garmin's proprietary off-grid maps for sports like golfing and skiing, to leakproof buttons for scuba, and even a built-in flashlight. If you want a killer luxury outdoor tracker, this is it. —Ryan Waniata

Fitbit

Amazon

Best Buy

I have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why?), and the $10/month subscription includes data, so you don't need to fuss with adding service to your cell plan. Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features.

Samsung

Amazon

Best Buy

Samsung

The Samsung Galaxy Ring (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is slim and lightweight, with decent sleep tracking, the ability to auto-detect workouts, and accurate cycle and heart rate tracking. You need a Samsung watch or phone to take full advantage, but Samsung's devices are slick when used together.

Garmin

Amazon

Target

Garmin

Garmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. The Forerunner 255 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the older version of the Forerunner 265 that we recommend in our roundup, but Garmins age well, and the older version does have some features to recommend it over the newer one, like better battery life.

Amazfit

Amazon

Amazfit

It may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance.

Apple

Amazon

Walmart

Apple

While it's not the most exciting Apple watch, the SE series is the cheapest way to try out an Apple fitness tracker. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. The SE series doesn't have the latest health features, like the ability to check your skin temperature, and the display is noticeably smaller than Apple's other options, but for the price this is hard to beat, especially on sale.

Samsung

Best Buy

Amazon

Samsung

Samsung's flagship smartwatch is a no-brainer for folks in Samsung's ecosystem. The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts dual-band GPS, excellent health and activity monitoring features, and two-day battery life. It's tough, too, with a titanium case and 10 ATM/IP68 ratings. Samsung announced a newer version of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but it's actually the same watch with 64 GB of storage and a new color, so it's smart to snag this one for half its MSRP.

Ultrahuman

Amazon

Ultrahuman

While the Oura Ring 4 is undoubtedly the champion of smart rings, you'll be paying $8 a month if you want the full experience. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included “lifetime subscription,” meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now.

Fitbit

Amazon

Walmart

Google Store

Best Buy

Here's proof that reliable tracking doesn't have to be expensive. The standout feature of the Fitbit Inspire 3 is its incredibly long battery life. We're talking up to 10 days! The teeny, tiny AMOLED screen is super bright, making it easy to see your stats despite its tiny size.

Garmin

Amazon

Garmin

Walmart

Most Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes—they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. The Lily 2 is the exception. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band. It's one of the smallest Garmins and battery life is on the short side—three to four days. But it has a Pulse Ox sensor, a beautiful Corning Gorilla Glass lens, a metal bezel, and standard Garmin features like Body Battery and fall detection.

Google

Amazon

Best Buy

Google Store

Slick looks, Fitbit integration, and bags of features, the Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Wear OS watch for folks with an Android phone. It's no slouch as a health and fitness tracker, with electrocardiogram readings, sleep tracking, heart rate readings, blood-oxygen measurements, and stress tracking.

Samsung

Amazon

Samsung

Samsung phone owners should consider this wearable as it offers excellent health and fitness tracking and some exclusive features that only work when paired with a Samsung phone, such as FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. It's a great discount but that's partly because the new one has just arrived.



Amazon

Target

It might be a little long in the tooth, but the Fitbit Sense 2 is probably still the best for serious health tracking and the closest to a competitor for the Apple Watch. It has ECG functionality, and can track your stress. There's also built-in GPS, an SpO2 sensor, and a skin temperature sensor, too.

Polar

Amazon

Polar

While fitness trackers generally have built-in heart rate monitors, a separate strap on your bicep or around your chest is far more accurate when things get sweaty and intense during a tough workout. Polar's strap has a comfortable buckle connector and silicone dots to keep it in place.

Withings

Amazon

Withings

Apple

If you still have a humble bathroom scale, it may be time to upgrade to one that has fancy new tricks, like tracking your vascular age and visceral fat. The Withings Body Comp connects directly to the Withings app (so you don't need to have your phone nearby) and shows a staggering amount of data, everything from your weight to muscle mass, heart rate, pulse wave velocity, and weird things like the air quality and your body water percentage.

This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The “one big beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 is set to upend many aspects of American life, including climate policy. The law, which Republicans backed en masse, not only derails the nation's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it could also strike a blow to consumers' pocketbooks.

From a climate perspective, the legislation's most significant rollbacks are aimed at industries such as renewable energy, not individuals. But there will be very real impacts for taxpayers hoping to decarbonize their homes.

The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, provided tax credits for climate-friendly purchases ranging from heat pumps to solar arrays through 2032. That time frame has been cut to as little as a few months.

“This bill is going to take away a lot of assistance from consumers,” said Lowell Ungar, director of federal policy for the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. He noted that 2 million people used the home improvement tax credit in its first year alone.

The good news is that the law does not affect the billions of dollars that the IRA already sent to state efficiency and electrification rebate programs and that much of that money will remain available beyond the federal sunsets. But, Ungar added, the tax credits can still save people thousands of dollars before they vanish.

“If consumers are able to make the investment now,” he said, “it will help them out.”

For those looking to act, here is a roundup of when credits will go away.

New electric vehicles that meet federal domestic manufacturing requirements qualify for a tax credit of up to $7,500. While credits on foreign-made EVs aren't offered directly to consumers, automakers do get them and often pass the savings along through leases. Used EVs under $25,000 that are purchased at a dealer are also eligible for up to a $4,000 credit.

All of this goes away on September 30. There will be no credits after that. Ultimately, this will make new electric vehicles more expensive and put the technology further out of reach for low- to moderate-income Americans.

The income caps on the EV credits still apply, limiting the benefit on new EVs to those households earning less than $300,000 and on used vehicles to those earning less than $150,000. There is an MSRP limit of $80,000 for new cars too.

Strangely, the tax credit for installing an EV charger (up to $1,000) runs through June of next year.

The remarkably vast Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit provides up to $2,000 toward qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves, or biomass boilers. It offers another $1,200 toward efficiency upgrades such as insulation, doors, windows, and even home energy audits.

These are going away on December 31. All items must be “placed in service” by then to qualify, though a reminder: Tax credits lower your tax liability but don't come back as rebates. You must have a tax bill to benefit, which may not be the case for some low-income households.

The most valuable IRA incentive being axed is the Residential Clean Energy Credit. It covers 30 percent of clean energy systems such as solar panels, wind turbines and geothermal heat pumps, and there is no cap. With the average cost of a solar system in the US just north of $28,000, that means a tax credit would be worth around $8,500. That credit vanishes at the end of this year, though the law refers to the “expenditures” being made by then so that could mean paying for—but not necessarily installing—a system by then.

As with other credits, Ungar suggests confirming any changes with a tax professional. He also said that the potential for higher tariffs is another reason to move quickly. But, he said, even after the credits go away, many of these improvements could still make financial sense over the long term.

“With or without the tax credit, these improvements bring energy savings that lower energy bills,” he said. “In some cases, improvements are going to be a no-brainer regardless.”

Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event in Brooklyn earlier this week debuted seven new devices, from the Galaxy Z Fold7 to the Galaxy Watch8 series. But there weren't any surprises at the end, despite rumors that Samsung would unveil a trifold phone. Sensing disappointment, the company later confirmed that the phone is expected to land in 2025.

“I expect we will be able to launch the trifold phone within this year,” TM Roh, head of Samsung's mobile business, told The Korea Times. The trifold phone, rumored to be called the Galaxy G Fold, would have a normal screen on the front and two hinges that let you open it up as a tablet-sized screen.

Huawei first unveiled its trifold, the Mate XT, in China last year, with an eye-watering price of 3,499 euros ($4,090~), and Samsung showed off a concept version at Mobile World Congress 2025. Considering it has upped the price of its Galaxy Z Fold7 flagship to $2,000, expect a high cost. Samsung is also expected to launch its Android XR mixed reality headset in the fall, so the trifold could land alongside it.

AI startup Hugging Face has announced a new coding robot called Reachy Mini, mere months after acquiring Pollen Robotics, the company behind the Reachy 2 humanoid robot. The Reachy Mini is open for preorder for $449 (though there's a Lite version for $299), and it's an open source robot designed around AI experimentation and coding.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Think of it like a STEM toy or a Raspberry Pi (in fact, the Robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 minicomputer)—you have to build it yourself, and there are more than 15 “robot behaviors” so you can learn how to use it out of the box. Reachy Mini can employ the latest AI models, and you can program it to act in certain ways. The head is motorized, and the antennas move around, too. It has a camera, microphone, and speakers for interacting with its surroundings.

Reachy Mini owners will be able to upload and share these robot behaviors with the Hugging Face community, and download other ones too. It'll ship this fall, though the Reachy Mini Lite, which isn't wireless, will arrive first, late summer. We can only hope this cute little robot won't have the same fate as the Jibo.

The public beta for Apple's iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 is expected to launch next week, but some drama has been brewing after the recent developer beta 3 for iOS 26. The company has reduced the transparency of its Liquid Glass design language, making the interface appear more like frosted glass. That's drawn criticism online that Apple has changed it too much, though there was plenty of backlash and readability concerns when Apple debuted the design at WWDC 2025.

In more Apple news, the company is expected to debut a new Apple Vision Pro later this year, powered by the M4 chipset that's in some MacBooks and iPads. The hardware itself won't look any different, though Bloomberg reports there will be a more comfortable strap. The rumored cheaper version of the Vision Pro is still a few years away.

It's a new day for smart home strategy at popular Swedish furniture purveyor Ikea, as the company announced more than 20 new Matter smart lights, sensors, and remotes using the Thread protocol. That means you can snag some of Ikea's affordable wares and use them directly with your Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings setup, without having to purchase an Ikea hub. And Ikea's David Granath told The Verge there are “more new product types and form factors to come.” Folks with Ikea's Dirigera hub will also be pleased to learn that Ikea is activating the built-in Thread radio and adding Matter support. That means it can serve as a Matter Controller and a Thread Border Router, enabling it to hook up and control any Matter devices in your home. Sadly for some, this signals the end for Zigbee support, as Ikea plans to replace its Zigbee gadgets with Matter devices.

Ikea also unveiled two new Bluetooth speakers this week—one that looks like a retro radio and another that doubles as a lamp. Both have a dedicated Spotify Tap button that allows you to jump straight back into whatever you were last listening to on Spotify. It's another nail in the coffin for Ikea's partnership with Sonos, as Ikea strives for simplicity, accessibility, and affordability. —Simon Hill

OnePlus Watch 3 43mm

It was five plus for OnePlus this week, as the company unveiled a slew of new devices. A smaller, 43 mm, version of the Watch 3 that's far more comfortable, but has less stamina than its larger sibling, is now available from OnePlus for $300 (a full $100 less than the 47 mm model). The very affordable wireless Buds 4 are also landing in the US at $130.

The rest of the new lineup is only being released in Europe and India. The headliner is the latest midrange OnePlus Nord 5 phone. It has a 6.83-inch display with a silky 144 Hz refresh rate, is powered by the Snapdragon 8S Gen 3, and offers a 50-megapixel camera front and back. There's also a 5,200 mAh battery and snappy 80-watt charging. You can get the 8 GB RAM, 256 GB storage model for £399 in the UK. Add another £50 to jump to 12 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.

If your budget is more limited, the Nord CE 5 sports a similar look, but has a slightly smaller 6.77-inch display, slower MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Apex processor, and is lower specced across the rest of the board, but starts at £249. Both models will get four years of Android updates.

The last new device is the OnePlus Pad Lite, and it looks to be a bit of a bargain. This 11-inch tablet boasts a 2K display with a 90-Hz refresh rate, a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset backed by 6 GB of RAM, and a chunky 9,340 mAh battery. There are also central 5-megapixel cameras front and back. It starts from £199, but you can jump to 8 GB of RAM and get LTE connectivity for just £30 more. —Simon Hill

It seems like only yesterday we crowned the Honor Magic V3 as the world's thinnest folding phone (it was last September). Now, Honor is back, having skipped the number 4, to reclaim the crown from Oppo's Find N5. The Honor Magic V5 is similar to the V3, but the important measurement is that it's just 8.8 mm thick when folded shut. That's just slimmer than Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold7, by 0.1 mm.

The Honor Magic V5 is some feat of engineering, weighing 217 grams (lighter than Apple's 16 Pro Max, but 2 grams heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold7). It's no slouch inside with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, backed by 16 GB of RAM. There's also a hefty 5,820-mAh battery, wireless charging support, and IP58 and IP59 water-resistance ratings (impressive for a foldable). The screens are LTPO OLED panels with up to a 120-Hz refresh rate. The camera bump on the back, which arguably spoils the svelte form, houses a 50-megapixel main shooter, a 64-MP periscope telephoto lens capable of 3x optical zoom, and a 50-MP ultrawide.

Throw in Honor's generous suite of AI features, and you have a luxurious top-tier device on your hands. The Honor Magic V5 launched in China last week, but unlike the Oppo Find N5, Honor plans to bring the Magic V5 to international markets soon, so folks craving a slim foldable better get saving. —Simon Hill

There are a lot of action cameras on sale right now, but this is the best deal. The Hero 13 Black was a big update for GoPro's flagship cam. It now features an interchangeable lens system, which makes it a much more versatile camera. If the standard lens doesn't fit your use case, there's also an Ultra Wide Lens Mod ($96) with a 177-degree field of view, a Macro Lens Mod ($130) for close-ups, and an Anamorphic Lens Mod ($130) with a 21:9 aspect ratio and those sweet, sweet movie-style lens flares.

The Hero 13 Black also finally got a magnetic mounting system, and a new, larger battery that lasts up to an hour and 45 minutes when shooting 4K (battery life depends a lot on ambient temps; if it's hot, that number will drop). GoPro has also dropped a white version and a forest green version if black is too boring for you.

Just look at that flip-up screen, and imagine your lovely mug reflected at you like the light of a thousand suns. Doesn't your lovely mug deserve a Leica lens and glorious 8K video selfies? Selfie video? Velfies? I don't know what the kids call it, but if you're into it this is a great deal on a serious upgrade from your phone.

Read my full review of the Ace Pro 2 for all the details, but everything you want is here–a large 1/1.3-inch sensor capable of 8K video at 30 fps, great audio, best-in-class low-light video, and good battery life. There's even support for log video and USB mic connections when you hit your auteur stage. This is the lowest price we've ever seen for the Ace Pro 2.

GoPro's Hero 12 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still one of our favorites thanks to features like smart stabilization, wireless mic support, a tripod mount, and solid battery life. There's no GPS, but if that's not a concern, this is a smart buy anywhere south of $300. —Ryan Waniata

The Insta360 X4 is a great deal at this price. Even at full price, it's our favorite budget 360 camera thanks to great 1/2-inch sensors, which can capture up to 8K video. The dynamic range is very good compared to everything but the newer Insta360 X5, which is better. The other major thing you give up compared to the X5 is PureVideo mode, which really helps in low light. The low-light capabilities of the X4 are, frankly, dreadful. Still, you're saving $165 off the price of the X5, in light of that these are not huge sacrifices.

The X4 has good battery life and, like the X5, can be used in single-lens mode, giving you a 4K action camera in addition to your 360 camera.

The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is an action camera with an escape pod. In action camera mode, it looks like the Ace Pro above, complete with flip-up screen, but then you can also pull out the tiny little camera itself and shoot with just that. The case will continue to act as a remote monitor if you want it, but I find I rarely use it this way. The beauty of the little camera pod is the extremely strong magnetic mounting system which will stick to just about anything metal, making the Goo 3 capable of shots from angles that no other action camera can match.

That's part of why I call this the most fun you can have with an action camera. I keep mine in my bag all the time and find myself using it more and more. The only real downside is that there's no SD card in the Go 3S, that's why I suggest grabbing the larger 128-GB model so you have plenty of storage space.

This is a minor deal (5 percent off), but it's the first time we've seen our favorite 360 camera go on sale.

The X5 uses twin 1/1.28"" sensors to capture 8K video of everything around you, intelligently editing out the selfie stick if you're using one. That's the highest resolution footage you can get in a 360-degree camera at the moment. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality, almost-4K clips sharp enough to mix with other video sources. The color science is excellent out of the box, with natural skin tones, making it a great option for point-of-view shots. You can also turn it into a more traditional action camera by switching to single lens mode.

Throw in great battery life and first class editing software and it's hard not to love this deal.

The Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) came out last year, but it remains the perfect antidote to the MacBook Air. Now at $500 off, it matches the RAM and storage at the same price as the MacBook Air, but here, you get a laptop with a larger screen and a faster refresh rate. There's also a more affordable configuration that gets the price down to $900, while still coming with 512 GB of storage. —Luke Larsen

Want a flagship Android tablet? This is a great 40% discount for Samsung's best, which sports an 11-inch AMOLED screen, excellent performance, and includes a stylus that magnetically sticks to the top of the slate. The Tab S9 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the smallest of the lot, but that also makes it the easiest to use. It's no iPad, but it comes very close. —Julian Chokkattu

The top pick in our Best Mesh Routers guide, this two-pack of tri-band Wi-Fi 6 routers comes pre-paired for easy setup. It scored consistently high for speed and stability, and will cover the average home. You get Wi-Fi on both the 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands, with an additional 5-GHz band reserved for wireless backhaul (traffic between the main router and the node). Asus mesh systems are great because they come with free, comprehensive security software and parental controls (no subscription required). —Simon Hill

Ready to upgrade your home network to enjoy the speedy delights of Wi-Fi 7? The Netgear Orbi 770 Series (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is easy to set up and use, delivers stable and speedy performance, and offers expansive coverage. A relatively new mesh that went $15 lower over Prime Day but is still discounted, I think it's the best Wi-Fi 7 mesh for most homes right now. —Simon Hill

It may look like a space shuttle, but this is actually one of the best Wi-Fi routers, and if it lands in your home, you can expect speedy Wi-Fi on three bands (6-GHz, 5-GHz, and 2.4-GHz). It also boasts a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, five gigabit LAN ports, and a USB-C 3.0 port. This Wi-Fi 6E router has been dropping in price since Wi-Fi 7 took off, but we've never seen it 50% off the list price. —Simon Hill

Staying connected to the internet when you travel can be challenging, but a good mobile hotspot will keep you online, and the Netgear Nighthawk M6 Pro is a very good mobile hotspot. With support for 4G and 5G networks, simply slip a SIM card in, and you're good to go. You can connect up to 32 devices, the range is up to 2,000 square feet, and, as a Wi-Fi 6E router, it supports the lightning-fast 6-GHz band. —Simon Hill

A travel router is handy on the road or vacation, and the Asus RT-AX57 Go is our current top pick. This 5-inch, white plastic square is a dual-band Wi-Fi 6 router with gigabit WAN and LAN Ethernet ports. It can connect to public Wi-Fi or your phone via the USB 3.2 port to act as a hotspot.

Topping our best USB flash drives guide, the SanDisk Extreme Pro offers speed and reliability at a great price.

It comes in various sizes and they are all on sale. —Simon Hill

Amazon (8-TB)

Before you get too excited about this deal (it's a good one), know that, to take full advantage of the speed of this drive, you'll need a system that supports the PCIe 4.0 SSD standard. Provided you've got the machine to take advantage of it, in benchmark tests, this drive's results came very close to Western Digital's claimed 7,300 MB/s read speeds. It's worth noting that the 8-TB version is also on sale for $545 ($335 off). —Scott Gilbertson

Lexar

Lexar's Professional 2000x SDXC memory cards have been my choice for eight years now, and the very first one I ever bought is still going strong. The UHS-II (U3) speeds go up to (and sometimes over) Lexar's claimed 300MB/s, and it has no trouble with 6K video. This deal is on the largest (and best if you're shooting video), but the other sizes are also on sale if you don't need the big one. —Scott Gilbertson

The Steelcase Gesture is our upgrade pick in our Best Office Chairs guide. The seat foam is a little more padded than a chair like the Herman Miller Embody, and there's a good amount of upholstery options. It's quite adjustable, so you can tailor it to your body, and there's a 12-year warranty if anything goes wrong. —Julian Chokkattu

I've used this little desk for years with no issues. It's a compact desk on wheels, and because of the way the leg is designed, you can roll it under furniture (like a bed or couch) to bring the desktop closer to you. You can manually adjust the height via a lever. This went $4 lower for Prime Day but is still discounted. —Julian Chokkattu

This fantastic OLED gaming monitor came out late last year, and it's already dropped to an all-time low of $730, which is 40% off. And it's not because it's not a good monitor. Far from it. The LG UltraGear 34GS95QE (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has the exceptional image quality and HDR goodness we expect from modern OLED monitors, combined with an aggressive 800R curve that wraps around your field of view. —Luke Larsen

The prices of OLED gaming monitors keep dropping, but the Samsung Odyssey G6 (8/10, Wired Recommends) will be among the absolute cheapest options you can buy.

It's the OLED monitor most gamers should be buying on Prime Day this year. —Luke Larsen

Not everyone needs a smart monitor, but for the right person or family, it's a lifesaver. This 32-inch, 4K monitor would be perfect for an office that just so happens to double as an entertainment room in the evening. Because it comes with a remote and webOS software, the LG MyView Smart Monitor (7/10, WIRED Recommends) transforms from a work monitor into a fully functioning smart TV when you need it to be—no PC required. —Luke Larsen

Most PC gamers are still using 1080p displays, but if it's finally time for an upgrade, the Dell S2722DGM is an affordable way to jump to higher resolutions and refresh rates. A resolution of 1440p and a refresh rate of 165Hz will offer a much more pleasant gaming experience from basic 1080p, not to mention the subtle 1500R curve, which gently sucks you into the gaming experience. You'll miss out on HDR, of course, and it doesn't have many ports. —Luke Larsen

The Logitech G Pro X TKL tops our list as the best keyboard you can buy, and for good reason. The tactile switches (also known as linear switches) feel luscious, and I find the TKL (lack of number pad) layout to be ideal for gaming, never getting in the way of my mouse hand, but not making non-gaming inconvenient. While it's normally a bit expensive, this sale price makes it an absolute must-buy if you're looking for a gaming keyboard. —Luke Larsen

Low-profile mechanical keyboards are the best of both worlds, offering that tactile typing we all love without the bulk and heaviness that come with standard mechanical keyboards. It has a strikingly thin profile, despite the fact that it has hot-swappable switches and a gasket mount design. It's a gorgeous design, and it's one of the very best mechanical keyboards you can buy. —Luke Larsen

Logitech's premium wireless gaming mouse is one of my very favorites. It's a mainstay in this category thanks to its excellent, reliable sensor and simple design. It's particularly good if fast-paced first-person shooters are your jam, thanks to its speedy polling rate and DPI. I like that the aesthetic isn't overly flashy, maintaining a fairly subtle design that could fit just as well in an office as it could next to a bottle of Mountain Dew. —Luke Larsen

NZXT

Nzxt might not be known for gaming mice, but based on the Lift 2, it should be. It's wired, of course, but that should be a given for the price of $25, which is 50% off. What you get, however, is a super-light design that weighs just 61 grams. It also has high-end specs like an 8K polling rate and a sensor that keeps your games feeling responsive. —Luke Larsen

Most people don't need to spend more than $50 on a gaming mouse. It might not have the extreme sensitivity as more expensive options, but so long as you're not an aspiring esports athlete, I don't think you'll find the speed of this mouse holding you back. Don't spend more when you don't need to—and don't buy any other gaming mouse for this much. —Luke Larsen

The M4 MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best laptop you can buy, and it might be the best laptop ever sold at this price.

I'm partial to Starlight, but the new Sky Blue option is equally classy. —Luke Larsen

I've written at length about why the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy. But what about the larger 15-inch MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends)? It's every bit as fast and thin, and maintains the same pixel density in the display. The larger screen just might be worth the extra $150, especially if you don't use an external monitor at home. It has a killer set of speakers too. —Luke Larsen

While I recommend that people consider the MacBook Air first, there's no doubt that the Pro model has its allure. While it uses the same M4 chip, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (9/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a brighter and better Mini-LED display, along with awesome speakers and more ports. You'll have to opt for the M4 Pro or Max if you need more speed, but if you aren't a creative professional, the M4 should be more than enough. —Luke Larsen

I have a weird prejudice against the AirPods Max. They're overpriced, and everyone knows exactly how much they are. (And the case looks like you're carrying around a bra.) Still, they're beautiful, and WIRED reviewer Parker Hall says they're one of the best headphones he's ever heard. At this very significant discount, that makes them almost a reasonable buy. They went $20 lower for Prime Day but are still $100 off. —Adrienne So

There are better MacBooks higher up on this list. Faster ones with better displays and more ports. Most people should buy one of those. But the M1 MacBook Air is a stalwart computer that's continued to be sold, exclusively at Walmart, despite being almost five years old. For Prime Day, the price has been dropped to $600, which isn't the lowest it's been, but is still a good price. Of course, you can also pick up one of the refurbished models for even less, but when it comes to new laptops, you can't find a better $600 laptop on the market right now.

If you don't need many bells and whistles but just want a good, well-rounded smartphone, you can't go wrong with the Galaxy S25 or Galaxy S25+, which are identical in many ways. They're different in size, with the S25+ sporting a larger 6.7-inch screen, which brings better battery life, too.

Google's next folding phone isn't far off, so it's a good time to grab the 2024 model at one of its lowest prices. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold slimmed down the original and made it taller, making it feel remarkably like a normal Pixel when closed. But you can open it up to experience a large 8-inch screen.

The Pixel 10 series rumors are heating up as Google's next phones are expected to arrive in August, but the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are still great phones to buy, especially on sale. The hardware feels excellent, and they have vapor chamber cooling systems for better thermals, allowing you to game for longer periods. The cameras are some of the best on a smartphone, and the nice thing is they're identical in specs. You're largely choosing what size phone you want, though that does mean the XL has slightly better battery life. —Julian Chokkattu

The Razr+ didn't get much of an upgrade over the 2024 model. Motorola improved the hinge mechanism, so it's a little more durable, but it otherwise shares many of the same specs.

It may not have an ultrawide camera (it has a 2x telephoto), but you'll still have fun with this flip phone, especially if you snag it in hot pink. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more.

This QLED TV offers fabulous picture processing for excellent clarity, accurate yet intense colors, and knockout brightness to bust through even your sunniest viewing parties. Its off-axis viewing is just OK, but its mini LED backlight does a good job of creating crisp images and deep blacks. —Ryan Waniata

Like its Samsung rival, the S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends), LG's lovely C4 OLED (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorite TVs, now at around half its launch price. That means if you've been holding out for its fabulous contrast and black levels, punchy brightness, natural and expansive colors, and excellent gaming chops (including four full-bandwidth HDMI ports), now is your moment. This TV is just way too good to be this cheap. —Ryan Waniata

The price of Samsung's luscious S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has been fluctuating for months, but at around half its debut cost, you can't lose. This TV's only real flaw is a lack of Dolby Vision HDR support. It serves up OLED's infinite contrast in style with deep black levels, excellent clarity and upscaling, and bright, vibrant colors that bring everything to life. It adds four full-bandwidth HDMI ports for sweet gaming spoils. —Ryan Waniata

Samsung's flagship S95D OLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) carves out its niche with a unique matte-like display. While this can slightly soften black levels in certain lighting, it's a game-changer for bright rooms, effectively neutralizing glare even from direct reflections. Beyond its anti-glare prowess, the TV dazzles with eye-searing brightness, rich and vibrant colors, superb image processing, and a wealth of features, including a built-in cloud gaming hub. —Ryan Waniata

TCL

Amazon

Walmart

TCL's QM7K had some odd quirks when I first evaluated it, including off colors that tended to turn black images into green (who knew there were so many green leather jackets?). The issue was fixed with a firmware update, which makes this a pretty tempting buy, especially at this price. Using TCL's new Precise Dimming tech, the TV provides almost OLED-level shades of black and blooming reduction, while still getting fiery bright. It's also got plenty of great features, including a 144-Hz refresh rate for gaming, making it worth real consideration on super sale.

The Roku 4K streaming stick is the highest-end Roku stick, which means you get all the same great apps but also a voice remote and support for Dolby Vision HDR. That makes this the best way to watch the latest shows and movies on your TV. I like that Roku has some of the best app support around, meaning you'll never struggle to stream as long as you have good Wi-Fi. —Parker Hall

If all you need is a cheap-and-stable streamer, one that shows you TV and movies on Amazon Prime you never knew existed, this is a nice buy. It's a great option for dumber 4K TVs or even an HD TV that may need replacing down the line. We still prefer the 4K TV Max for serious streaming after testing both, but you can't do much better for a budget stick with voice search at this price, especially if you're into Alexa as your copilot. —Ryan Waniata

JBL's Endurance Peak 3 workout buds go all the way with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating that means they're essentially swim-ready. Take them in the shower, the hot tub, and certainly a sweaty run in the rain, and they'll keep on ticking.

Sony's value-packed 720N provide good features and satisfying performance in a refreshingly affordable package. You'll get solid noise canceling thanks to Sony's V1 processor, full and punchy sound, and a comfy fit, though they don't fold down for travel. You're still better off with one of Sony's more premium pairs like the XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), but if your budget is $100 or less, these are among the best noise cancelers around. —Ryan Waniata

Sony's hallowed WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) headphones have been bouncing up and down in price since the XM5 was released. Now there's an even better, noise-eviscerating version in the WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Here's the thing, though: these are still incredible headphones with great noise canceling, comfort, features, and sound.

The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are good headphones at full price, and great ones on a big sale. The build quality feels a step below their $300 launch price, and they miss a few extras, like auto-pause sensors.

Sony's WH-1000XM6 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) took on the uncompromising Bose QuietComfort Ultra (9/10, WIRED Recommends) head-to-head for the title of the best noise-canceling headphones and won.

Sony's WF-1000XM5 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are some of the best noise-canceling earbuds around, including impressive sound quality and plenty of features.

Vizio's latest Elevate SE soundbar (7/10, WIRED Recommends) cuts back on features like Wi-Fi streaming and even a remote, but it keeps the coolest trick: rolling speakers that spin upward for Dolby Atmos effects and back down again for stereo and surround tracks.

Vizio's mini 2.1 soundbar provides solid sound quality from the main bar and some nice punch from its compact subwoofer.

We rank the Italian-made Linea Classic from De'Longhi as our favorite $200 espresso maker, a price point where it's tough to find a reliable machine. This is true especially among machines with a pressure gauge and a fast-heating thermopump. Welp, now it's not $200. It's $150. The trade-offs are that the steam wand is a little foamy, and the portafilter is lightweight. —Matthew Korfhage

The Oxo Brew is the best grinder I know at this price range, which is 30% lower than normal right now. It might not be your pick for espresso: the 15-grind setting doesn't offer fine enough distinctions. For that, get the Baratza ESP. But for Aeropress, drip, or French Press?

This semiautomatic De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) comes with a built-in burr grinder and frother and makes great espresso right out of the box. At this steep discount price, it has two perks over the Barista Express, also on sale for Prime Day. One is a cold brew function best used with milk, and the other is an extra-slim profile less than a food wide. That said, the portafilter needs a plastic adapter and the espresso cup needs a stand. —Matthew Korfhage

The Instant Pot Pro Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends), is a thoughtfully designed and capable multi-cooker, still our favorite multicooker WIRED has tested.

Food processors don't have to be big or complicated or even powerful to be useful. Most of the dumb little cutting I do is of the half-onion or “too many little pieces of carrot” variety. This low-cost Hamilton Beach veggie chopper, on sale for double-cheap during Prime Day, is an old favorite of multiple WIRED staffers because it is tiny and it solves tiny but persistent problems. Which is to say, it dices an onion. —Matthew Korfhage

The Typhur Dome 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is such a terrific air fryer—significantly faster and crisper than all I've tried, with tight temp control and useful self-cleaning—that it caused a fight in the WIRED Reviews team about whether the Typhur's $400 price tag could even be called expensive. Well, you don't have to find out. It's on sale for way less than that for Prime Day. —Matthew Korfhage

Dreo

I didn't used to be the guy who makes steaks in an air fryer. But the Dreo Chefmaker Combi Fryer is the best air fryer for roasts, steaks, and chops precisely because it's no ordinary air fryer.

Aqara's Smart Lock U50 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great-looking lock that's affordable, high quality, and works well. Even when my hub disconnected, the U50 never faltered with remembering codes or auto-locking. I only gave it a 7 originally due to the expensive hub. —Nena Farrell

It's no secret I love Petlibro's products; its automatic feeders and fountains are consistently my top picks. The RFID automatic feeder is a game-changer for pets in a multi-pet home.

Usually around $170, this is probably the lowest the price will drop until Black Friday. —Molly Higgins

This automatic cat fountain is what I recommend for most people. Although it's not completely stainless steel, it does have a stainless steel top, smart water detection, and an app that records when your cat drank from it, how much they drank, and for how long.

At about $20 less than it's usually priced, now's a great time to invest in your cats' health (for less). —Molly Higgins

This fountain has a stainless steel top, has a wireless pump, isn't connected to an app, and it's cordless—so you can conveniently move it around in your house. The bottom of the dock lights up to indicate when charging, when the battery's low, or when water levels are low. —Molly Higgins

AquaSonic

Amazon

If you want a decent electric toothbrush without spending Sonicare money, the Aquasonic Black Series is worth a look. It comes with eight brush heads, which is plenty to last over a year, and it does a solid job of cleaning. It's not my favorite—the brush feels a little small and the body vibrates almost as much as the head—but at this price, it scores bonus points. —Boutayna Chokrane

Vital Proteins

Amazon

I've been on a Vital Proteins kick lately, and it's an easy upgrade to your wellness routine. Vital Proteins is an unflavored collagen powder blends into coffee, smoothies, even oatmeal—hot or cold. You get 20 grams of collagen per scoop, derived from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine. If you're trying to sneak in some joint or skin support without thinking too much about it, this is the one. —Boutayna Chokrane

Orgain

Amazon

Orgain is our favorite vegan protein powder, and this iced coffee flavor adds a nice kick. You get 21 grams of plant-based protein (from pea, brown rice, chia, and mung bean) and 60 milligrams of caffeine per serving, which is a sprinkle less than an espresso. Ideal for an energy boost after a workout or a mid-morning pick-me-up. —Boutayna Chokrane

Isopure

Amazon

Isopure

Isopure's zero-carb protein powder is smooth, subtly sweet, and versatile; it blends into smoothies, oatmeals, and no-bake cheesecakes. WIRED reviewer Nena Farrell stirs it into her post-workout treats, and Scott Gilbertson loves incorporating it into his baked goods. There are 25 grams of protein per serving, and the flavors go beyond the standard vanilla and chocolate (think banana cream, toasted coconut, and cookies and cream). —Boutayna Chokrane

Mando

Amazon

Walmart

This isn't just any deodorant. It's a man's deodorant—a previous mainstay on our guide to the manliest men gifts that ever manned. It comes in aromas like bourbon leather, a scent that attracts drunken cowboys the way vanilla attracts sentient cupcakes. Anyway, it's 20 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage

Oura

Oura

People ask me what fitness tracker to get all the time. Given their requirements, I have told people more often than not to just get the new Oura Ring 4. I wear mine almost every day; it's the tracker I use to check other fitness trackers. The battery life is longer than a wrist wearable, and Oura frequently issues meaningful, interesting software updates. This is the first time it's gone on sale. —Adrienne So

Ultrahuman

Amazon

Ultrahuman

The Ultrahuman Ring Air is the primary contender to beat the Oura Ring 4's dominance, mainly because you don't need to have a subscription. It's also light, comfortable, has great battery life and is great at sleep tracking. The company has also started introducing dubious features like Blood Vision, which requires you to take a blood test from a third-party tester. I'm going to test this once I get over my fear of needles, but we'll overlook it for now.—Adrienne So

Even as many lookalike fitness trackers flood the market, we continue to rank the Fitbit Charge 6 very highly for its accuracy, affordability, and high-end features. You can use it with Android or iOS and integrates with Google Maps and YouTube Music. It checks your skin temperature and takes ECGs in the newly Google-fied app. Most happily of all, it frequently goes on sale. —Adrienne So

I personally persuaded many parents to buy the Fitbit Ace for their kids. The watch incentivizes kids to charge and wear their smartwatch with a gaming platform called Fitbit Arcade, and includes data in the very reasonable $10/month subscription plan. You can check your kids' location and you can send each other texts (or in my son's case, just a bunch of poop emojis).—Adrienne So

It's been a few years since the Sense 2 came out; nevertheless, it's still the Fitbit that's best for serious health tracking and the one that was probably meant as a competitor to the Apple Watch. Like the Apple Watch, it has an ECG; it also has a sensor that monitors your stress to remind you to calm down on the spot. —Adrienne So

The Lily 2 is Garmin's lovely little lady watch. The display is integrated into the watch face so that when you're not actively tracking an activity, it disappears and looks just like a regular analog watch.

The Inspire 3 is Fitbit's cheapest tracker, but it's proof that you don't have to spend a ton of money to get reliable tracking.

This is the older version of the Forerunner 265 that we currently recommend in our roundup of the Best Garmin Watches.

But Garmin watches age very well and the older version has better battery life.—Adrienne So

The Instinct is one of Garmin's most popular lines because it offers full backcountry functionality for a cheaper price than the high-end Fenix line, with better battery life and a fun, chunky, retro aesthetic.

The Pixel Watch 3 is my favorite Android smartwatch right now, though a successor will likely arrive in a few months. It's gorgeous and will work with any Android phone. There are two sizes to choose from, and the 45-mm variant is worth your time largely because it delivers better battery life. You can eke out a little more than a day with it, all while meticulously tracking your health, even a loss of pulse event, which is something no other smartwatch can do. —Julian Chokkattu

LifeStraw

Amazon

Camping water, and outdoor water, is often gross water—sitting too long in the cooler with pine needles for some reason, running free in the outdoors but maybe unsafe, or pulled from spigots of unknown plumbing. This Lifestraw is a WIRED favorite. It makes water safer, and makes it taste better—and will purify up to a thousand gallons. It's half off. Buy two. —Matthew Korfhage

Sawyer

Garage Grown Gear

The Sawyer Squeeze is our top water filter for ultralight hikers and backpackers. It'll filter down to 0.1 microns (which gets rid of E. coli, salmonella, Giardia, cryptosporidium, and other common problems) and weighs just 3 ounces. It will connect to any 28-mm diameter bottle (your basic 20-ounce Coke bottle, for example), and it can be used as a drip filter as well. —Scott Gilbertson

Coleman

Amazon

As grills go, this portable Coleman looks a lot like an ironing board: with wheels on one side, and a stand that folds down for easy collapsibility. WIRED has recommended the Coleman as the budget option among rolling portable grills. At the moment, even as prices on grills and griddles skyrocket, our budget option is even easier on the wallet for Prime Day. —Matthew Korfhage

Shark Ninja

Amazon

Sometimes a Shark or Ninja product is so clever it's almost irritating. In one incarnation, this is a tall, pivoting indoor fan. Lock in the water tank, and it's a backyard swamp cooler. But pull the top section off, and the shaft spiders out to become a table fan, too. Crazy. The Flexbreeze is a heck of a summer all-in-one, available at a respectable discount for Prime Day. —Matthew Korfhage

My top pick on our guide to the best flashlights, the Arkfield Pro has plenty of power (a claimed 1300 lumens) in its compact square body form. However, what I love about it are the three light sources (standard, UV, and a green laser beam for spotting), the intuitive controls that have never gotten triggered in my pocket, and the magnetic charging system. —Martin Cizmar

Chirp

Chirp

The Chirp RPM Mini is a handheld massager that combines rolling and percussive therapy. It's like an electric rolling pin for your entire body, featuring three speed settings and a multi-grip handle. This cordless device has six free-spinning massage heads, 24 massage nodes, and nonabrasive rollers that won't pinch your skin. It's gentler on my smaller muscle groups compared to percussive guns. The battery life is impressive, lasting up to four hours on a single charge. It's TSA-approved for carry-on and comes with a portable case. —Boutayna Chokrane

Need a way to get around town quickly? The E2 Pro is a nice entry-level scooter that cruises at 15 miles per hour, and its 41-pound weight is manageable. Don't expect a ton of range.

The Apollo Go (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great scooter for experienced pros and for newcomers. It has a top speed of 28 mph, but I rode it 15 or 20 mph (follow local speed laws!), and I was able to get roughly 15 miles out of it. You can probably go further (I'm 6'4”, and weight plays a big part in a scooter's range. It has turn signals and a dot display that's readable even in broad daylight. —Julian Chokkattu

Segway

Amazon

I recently dropped this scooter lower on my list after testing the newer Max G3, but that's only because the Max G3 outpaces it in a few ways and costs nearly the same. But at this discounted price, the ZT3 Pro is a great buy. I got 16 miles of range, and you'll probably get much more than that if you're shorter than 6'4”. —Julian Chokkattu

Comfort Colors

When I click on this link, Amazon informs me that I bought variations of this Comfort Colors shirt several times. I buy this shirt in batches for my husband. The cotton fabric is a hefty 6.1-ounce weight, with triple-stitched shoulders and double-stitched hemlines and sleeves. They're overbuilt, and they age beautifully; the pigment-dying process gives them a faded, vintage look right out of the packaging. —Adrienne So

In Azul, you must make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to get the maximum possible score. Azul is easy to grasp but supports many different tactical approaches and has surprising depth, making it one of the best family board games. The tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will want to play again. —Simon Hill

A fantastic gift for kids of all ages, this clever construction kit made our best STEM toys guide. Clixo's colorful, versatile, magnetic pieces snap together, so you can build three-dimensional shapes, from crowns to cats.

If you're a murder mystery fan in any capacity, you'll probably love Chronicles of Crime. It's delightfully fun to figure out, using your phone to scan cards, interview suspects, and even spot clues. It's a miracle it works as well as it does, given just how dead-simple it plays. I wouldn't recommend it for more than two, but it makes for the perfect solo or couples activity on a night in. —Luke Larsen

There's no board game quite like Root. It's the kind of game that instantly grabs you, even if it takes a few games to truly grasp its depth. Root takes that concept of player asymmetry to another level, letting each player fight for dominion of the woodland wilderness with completely different actions and mechanisms. Maybe it's the cutesy artwork and playful components, but Root is one of the games that's somehow as accessible as it is complex. —Luke Larsen

Carcassonne is a classic, tile-laying game with dead-simple rules. Just pick a tile and place it somewhere, building out the landscape right in front of the players.

We start searching for the best Prime Day deals weeks before the event. The WIRED Reviews team receives embargoed lists of expected sales a few weeks before Prime Day, which we supplement by directly contacting our sources at brands we like to get details on their planned sales. These deals lists are usually about 70% accurate and we strive to make our posts completely accurate. We then use proprietary software to cross-reference the list of products that are on sale with the products we have positively reviewed. We only consider deals on products we have tested and like.

During events like Prime Day and Black Friday, WIRED will only recommend deals on products that someone on our team—there are 15 of us spread across the country and one person in the UK—has personally tested and vouched for. You will not find us adding random products with all-caps names that may be cheap but also junky. We also rigorously cross-check everything we're planning to cover with price history databases to make sure it's actually a deal at the Prime Day price, and not just a regular-priced item dressed up as a deal.

We have a lot, which is why we have standalone posts dedicated to shopping like a Pro during Prime Day, avoiding scams and shoddy wares on Amazon, and advice on how to get the most out of your Prime membership perks. Above all, we recommend that you check in with trusted sources before making any big purchases and stick to your budget.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Friday the company is delaying the release of its open model, which was already pushed back a month earlier in this summer. OpenAI had planned to release the model next week, however Altman said the company is pushing it back indefinitely for further safety testing.

“We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us,” said Altman in a post on X. “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can't be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.”

OpenAI's open model release is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of the summer, alongside the ChatGPT maker's expected release of GPT-5. Unlike GPT-5, OpenAI's open model will be available for developers to freely download and run locally. Through both of these launches, OpenAI will attempt to demonstrate that it is still Silicon Valley's leading AI lab — an increasingly difficult task as xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic invest billions of dollars in their own efforts.

The delay means developers will have to wait a little longer to try the first open model OpenAI has released in years. TechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI's open model is expected to have similar reasoning capabilities to the company's o-series of models, and that OpenAI planned for it to be best-in-class compared to other open models. 

The ecosystem of open AI models became a little more competitive this week. Earlier on Friday, Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2, a one-trillion-parameter open AI model that outperforms OpenAI's GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks.

In June, when Altman announced the initial delays around OpenAI's open model, he noted that the company had achieved something “unexpected and quite amazing,” but didn't elaborate on what that was. 

“Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we're releasing a model we're proud of along every axis,” said Aidan Clark, OpenAI's VP of research who is leading the open model team, in a post on X Friday.

TechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI leaders have discussed enabling the open AI model to connect to the company's cloud-hosted AI models for complex queries. However, it's unclear if these features will make it into the final open model.

There is a time-honored crisis management strategy, wherein one says nothing and waits for the outrage to pass. For Sequoia Capital, the strategy worked pretty well this week. While partner Shaun Maguire initially weathered criticism over an inflammatory social media post, that initial indignation cooled quickly. Now, some seem to think that Maguire's defiant stance may even be strengthening his position. Business Insider actually called it “good for deal flow” — controversy as competitive advantage.

Sequoia's calculated gamble carries real risk, though. Another provocative post from Maguire that hits the wrong nerve, a shift in political winds, or escalating consequences could quickly transform their unflappable partner from an asset into a liability the firm can no longer afford to ignore. 

A crisis communications professional who has managed reputation disasters for dozens of major brands tells this editor, “Firms like Sequoia are bulletproof until they aren't.”

What happened

Sequoia's hands-off approach was put to the test earlier this week when the storied venture firm found itself in the eye of a storm over Maguire's comments about New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Maguire called him an “Islamist” who “comes from a culture that lies about everything” in a July 4th tweet on X that has since been viewed more than five million times. More than one thousand signatures have poured in regarding a petition demanding that Sequoia condemn the remarks, investigate Maguire's conduct, and apologize.

There's been a lot of talk about why Sequoia hasn't done this, with many outlets noting that Maguire isn't just any partner. This status owes partly to his friendship with Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison. According to reports, at a 2015 Founders Fund event, Maguire — then a Founders Fund-backed entrepreneur — defended Collison during an argument with Anduril's Palmer Luckey about quantum computing, earning Collison's friendship. The connection proved valuable when Maguire joined Google Ventures in 2016; he helped secure a $20 million Stripe investment during his first week. When Maguire left Google Ventures in 2019, Collison personally recommended him to Sequoia's partners. (Stripe has been in Sequoia's portfolio since 2010, with the firm investing more than $500 million over 15 years.)

Maguire also led Sequoia's investment in Bridge, a stablecoin platform that Stripe acquired for $1.1 billion, and is reportedly Sequoia's link to Elon Musk, though he's hardly its only link. Musk and Sequoia's global leader, Roelof Botha, are both native South Africans and have known each other for more than 25 years, dating back to their time together at the then-nascent PayPal, where Botha was recruited personally by Musk.

Despite that long relationship, the two haven't always seen eye to eye. Botha was highly critical of Musk's management style when Musk was CEO of the merged X.com/PayPal company, where Botha was CFO. Botha once told veteran journalist Ebbe Dommisse, “I think it would have killed the company if Elon had stayed on as CEO for six more months. The mistakes Elon was making at the time were amplifying the risk of the business.” But Musk was at odds with pretty much that entire crew at the time, and those tensions have long since been resolved.

The bigger point here: when you're managing tens of billions of dollars in assets and your firm's reputation rests on backing winners like Google, Stripe, and Nvidia, you don't easily cast aside a rainmaker.

Meanwhile, Maguire's behavior suggests he's not backing down. After issuing a 30-minute video on X last weekend in which he apologized for offending so many — saying he was making a point about a political ideology and not one about a religion — he has doubled down with increasingly aggressive posts this week. He claimed he has “reverse engineered” his critics' “command structure” and threatened to “embarrass” anyone who escalates against him. He added that this is him at “1% throttle” and warned people not to “fuck w children of the internet.”

The silent treatment

Sequoia has precedent for its approach to this situation. The firm has historically given its partners space to express themselves publicly, with figures like Doug Leone and Michael Moritz (who left the firm in 2023) representing different political perspectives. 

But there's a crucial difference between political diversity and incendiary rhetoric and clearly to some, Maguire's comments extend beyond partisan politics into territory that alienates both political opponents and potential business partners.

It's also worth remembering that even for Sequoia, there is a bright line. Michael Goguen, another, earlier rainmaker with the firm, was promptly shown the door when Sequoia learned of a sexual abuse lawsuit filed against him. The situations aren't exactly comparable; Goguen's issues were legal and personal, not ideological. At the same time, Sequoia has shown it isn't willing to circle the wagons at any cost, not if its reputation is at stake.

Presumably, several factors inform Sequoia's do-nothing PR strategy, including how quickly people, faced with a constant flurry of news, move on from a scandal. The firm is also operating in a different political landscape right now in the U.S. Along with Donald Trump's victory and the rollback of DEI initiatives has come new tolerance for controversial speech. What might have been career-ending at an earlier point in time is now weathered more easily.

Beyond the shifting political winds, the firm is likely banking on the fact that while founders want partners who fit the traditional, more genteel VC mold, they want successful ones even more. Startups being courted by multiple top-tier firms might not like or agree with Maguire, but when Sequoia comes calling with its track record and almost bottomless pockets, most founders are going to welcome the firm with open arms.

Of course, there's the very real possibility, too, that Sequoia is working on a contingency plan. (Sequoia declined to comment on Maguire's posts when reached by TechCrunch earlier this week.)

Still, Sequoia's silence carries risks. Not all the signers have been confirmed, but the petition against Maguire includes the names of some prominent Middle Eastern executives and founders who have attested to signing it, and they represent the kind of diverse, global talent pool on which Sequoia's future depends. By not addressing the controversy, Sequoia risks being seen as tacitly endorsing Maguire's views.

Put another way, though the venture capital world has historically been remarkably forgiving of controversial figures with exceptional deal flow, the firm is gambling with its reputation in an increasingly connected global market where alienating entire regions and communities carries real business consequences.

Whether that bet pays off will depend on how long the controversy lingers, how much business it actually costs Sequoia, and whether Maguire can resist the urge to push things past Sequoia's own tolerance threshold. (He has said he doesn't post anything that hasn't been “excrutiatingly thought out.”)

History suggests that established financial firms with strong track records tend to outlive their scandals, even serious ones. When Apollo Global Management's Leon Black resigned in 2021 over his $158 million payments to Jeffrey Epstein, the firm's stock barely moved and shareholders seemed largely unfazed. Apollo just continued its aggressive deal-making under new leadership.

Similarly, Kleiner Perkins survived Ellen Pao's high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit in 2015. But it took years and essentially an entirely new team for the venture firm to regain its footing in Silicon Valley's hierarchy. The lesson here may be that while controversial partners can be endured, the recovery timelines can vary significantly depending on how firms handle the crisis.

For now, the crisis communications professional, who asked not to be named, has some advice for Maguire and, by extension, Sequoia. Regarding the video Maguire published in the aftermath of his initial comments, the expert said, “I did think that apology addressed the ambiguities in [Maguire's] post. But it's a 30-minute video — you have to be really interested to watch this.”

If there's a next time, the professional said, Maguire should “do two videos — one for three minutes” and another, longer video, for anyone who wants to keep watching.  

Sometimes, the expert added, “less is more.”

Speedballing—the practice of combining a stimulant like cocaine or methamphetamine with an opioid such as heroin or fentanyl—has evolved from a niche subculture to a widespread public health crisis. The practice stems from the early 1900s, when World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine.

Once associated with high-profile figures like John Belushi, River Phoenix and Chris Farley, this dangerous polysubstance use has become a leading cause of overdose deaths across the United States since the early- to mid-2010s.

I am an assistant professor of public health who has written extensively on methamphetamine and opioid use and the dangerous combination of the two in the United States. As these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment.

Dating back to the 1970s, the term speedballing originally referred to the combination of heroin and cocaine. Combining stimulants and opioids—the former's “rush” with the latter's calming effect—creates a dangerous physiological conflict.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately 70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022 also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality.

Users sought to experience the euphoric “rush” from the stimulant and the calming effects of the opioid. However, with the proliferation of fentanyl—which is far more potent than heroin—this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl is often mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine, sometimes without the user's knowledge, leading to unintentional overdoses.

The rise in speedballing is part of a broader trend of polysubstance use in the U.S. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased 50-fold, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually.

This has been called the fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. The toxic and contaminated drug supply has exacerbated this crisis.

Stimulants like cocaine increase heart rate and blood pressure, while opioids suppress respiratory function. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. People who use both substances are more than twice as likely to experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone.

The conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. Users may experience heightened anxiety, depression, and paranoia. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making.

Speedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, including hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. The strain on the heart and blood vessels from the stimulant, combined with the depressant effects of the opioid, increases the risk of these life-threatening conditions.

Increasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. I believe that educational campaigns can inform the public about the risks of combining stimulants and opioids and the potential for unintentional fentanyl exposure.

There is a great need for better access to treatment for people with stimulant use ddisorder—a condition defined as the continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this and other substance use disorders are underfunded and less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing.

Implementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations, and health care providers, such as providing fentanyl test strips and naloxone—a medication that reverses opioid overdoses—can save lives.

These measures allow individuals to test their drugs for the presence of fentanyl and have immediate access to overdose-reversing medication. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.

In contrast to other technological advances, the objective for next-generation nuclear reactors seems to be to scale down, not up—an initiative backed by the Department of Energy (DOE).

Earlier this month, the DOE announced a conditional agreement made with private firms Westinghouse and Radiant to conduct the first reactor tests at its Demonstration on Microreactor Experiment (DOME) facility, located at Idaho National Laboratory.

These experiments, featuring two trailer-sized microreactors, will be “the first of their kind in the world” and will assist in meeting “the nation's demand for more abundant, affordable, and reliable power,” the DOE stated in a press release. 

The microreactors eVinci (Westinghouse) and Kaleidos (Radiant) each produce only 5 megawatts and 1.2 megawatts of power. The DOE defines microreactors as small reactors that generate between 1 and 50 megawatts of power. That's tiny compared to traditional reactors, which are capable of generating around 833 times the power of Kaleidos. 

That being said, these microreactors aren't meant to power crowded cities. Rather, the compact efficiency of microreactors could greatly benefit small, remote sites that run on less efficient sources. The average U.S. household consumes about 30 kilowatt-hours, or 0.03 megawatts worth of electricity daily—meaning, in theory, Kaleidos on its own could supply many homes in a distant rural area. 

Not only that, these microreactors are relatively easy to assemble and transportable by train, truck, or plane. That makes them potentially useful in unexpected situations such as blackouts caused by natural disasters or cyberattacks. For eVinci and Kaleidos in particular, the DOE's intention is to employ the microreactors as a possible power source for remote data centers and an alternative to diesel generators, respectively.

“Microreactors will play a big role in expanding the use of nuclear power in the United States,” added Mike Goff, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, in the same release. “These DOME experiments will test new reactor designs that will be counted on in the future to reliably power our homes, military bases, and mission-critical infrastructure.”

The first fueled experiments at DOME are slated to begin as early as spring 2026, operating for up to six months to test technological ability and efficiency.

The release of Superman this weekend has naturally led to a culture war it's largely managed to avoid before now. But come it has, and the occurrence speaks to how much grifters refuse to engage with art on its actual terms, instead trying to twist it to their own ends.

After Fox News and other prominent alt-right figures tried pretending the DC hero wasn't an immigrant earlier this week, the White House's Twittter posted a photoshopped poster of the film with President Donald Trump flying in the air, and the poster's text was tweaked in support of him. “A Trump presidency: Truth, Justice, and the American Way,” it reads.

THE SYMBOL OF HOPE.

TRUTH. JUSTICE. THE AMERICAN WAY.

SUPERMAN TRUMP. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/fwFWeYonAq

— The White House (@WhiteHouse) July 11, 2025



That the White House is trying to embrace Superman isn't particularly surprising; it's the film's opening weekend, Superman is the mightiest hero in all of DC, and part of Trump's perceived appeal is how he speaks to the fantasy of a powerful, masculine man the right wing (and America at large) are constantly in search of.

It's also not the first time this particular sect has tried to co-opt a specific fictional character or person, either for real or just a quick hit of virality. During the 2018 midterms, the first Trump administration used Game of Thrones memes to sway voters. Before the 2024 election, many musicians asked Trump to stop using their songs for his campaign and eventual win, even going so far as to take matters to court. And whether intended or not, it could be easy to read this as a direct, petty swipe at writer/director James Gunn, who's had no issue making his feelings on this particular president and white supremacy known through his works.

And yet, this instance carries more significance due to factors such as parallels audiences have made between the film and the continued real-world attacks on Gaza—something Gunn recently claimed was an unintentional move—and coming straight from the White House's mouth. For as much as this administration and its defenders have complained about the “woke” media plaguing the country, they can't find it in themselves to not be drawn to the very things that fall under that purview. To them, Superman is a godlike being who cuts a figure in the clouds with menacing laser eyes, the type of figure feared by his enemies and otherwise populated by acolytes.

But DC fans have spent the past decade soured on portrayals like Man of Steel and the one-two video game punch of Injustice and Suicide Squad. Now, they want a version of the hero that radiates hope and optimism, which has since been gradually brought back to the character via Gunn's movie and Adult Swim's My Adventures with Superman. From those who've come out of the film and liked it, their big takeaway is how Gunn and Warner Bros. finally got him right again and charted a brighter path forward for the burgeoning DC movie universe. That momentum looks like it'll keep the film in discussion in the weeks and months ahead while likely leaving the White House's attempt to ride the current wave far behind in the dust.

When it comes to gadget specs, it's best to be precise. For example, if you were buying a TV, you may want to know the resolution, and if you showed up to Best Buy and the tag on your brand-spanking-new Sony said “kind of, sort of, 4K,” you'd probably have some questions. Same goes for AR glasses, in my opinion, but that didn't stop Viture from slapping “4K-like” branding on all of its new frames. It also doesn't stop me from wanting them all the same.

Viture announced a few pairs of upcoming AR glasses this week, but the most exciting one is “Beast.” Yes, that's really the name. Beast is aptly named for being the most spec'd-out glasses of Viture's current generation and comes with an impressive 58-degree field of view and Sony's micro-OLED panel, which offers—and here's the kicker—a “4K-like” resolution, according to Viture. What is “4K-like,” you ask? Well, it's actually 1080p. But this 1080p is sharper, according to Viture, (50 percent sharper than the Viture Pro) and makes its AR glasses the “sharpest on the market.” I haven't had a chance to use Viture's Beast myself because they don't launch until October, but Viture's previous AR glasses already had the edge in clarity, so I'm curious to see how its new iteration moves the ball forward.

And if you're still hung up on the marketing—I don't blame you if you are—Viture says that the “4K-like” part actually comes from people's reactions to the glasses. In an official explanation, Viture says, “The term ‘4K-like' was inspired by users. When people first saw the display, they often asked, ‘Is this 4K?' or said, ‘Wow, it looks like 4K!'” I mean… fine. To be honest, I'm willing to forgive some iffy marketing if these things are actually as crisp as Viture says they are, especially because of all the other stuff Beast has going for it.

On top of its nice micro-OLED display and supposed class-leading sharpness, Viture's glasses also have a Harman-tuned audio, electrochromic dimming so you can go from shades to clear depending on if you're inside or outside, 1,280 nits of brightness, and even a depth sensor for “spatial computing” like the Vision Pro. That's a lot of stuff packed into glasses that are pretty freaking small. Viture says Beast weighs about 88 grams, which is double other “smart glasses” like Meta's Ray-Bans but with quadruple the capabilities and an actual display in them. All of that good stuff will cost you, though. When orders are available in October, Viture says its Beast glasses will cost $549, and those aren't even the most expensive pair. Viture's Luma series glasses, which are also incoming, will cost $600 but are primarily geared toward enterprise usage. For the full slate of incoming glasses, you can visit Viture's site.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","This ‘Molecular Shield' Might Stop Pollen Before It Wrecks Your Nose","https://gizmodo.com/this-molecular-shield-might-stop-pollen-before-it-wrecks-your-nose-2000627787","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 13:15:53 GMT","

Every year, pollen seasons grow longer and more intense—to the great misery of those suffering from pollen allergies—myself included. There's only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. 

But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? 

This was the “simple but powerful idea” that inspired Kaissar Tabynov, who led the efforts to create a “molecular shield” that intercepts allergens the moment they approach our airways. For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the most common cause of pollen allergy in Central Asia and Europe. Tabynov and colleagues reported the first proof-of-principle for this technology, in this instance with mice, in a paper published today in Frontiers in Immunology.

“Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” 

Here's how the “shield” works. Researchers first develop a monoclonal antibody, or a lab-made protein designed to attach to a specific molecule. In this case it's aimed at a major allergy-causing protein found in mugwort pollen. These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. 

The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn't disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they're so insufferable), meaning Tabynov's team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. 

After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals' natural antibodies. Although the duration of the treatment was shorter than Tabynov hoped, he told Gizmodo that he and his team have already devised a strategy to potentially make the treatment last longer.

“What's exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. “Our approach is non-invasive, needle-free, and fast-acting [and] reduces the allergen load on the immune system and may help prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis into more severe conditions such as bronchial asthma.”

As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. It'd also be a time-saving, cheaper alternative to immunotherapy sessions, which can take years to have any effect. 

So, is this something we'll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Depends. Tabynov's most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment's protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.

As AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX approaches its launch, unofficial benchmark results have been posted to the Geekbench database, revealing some details about its performance. While the CPU clearly shines in AMD-conducted benchmarks showing its potential for professional workstation workloads, when it comes to the drag race-style Geekbench benchmark, it is not all that clear-cut. In fact, it runs neck-and-neck with Apple's M4 Max in threaded benchmarks, with the leader changing in some runs, while losing in single-thread work against Apple's chip. 

For now, there are multiple test results of AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in the Geekbench database. The best single-thread result for AMD's workstation flagship is 3,122 points, which is noticeably higher than the 2736 points scored by its direct predecessor, the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX. Since the new CPU is based on the improved Zen 5 microarchitecture and runs at a higher frequency, it is pretty much expected that it would be 14% faster in this benchmark.

However, as expected given its workstation focus, the single-thread performance of AMD's Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in Geekbench isn't competitive with consumer PC-oriented processors. The latter are designed for burst performance for a short while to guarantee system responsiveness and fluent user experience. By contrast, the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX barely hits its 5.40 GHz turbo frequency in GB6's single-thread scenarios.

When it comes to GB6's multi-thread performance, there is another peculiarity with AMD's workstation-oriented Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. On the one hand, the unit scores 30,170 points in the base case scenario, leaving behind its Zen 4-based Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX predecessor by a whopping 15%, or at 25,899 points. But on the other hand, the M4 Max is competitive, either beating or only slightly trailing the Threadripper chip in the multi-core score, depending on the run.

Meanwhile, one should remember that Geekbench 6 multi-tread test is a short-duration benchmark designed to simulate everyday tasks like file compression, PDF rendering, and image filtering. Because of its quick runtime and bursty workloads, it can't fully exploit the capabilities of ultra-high-core-count CPUs like the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. Many of GB6's MT tests scale only up to 8–32 threads efficiently, leaving a large portion of the 9995WX's cores underutilized, but leaving headroom for Apple's, AMD's, and Intel's client CPUs to thrive in consumer workloads because of their high clocks.

Before drawing conclusions, we should wait for tests conducted by an independent test lab. With the launch fast approaching, you can expect to see plenty of benchmarks when the chips arrive this month.

Minh  Nguyen, MD

DISCLOSURES |  July 11, 2025  

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management has recently evolved to incorporate optimized pharmacologic strategies, including timing and selection of acid-suppressive agents and use of diagnostic tools. Many cases can be treated effectively with lifestyle modifications and medications. However, patients who do not respond to initial treatment, or those with atypical symptoms or potential complications, might require more nuanced evaluation or advanced therapeutic strategies.

How much do you know about the diagnosis, symptoms, and management of GERD? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

In patients with GERD symptoms accompanied by alarm signs (eg, dysphagia, unintended weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding), endoscopy is the recommended initial diagnostic tool. This procedure allows direct visualization of the esophageal lining, helping to identify conditions such as erosive esophagitis or Barrett esophagus. These findings can confirm or support a GERD diagnosis and help guide further management.

Although a barium swallow might occasionally detect reflux, it lacks the accuracy and consistency required to serve as a standalone diagnostic method for GERD. Salivary pepsin testing has not demonstrated enough reliability in distinguishing patients with reflux-related symptoms from those without, particularly in cases involving extraesophageal manifestations. As a result, it is not recommended for routine clinical use. High-resolution manometry is primarily used to evaluate esophageal motility disorders rather than to diagnose GERD itself and does not assess mucosal integrity or confirm acid reflux as the source of symptoms.

Learn more about endoscopy.

When a patient continues to experience reflux symptoms despite PPI therapy, ambulatory wireless pH monitoring is a valuable diagnostic tool to assess whether abnormal acid exposure persists. This test provides a multi-day analysis of esophageal acid levels. It captures variations that might not appear during shorter monitoring periods, making it useful for confirming the presence of GERD in refractory cases and for guiding subsequent treatment decisions.

Abdominal ultrasound is helpful for visualizing organs such as the liver or gallbladder but cannot detect acid in the esophagus. CT of the abdomen is effective for assessing abdominal structures but does not provide information on acid reflux patterns. Blood tests for digestive enzymes might aid in evaluating pancreatic function but are not relevant for assessing esophageal acid exposure.

Learn more about PPIs.

When GERD causes symptoms beyond the digestive tract, such as a persistent cough, ongoing throat irritation, dental erosions, or asthma, it might indicate a more severe or complicated form of the disease that requires intensified treatment (possibly including surgery). These respiratory or voice-related issues can arise from stomach acid reaching areas such as the larynx or airways, causing inflammation or damage. Because these symptoms are harder to control with standard medications, a more aggressive therapeutic approach is often needed.

Intermittent dyspepsia usually reflects mild upper abdominal discomfort and is often managed with lifestyle changes or medications. Chest pain must first be evaluated to rule out cardiac causes and does not, by itself, indicate severe disease needing surgical intervention. Excessive flatulence is not a classic feature of GERD and is usually related to dietary or gastrointestinal motility factors rather than acid reflux.

Learn more about chronic cough.

For patients experiencing typical GERD symptoms, such as heartburn and acid regurgitation, without alarm features such as weight loss or dysphagia, once-daily dosing of a PPI before a meal is the recommended initial approach. This timing maximizes the medication's effect by ensuring it is active when the stomach begins producing acid in response to food.

Taking a PPI after eating is less effective because the drug must be present in the bloodstream before the stomach's acid-producing pumps are stimulated by food. Twice-daily dosing might be considered for patients with refractory symptoms or complications but is not recommended as first-line therapy. Three times daily is excessive for standard GERD management and is not supported by current guidelines for uncomplicated cases.

Learn more about GERD management.

For patients who continue to experience nighttime reflux symptoms despite taking PPIs, adding a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist at bedtime can provide additional symptom relief. Acid production tends to increase at night due to natural histamine release, and H2 blockers can help suppress this nocturnal acid surge. Although their effectiveness might diminish over time due to tolerance, short-term use can still significantly reduce nighttime acid exposure.

A morning dose of antacid does not effectively address nighttime acid production and has a short duration of action. Consuming a light dinner might offer symptom relief but is not a reliable solution for persistent nocturnal symptoms. Sleeping in an upright position is generally unnecessary; instead, elevating the head of the bed is a more practical and effective strategy to prevent nighttime reflux.

Using artificial intelligence, researchers show how γ-secretase recognizes substrates - an important advance for fundamental and translational research.

The γ-secretase enzyme is capable of cleaving more than 150 different membrane proteins. This includes the amyloid precursor protein, from which the deposits typical for Alzheimer's disease are formed, and the Notch1 protein, which plays an important role in cell communication and carcinogenesis. For a long time, however, it was unclear how γ-secretase recognizes its target proteins. Although many proteases identify substrates by means of characteristic amino acid sequences, γ-secretase does not.

An interdisciplinary team from LMU's Biomedical Center, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) has now managed to clarify details of the mechanism. The researchers have shown that substrates of the enzyme possess a complex physicochemical profile which is decisive for their recognition and cleavage.

The team developed a novel technique called Comparative Physicochemical Profiling (CPP), which allows them to compare the physicochemical properties of known substrates against reference proteins and identify characteristic patterns. In combination with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the team was also able to render visible the features that are characteristic for substrates of γ-secretase.

""The substrates of γ-secretase possess a specific physicochemical profile, which spans the entire transmembrane domain and adjacent sequence regions,"" explains Prof. Harald Steiner (LMU and DZNE), who led the study together with Dmitrij Frishman (TUM). Particularly close to the cleavage site of the substrates, the researchers discovered, substrates have the potential to develop an extended conformation as an alternative to their helical structure - a property that is supported by experimental data from γ-secretase enzyme-substrate complexes.

""We wanted to understand what actually defines a substrate, and not just generate a black-box prediction,"" adds lead author Dr. Stephan Breimann, who played a major part in developing the CPP method. ""The use of explainable AI has given us precisely this transparency.""

Using the CPP method, the researchers also managed to identify several previously unknown substrates of the enzyme, including proteins that play an important role in immune regulation and carcinogenesis.

The authors of the study are convinced their findings extend far beyond γ-secretase.

We see a new approach in here for also decoding the interplay of sequence, structure, and function in other proteases - or, say, in receptors.""

Prof. Harald Steiner, LMU and DZNE

In the long term, the results could also contribute to the development of therapeutically relevant compounds such as small-molecule drugs, peptides, or antibodies with enhanced specificities.

In recent years, some scientists and advocates have warned that playing contact sports like football and hockey may increase the risk of brain diseases like Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to a buildup of a specific protein in the brain.

But a new Northwestern Medicine study of 174 donated brains, including some from former high school and college football players, pumps the brakes on that theory. 

The long and short of it is no, this protein in this specific brain region is not increased in people who played football at the amateur level. It throws a little bit of cold water on the current CTE narrative.""

Dr. Rudolph Castellani, corresponding author, professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine neuropathologist

The study was recently published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. It raises important questions about how scientists interpret subtle brain changes associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and repetitive head impacts.

The study analyzed brain tissue from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, which collects brain donations from people who had psychiatric conditions (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression, general anxiety, substance use disorder, etc.) throughout their life. Of the 174 samples collected from older adult men (with a median age of 65 at death), 48 men participated in football in high school or college while 126 had no history of playing a contact or collision sport. 

The study did not include brains from professional athletes. 

The scientists focused on a small memory-related brain region called CA2, part of the hippocampus. This region has been shown to accumulate phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein - which is often present in neurodegenerative disease - in a variety of contexts, including normal aging, Alzheimer's disease and in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts.

But the findings suggest p-tau buildup in CA2 isn't specific to contact sports. The scientists found no over-representation of CA2 p-tau in individuals with a history of youth football participation. Instead, the presence of p-tau in this region was statistically associated with age.

""What's novel here is a return to the null hypothesis - that there may be no link between repeated head injuries and p-tau buildup in this location,"" said Castellani, who also is the neuropathology core director of the Northwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. ""Rather than assuming p-tau in CA2 is inherently pathological, we're asking whether it might be part of normal aging or a non-specific response to environmental factors.""

The study also highlights broader challenges in the field of neurodegeneration research. In particular, the authors point to the difficulty of assigning clinical meaning to subtle pathological findings. The paper's section, ""Knowledge gaps and implications for future research,"" underscores how even expert consensus groups struggle to define CTE in clinically meaningful terms.

""Modern studies on CTE may be expanding the boundaries of what's considered normal variability in the human brain,"" Castellani said. ""This work reminds us to be cautious in interpreting pathology without clear clinical correlation.""

The authors call for larger studies to better understand how p-tau relates to aging and head injuries, while urging the scientific community to critically evaluate assumptions about what constitutes neurodegenerative disease.

The study is titled ""Postmortem tau in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in older adult men who participated in youth amateur American-style football.""

WHO Member States have held their first meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the WHO Pandemic Agreement, formalizing next steps on implementing key provisions of the historic legal instrument to make the world safer from future pandemics.

Ambassador Tovar da Silva Nunes of Brazil, co-chair of the IGWG Bureau guiding the negotiations, said the first meeting, that ran from 9-10 July, was a critical moment in the global effort to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. It followed the World Health Assembly's landmark adoption on 20 May 2025 of the WHO Pandemic Agreement.

Through the WHO Pandemic Agreement, countries recognized that global collaboration and action, based on equity, are essential for protecting people from future pandemics. Now, through the IGWG, countries are breathing life into the Agreement by establishing the way forward to implement the Agreement's life-saving provisions.""

Ambassador Tovar da Silva Nunes of Brazil

The Assembly established the IGWG to, as a priority, draft and negotiate an annex to the WHO Pandemic Agreement on Pathogen Access and Benefit Sharing (PABS). This PABS system is intended to enable safe, transparent and accountable access and benefit-sharing for PABS materials and sequence information. The outcome of the IGWG's work on the PABS annex will be submitted to the Seventy-ninth World Health Assembly in 2026 for its consideration.

In addition to negotiating the PABS annex, the IGWG has been established to discuss procedural and other matters to prepare for the Conference of the Parties to the WHO Pandemic Agreement and develop a proposal for the terms of reference for the Coordinating Financial Mechanism.

Fellow IGWG Bureau co-chair Mr Matthew Harpur, of the United Kingdom, said he was encouraged by the strong collaboration shown by WHO Member States to take the WHO Pandemic Agreement forward.

""Global collaboration is the foundation of an effective response to global threats,"" said Mr Harpur. ""I am encouraged by the commitment shown by WHO Member States during the first IGWG to work together to protect their citizens, and those of all other countries.""

The first meeting of the IGWG adopted the body's method of work, timeline of activities leading up to next year's World Health Assembly, and mode of engagement with relevant stakeholders, and elected co-chairs and vice chairs to lead the IGWG process. The IGWG also decided to identify experts to provide inputs on the PABS annex and possibly hold an informal briefing before the second meeting of the IGWG, which will be held on 15-19 September 2025.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Bioresponsive materials have gained prominence as innovative tools for advancing drug delivery systems, particularly in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These materials respond to biological stimuli such as pH, glucose, enzymes, or temperature, thereby enabling spatiotemporally controlled drug release.

This article examines recent progress in the design strategies, activation mechanisms, and therapeutic applications of these materials in diabetes care. Key focus areas include macromolecular insulin delivery systems and oral hypoglycemic agents, with emphasis on their efficacy in regulating blood glucose homeostasis. Despite their promise, challenges persist in translating these technologies to clinical practice, including scalability limitations, insufficient clinical validation, regulatory hurdles, and healthcare system compatibility.

Current therapeutic shortcomings, such as frequent injections and adverse effects compromising patient adherence, are discussed. By synthesizing contemporary research developments and implementation barriers, this work provides critical insights into optimizing bioresponsive platforms for clinical translation. The analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address technical and practical constraints, and ultimately engineer patient-centric, scalable solutions that enhance therapeutic outcomes and quality of life. Future directions include bridging material innovation with clinical needs to develop next-generation diabetes management systems.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New analysis reveals widespread progression of CKM syndrome across the U.S.","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250711/New-analysis-reveals-widespread-progression-of-CKM-syndrome-across-the-US.aspx","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

One in three adults in the U.S. has three or more risk factors for a newly recognized but increasingly common condition: cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. First recognized by the American Heart Association (AHA) in a 2023 presidential advisory, CKM connects heart and metabolic health with kidney function as intertwined drivers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Long before CKM was defined, millions of Americans were unknowingly progressing through the condition's dangerous stages. 

In a first-of-its-kind analysis, Tarang Parekh, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware College of Health Sciences, and colleagues at Houston Methodist Hospital and Harvard Medical School, examined the state-level prevalence of CKM syndrome, using self-reported data from the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System from 2011 to 2023. 

Parekh's analysis, recently published in the journal JAAC: Advances, found that 80% of the population has some form of CKM syndrome. Over the past 12 years, not a single state saw a decline in CKM rates. 

West Virginia had the highest prevalence, with nearly 87% of residents affected by 2023. Delaware wasn't far behind, with rates climbing from 76% to 83% over the same period. Colorado reported the lowest rate, with nearly 72% of the population impacted. Overall, CKM rates were highest in the Midwest and the South.

""This is an alarming trend that's a result of our fragmented healthcare system,"" Parekh said.

CKM, like many chronic diseases, progresses in stages. Stage zero means no disease is present. At Stage 1, individuals are obese or prediabetic. Stages 2 and 3 involve kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes or a combination of risk factors that dramatically raise their risk for CVD. Stage 4 is dire.

That's where we see a clinical CVD diagnosis, including heart failure, stroke or coronary heart disease, or kidney failure.""

Tarang Parekh, assistant professor of epidemiology, University of Delaware College of Health Sciences

Parekh's analysis found nearly 50% of states saw an increased prevalence of CKM in stages 1 through 3. While Stage 4 rates declined steadily nationwide, Minnesota was an exception, seeing significant increases in the most dangerous stage of the condition.

Routine health screenings are key to slowing the progression of CKM and reducing CVD. However, work to get physicians to assess these conditions in an interconnected manner is only just beginning.

""We must educate the public about the intersection of these conditions, so they realize CKM syndrome is more than just taking care of obesity, diabetes, or CVD in isolation,"" said Parekh. ""Without lifestyle and behavioral changes, one risk factor can snowball into several.""

Significant variation in state-level programs also complicates the matter.

""Some programs only tackle diabetes self-management. We must expand those programs to include other risk factors for CVD to reduce CKM syndrome progression,"" Parekh added.

Parekh also emphasized that individuals must take charge of their health.

""People need to know their weight, blood pressure, and BMI,"" said Parekh. ""Routine point-of-care testing during wellness visits is essential. But often, if a measure is borderline, we tend to ignore it - that needs to stop.""

To combat rising CKM rates, the AHA has launched a pilot preventive health initiative focused on improving care for people in select cities and regions, including Atlanta, San Diego, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Washington, D.C, Maryland, and Ohio, including the Cincinnati metro area and parts of Kentucky. These locations were selected due to disease prevalence, health system infrastructure and community characteristics. 

The AHA plans to expand the CKM Health Initiative to 15 geographic regions nationwide, ultimately reaching 250,000 Americans at 150 existing healthcare sites. 

""The pilot brings together providers across various specialties, from primary care physicians to cardiologists and nephrologists, to take a more holistic approach to care,"" Parekh said.

Looking ahead, Parekh plans to analyze clinical data using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct a more detailed understanding of CKM. He also hopes to develop a machine-learning risk model to predict and, ultimately, slow CKM progression.

Mothers experiencing depression have considerable challenges across multiple parenting domains, according to a global systematic review published in the July issue of Harvard Review of Psychiatry, part of the Lippincott portfolio from Wolters Kluwer. Maternal depression is defined as major depressive disorder (MDD) that occurs during pregnancy or emerges within 4 to 30 weeks after birth.

Tiago N. Munhoz, PhD, a psychologist at Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil, and colleagues found that 97% of observational studies published in the past decade demonstrated an association between maternal depression and negative parenting practices. ""Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective psychological methods and interventions,"" they emphasize.

Until now, the most recent systematic review to explore the association between maternal depression and parenting only included data collected up to 2013 and was limited to English-language reports. To find more recent evidence, Dr. Munhoz's team searched the MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, BVS, LILACS, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases for articles published from November 2013 through 2023. They included observational studies in which mothers were diagnosed with MDD or were screened for depressive symptoms postpartum or in their child's youth or adolescence.

The researchers looked for studies on parenting practices-specific behaviors directed toward children-and excluded those pertaining to parenting styles (e.g., authoritarian, permissive, or neglectful). They selected 29 articles for data extraction: 27 published in English and two in Portuguese. Of these, 10 studies were conducted in Europe/Central Asia, six in East Asia/the Pacific, six in Latin America/the Caribbean, five in North America, and two in the Middle East/Africa. Eight studies were conducted in middle-income countries and one in a low-income country. Some studies involved videotaping interactions between mothers and children.

Fourteen studies investigated mother-baby bonding, and all found that maternal depression impaired this bond. In studies that used both the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire, higher depression scale scores indicated more damage to the bond. Four studies showed that women who did not manifest depressive symptoms bonded more closely with their babies than women who were depressed or experienced depressive symptoms throughout their lives.

Maternal depression was also associated with:

One study found no significant associations between maternal depression (during pregnancy and postpartum) and sensitivity or positive regard for the child. That study was conducted in the US and involved 36 low-income mother-child dyads.

""[E]xisting literature suggests that depression-alleviating interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness improve parent–child relationships and reduce negative parenting behaviors,"" the authors remind their colleagues. ""Such tactics benefit maternal well-being and the overall family dynamic.""

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Imbalances in the intestinal microbiome are closely associated with the occurrence and development of cancer, and can affect tumorigenesis by influencing the inflammatory response, regulating the immune system, producing specific metabolites, and participating in tumor signaling pathways.

This study investigated the relationships among intestinal microbial dynamics, metabolite profiles, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Patients were stratified by Miller-Payne (MP) grade into good (MP 4-5) or poor (MP 1-3) responders. Fecal samples from patients (pre- and post-NAC) were analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic analysis.
After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the species diversity and abundance of the intestinal microbiome significantly decreased, and these trends were not correlated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy. Fusobacterium abundance remained significantly higher in poor responders than good responders post-NAC, thus suggesting its association with chemoresistance.

The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in patients with breast cancer than healthy controls, and was correlated with the therapeutic response: this ratio rose post-NAC but remained suboptimal in poor responders. Untargeted metabolomics identified upregulated amino acids (Thr-Thr and histidine) in poor responders and elevated lipids (C17-sphinganine) in good responders. ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis validated these metabolites (AUC >0.7) as predictive biomarkers. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in mTOR signaling, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signaling pathways.

These findings underscore the intestinal microbiome's potential as a predictor of NAC efficacy and a therapeutic target. Modulating Fusobacterium or metabolite pathways may enhance chemotherapy response.

A third of women who died during or in the year after pregnancy were known to Children's Social Care – higher than previously reported, new research reveals. The authors say urgent changes are needed to prioritize and improve mothers' care.

The study is published today in BMJ Medicine and led by King's College London, Oxford University and the charity Birth Companions, and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. It is the first to detail the situations of the 1695 women who died within a year of pregnancy; of whom 420 were in contact with children's social care. Researchers analysed national surveillance data from 2014 to 2022 to understand how the women died and the quality of the care they received.

The number of newborn babies in care proceedings in England is a growing problem. 2914 were in care in 2019/20; up 20% in seven years. Children under one make-up over a quarter of all children in care proceedings.

The study finds three quarters of the mothers known to social services died between six weeks and the year after pregnancy and most deaths were due to suicide (20%), other psychiatric causes including drug related deaths (30%), and homicide (5%). Women with social care involvement more frequently died from homicide and mental health related causes than women without involvement.

Many of the women who died had significant experiences of abuse and mental ill-health. Two thirds (65%) of women with Children's Social Care involvement reported domestic abuse before or during pregnancy, compared to 3% of women without social care involvement. One in three disclosed abuse during childhood compared to 2% of women without social care involvement.

A higher proportion of women known to social care had pre-existing medical problems (75%, versus 59%), mental health issues (75% versus 27%), smoking during pregnancy (73% versus 21%) and known substance use (55% versus 5%) than women with no social care involvement.

The researchers also conducted a confidential care review, which looked at anonymised care records for 47 of these women. The study found uncoordinated involvement of services and agencies, such as maternity and mental health services, children's social care, and other medical specialists. This resulted in overwhelming appointment schedules, and compounded the adversity the women were facing rather than helping them. In several case reviews, women had more than thirty different appointments during pregnancy. In many instances, risk management solely focused on safeguarding the infant, disregarding the mother's own safeguarding needs.

This report details for the first time the high proportion of women with children's social care involvement who die in the UK and the care they receive during pregnancy and the postnatal period.

What the analysis tells us is that these women come from backgrounds of trauma and abuse, and yet despite their efforts to keep up with demanding appointment schedules, they often face scrutiny and judgment rather than receiving support for the issues they are facing. Too often, the professionals the women are in touch with don't work together to provide holistic care, which increases the pressure on a mother. When women have access to designated multi-disciplinary teams, with specialist knowledge and capacity to provide integrated and holistic care, these barriers can be overcome. It makes it easier to understand who is doing what and when, for women and professionals.""

Kaat De Backer, first author from King's College London

The researchers highlighted the complex care women have to navigate during pregnancy and the postnatal period. They say urgent changes to practice, clinical guidance and policy are required to prioritise mothers with social care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood.

Naomi Delap, Director at the charity Birth Companions, said: ""This study highlights the acute need for better care for women with Children's Social Care involvement, and the significant barriers that get in the way of providing that care.

""To help improve things, we need coordinated national policy and clear expectations across the health and social care systems. In response to this study, Birth Companions is launching work to co-design a national care pathway, in order to deliver consistent, compassionate support for all women who have Children's Social Care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood. This work holds the potential to transform care, break cycles of harm, and help ensure fewer mothers lose their lives in such tragic circumstances.""

Senior author Dr Nicola Vousden, from Oxford Population Health's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, said ""This study adds to findings from MBRRACE-UK that women with multiple disadvantages prior to, and during pregnancy, are at increased risk of worse outcomes. We've identified practical changes that are required within maternity care. We also need joined up pathways of care across maternity, social care and community health partners to support the needs of women with children's social involvement, including domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental health. This will require local and national action.""

This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how an anti-complement homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata ameliorates acute pneumonia with H1N1 and MRSA coinfection through rectifying Treg/Th17 imbalance in the gut–lung axis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

The coinfection of respiratory viruses and bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the development of vaccines and powerful antibiotics. As a macromolecule that is difficult to absorb in the gastrointestinal tract, a homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata (HCPM) has been reported to exhibit anti-complement properties and alleviate influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced lung injury; however, the effects of HCPM without in vitro antiviral and antibacterial activities on more complicated pulmonary diseases resulting from viral-bacterial coinfection remains unclear.

This study established a representative coinfection murine pneumonia model infected with H1N1 (0.2 LD50) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 107 CFU). HCPM significantly improved survival rate and weight loss, and ameliorated gut–lung damage and inflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, the therapeutic effect of HCPM on intestinal damage preceded that in the lungs. Mechanistically, HCPM inhibited the overactivation of the intestinal complement (C3a and C5a) and suppressed the activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway, which contributes to the regulation of the Treg/Th17 cell balance in the gut–lung axis.

The results indicate the beneficial effects of an anti-complement polysaccharide against viral–bacterial coinfection pneumonia by modulating crosstalk between multiple immune regulatory networks.

Women diagnosed with premenstrual symptoms have a slightly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life. This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Cardiovascular Research.

Premenstrual symptoms include premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The symptoms, which appear a few days before menstruation and then subside, can be both psychological and physical.

The study included more than 99,000 women with premenstrual symptoms who were followed for up to 22 years. The researchers compared their health with women without these symptoms – both in the general population and by comparing them with their own sisters to take into account hereditary factors and upbringing.

The results show that women with premenstrual symptoms had about a ten per cent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. When the researchers also looked at different types of cardiovascular disease, they found that the link was particularly strong for heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias), where the risk was 31 per cent higher, and for stroke caused by a blood clot, where the risk was 27 per cent higher. Even after the researchers took into account other factors such as smoking, BMI and mental health, the link between premenstrual symptoms and increased disease risk remained.

The increased risk was particularly clear in women who were diagnosed before the age of 25 and in those who had also experienced postnatal depression, a condition that can also be caused by hormonal fluctuations.""

Yihui Yang, PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet and first author of the study

Research has not yet identified the cause of this link, but the researchers behind the study suggest three possible explanations. One is that women with premenstrual symptoms may have a disrupted regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which controls blood pressure and fluid balance in the body, among other things. The second is that these women have increased levels of inflammation in the body, which is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and other heart problems. Finally, it may be because women with premenstrual symptoms may have metabolic abnormalities, which are linked to an increased risk of both stroke and heart attack.

""We hope that our findings will contribute to greater awareness that premenstrual disorders not only affect daily life but can also have consequences for long-term health,"" says Donghao Lu, associate professor at the same department and last author of the study.

This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how ALKBH3-regulated m1A of ALDOA potentiates glycolysis and doxorubicin resistance of triple negative breast cancer cells.

Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic management for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but chemoresistance significantly impacts patient outcomes.

This research indicates that Doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant TNBC cells exhibit increased glycolysis and ATP generation compared to their parental cells, with this metabolic shift contributing to chemoresistance. It was discovered that ALKBH3, an m1A demethylase enzyme, is crucial in regulating the enhanced glycolysis in Dox-resistant TNBC cells.

Knocking down ALKBH3 reduced ATP generation, glucose consumption, and lactate production, implicating its involvement in mediating glycolysis. Further investigation revealed that aldolase A (ALDOA), a key enzyme in glycolysis, is a downstream target of ALKBH3. ALKBH3 regulates ALDOA mRNA stability through m1A demethylation at the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). This methylation negatively affects ALDOA mRNA stability by recruiting the YTHDF2/PAN2–PAN3 complex, leading to mRNA degradation. The ALKBH3/ALDOA axis promotes Dox resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

Clinical analysis demonstrated that ALKBH3 and ALDOA are upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and higher expression of these proteins is associated with reduced overall survival in TNBC patients. This study highlights the role of the ALKBH3/ALDOA axis in contributing to Dox resistance in TNBC cells through regulation of ALDOA mRNA stability and glycolysis.

Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions arise when the body's immune system fails to distinguish between ""self"" and ""foreign"" cells, and mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, resulting in persistent inflammation and tissue damage. Central to these autoimmune responses are CD4+ T cells, a class of immune cells that can either promote or suppress the condition.

Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a special subtype of CD4+ T cells that act as the immune system's peacekeepers. Treg cells, marked by protein Foxp3, help in suppressing harmful immune responses. However, when the function of Treg cells is compromised, as seen in cases of MS and IBD, the immune response is dominated by the Th1 and Th17 cells (other CD4+T cell subtypes), which promote inflammation, further worsening the disease symptoms. Therefore, boosting the development and activity of Treg cells is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach, but the mechanisms underlying its effective regulation remain unclear.

In pursuit of a deeper understanding of these mechanisms, a team of Chinese scientists led by Dr. Xiaojun Wu and Dr. Fei Huang from the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines, SHUTCM, China, and Dr. Weidong Pan from the Department of Neurology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China, explored the role of Early Growth Response Gene 1 (Egr-1) in promoting the activity of Treg cells. The study was conducted in a well-established animal model of MS, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to confirm the mechanisms. The findings of this study were published in Volume 8 of Research on April 15, 2025.

Elaborating more, Dr. Wu, the lead author of this study, says ""We started by screening the genes that appeared different between mice with mild and severe EAE."" Further, he adds, ""Among the top identified genes in CD4+ T cells, Egr-1 stood out as significantly downregulated in severe disease.""

After identifying Egr-1 as a regulatory gene, the team assessed its role by using genetically engineered mice lacking Egr-1 in CD4+ T cells. These mice were induced with EAE and tracked for disease progression. The researchers also analyzed the immune cell compositions in the spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system of these mice.

""The mice lacking Egr-1 showed worse disease, fewer Treg cells, and more inflammatory TH17 and TH1 cells"" explains Dr. Huang.

The researchers also conducted additional in vitro experiments. By analyzing isolated human CD4+ T cells from MS patients and healthy donors, they confirmed that both Egr-1 and Foxp3 levels were reduced in patient samples. Further, to determine whether Egr-1 directly regulates Foxp3, the researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation, which revealed that Egr-1 binds to the Foxp3 promoter. Additionally, using luciferase reporter assays, they also confirmed that Egr-1 binding increases Foxp3 gene activity. They then traced the pathway to TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor Beta) signaling via the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates Egr-1.

""We identified a unique mechanism of Egr-1,"" explains Dr. Pan, ""First, TGF-β activates the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates Egr-1. Egr-1 then directly binds to the Foxp3 promoter to enhance its expression, bypassing the classical Smad3-dependent pathway.""

What's more, the researchers also investigated the effect of a natural compound, Calycosin, which acts as an Egr-1 agonist. Treatment with calycosin restored Treg cell functions and improve clinical outcomes in mice with EAE, but only in those with functional Egr-1.

Overall, the study underscores the essential role of Egr-1 in Treg cell development and function, identifying it as a central molecular switch in immune regulation. By elucidating its mechanism and validating the effect of a natural Egr-1 agonist, the study suggests that targeting Egr-1 may offer a promising treatment strategy, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases.

A new study, published in Addiction, shines a light on how industries associated with health harms-such as tobacco, fossil fuels, and in this case, alcohol-can distort the evaluation of scientific research through industry-friendly commentary. 

A team of researchers led by UVic's Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR), analyzed 268 critiques of alcohol and health studies published online since 2010 by the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research, or ISFAR. 

ISFAR describes themselves as an international group of ""invited physicians and scientists who are specialists in their fields and committed to balanced and well researched analysis regarding alcohol and health."" However, members have continuing alcohol-industry connections, says Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study. 

Although ISFAR has long-standing ties to the alcohol industry, it is still frequently quoted in the media as an authoritative voice on matters relating to alcohol and health. We had observed their critiques seemed to favour studies finding health benefits from alcohol, and to be critical of those that said otherwise. We set out to test this impartially and comprehensively."" 

Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study

The researchers' hypotheses were confirmed, whether using data generated by human coders or by computer-based text analysis of the ISFAR critiques. The team found studies supporting an industry-friendly narrative were ten times more likely to receive a positive review from ISFAR than those suggesting otherwise. Notably, ISFAR's favorability ratings were completely unrelated to the studies' level of scientific merit as assessed by an independent expert who was not otherwise involved in the project. 

""This analysis confirms the impression that ISFAR is an industry-friendly echo chamber whose critiques are determined more by whether they like the conclusions contained in research papers than by scientific merit,"" says Stockwell. ""We've seen this playbook before with the tobacco industry trying to discredit science around smoking's harms."" 

It's a reminder that we need to be mindful of where our information is coming from and who is paying for its creation, says Stockwell.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Hepatitis C treatment gaps persist for children and new mothers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250711/Hepatitis-C-treatment-gaps-persist-for-children-and-new-mothers.aspx","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:20:00 GMT","

As the opioid epidemic has worsened in the United States, prevalence of hepatitis C has also increased. Hepatitis C is a bloodborne virus that damages the liver. It is mainly spread through sharing needles or other injection equipment and can also be passed from a mother to baby during pregnancy or childbirth. It can be safely and effectively treated by direct-acting antiviral therapies that are approved for both adults and children.

Two recent studies from researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis reveal that two vulnerable populations - children and recently pregnant women - face disparities in access to treatment for hepatitis C infection. Without treatment, these groups are at risk of long-term adverse health outcomes such as cirrhosis, liver cancer and death.

One study, published in Pediatrics in collaboration with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, found that few children with hepatitis C were referred for care. This study also revealed that there were significant disparities in whether these patients were provided care and treatment for their infection depending on a child's race, geographic location and age. A second study, led by WashU Medicine researchers and published July 10 in Obstetrics & Gynecology Open, showed that recently pregnant women with the hepatitis C virus were significantly less likely to receive hepatitis C treatment than men or women who had not been recently pregnant.

""We have treatments for hepatitis C where it's just two or three months of pills and then over 95% of people are cured,"" said Megan Curtis, MD, an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases in the John T. Milliken Department of Medicine at WashU Medicine, who led both studies. ""But we are still having difficulties in getting the treatments to the populations that need them the most. These kinds of studies can help us identify where those barriers are.""

Curtis has focused her research on identifying which patients experience gaps in access to hepatitis C treatment. Using anonymized data from a national database, she identified 928 pediatric patients who tested positive for hepatitis C between 2000 and 2022.

In the study published in Pediatrics, Curtis found that only about one in eight of these children were treated for hepatitis C, but that ratio was affected by certain factors. Children born between 2014 and 2018 were more likely to be treated than were those born earlier, which likely reflects changes in Medicaid and insurance coverage during that period, as well as increased availability of treatment for younger children in later years. However, this group's rate of treatment was still much lower than that of adult patients with hepatitis C.

The study found racial and ethnic disparities as well. Compared to Black children, Hispanic children had about twice the odds and White children had about three times the odds of receiving care for hepatitis C. Geographic region also played a role in disparities: Children with hepatitis C living in the South were least likely to receive treatment compared to those in other regions of the country.

Although these differences may stem largely from socioeconomic disparities in access to health care and regional availability of providers, Curtis noted that other factors can also contribute to low overall treatments rates among children.

""Parents might also delay because of the difficulty of administering a medicine to a young child,"" she said, ""and clinicians may delay treatment because some children who have hepatitis C will spontaneously clear it on their own. However, this isn't always the case.""

Hepatitis C infections have been increasing in people with opioid use disorders. Within that population, men have been shown to be more likely to receive treatment for hepatitis C than women are. To understand why, Curtis, in collaboration with Kevin Xu, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry and co-senior author of the study in Obstetrics & Gynecology Open, and their team set out to see if pregnancy might be playing a role in these sex disparities.

Given that people with opioid use disorder are at risk of contracting hepatitis C, the researchers used an administrative claims database and similar epidemiologic methods as in the pediatric study to analyze data on patients in treatment for opioid use disorder who were also confirmed to have hepatitis C. They found that recent pregnancy was strongly associated with a lower likelihood of receiving treatment for hepatitis C. Recently pregnant patients with hepatitis C were almost 30% less likely to receive antivirals than men were (31.8% versus 40.6%, respectively), and about 11% less likely than women who were not recently pregnant (31.8% versus 35.7%).

Caroline Cary, a third-year medical student at WashU Medicine who is the first author on the study, said the results suggest that more resources are needed to reach patients who are likely to slip through the cracks.

People with hepatitis C are often asymptomatic for years after being exposed, so if you are young, otherwise healthy and have a new baby, getting prompt treatment may not be a top priority, especially if it is challenging to access. It's imperative to make hepatitis C care more readily accessible to new moms considering the long-term consequences of the condition.""

Caroline Cary, third-year medical student at WashU Medicine

For Curtis, it's a troubling problem because treatments for hepatitis C are very effective when started early and taken consistently.

""We need to come up with better strategies for addressing hepatitis C,"" she said. ""We have all the tools to eliminate it. We have medications that can treat it. We know the people who need to get it. We just need to step up the availability and the awareness. We could be done with hepatitis C in a generation.""

Recently, the team led by Chief Physician Quan Zhang and Associate Professor Feng Liu at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital systematically evaluated the genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain structures using large-scale genome-wide association summary statistics and advanced statistical genetic methods. The related findings were published in Research under the title ""Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis reveals shared genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain volumes"".

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder worldwide. Beyond glucose dysregulation, it exerts significant effects on the central nervous system. Epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence indicates that individuals with T2DM are at substantially increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which is closely linked to degenerative changes in brain structure—particularly within subcortical regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and thalamus. These regions play critical roles in memory, emotional regulation, and motor control, and have been shown to exhibit marked volume reduction and structural abnormalities in individuals with T2DM.

Current neuroimaging studies have systematically characterized the structural brain abnormalities associated with T2DM. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving these changes remain unclear. T2DM is a prototypical polygenic disorder, with large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) having identified hundreds of associated genetic loci. Likewise, the volume and morphology of subcortical brain structures are known to be strongly influenced by genetic factors. Emerging evidence suggests potential genetic overlap between T2DM and brain structure. For instance, the T2DM risk gene TCF7L2 has been linked to amygdala volume, and the Hp 1-1 gene has been associated with hippocampal volume. Moreover, polygenic risk scores for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) have shown associations with gray matter volume, and the genetic risk of several hippocampal morphological traits has been related to T2DM. While these findings provide preliminary insights, a comprehensive investigation into the shared genetic architecture between T2DM and brain structural abnormalities is still lacking. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways and biological mechanisms.

The authors systematically evaluated the polygenic overlap and shared genetic architecture between T2DM and the volumes of subcortical brain structures, including the bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and accumbens. MiXeR analysis revealed that T2DM has high polygenicity and low discoverability, and shares varying degrees of genome-wide genetic overlap with subcortical brain regions, with Dice coefficients ranging from 22.4% to 49.6% .

Using the conditional false discovery rate approach, the study identified 229 loci associated with T2DM (including 5 novel loci) and 220 loci associated with subcortical brain structures (including 16 novel loci). Furthermore, conjunctional false discovery rate analysis revealed 129 shared loci jointly associated with T2DM and subcortical volumes. Among them, rs429358 on chromosome 19 (located in the APOE gene) showed the strongest association with both bilateral accumbens volume and T2DM, and exhibited a high functional pathogenicity score.

In the functional annotation, most of the shared SNPs were located in intronic or intergenic regions. A total of 769 protein-coding genes were mapped from the candidate SNPs, showing high expression in pancreatic, hepatic, and cardiac tissues, and were involved in various biological processes including energy metabolism, neurogenesis, and nervous system development. Developmental trajectory analysis revealed that genes shared between T2DM and multiple subcortical brain regions were highly expressed during the fetal period and gradually declined after birth, suggesting their potential role in early brain development.

Further transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) validated the dual association of several key genes (e.g., TUFM, JAZF1) with both T2DM and the volumes of specific brain regions.

This study systematically revealed the genetic overlap between T2DM and subcortical brain structures, clarifying their shared genetic loci, shared genes and the potential biological pathways involved. This interdisciplinary work not only deepens our understanding of how T2DM affects brain health, but also promotes a shift in metabolic disease research from a traditional focus on peripheral metabolism to the central nervous system. The findings provide critical genetic evidence for risk prediction, biomarker identification, and early intervention strategies targeting T2DM-related brain structural alterations, offering new directions for clinical translation and precision prevention in the brain-metabolism interface.

United States women's national team legend and two-time World Cup and Olympic gold medalist, Tobin Heath, has announced her retirement from professional soccer on her podcast, ""The RE-CAP Show,"" at the age of 37.

Heath's decision to retire comes after a series of setbacks, including a knee injury that required multiple surgeries, keeping her out of play since 2022. During her time with the USWNT, Heath made a significant impact, scoring 36 goals and recording 42 assists in 181 appearances for the U.S. since 2008. She was part of the USWNT World Cup teams in 2015 and 2019, and she scored the final goal against Japan in the final match of the 2015 tournament.

In addition to her achievements at the national level, Heath spent some time in France playing for Paris Saint-Germain before returning to the Portland Thorns, where she won two NWSL championships. She then moved to the FA Women's Super League, playing for Manchester United and Arsenal, until an injury sidelined her. After recovering, she returned to the NWSL and signed with OL Reign, but unfortunately, she faced another season-ending knee injury after playing only a few matches.

Since Heath has been rehabilitating her left knee, she started a podcast with her former USWNT teammate and current partner, Christen Press, titled ""The RE-CAP Show."" This podcast offers an honest, unfiltered, and humorous perspective on global soccer and women's sports.

Additionally, Heath is the only woman in FIFA's technical study group, which was formed in preparation for this summer's Men's Club World Cup tournament.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

U.S. women's national team and NWSL star Tobin Heath announced her retirement from professional soccer on Thursday. Though it has been nearly three years since Heath competed professionally, she chose to make it official on “The RE-CAP Show,” a podcast she hosts with partner and former teammate Christen Press.

“Over New Year's, I actually came to the full acceptance that I wasn't going to be playing, which was like a two-year, some might say three-year process of acceptance,” Heath told listeners.

Heath was a joy to watch for over a decade thanks to her creativity and elite technical skill. An intense student of the game, Heath was known for her tricky nutmegs, sneaky jukes, joyful juggling, slick dribbles and clever passes.

The now 37-year-old had her career cut short by a serious knee injury in 2022 that required several surgeries to repair and eventually ended up being career-ending. Her last U.S. appearance came on Oct. 26, 2021. Her last NWSL appearance was Aug. 14, 2022, for Seattle Reign (then OL Reign).

Despite injuries throughout her career, Heath made 181 appearances in 13 years for the senior national team, scoring 36 goals and adding 42 assists. She won two World Cups (2015, 2019) and three Olympic medals (gold in 2008 and 2012, bronze in 2020/21).

The University of North Carolina alumni began her pro career with the Atlanta Beat after being picked No. 1 overall in the 2010 WPS College Draft. While still a Tar Heel, Heath won four straight Atlantic Coast Conference titles and three NCAA National Championships.

In the NWSL, Heath won multiple Championships and Shields. The attacker won two NWSL championships with the Portland Thorns, in 2013 & 2017. Heath was named the 2013 NWSL Championship MVP for scoring the game-winning goal directly from a free kick. She also won two NWSL Shields, one with Portland in 2016 and the other with the Seattle Reign in 2022. Between 2013 and 2022, Heath made 75 NWSL appearances, recording 13 goals and 24 assists.

Herculez Gomez reacts to Bayer Leverkusen's links to Malik Tillman. (1:33)

Bayer Leverkusen announced the signing of United States international Malik Tillman from PSV Eindhoven on Saturday, activating the 23-year-old's €35 million release clause, and it's not hard to see why.

Tillman completed an exceptional season in the Netherlands in 2024-25 and capped it off by being arguably the U.S. men's national team's best player on its run to the Gold Cup final. Not only is he a player in form, but he's also joining a team that's in a state of transition and has a definitive need in the creative department.

So, how will Tillman fit in Leverkusen? What did they see in him? And are the 2023-24 Bundesliga champions the best place for one of the USMNT's most gifted creators? ESPN's Constantin Eckner and Cesar Hernandez reflect on Tillman's return to Germany.

It's a summer of transition at Leverkusen. Hugely adored manager Xabi Alonso has left for Real Madrid, with Erik ten Hag arriving to take his place. Star Germany international Florian Wirtz left the BayArena in a £100 million (plus £16 million in add-ons) move to Liverpool, and unsurprisingly given his profile, Tillman has been signed as a central piece of the club's attack.

Ten Hag spoke to PSV manager Peter Bosz about Leverkusen in recent times, with Bosz having served as Bayer's head coach from late 2018 to spring 2021. The two Dutchmen likely exchanged thoughts on Tillman, too.

The German-born midfielder was arguably PSV's best player last season. When Tillman was sidelined with an ankle injury in the later stages of the Eredivisie season, the Eindhoven club lost 10 points to Ajax but ultimately overtook its rivals at the end of the season, in part thanks to Tillman.

Leverkusen have been aware of the midfielder for quite some time, which might not be a revelation given that Tillman is a Bayern Munich academy graduate. He quickly realized there would be little chance to play for Bayern and thus took a different route, first on loan at Rangers and then for PSV. The Eredivisie side ultimately signed him on a permanent deal for a modest fee of €12 million in 2024. In transferring Tillman to Leverkusen, PSV have nearly tripled their investment.

The Bundesliga club was aware of the fact that several teams, including some from the Premier League, were seriously looking at Tillman in recent months. That comes as little surprise considering his talent. In particular, Tillman's forceful nature of making runs from midfield and into the penalty area caught Leverkusen's eye.

Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

Despite being a smaller player, Wirtz exuded a similar degree of explosiveness when running from near the halfway line into the attacking third. Leverkusen don't see Tillman as a one-to-one replacement for Wirtz, though, considering the U.S. international is not the kind of smooth technician who can move effortlessly between the lines and in tight areas. Hence, the Werkself are still looking to add a more technical and possibly smaller attacking midfielder to their squad.

Tillman has compared himself to Paul Pogba, another midfielder who is best suited as a No. 8 rather than a No. 10. Nevertheless, Tillman has stressed that his favorite position is the 10.

""Well, if someone asks me what my favorite position is, then it is the 10,"" Tillman told German football magazine kicker a year ago. ""Sure, I have also played on the left wing and a bit deeper, because I'm pretty versatile.""

Tillman will be an immediate starter for Ten Hag, whose tactical approach is not that far away from Bosz's, although a bit more risk averse. In fact, being Leverkusen's record signing will put considerable expectations on the 23-year-old.

Despite those expectations, virtually everyone at the Werkself accepts that Tillman won't simply replace Wirtz. Their playing styles are too different, as are their personalities. Wirtz was a natural leader even at the tender age of 19, but Tillman is soft-spoken, introverted and lets his actions on the pitch speak for him. -- Eckner

Shining at the Gold Cup with three goals and two assists as an attacking midfield conductor, the clever game-changer boasted moments of finesse and flair that helped carry the summer's alternate squad to a second-place finish. By tournament's end, Tillman transitioned from a player about whom you wondered if he could replicate his club form with his country, to arguably a member of the USMNT's best XI.

With that in mind, it's fair for some American fans to feel a little hesitant about the midfielder suddenly changing scenery less than a year out from the World Cup.

Can Tillman thrive in the Bundesliga? He most definitely can.

Culturally speaking, it won't be tough for the German American to return to not only the country of his birth, but also a league he has had some (minimal) experience in. His confidence will be at an all-time high after the Gold Cup, and with the form that he's in, one shouldn't blame the up-and-coming player for having the confident mindset to take on new challenges with a team like Leverkusen.

Nonetheless, it's a risk.

There are numerous examples of players who thrived in the Eredivisie but weren't able to perform at the same level in a bigger European league. With the USMNT, it also shouldn't be overlooked how Mexico were able to quiet and contain the midfielder during the Gold Cup final that the U.S. lost 2-1. In the group stage against an organized Saudi Arabia, Tillman also struggled with making much of an impact in the final third.

There's a lot to like about the player who clearly has a lofty ceiling, but it'll undoubtedly be a unique challenge for him at the club level for the 2025-26 season, despite not being viewed as a one-to-one replacement for Wirtz. At the moment, the jury is out on whether the coming months will be successfully navigated with Leverkusen and provide an additional boost next summer, or if it'll be a failed gamble on a USMNT player whose stock is at an all-time high. -- Hernandez","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Herculez Gomez reacts to Bayer Leverkusen's links to Malik Tillman. (1:33)

United States men's national team star Malik Tillman told ESPN he has ""mixed feelings"" after completing a move to Bayer Leverkusen from PSV Eindhoven on Saturday, but the midfielder added he is ""excited to have some new experiences in my life.""

Tillman helped PSV win the Dutch Eredivisie title in both of the past two seasons. He joins Leverkusen as one of the first signings for new boss Erik ten Hag, who took over from Xabi Alonso this summer.

""I'm happy, I'm excited; I think it's a good step for my career,"" Tillman told ESPN.

When asked if he has mixed feelings about leaving PSV, Tillman said: ""I definitely do. But it's football. Sometimes you have to move on. I'm going to miss it here. I had two great seasons here. I miss the players, the coaches, the people at the club. But I'm also excited to have some new experiences in my life. So yes, mixed feelings.""

Tillman, who said he spoke to Ten Hag ahead of the transfer, added: ""It's been a good step for my career [playing for PSV]. Obviously we've won two titles, and played good in the Champions League. A great step for my career. I developed as a player and a person. I can't be grateful enough to play for PSV, in front of those fans.""

His arrival at Leverkusen follows the exit of the team's star attacker, Florian Wirtz, who joined Liverpool on June 20.

Tillman has signed a five-year contract with the Bundesliga club.

""We've gained another strong and very dangerous attacking player,"" Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes said. ""He can play in both the No. 10 and the No. 8 positions in midfield. Malik is an absolute top signing for us.""

Tillman, who was born in Nuremberg, Germany, to a German mother and American father, played through Bayern Munich's youth teams after switching from Bavarian rival SpVgg Greuther Fürth in 2015.

He was unable to establish himself in the senior team and made just seven appearances for Bayern before joining Scottish giants Rangers on loan in 2022-23. He joined PSV on loan with an option to make the move permanent the next season. PSV activated the permanent option last year.

Tillman scored 16 goals and set up five more in 34 competitive games for PSV last season.

He has 25 international caps for the U.S., with six coming at this summer's Gold Cup.

PSV Eindhoven will have one less attacking option, although Bayer Leverkusen will, for the upcoming Bundesliga season.

That's because U.S. men's national team midfielder Malik Tillman has signed with Leverkusen, it was announced on Saturday.

The 23-year-old Tillman, whose 33 goal involvements helped PSV win back-to-back Dutch Eredivisie titles in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns signed a five-year contract.

Can't wait to see you too! 👋 pic.twitter.com/yEU08i9ZXw

The 23-year-old attacker's arrival follows Florian Wirtz's transfer to defending English Premier League champions Liverpool on 20 June.

“This club has always played great football,” Tillman said, according to Bundesliga.com. “In the last four or five years, Leverkusen have grown enormously and become attractive to a lot of players throughout Europe. I want to win something. That was my aim in Glasgow and in Eindhoven and it remains my aim here.”

Tillman, one of the USMNT standouts during its recent run as Concacaf Gold Cup runners-up, has scored three goals in 25 international appearances.

Born in Nuremberg, Tillman spent eight years in the Bayern Munich system, playing for the record champions' various youth teams before making his professional debut and scoring his first senior club goal in the 2021-22 season.

He made seven first-team appearances for Bayern before he was loan to Glasgow Rangers, recording 12 goals and five assists in 43 matches across all competitions during the 2022-23 Scottish Premiership season.

Tillman was loaned out to PSV the following campaign, with the move made permanent after he contributed nine goals and 10 assists to PSV's 2023-24 league title. He contributed another 14 goal involvements in the 2024-25 season, as well as four in the UEFA Champions League.

The ESPN FC crew look ahead to the Club World Cup final between Chelsea and PSG. (1:39)

It's the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, and Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea will battle it out at MetLife Stadium for the honor of becoming the first winner of the 32-team tournament.

After a monthlong competition in the United States, which has at times been overshadowed by low attendance, weather-enforced delays and extreme heat, as well as the pre-tournament concerns of player burnout, either UEFA Champions League winners PSG or Premier League giants Chelsea will emerge as world champions this weekend.

Luis Enrique's PSG have already won Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and Champions League this year, while Enzo Maresca's Chelsea are aiming to become the first club to win every major honor, having completed the European set with their UEFA Conference League win in May, by lifting the Club World Cup trophy. So how will it play out at MetLife, and who are the players to watch out for on Sunday?

PSG are the undisputed best team in the world right now. Their 5-0 Champions League final win against Inter Milan in Munich was the biggest winning margin for a team becoming champions of Europe, and they've reached the final of this competition by blowing away Real Madrid in a 4-0 semifinal victory that could, and should, have ended with a heavier defeat for the LaLiga giants.

So, when you consider that Chelsea secured Champions League qualification via the Premier League only on the final day of the 2024-25 season before winning the Conference League, UEFA's third-tier competition, the two teams are miles apart on paper. But Maresca's team has grown into the competition, and Chelsea are just 90 minutes away from becoming world champions.

PSG should win, but Chelsea have shown that they know how to get the job done, so this game will be closer than many expect.

PSG have been the outstanding team of the Club World Cup, recording wins against fellow European heavyweights Atlético Madrid (4-0), Bayern Munich (2-0) and Real Madrid (4-0) to make it to the final. They haven't been invincible, though.

A 1-0 defeat against Copa Libertadores champions Botafogo in the group stage showed that PSG could be beaten, although Luis Enrique may point to his team being without star players Ousmane Dembélé, João Neves, Fabián Ruiz and Marquinhos for that game.

PSG's consistent performance in the Champions League throughout the four-year qualification period for the Club World Cup secured their place in the tournament, but their Champions League final success against Inter Milan in May confirmed their status as the team to beat in the U.S. They have lived up to that billing so far, and Luis Enrique even had the luxury of substituting Dembélé, Ruiz, Désiré Doué and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the second half of the semifinal win against Real to conserve their energy for the final.

Chelsea needed a win in their final group game against Esperance Sportive de Tunis to reach the knockout stages after a 3-1 defeat against Flamengo put their progression at risk. Since reaching the round of 16, though, Chelsea have had luck on their side in terms of enjoying a favorable route to the final.

Bayern's surprise group-stage loss to Benfica meant that Chelsea avoided the Bundesliga giants and faced the Portuguese team in the round of 16. eventually winning 4-1 after extra time in Charlotte, North Carolina. Chelsea then defeated Brazilian teams Palmeiras (2-1) and Fluminense (2-0) to secure a clash against PSG in the final.

Chelsea earned their Club World Cup spot by virtue of winning the Champions League in 2021 -- the start of the four-year qualification period -- but their absence from Europe's top club competition for the past two years highlights how the Stamford Bridge team sneaked into the tournament by its achievements under a different coach and ownership group four years ago.

Where do you start with PSG? They are a team of outstanding individual talent, but their success lies in all of those players being willing and able to match their talent with supreme work rate and team ethic.

Dembélé is the star player in Luis Enrique's team, though, and the France forward is now the clear favorite to win this year's Ballon d'Or. The 28-year-old has scored 35 goals and registered 14 assists in 52 appearances for PSG this season, and has dispelled all previous doubts over his ability to stay fit and reach his potential.

He had a tough 5-½ seasons at Barcelona following a big-money move from Borussia Dortmund in 2018, but since moving to Paris in 2023, Dembélé has lived up to all of the hype.

Even if Chelsea can stop Dembélé, though, they will then have to stop Kvaratskhelia and Doué on the wings, or somehow overpower the midfield of Ruiz, Vitinha and Neves. And then there are the two fullbacks, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes, who are the best in the world at their position right now.

Until two weeks ago, it was all about Cole Palmer for Chelsea. When the former Manchester City forward plays well, he usually scores and Chelsea tend to win.

But while Palmer, 23, is still the man who can take Maresca's team to another level, £55 million summer signing João Pedro has arrived to share the load with Palmer and give Chelsea a sharper cutting edge up front. The former Brighton & Hove Albion forward said he was ""on the beach"" in Brazil when the Chelsea deal was done halfway through the tournament, but he made an immediate impact by scoring twice against former team Fluminense in the semifinal.

With Chelsea also adding former Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap and ex-Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens to their squad this summer, Maresca has plenty of attacking options, but the players who could hurt PSG are Palmer and João Pedro.

One key element for Chelsea is the fitness of midfielder Moisés Caicedo, who limped out of the semifinal with an ankle injury. If he is unfit to face PSG, that will make stopping their midfield unit almost impossible.

Luis Enrique's PSG play a 4-3-3 formation that is built around their midfield axis of Neves, Vitinha and Ruiz. The challenge for Maresca will be about how Chelsea can disrupt that midfield, especially as his 4-2-3-1 formation will leave the Blues outnumbered in the center of the pitch.

PSG are so strong in the midfield area that Maresca will almost certainly have to tweak his system to be able to compete with the European champions. PSG keep the ball so well that it would be incredibly risky if Maresca sticks with his two-man midfield -- a risk that will be exacerbated if Caicedo fails to overcome his injury.

But it is not just about stopping PSG in midfield. Their attacking fullbacks Hakimi and Mendes, in tandem with wingers Doué and Kvaratskhelia, will make life incredibly tough for Chelsea's Marc Cucurella and Reece James. Both Cucurella and James like to attack, but they will have to stay back to nullify PSG's threat out wide.

Luis Enrique was happy to see Kylian Mbappé leave PSG a year ago, when the forward ran down his contract to join Real Madrid as a free agent. The manager tried and failed to make Mbappé work harder for the team -- the failure was probably on Mbappé's part rather than Luis Enrique's -- so his departure was regarded as no great loss because it enabled the coach to build a team of players who work incredibly hard for the side.

Julien Laurens reacts to Ousmane Dembélé's performances at the Club World Cup.

That is the beauty of this PSG team. They can be mesmerizing to watch with their passing and dribbling, but it is all built on the rock-solid foundation of teamwork.

At halftime in the semifinal, FIFA produced a stat that showed that Madrid's average ball recovery time was 45 seconds. PSG's number was 23.

In a nutshell, that said everything. The best team in the world was working twice as hard as its opponents. That's why PSG are so good.

This is such a tough challenge for Chelsea. If you had to pick a combined team from the two sides, it would be difficult to justify selecting any Chelsea player ahead of his PSG counterpart.

But football can be, and often is, unpredictable, so Chelsea have a puncher's chance on Sunday.

If they are to win, they will need to score early and then outrun Luis Enrique's team in every department. They will also have to win the midfield battle.

Enzo Fernandez talks about the playing conditions at the Club World Cup ahead of the final between Chelsea and PSG.

Mistakes at the back have been an issue for Chelsea, especially in goal, but they will have to cut out all the lapses of concentration to have a hope of winning the game. Even if they do all of the above, they still will need a moment of genius from Palmer or João Pedro.

Sounds almost impossible, right? That's the challenge facing Chelsea, but they still have a chance.

It has to be PSG. They are, by some distance, the best team in the world right now. They might even be the best side since Pep Guardiola's great Barcelona team of 2009 through 2011.

In three games against strong European opposition at this tournament, PSG have scored 10 goals and conceded none, and Chelsea are not as strong as the Atlético, Bayern and Madrid sides that PSG have beaten. Chelsea are a young team led by a young coach, and they are still a work in progress, so it could be a very difficult afternoon on Sunday.

But those are the levels in a Club World Cup final, and PSG are in a league of their own, so they will win, and they will win comfortably.

NEW YORK – Does President Donald Trump love soccer? FIFA president Gianni Infantino believes so.  

Trump and Infantino have built a close relationship, showcased after several visits made by Infantino to the White House in the last year. FIFA also opened a new office inside Trump Tower this week during the Club World Cup.

Infantino said their friendship sparked when he saw a soccer net outside a window during his first visit to the White House in Trump's first presidency. They bonded when Trump told him his youngest son, Barron, loves the sport.  

“He explained to me his son loved football. And of course, when you're parents, you love what your children love. So, I would think he loves [soccer],” Infantino said during a press briefing at Trump Tower on Saturday, July 12, before the Club World Cup final. 

FINAL TICKETS:Prices slashed for PSG vs. Chelsea Club World Cup showdown

Infantino further explained his connection with Trump derives from needing government support from the United States to run the Club World Cup this summer and the World Cup next summer, which will be co-hosted with Canada and Mexico.  

“He embraced immediately the importance of the FIFA Club World Cup, and the World Cup next year,” Infantino said of Trump.  

“He established a White House task force chaired by himself, which we all participate because events like the Club World Cup and World Cup are a huge, huge, huge events with 100s of thousands of people coming (into the country), going out (of the country), traveling to games.  

“You cannot even think about organizing an event like this … such a competition without the full engagement and full support of the government.” 

Infantino says Trump will attend the Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, July 13.  

Reigning Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will face English side Chelsea in the match to conclude the tournament, which has faced steep criticism.  

While photos of empty seats at NFL-sized stadiums went viral on social media, Infantino said nearly 2.5 million fans attended Club World Cup matches. Infantino said fans from 168 countries attended matches. 

“I prefer to put 35,000 people in an 80,000-seat stadium than 20,000 in a 20,000-seat stadium,” Infantino said. 

FIFA's president said the Club World Cup has also generated “almost $2.1 billion in revenue"" and that the tournament has had 20 million viewers globally thanks to a broadcasting partnership with DAZN.

Infantino emphasized FIFA's claim that it will not pocket any of the revenue, instead re-investing the funds back into soccer clubs globally.  

The Club World Cup winner will earn $40 million, while the runner-up gets $30 million as part of a $1 billion prize pool for the tournament. Another $250 million will be made as solidarity payments to teams around the world.  

Still, Infantino is aware FIFA has work to do to ensure the World Cup – which will be held from June 11 to July 19, 2026 – will be a success.  

One contentious point was the weather, with players and teams playing in temperatures higher than 90 degrees during afternoon matches played at noon or 3 p.m. to satisfy primetime viewing windows elsewhere in the world.

“Of course, the heat is an issue. … We need to look at what we can do better (next year) in America,” Infantino said. “We also have stadiums that are covered and we need to use these stadiums more in the day. These are questions that we have to study. 

“We can improve. We have to improve. And we will improve,” Infantino added.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Paris Saint Germain manager Luis Enrique praises Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup final. (0:47)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said stadiums with roofs will be used to ease concerns over severe weather at the 2026 Men's World Cup after criticism over players being exposed to extreme heat during the Club World Cup in the United States.

Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will meet Chelsea in Sunday's Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, in a game that will kickoff at 3 p.m. local time, with forecasts of 84° Fahrenheit (28.8° Celsius) when the match begins.

Tuesday's semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife saw the temperature rise to 96° Fahrenheit (35.5° Celsius) at kick-off, while global players' union FIFPRO has said that three games during the tournament should have been delayed or postponed due to excessive heat.

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández has urged FIFA to reassess the schedule for next year's World Cup, saying the heat made him ""dizzy"" and was ""very dangerous.""

But with thunderstorms also leading to some games being suspended for long periods, Infantino said that more games at the 2026 World Cup will now be staged in covered stadiums -- venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver have roofs and air-conditioning -- to mitigate against the daytime heat and climate issues.

""Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyse what can do better,"" Infantino told reporters at a media conference in New York.

""Of course the heat is an issue. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, games during the day, in all sports, took place in very hot conditions.

""Cooling breaks are very important and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year.""

Infantino and FIFA have been criticised by players and coaches for the decision to stage a 32-team summer Club World Cup.

But the FIFA president defended the tournament and said some European teams who failed to qualify asked to be invited.

""I've been speaking to teams from Europe who came here and all have been very happy,"" he said. ""And some teams from Europe who didn't qualify called us at FIFA and asked if they could participate.

""Of course [we] would love Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham, AC Milan and Barcelona here, but there is a qualifying criteria.

""We will see what the future will bring us. We will make this better, we have had criticisms and we must do better.

""Should the country limits be two or four teams? There are many elements we can think about. For now, we go ahead again with this in 2029 and we will see.

""I respect everyone and every opinion of everyone. I had my own opinion before the tournament and this opinion has become even stronger now.

""It has been a huge, huge, huge success and the golden era of football has started.""

Infantino, who speaking at Trump Tower in Manhattan, confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the final in New Jersey on Sunday.

""President Trump will be at the final,"" he said. ""He loves soccer. In his first term as President there was a soccer goal in the White House garden.

""President Trump is the President of the U.S., one of the host countries for the World Cup, and he embraced immediately the Club World Cup as well.

""Events like these are huge events. You can't stage tournaments like this without his support.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","FIFA president Infantino says Club World Cup is 'world's most successful competition'","https://www.flashscore.com/news/soccer-fifa-club-world-cup-fifa-president-infantino-says-club-world-cup-is-world-s-most-successful-competition/EZlsmkPN/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:06:47 GMT","

The first 32-team edition of the tournament faced criticism in the build-up for stretching demands on elite players and has been played out in baking temperatures in the United States that have raised concerns for the health of those involved.

There were also doubts about the level of interest the competition would generate among fans but Infantino said he was satisfied with the attendances at matches - despite many games being far from sold out - and claimed it had been a major success financially.

""The golden age of club football has started. We can definitely say this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge success,"" Infantino told reporters at Trump Tower on New York City's Fifth Avenue, where FIFA has just opened an office.

""We heard that financially it would not work, that nobody is interested, but I can say we generated almost 2.1 billion dollars in revenues, for 63 matches,"" he said.

""That makes an average of $33 million per match - no other club competition in the world comes close.

""It is already the most successful club competition in the world.""

Former Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has been one of the leading voices against the tournament, calling it ""the worst idea ever implemented in football"" in a recent interview.

But the head of world football's governing body dismissed suggestions that Klopp might be speaking for most observers in Europe.

""We shouldn't say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it is not true,"" said Infantino, who was appearing on a stage alongside numerous footballing greats including the Brazilian Ronaldo.

""All the teams who have come here have been happy - some teams who didn't come here because they didn't qualify were calling us to see how they could qualify.

""Of course I would have liked to have Liverpool here, Arsenal, Manchester United, Barcelona, Tottenham, AC Milan, Napoli... but you have to qualify and there are different criteria.""

The next Club World Cup is due to take place in 2029, with Infantino refusing to commit when asked whether the tournament could be played every two years or be expanded to feature more teams.

""We created something new, something which is here to stay, something which is changing the landscape of club football,"" he added.

                Captain Reece James has lavished praise on the midfield duo of Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo ahead of the final of the FIFA Club World Cup.
            

We're only days away from the showpiece event as we bid to become global champions at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, and Reece is looking forward to testing himself against current European champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Tickets are still available for our Club World Cup final so come and support the Blues by clicking here

He knows that the Blues will be in a much better position to take on the Parisians with our midfield dynamos Enzo and Caicedo available. The pair have been crucial to our success this season, with the Argentine enjoying his best spell statistically for goals and assists this campaign, while Moises' performances earned him the club's Player of the Year award.





Speaking about the qualities his two team-mates bring to the side, Reece is excited for the world to see them on full display on Sunday afternoon.

‘They are two phenomenal players,' James began, speaking during his pre-match press conference for the final.

‘They are up there with the best midfielders in the world. I think that will be clear on Sunday.

‘Enzo Fernandez is an amazing player and person. He's come on so much since he arrived at Chelsea, and he's a huge part of Chelsea Football Club. He's a huge player for our team, and they'll both play a big part on Sunday.'





Even with that pair adding their considerable talents for the Blues, coming up against the current UEFA Champions League holders will be no easy task, but Reece is hopeful that Chelsea will show our own talent. 

‘We expect a tough game,' Reece added. ‘PSG are an amazing team, but we also have an amazing team and we will surprise a lot of people. We have come a long way in our journey from where we started.

‘It's two great young sides playing against each other on the biggest stage, so I believe we will go toe-to-toe.'

Tickets are available to see our Club World Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey and can be purchased from FIFA here. You can also watch the game live anywhere in the world via DAZN by signing up for free here.

Real Madrid center back Raúl Asencio has acknowledged he fell short of expectations in the team's Club World Cup run this summer.

A defensive injury crisis plagued Xabi Alonso's squad in the United States. Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba and Éder Militão were all injured in the opening stages, leaving the new manager with just Asencio and new signing Dean Huijsen as senior center-back options.

In the face of such a significant opportunity to impress Alonso, Asencio endured a nightmare tournament. He conceded a penalty and was hooked at half-time of the 1–1 draw with Al Hilal, before earning a straight red card just seven minutes into the group game against Pachuca.

Suspended against RB Salzburg and benched to take on Juventus, Asencio managed five minutes as a late substitute in the quarterfinal win over Borussia Dortmund, but he was then restored to the starting lineup for the semifinal against Paris Saint-Germain.

In his hour on the pitch, Asencio was guilty of an error which led to an early goal for PSG, although he was by no means the only player to disappoint in the humbling 4–0 defeat.

It was a bitterly disappointing end to a breakout season at Madrid from Asencio, who took to social media to apologize for his performances at the Club World Cup.

“Madridistas, a season in which I have fulfilled my dream of being part of the best club in the world is ending but it has ended in the way I least wanted,” Asencio wrote on Instagram. “I feel like I haven't been up to it in a demanding Club World Cup but now it's time to disconnect and recharge.

“Wishing you a happy holiday and now and always, HALA MADRID! Counting down the days until the return to the Bernabéu.”

Asencio faces a battle to retain his starting spot at the start of the new season. Militão caught the eye in his brief return from injury this summer and may be the favorite to start alongside Huijsen, particularly as Rüdiger still has one game left on his six-match suspension issued towards the end of last season.

Millions of fans. Sixty-three matches. Thirty-two teams from six confederations. Twelve host stadiums. A $1 billion prize pool.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup reached unprecedented heights as the prestigious international tournament unfolded across the United States this summer.

""I think the Club World Cup has been an incredible success and a proud moment for everyone involved in soccer across North America,"" said Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber.

""Gianni Infantino had a bold vision, and FIFA delivered a remarkable event. This was a defining moment for the sport.

""I'm proud of how our country showed up at every level for the Club World Cup. A lot of the future growth in global soccer is happening right here in the United States and across North America. The Club World Cup showcased that.""

MLS had three entrants in the expanded tournament, as Inter Miami CF, LAFC and Seattle Sounders FC competed against world-class opponents.

Led by Lionel Messi, Inter Miami became the first MLS club to reach the Club World Cup knockout rounds after going undefeated in Group A. Along the way, a 2-1 victory over Portuguese giants FC Porto made the Herons the first North American club to beat a European team in an official competition.

And while Seattle and LAFC didn't advance from their groups, they turned heads throughout, especially in respective matchups with finalists Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

""The beauty of the Club World Cup is that our teams had the chance to go head-to-head with some of the best clubs in the world – and they held their own,"" Garber said.

“Research tells us that our fans measure MLS by how our teams perform against top clubs. These matches raise the profile of MLS and show that our teams belong in the global soccer conversation.""

The event also offered a preview of what awaits next year, when the United States, Mexico and Canada co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That expanded tournament will feature 48 countries, and again include MLS venues and cities in the global spotlight.

""The Club World Cup proved that North America can be the global epicenter for soccer,"" Garber said. ""It was the perfect lead-in to next summer's World Cup.""

""I have no doubt that North America will rise to the occasion next summer. The World Cup will be the most spectacular sporting event in our country's history and will serve rocket fuel for everyone involved in soccer across this region.""

As for a future Club World Cup in the United States, Garber hopes that's possible.

""I'd love to see the Club World Cup return to the United States,"" said Garber. ""I'm not sure what FIFA's plans are, but this was a huge moment for soccer in our country – and a major moment for Major League Soccer with three teams competing.

""If the tournament returns, I'd like to see even more MLS clubs involved.""","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

MetLife Stadium will host not only some of the world's best football players in the Club World Cup final this weekend, but also arguably the planet's most famous and polarising person.

Fresh off the announcement that FIFA, world football's governing body and the organiser of this tournament, has opened an office a few miles from the New Jersey venue inside New York City's Trump Tower, Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th president of the United States, has taken another step in strengthening his association with FIFA counterpart Gianni Infantino by confirming his attendance at Sunday's final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

A year out from the best men's national teams coming to the U.S., Canada and Mexico for the World Cup, Trump and his office are eager to be front and centre in a country long seen as the world's favourite sport's final frontier. The president to set to be involved with the trophy presentation on Sunday, according to people familiar with the planning who were not authorised to speak publicly.

U.S. vice-president JD Vance was at Cincinnati's TQL Stadium to watch Borussia Dortmund of Germany beat South Korean side Ulsan 1-0 in the Club World Cup last month. In Vance's home state of Ohio, U.S. Secret Service members bolstered a tiny crowd of 8,239, surveying the 26,000-seat venue and surrounding areas for any threat to a man who ranks first in the country's presidential line of succession.

“We were checked by strict security,” said Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac in the post-match press conference. “When we left the hotel, we were given a sniff test by a dog. When we got into the stadium, someone came onto the bus with another dog. That's completely normal. It's a World Cup. They are high-level people, so I think it's normal, but it was relatively tight.”

On Sunday, security measures will be further enhanced, as security teams, stadium staff, event organisers, and the Secret Service are tasked with keeping Trump protected at the 82,500-capacity stadium in the state of New Jersey, situated approximately five miles west of Manhattan. At an open-air rally in Pennsylvania on the very same date last year, Trump was shot at and wounded in his right ear, while security personnel also have to be mindful of anything that would “embarrass the principal”.

“I'm not going to say it's going to be the worst thing that the protection detail has worked on, but they don't like it,” says Michael Evanoff, global chief security officer of the U.S. security technology company Verkada and former assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. “You're going into a venue, but who knows? People can throw something… The pie in the face, right? That or throwing fake blood or anything that would embarrass the principal.”

“With a sitting president of the United States, everything is different,” adds an industry source with experience hosting political figures, royalty and major celebrities for a world-leading stadium owner and event company, kept anonymous to protect relationships. “No one else will come with such a huge Secret Service and national military presence.”

When providing personal security to a prominent public figure at a major event such as a Club World Cup final, preparation begins well in advance of matchday.

“We appoint a security advance party, which will proceed before the event and conduct a detailed reconnaissance of the venue, liaising with venue staff and security to assess the existing security measures,” says Jordan McGrath, co-founder of VIS Protection, a private security firm with experience of working with top-end Forbes World Billionaires List members.

“You'll speak to venue staff about your plan and how they can help you and your team with entry and exits. With big crowds around, you must have contingency plans for vehicles ready outside and emergency vehicle access. It's a big operation, particularly for big sporting events.”

Ideally, private security firms, or the Secret Service in Trump's case, would be notified months in advance of the proposed public appearance, so their preparations for the event can be as thorough as possible.

“Mass gatherings present a complex and dynamic threat environment,” says Steven Rice, who worked for 27 years at the U.S. Department of State. He was deputy assistant director for intelligence and threat analysis, and also had extensive postings in China and the Middle East. “Planning and site familiarity are key to controlling the environment — designating primary and alternate arrival/departure locations, potential attack sites, safe rooms, and evacuation plans.

“Robust communications, counter-surveillance, and perimeter and access control are a must — large crowds mean reduced manoeuvrability, limited escape routes and elevated risk of concealment for potential attackers. Coordinated emergency response plans need to be integrated across agencies and validated before gameday.”

However, given the often impulsive nature of such ultra-high-net-worth individuals, these decisions can be made on a whim, prompting a rapid response from security agencies.

“You have to be prepared for every eventuality. I'm currently working with a client who is one of the world's wealthiest individuals,” says McGrath. “They can be on the runway in one of their planes, and suddenly everything changes. In an instant, you're told you're going somewhere else and not getting on that plane. You have to be ready to adapt.”

In Trump's case, the Secret Service would then be in communication with emergency services, stadium personnel and private security agencies at the event to conduct the most comprehensive checks possible given the time constraints.

As MetLife Stadium is one of the nation's flagship sporting arenas (it hosted an NFL Super Bowl in 2014 and will stage the World Cup final next July), it will already have detailed practices in place that consider transportation, the stadium's layout, and Trump's position when he watches the match.

“Having had experience of working with the Secret Service, they like to have control themselves,” says Nigel Thomas, a former British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier and founder of Blue Mountain Group, a security training and advisory firm. “They like to keep information very tight. They carry out their own risk assessment.

“They have a huge team in cyber-security and physical security. They will search the stadium with sniffer dogs for anything from drugs to explosives. They would want searches done on the security teams and a background check, so they don't leave any stone unturned.”

Once the Secret Service has established the route and motorcade for Trump's journey to the stadium, the next requirement is to find a suitable place for him to sit, which is not always straightforward. Some private-security agencies would endeavour to secure the suites on either side of the one that their VIP will be using to act as buffers, but this is a FIFA event, so the governing body has more control. It is anticipated that Trump will sit with Infantino, senior officials from PSG and Chelsea, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, whom the president met in Doha in May.

FIFA typically reserves a significant portion of premium suites and VIP lounges for its partners and sponsors, which means that some areas of the stadium may be set aside and not offered to regular-season suite holders. This is typical practice for major sporting events, such as the World Cup, the Olympics or leagues' all-star games, where the competition falls outside a stadium or arena's typical event offerings.

Once Trump and his immediate entourage arrive on Sunday, staff at MetLife may halt traffic around the entrance being used to ensure his motorcade can enter safely. They will then go into the stadium itself with their armed private security.

Most stadiums and arenas in the United States use metal detectors, but given the heightened security risk on this occasion with a president in attendance, the Secret Service may arrive before the event and replace the existing apparatus with their own around the stadium, according to our industry source.

“For the president, there will probably be a bullet-resistant-glass setup,” says Evanoff. “Even though there's not supposed to be any weapons there, they're not taking any chances by not doing that. You've seen him in front of bullet-resistant glass before. It's just tough because, at the same time, protecting an individual is a science.

“The Secret Service and my old organisation at diplomatic security have refined this to a real science. And with the loss of the Hortmans, with the attack on Governor Shapiro, this concept of executive protection is at the top of everybody's mind right now. Bringing a protectee into a venue, hopefully a screened venue, to sit them in an environment where you really don't know who's in the crowd — other than everybody's been screened — is serious.”

The operation will be made even more difficult as Trump has given advance notice he will be there.

“Public knowledge increases risk,” says Rice. “Announced appearances give adversaries time to plan, conduct surveillance, and exploit vulnerabilities. Public figures attract crowds, complicating protective movement and increasing the chance of disruptions. Announced visits narrow planning options and heighten the threat environment. Layered defences, robust intelligence monitoring, and visible deterrence are critical.”

Then, once the VIP is in their seat, the task switches to providing the most seamless experience possible, even if the security staff are on high alert.

“While they're in, you're still thinking, ‘If this vehicle breaks down, what's my backup? If that road is closed, what's my alternative?',” says Thomas. “You're ensuring the drivers are prepared, fed, and watered. That's going on without the VIP knowing.”

Most of the time, the VIP experiences the event without any major hiccups and, as far as they are aware, everything goes smoothly.

But what happens if something does go wrong?

“These security teams provide people from backgrounds where they have experienced so many challenges, whether from working as police or military officers,” Thomas says. “When you do the threat and risk assessment, you cover anything that could go wrong: if they were at a mass gathering, what if the stage collapsed? We will have a standard operating procedure for that, for example. You need to be prepared for it, and that takes communication with stadium security and emergency services.

“If there were to be a catastrophic event involving the whole stadium, everyone would need to know our procedures for keeping the VIP safe while a mass of people are trying to escape. It's a huge operation, and things do go wrong, so it takes experience.”

Paris Saint Germain manager Luis Enrique praises Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup final. (0:47)

FIFA president Gianni Infantino said stadiums with roofs will be used to ease concerns over severe weather at the 2026 Men's World Cup after criticism over players being exposed to extreme heat during the Club World Cup in the United States.

Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain will meet Chelsea in Sunday's Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, in a game that will kickoff at 3 p.m. local time, with forecasts of 84° Fahrenheit (28.8° Celsius) when the match begins.

Tuesday's semifinal between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife saw the temperature rise to 96° Fahrenheit (35.5° Celsius) at kick-off, while global players' union FIFPRO has said that three games during the tournament should have been delayed or postponed due to excessive heat.

Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández has urged FIFA to reassess the schedule for next year's World Cup, saying the heat made him ""dizzy"" and was ""very dangerous.""

But with thunderstorms also leading to some games being suspended for long periods, Infantino said that more games at the 2026 World Cup will now be staged in covered stadiums -- venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Vancouver have roofs and air-conditioning -- to mitigate against the daytime heat and climate issues.

""Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyse what can do better,"" Infantino told reporters at a media conference in New York.

""Of course the heat is an issue. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, games during the day, in all sports, took place in very hot conditions.

""Cooling breaks are very important and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year.""

Infantino and FIFA have been criticised by players and coaches for the decision to stage a 32-team summer Club World Cup.

But the FIFA president defended the tournament and said some European teams who failed to qualify asked to be invited.

""I've been speaking to teams from Europe who came here and all have been very happy,"" he said. ""And some teams from Europe who didn't qualify called us at FIFA and asked if they could participate.

""Of course [we] would love Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham, AC Milan and Barcelona here, but there is a qualifying criteria.

""We will see what the future will bring us. We will make this better, we have had criticisms and we must do better.

""Should the country limits be two or four teams? There are many elements we can think about. For now, we go ahead again with this in 2029 and we will see.

""I respect everyone and every opinion of everyone. I had my own opinion before the tournament and this opinion has become even stronger now.

""It has been a huge, huge, huge success and the golden era of football has started.""

Infantino, who speaking at Trump Tower in Manhattan, confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the final in New Jersey on Sunday.

""President Trump will be at the final,"" he said. ""He loves soccer. In his first term as President there was a soccer goal in the White House garden.

""President Trump is the President of the U.S., one of the host countries for the World Cup, and he embraced immediately the Club World Cup as well.

""Events like these are huge events. You can't stage tournaments like this without his support.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Audio By Carbonatix

Soccer players like Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea are very concerned about the heat at the World Cup next summer. They struggled with the high temperatures and humidity at the Club World Cup this year so they are asking FIFA to reconsider its schedule for 2026.

The solution is very simple if you ask me!

This narrative about the upcoming World Cup first came to exist at the end of June. International soccer clubs from all over the world traveled to the United States to play the Club World Cup. They just so happened to arrive right in the middle of a massive heatwave. Temperatures spiked well above 80º, 90º and even 100º during the group stage. It was even hotter in the sun with the humidity.

South American clubs did not seem to have a huge issue with the weather. The same cannot be said for the Europeans. Borussia Dortmund hid its entire bench in the locker room to avoid the heat in… Ohio. Juventus players were literally begging their gaffer to sub them off during their match in Miami.

It very quickly became clear that the extreme heat across the United States is going to create legitimate issues for European national teams at the World Cup in 2026. They don't know how to handle it.

Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea is the latest player to voice his worries for next summer.

Honestly, the heat is incredible. Honestly, I don't know how to explain it. The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.

Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.

He also asked FIFA to reevaluate the upcoming tournament.

Let's hope that next year they change the schedule. At least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?

FIFA moved the last World Cup to November because of the heat in Qatar. Should they do the same for North America?

Six host venues at the 2026 World Cup could be an issue. Atlanta, Dallas and Houston are domed so that is not a problem. Kansas City, Miami, Monterrey, Philadelphia, Foxborough and Guadalajara are not. Extreme temperatures might be a factor during those matches like they were at the Club World Cup.

However, the most prominent temperature issues this year came during a heat wave. It really is not that bad when it is just regular hot. That would be a very lucky break.

Stu Holden also pointed to the different temperatures at different international and domestic cities on the some day Fernandez made his scathing comments. They were fairly standard across the board.

Honestly— enough of the “USA conditions aren't safe for players”. Where do you want to play it Enzo? Here is a graphic showing the current temperatures in NYC, London, Paris, and Madrid. (BTW that temp is at night in Europe and 3 PM EST in NYC).

Mind you, it is ignorant to pretend like 82º in Paris feels anything like 82º in Miami. I am not going to discount the humidity. I know 84º in New York was considered a fairly tepid summer day. The odds are that it will not be that “cool” during the World Cup.

And yet, the solution is simple. Much like the MLS, matches should be scheduled according to venue.

A match played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be air conditioned. It can be played at any hour of the day without issue. Put those matches during the peak of daylight.

A match played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami will be hot during the day. Put those matches late in the evening or after sunset. It won't be as hot.

I am not in a position to make these decisions nor will I ever. FIFA is probably going to do whatever makes the most sense for its television broadcast partners and for its financial gain. The solution is just so simple!","{'href': 'https://brobible.com', 'title': 'BroBible'}","soccer"

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández heads into Sunday's Club World Cup final wary of the weather, along with Paris Saint-Germain.

“Honestly, the heat is incredible,” Fernandez said Friday. “The other day I got a little dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature in very dangerous.”

FIFA slashed ticket prices again ahead of the final, as it has throughout the tournament.

Chelsea and PSG play starting at 3 p.m. EDT in MetLife Stadium, also site of next year's World Cup final. Because of the heat, Fernandez recommended FIFA avoid afternoon kickoffs at the 2026 tournament.

“The speed of the game is not the same,” he said. “Everything becomes very slow. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle.”

Temperature at kickoff is forecast to be 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) with humidity that will make it feel like 91 F (33 C).

“The game will be harder for the team that don't have the ball,” Chelsea captain Reece James said. “I think we've played in it a fair amount now, so I'd say we're slowly, slowly getting used to it.”

Both teams were allowed by FIFA not to have media availabilities on Saturday.

PSG seeks to complete a quadruple after winning Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and its first Champions League title.




Chelsea is trying for its second world championship after winning in 2021. The Blues have a fourth day of rest after beating Fluminense 2-0 on Tuesday, a day before PSG routed Real Madrid 4-0.

Lowest ticket prices dropped from $330 earlier in the week to $199.60 on Saturday.

“I agree with most of the people that they say that they are the best team in Europe, the best team in the world, and the reason why is because they are showing this — they show in France, they show in the Champions League, they are showing in this competition,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said.

PSG clinched the French league title on April 5 with six games to spare, won the French Cup on May 24 and the Champions League a week later, romping over Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.

“We really want to go grab this title and this would make it an absolutely perfect season, which would be very hard to replicate,” PSG captain Marquinhos said. “We really want to make history.”

Chelsea had a more modest season, finishing fourth in the Premier League, losing to Brighton in the fourth round of the FA Cup, to Newcastle in the fourth round of the League Cup and winning the third-tier UEFA Conference League.

“Everyone is picking up our opposition,” James said. “We are preparing right and we are going to win.”

NOTES: Maresca said winger Noni Madueke had left the team to sign elsewhere.

Millions of fans. Sixty-three matches. Thirty-two teams from six confederations. Twelve host stadiums. A $1 billion prize pool.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup reached unprecedented heights as the prestigious international tournament unfolded across the United States this summer.

""I think the Club World Cup has been an incredible success and a proud moment for everyone involved in soccer across North America,"" said Major League Soccer Commissioner Don Garber.

""Gianni Infantino had a bold vision, and FIFA delivered a remarkable event. This was a defining moment for the sport.

""I'm proud of how our country showed up at every level for the Club World Cup. A lot of the future growth in global soccer is happening right here in the United States and across North America. The Club World Cup showcased that.""

MLS had three entrants in the expanded tournament, as Inter Miami CF, LAFC and Seattle Sounders FC competed against world-class opponents.

Led by Lionel Messi, Inter Miami became the first MLS club to reach the Club World Cup knockout rounds after going undefeated in Group A. Along the way, a 2-1 victory over Portuguese giants FC Porto made the Herons the first North American club to beat a European team in an official competition.

And while Seattle and LAFC didn't advance from their groups, they turned heads throughout, especially in respective matchups with finalists Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

""The beauty of the Club World Cup is that our teams had the chance to go head-to-head with some of the best clubs in the world – and they held their own,"" Garber said.

“Research tells us that our fans measure MLS by how our teams perform against top clubs. These matches raise the profile of MLS and show that our teams belong in the global soccer conversation.""

The event also offered a preview of what awaits next year, when the United States, Mexico and Canada co-host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That expanded tournament will feature 48 countries, and again include MLS venues and cities in the global spotlight.

""The Club World Cup proved that North America can be the global epicenter for soccer,"" Garber said. ""It was the perfect lead-in to next summer's World Cup.""

""I have no doubt that North America will rise to the occasion next summer. The World Cup will be the most spectacular sporting event in our country's history and will serve rocket fuel for everyone involved in soccer across this region.""

As for a future Club World Cup in the United States, Garber hopes that's possible.

""I'd love to see the Club World Cup return to the United States,"" said Garber. ""I'm not sure what FIFA's plans are, but this was a huge moment for soccer in our country – and a major moment for Major League Soccer with three teams competing.

""If the tournament returns, I'd like to see even more MLS clubs involved.""","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Kansas City has hosted its share of major sporting events, including NCAA championship games, all-star games, four World Series and six of the last seven AFC Championship Games, but the FIFA World Cup 26 quarterfinal on July 11, 2026 — one year from Friday — will be the biggest sporting event the city's ever seen.

“You can't match the global scale,” Paul Carr, who attended the 2010 Uruguay-Ghana quarterfinal in South Africa, said. “Those events (Kansas City has hosted before) are always the biggest thing going on in the U.S. at that time, but this is the biggest thing and sporting event going on in the world.”

Carr was in South Africa working as a researcher for ESPN and said Uruguay's penalty-kick shootout win was the greatest sporting event he's ever attended.

“I've been to Final Fours, NCAA tournaments, World Series, World Cup qualifiers, etc., but there's just a united passion that you get,” he said. “... It's the biggest sporting event on the planet. It's the biggest sporting event most of these fans will ever be at or be involved in or root for, so all of that just comes out.”

KCK Community College women's soccer coach Jefferson Roblee attended the 1994 Brazil-Netherlands quarterfinal at the old Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

“The quarterfinal is a knockout game, so it's a do-or-die type situation,” he said. “You have intensity that the game means something, but it's on a global level. You also have just the energy of the game would be like a gigantic Super Bowl, World Series type of event, except for on a global level.”

Roblee attended Brazil's win en route to the World Cup title with his twin brother and some friends.

“You would have thought that you were in Brazil,” he said. “To be honest, there were a lot of Netherlands fans, but the Brazil fans seemed to just engulf the stadium. ... There were 65,000 people at the game; it felt like there were 165,000 people.”

Recent World Cup finals have drawn between 517 million and 571 million global viewers, while the typical quarterfinal draws roughly 250 million viewers around the world, which dwarfs the estimated 186.2 million people who watched the Chiefs beat San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII.

“It's like the Elite Eight in NCAA basketball or the divisional round of the NFL playoffs,” Carr said. “You have the best of the best. There's eight teams left. ... A great team, great player — someone does something in these quarterfinals, because it's the biggest stage. ... Making that jump from the quarters to the semis is legacy building for both players and teams.”

Next summer, it'll happen at Arrowhead.

The ATP Tour returns to clay and hard courts this week, with three ATP 250 events taking place.


Andrey Rublev is the highest-ranked player in action, competing at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos, a hard-court event that has shifted from its traditional February slot to July. Casper Ruud leads the field at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad and Francisco Cerundolo is the top seed at the Nordea Open in Bastad.


ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event.




FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN LOS CABOS
1) Rublev Makes Debut: The 17-time tour-level champion Rublev is set to make his Los Cabos debut as the top seed.
Rublev arrives in Baja California with a 21-15 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result being a title run at the ATP 500 in Doha.

2) Foki's Summer Heats Up: It has been a memorable few months for Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who married his longtime girlfriend Paloma Amatiste in June and then reached the Eastbourne semi-finals, followed by a third-round run at Wimbledon. The Spaniard reached two finals earlier this year, in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and now sets his sights on a maiden tour-level title in Los Cabos, where he is seeded second.

3) #NextGenATP Stars: The Mexican crowd will be in full force for home favourite Rodrigo Pacheco Mendez, the 20-year-old lefty who is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. Also in the Los Cabos field is fellow #NextGenATP contender Nishesh Basavareddy, who is sixth in the Race To Jeddah. While the American is bidding for a return to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Pacheco Mendez is chasing his maiden trip to the 20-and-under event.

4) Shapo Among Other Seeds: Third seed Denis Shapovalov brings plenty of firepower to his Los Cabos debut. Chasing his second title this season, the Canadian captured the biggest career trophy at the ATP 500 in Dallas in February. Shapovalov owns a 12-6 hard-court record this season. Fourth seed Quentin Halys and fifth seed Daniel Altmaier look to spoil the party and claim their first tour-level trophy.

5) Doumbia/Reboul Lead Doubles Field: Frenchmen Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul are the top seeds in doubles. Doumbia and Reboul are looking for their second title of the season, having triumphed in Geneva. Finalists in Acapulco earlier this year, can they go one step further this time in Mexico?







FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN GSTAAD
1) Ruud Reigns: Norwegian Casper Ruud is back in Gstaad for the first time since 2022, a warning shot to the rest of the field. The 26-year-old is unbeaten in Gstaad across two appearances, claiming the title in both 2021 and 2022. Ruud is 13-4 on clay this season, highlighted by his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Madrid. Gstaad will mark Ruud's first tournament since Roland Garros. He withdrew from Wimbledon due to a knee injury.
2) Bublik Building: Alexander Bublik has been on one of his career-best runs. The Kazakh reached his maiden Slam quarter-final at Roland Garros, followed by a title run in Halle, where he lifted his fifth tour-level crown. After a disappointing first-round exit at Wimbledon, Bublik looks to return to his winning ways as the second seed in Gstaad.
3) Home Favourites: Former No. 3 Stan Wawrinka is set for his 12th appearance in Gstaad, a tournament he first competed at in 2003. The 40-year-old, fresh off a semi-final run at the Iasi Challenger, looks to roll back the years and treat his home fans to a strong showing. Wawrinka could meet Bublik in the second round, while fellow Swiss Dominic Stricker is also in the field, with a potential second-round clash against Ruud. Swiss Jerome Kym is also in the draw.
4) #NextGenATP Pathway: Spaniard Martin Landaluce is using a Next Gen Accelerator spot to gain entry into the main draw. Players aged 20-and-under who are ranked in the Top 250 of the PIF ATP Rankings are eligible for one ATP 250 main draw spot, an effort to support young talent and their development pathway. The 19-year-old Landaluce, seeking his second tour-level win, is World No. 137.
5) Doubles Draw: Portugal's Francisco Cabral and Austrian Lucas Miedler spearhead the doubles field, which also features Stan Wawrinka playing alongside countryman Henry Bernet, this year's Australian Open boys' singles champion.





FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BASTAD
1) Top Seed Cerundolo: Francisco Cerundolo is seeking his first title of the season. The Argentine is comfortable in Bastad, having won the title in 2022. Holding a 7-2 tournament record, the 26-year-old Cerundolo reached the semi-finals in his most recent showing in 2023. Cerundolo reached a career-high No. 18 this May.
2) Defending Champ Borges: It was a memorable week for Nuno Borges last year in Bastad, where he captured his first tour-level trophy and upset 92-time tour-level titlist Rafael Nadal in the final. Borges, seeded third, looks to successfully defend the title. Borges became the second Portuguese ATP Tour titlist, joining Joao Sousa.




3) Baez Seeking More Clay Success: Sebastian Baez won the clay ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro for the second consecutive year and reached two additional finals on the surface in Santiago and Bucharest. Now returning to his favourite surface post-Wimbledon, Baez is hunting his eighth tour-level trophy. The Argentine reached the final in 2022, falling to countryman Cerundolo.
4) Other Seeds: Camilo Ugo Carabelli, Luciano Darderi, Damir Dzumhur and Vit Kopriva are seeded fifth through eight, respectively. Ugo Carabelli and Kopriva are among the seeds who are seeking their first tour-level title.
5) Doubles Top Seeds Andreozzi/Arends: Guido Andreozzi and Sander Arends are the top seeds in Bastad doubles. Romain Arneodo and Manuel Guinard are seeded second.

As Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to monopolise Grand Slam titles, it's far from a hot take to call them the heirs apparent to the Big 3. The top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings will square off in Sunday's Wimbledon final (4 p.m. BST/11 a.m. EDT), supercharging their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with a second meeting in as many Grand Slam finals.

The young superstars — Alcaraz, 22, and Sinner, 23 — have won seven of the past eight major singles trophies, evenly splitting the six on offer since the start of 2024. But rather than letting the success fuel their respective egos, the Spanish and Italian champions maintain perspective. If you equate their professional careers to a five-set match, the length of each of their past three Grand Slam meetings, both players are perhaps early in the second set.

""We are still really young,"" Alcaraz said, adding that they would need another five or 10 years of similar results ""to be at the same table"" as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

Sinner, asked what he might label himself and his Spanish rival as a cohort, had a similarly grounded response: ""No name yet, because you cannot compare what the Big 3 did for 15-plus years. Six Grand Slams are one and a half years. It's not that big yet,"" he said.



Another ""big"" debate surrounding this rivalry: Just how significant is Alcaraz's five-match winning streak (dating back to the Indian Wells 2024) and his 8-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage against the Italian? Sinner may be the runaway No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings — he will leave London with a lead of 3,430 or 2,030 points, depending on Sunday's result — but he cannot outrun Alcaraz when the Spaniard is across the net.

Alcaraz's two wins this season against Sinner (Rome, Roland Garros) are reflected in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, where he can stretch his lead to 2,940 points with the Wimbledon title. More than halfway through the 2025 season, that would be a sizable cushion in the battle for year-end World No. 1.

Sinner nearly snapped the streak at Roland Garros, but Alcaraz saved three championship points to win the instant classic, 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). The Italian played just two matches in between that defeat and Wimbledon, losing to Alexander Bublik in the Halle second round. While he said the gutting defeat has not been on his mind in London, he admitted it could flash through his head during Sunday's rematch.

Asked about any potential scar tissue from that match, Alcaraz seemed to suggest the disappointment could prove an advantage for his opponent: ""I'm pretty sure he's going to take a lot of things from the French Open final, that he's going to be better,"" said the Spaniard, who called Sinner ""a huge champion"".

""He's going to be better physically, he's going to be better mentally,"" Alcaraz continued. ""He's going to be prepared on Sunday to give his 100 per cent. I'm not thinking I have an advantage mentally Sunday because of that match.""

The tale of the tape for the Roland Garros final is similar to the outlook for their Wimbledon showdown. Alcaraz's artistic game might benefit more from the natural surface, while Sinner's ruthless efficiency is a constant threat to overwhelm the Spaniard if he is not firing on all cylinders. Outside of Sinner's favoured hard courts, Alcaraz's top level may edge Sinner's best — the dominant 10-2 fifth-set tie-break in Paris the prime example. But the Spaniard is more prone to peaks and valleys in his game.

They have met just once before on grass, in their second overall meeting in the 2022 Wimbledon fourth round, a four-set win for Sinner. Three years later, Alcaraz says he won't bother reviewing that match because they are ""completely different players"" today.

Taylor Fritz, whom Alcaraz beat 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6) in Friday's semi-finals, also played Sinner three times late in the 2024 season — albeit on hard courts, in the US Open final and twice at the Nitto ATP Finals. Sinner won all three meetings in straight sets.

Analysing the final matchup, the American pointed out Alcaraz's unpredictability as a key differentiator: ""[Sinner] is unbelievable at what he does playing from the baseline. I think Carlos is a little more unpredictable with the slicing and the coming to net and the drop shots. Carlos has a lot of different ways to play,"" he said.

Fritz also compared the movement of Alcaraz's whipped forehand with the flatter, more penetrating nature of Sinner's ground game, noting that he personally is more comfortable facing the latter.

Sinner never let Novak Djokovic get comfortable in his 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 semi-final victory, though the Serbian was physically hampered and unable to truly threaten an upset of the World No. 1. Conversely, the Italian said he had ""no concerns"" about the elbow issue that required an MRI after a fall in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov.

While Sinner was four games from defeat against Dimitrov, trailing by two sets before the Bulgarian's unfortunate pectoral injury forced him to retire, he has not lost a set in any of his five other victories this fortnight, including against a red-hot Ben Shelton in the quarters.

 Alcaraz has dropped five sets en route to the final — including two in a dramatic opening-round match against Fabio Fognini — but the Spaniard has perfected the art of peaking for the biggest matches. His 5-0 mark in major finals trails only Federer's 7-0 start in Grand Slam title matches. 

Alcaraz is also riding a career-best 24 match winning streak, dating back to his Rome title run. He has 33 victories in his past 34 matches.

🚨 THE REMATCH IS HAPPENING 🚨@janniksin will face @carlosalcaraz in the Wimbledon final on Sunday!@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JedFZHXoZL

Both players have plenty of reasons to feel confident entering Sunday's final; both will also walk onto Centre Court with a healthy dose of respect for the singular talents of the other.

It would take a brave pundit to make a prediction on this match with much conviction. When Djokovic was asked his expert opinion, the 24-time champion picked a favourite while remaining firmly on the fence.

""I think I will give a slight edge to Carlos as a favourite because of the two titles he's won here and the way he's playing and the confidence he has right now,"" said Djokovic, whose example both players hope to follow over the next decade-plus. ""But it's just a slight advantage, because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well. I think it's going to be, again, a very close matchup like we had in Paris.""

The Wimbledon final is scheduled for 4 p.m. local time (11 a.m. EDT) on Sunday in London.

Jannik Sinner says Carlos Alcaraz favourite in men's singles final at Wimbledon, won't compare rivalry to big three

Jannik Sinner played down the impact of his painful defeat against Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final as he prepared for a rematch at Wimbledon on Sunday.

The world number one crushed seven-time champion Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in under two hours on Friday to set up a title showdown against the Spanish two-time defending champion.

Alcaraz had earlier dispatched US fifth seed Taylor Swift in four sets on Centre Court.

Just weeks ago at Roland Garros, Alcaraz came back from two sets down against Sinner, saving three match points to win a fifth grand slam.

But Italy's Sinner, 23, played down the lingering impact of that loss in the aftermath of his semi-final win against Djokovic.

“I think if it would be a lot in my head, I would not be in the situation to play a final again, I guess,” he said. “I'm very happy to share once again the court with Carlos. It's going to be difficult, I know that.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Andy Roddick suggests who is the 'clear favorite' to win the Wimbledon final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/andy-roddick-suggests-who-is-the-clear-favorite-to-win-the-wimbledon-final-between-jannik-sinner-and-carlos-alcaraz/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

Andy Roddick discussed the men's Wimbledon final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

The two players won their respective semifinals at the All-England Club to set up a second successive championship match at a Grand Slam.

After Alcaraz and Sinner produced a classic battle during their French Open final, fans around the world are hoping for another titanic contest, this time with Wimbledon's Centre Court as the backdrop.

One player who is very used to those surroundings is three-time runner-up at SW19 Andy Roddick, who predicted his winner of Sunday's final.

Carlos Alcaraz reached his third successive Wimbledon final after beating Taylor Fritz in four sets.

The Spaniard's first two finals at the grass court Grand Slam came against Novak Djokovic, who he defeated on both occasions.

But this year Jannik Sinner is standing between Alcaraz and a third successive title at Wimbledon, and this will be the toughest test of the second seed's campaign as he aims to make history.

This is set to be an exciting match between the world's two best players and Roddick thinks Alcaraz is the ‘clear favourite' to take the title once again.

“I am so excited for this final. I think Alcaraz is the favourite. He is the clear favourite. I don't think that has changed since the beginning,” Roddick said via his ‘Served' podcast.

“Alcaraz looks a fluent mover on grass in the vein of Roger, Novak, prime Rafa. His feet understand what they are supposed to do with him actually having to send the conscious thoughts down to them.

“It just feels like he is in full flow. I think Sinner, it's weird, when he has to take those big cuts against a player.

“When he feels like the entire court is open I think he kind of misses them early in tournaments sometimes, he still smothers people.”

There is very little to separate Alcaraz and Sinner with how they match up against each other on court.

They both hit solid consistent groundstrokes, impressive serves and are two of the quickest and most athletic players on the tour.

But Roddick looked at certain aspects of their movement and explained how it could be a key factor of the Wimbledon final.

“The movement is the biggest piece here. The variety that Alcaraz has that you can't trip Sinner up on a hard court. If you hit a drop shot and he reads it, he is off the edge of his shoe and he is bursting,” Roddick explained.

“We have seen him on the mat numerous times. We saw Dimitrov working that slice in and out. We saw the corners, he is sliding into balls but then that recovery is not as easy after he slides into his shots.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Mumbai: Feels like yesterday, doesn't it, when Carlos Alcaraz slumped to the Roland Garros red dirt after giving us the collective high of a five-set, five-hour, five-star final for the ages with Jannik Sinner.

Perhaps you've relived its several edge-of-the-seat moments scrolling through the highlights (or reels, if you're from a certain generation). Alcaraz hasn't. Just a few points here and there, he said.

He doesn't need to. He's playing the same man at the same stage again on Sunday.

Hello, Wimbledon final – whether or not you've bid a mental goodbye to the French Open final.

“I don't know if it'll get better,” said Sinner, “because I don't think it's possible.”

The bar, indeed, after a battle that had Alcaraz wipe off a two-set deficit and three championship points to script a surreal triumph, is set sky high. As high as the two protagonists born one year apart have set in men's tennis. No one, not even a 24-time Grand Slam champion, has come close to them in Slams at the moment.

It seems fitting, therefore, that this is only the second pair in the Open era to meet in the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same season, after Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. That a 23-year-old world No.1 and a 22-year-old world No.2 have a Wimbledon title at stake. That a seventh straight major crown going back to early 2024 will carry the name of Alcaraz or Sinner.

Much of this duo-dominating dance playing its tune even at Wimbledon is down to Sinner punching above his weight in a Slam where he'd only once made a semi-final before. He's gone a step ahead, and in some style.

Sinner has dropped just 56 games on his way to the final, the fourth fewest by any man in Wimbledon history. There was an asterisk after the Grigor Dimitrov retirement escape, but a bold exclamation mark after the Novak Djokovic rout.

Signs of the growing all-court prowess of the Italian, whose three Slams have all come on hard courts, lie in him reaching the final of the last four majors, two of them on clay and grass.

Alcaraz is chasing something bigger on clay and grass: a rare double-double. The Spaniard stands one step away from capturing both the French Open and Wimbledon in consecutive years, a feat only achieved by Bjorn Borg.

The two-time defending champion is riding a 20-match win streak at Wimbledon, his genius and all-court craft proving too good for anyone taking him on.

Almost typical of Alcaraz, an unpredictable 38-year-old Italian was his trickiest obstacle over the last two weeks. After that wild Fabio Fognini opening ride though Alcaraz is back on sublime track.

The all-round game, with the deft touch and baseline power, is a trick up his sleeve on grass. What's only heightened is the serve. After issues with the ball toss hampered the quality of his serves in the early rounds, Alcaraz is happy with how he's striking them now. It surprised even Taylor Fritz, his semi-final opponent. It should come as no surprise if he keeps that up in the final, and if that proves the differentiator.

In a head-to-head record that tilts decisively towards Alcaraz (8-4) – it is 5-0 in their latest meetings – it's ironic that Sinner has won their only encounter on grass. It came at the 2022 Wimbledon, after which both players have gone different ways on grass.

That seems like a long time ago. What doesn't is the French Open final.

Both young men maintain they've moved on from that classic. Will they conjure up another?

“I just hope not to be five-and-a-half hours on court again,” Alcaraz said with a smile. “But if I have to, I will.”

The Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, returned to the tennis tournament

 Kate Middleton is back at one of her favorite summer outings: Wimbledon.


 On Saturday, July 12, the Princess of Wales, 43, stepped out at the prestigious tournament for the first time this season to see American tennis star Amanda Anisimova and Poland's Iga Swiatek compete in the women's singles final. She'll later present the champion with their trophy.


 Kate, who took her seat in the royal box at Centre Court, continued her recent streak of tailored elegance in a white belted blazer-style top and cream pleated skirt — a silhouette she also embraced earlier this week during the French state visit. As patron, Kate also wore a Wimbledon purple and green bow pinned to the left side of her top.


 That outing comes shortly after her emotional revelations about the difficulty of finding her new normal following cancer treatment.


 On July 2, Princess Kate visited Colchester Hospital in Essex, where she spoke candidly about her cancer journey.

 ""You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' "" she said. “But actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult.""


 ""You have to find your new normal and that takes time...and it's a rollercoaster, it's not smooth, like you expect it to be,"" Kate added. ""But the reality is you go through hard times.""

 Upon her arrival, Kate first congratulated women's wheelchair tennis champion Wang Ziying shortly after her straight-sets victory. She then spoke with eight-year-old Lydia Lowe, who represented the Dan Maskell Trust and performed the coin toss for the wheelchair final.

 Kate also met 12-year-old Sophie Kneen, set to do the coin toss for the women's final, along with ball boys, ball girls and honorary stewards. Crossing the bridge, she smiled and waved to hundreds of waiting fans.

 Guided by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, a former pro, Kate greeted the welcoming party and briefly chatted about their tournament experiences. She also met young people from the Work at Wimbledon program and representatives from the Wimbledon Foundation.

 Kate has regularly attended Wimbledon over the years, even before Queen Elizabeth appointed her as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2016. She has watched the tournament in person every year since she married Prince William in 2011, apart from the 2013 matches, which took place when she was ""heavily pregnant"" with Prince George and doctors advised against her attending, and when Wimbledon was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


 Princess Kate's return to Wimbledon comes after she attended the men's singles finals in July 2024, marking one of her few appearances of the year as she mainly remained out of the spotlight amid her cancer treatment. She announced in September 2024 that she had completed chemotherapy, adding a few months later in January that she was in remission.

 On July 14, 2024, the royal received a standing ovation as she made her way to her seat in the front row of the Royal Box at Centre Court, joined by her daughter, Princess Charlotte, and sister, Pippa.


 After the match, Princess Kate headed down to the court and presented Carlos Alcaraz with the winning trophy after defeating Novak Djokovic.

 The hospital visit earlier this month marked her first public outing since her surprise withdrawal from Royal Ascot on June 18. The Princess of Wales was said to be disappointed with not being able to attend Ascot this year but is determined to find the right balance as she returns back to public work amid her continued recovery.

Kate, the Princess of Wales, and other celebrities attended the Wimbledon Tennis Championships to watch Poland's Iga Swiatek shut out American Amanda Anisimova in her first game on Centre Court.

The final began at 4 p.m. local time in London, which is 11 a.m. EDT, and it lasted under an hour. Swiatek won the women's final in consecutive sets, 6-0, 6-0.

Kate, the wife of Prince William, presented the trophy to Swiatek, the winner of the women's singles final. She didn't attend the match last year while she was recovering from cancer.

KATE Middleton dazzled at Wimbledon as she handed the trophy to winner Iga Swiatek.

Swiatek was presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time after winning her match 6-0, 6-0.

The Princess then consoled runner-up Amanda Anisimova who was visibly upset by the loss.

Anisimova left the court immediately after the match in tears, while the audience gave her a standing ovation.

Kate then comforted her while she presented Anisimova with the runner-up trophy.

Anisimova was visibly trying to stop the flow of tears while Kate offered her words of reassurance.

She was followed by Iga who repeatedly thanked the Princess while she was presented with the trophy.

The game was Anisimova's first Grand Slam showpiece, increasing the pressure as she struggled to match Swiatek's ease on the court.

It is only the second time in the Open Era that a 'double bagel' [6-0, 6-0] score has been achieved in a women's match.

The other was the 1988 French Open final.

It has cemented Swiatek's position among the world tennis champions, as she has now won majors on all three surfaces - the youngest woman to do so since Serena Williams.

The beaming Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, looked classy in a white belted blazer-style and cream pleated skirt as she watched Iga Swiatek beat Amanda Anisimova in straight sets.

Kate also donned a Wimbledon purple and green bow on the left-hand side of her top.

A massive cheer went up as she smiled and waved before taking her seat in the Royal Box, with the beloved Princess getting a standing ovation.

She briefly greeted American ace Martina Navratilova, 68, as she walked along the first row of the VIP seating section.

Tennis legend and six-time Wimbledon winner Billie Jean King, 81, then curtseyed to the royal before the pair shook hands.

As she accepted the cheers from the packed 15,000 crowd, a smiley Kate waved twice – once with her left and right hands -- prompting another huge cheer.

She sat down as both Swiatek and Anisimova prepared to make their entrance to the court.

Earlier, the Princess first spoke with women's wheelchair tennis champion Wang Ziying – only moments after she won her final in straight sets.

Kate then had a lengthy chat with eight-year-old inspiration Lydia Lowe, who is representing the Dan Maskell Trust and was given the honour of doing the coin toss for the wheelchair final on Court No.1.

She also talked with Sophie Kneen, 12, who will do the coin toss for this afternoon's women's final, ball boys and girls, and honorary stewards.

The Princess, 43, then crossed the bridge, where she flashed a smile and a wave to hundreds of fans who had gathered to catch a glimpse.

Kate was guided around the grounds by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, who is a former professional player.

She shook hands with each member of the greeting party and had a brief chat about their time at the tournament so far.

In an adorable moment, beaming Princess appeared to ask young Lydia, who overcame a brain injury and had to learn how to walk again, if she had any advice for the big day.

The brave girl seemed to reply: ""Don't be nervous.""

She also met young people from the Work at Wimbledon programme and Wimbledon Foundation representatives.

Sophie, 12, is part of the foundation's women and girls inclusion project, and said of being chosen to do the coin toss: ""I'm really excited, it's always been a dream of mine to go out on Centre Court.""

Traditionally, avid tennis fan Kate watches a number of matches in the Royal Box and later present champions with their trophies at the end of the tournament.

Hundreds of spectators gathered in and around the grounds to try and catch a glimpse of the Princess as she entered Wimbledon.

She will take part in a special ceremony before moving to the best seat in the house to watch the ladies' final, which is tipped to be an all-time classic.

The  Princess of Wales and 15,000 fans on Centre Court will have to battle scorching temperatures of up to 31 degrees as the third heatwave of the summer baked Britain.

Several fans have passed out in the stands during the tournament, though bosses have rejected calls to close the Centre Court roof and turn on the air conditioning during severe temperatures.

The Women's Singles final this afternoon will see a showdown between American Amanda Anisimova, 23, and Pole Iga Swiatek, 24 — neither of whom have won in West London before.

Swiatek, one of the most successful players in recent years, has won five majors in the past and was previously the world number one.

However, this is her first Wimbledon final, having only ever made it as far as the quarter-finals in 2023.

Seeded eighth for this year's tournament, she arrived having made only one final since her French Open victory last year.

She will face off against Anisimova. Once touted as a teenage prodigy, she was a junior US Open champion in 2017 at age 16.

Her first peak was marked by a semi-final run at the 2019 French Open, but her rapid rise was soon halted and she took a four-month health break before returning to the sport last year.

She arrived at the All England Tennis Club seeded 13th.

Anisimova waved and blew kisses to the crowd earlier in the championships after securing a remarkable 6-4 4-6 6-4 victory against world number one Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court.

The Men's doubles final on Centre Court earlier today saw Aussie Rinky Hijikata, 24, and Dutch David Pel, 34, face off against Brits Julian Cash, 28, and Lloyd Glasspool, who is 31.

The Brits won to resounding cheers from the home crowd - and took a selfie to mark the occasion as the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles since 1936.

Alongside the princess in the Royal Box will be Barbie mastermind Greta Gerwig, Mo Farrah, Stanley Tucci and Billie Jean King.

Saturday

Sunday

Also present will be Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and Labour's Lisa Nandy.

Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay are also expected to be there.

Eyes will also be on the thermometers this weekend, as temperatures of up to 33 degrees could bake fans.

This afternoon's final starts at the later time of 4pm – the first time in 119 years that the match has been pushed back.

The climax to the men's and women's Championships has traditionally begun at 2pm on the finals weekend.

This year, the matches have been pushed back by two hours to maximise the TV audience in the United States, where the clash will start at 11am in New York.

All England Club officials insisted the later start will result in better crowds for the doubles finals, which now start before the singles main event.

Kate's mother-in-law Queen Camilla was also back at Wimbledon on Wednesday to watch her favourite player Novak Djokovic in action.

Princess Kate has rarely missed attending Wimbledon since marrying Prince William.

She did skip the championships in 2013 - and missed Andy Murray's first Wimbledon victory - but this was due to her being heavily pregnant with Prince George at the time.

Princess Kate used to take tennis lessons at the elite Hurlingham Club in Fulham, and even set up training sessions for Prince George with tennis legend Roger Federer.

Last year, she handed champion Carlos Alcaraz his golden cup as he retained his Wimbledon title against rival Djokovic.

Djokovic looked emotional as he trundled off following a first Wimbledon semi-final defeat for 13 years yesterday.

Physical problems had prevented him from taking this the full distance as he lost 6-3 6-3 6-4 to the outstanding Jannik Sinner.

Traditionally, the final Saturday and Sunday of the tournament has seen the women's singles final and the men's singles final respectively open play on Centre Court.

Both matches would ordinarily begin on Wimbledon's most famous stage at 2pm.

But this year, on the Saturday, the men's doubles final will open play on Centre Court at 1pm before the women's singles final at 4pm.

While Sunday's opening match will be the women's doubles final at 1pm, with the men's singles final also following at 4pm.

All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton explained that the change in schedule will allow the men's and women's finals to attract the ""largest possible worldwide audience"" with both singles finals starting at 11am ET in New York.

Bolton said: ""We have adjusted the provisional schedule for the final weekend of The Championships with the ambition of improving the experience for all involved.

""The doubles players competing in the finals will have increased certainty over their schedule and fans will enjoy each day's play as it builds towards the crescendo of the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals, with our champions being crowned in front of the largest possible worldwide audience.""

Djokovic, 22 years a pro, is still good enough to beat 98 per cent of the ATP Tour players yet against Sinner and two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz he comes up short.

Next year, he will be 39-years-old and he accepts his body is breaking down after years of playing the sport.

Even when he is fully fit, thanks to months of hard work in training, he admits he cannot find a way past the top two.

At one hour and 55 minutes, it was the shortest defeat he had experienced, aside from two mid-match SW19 retirements.

Djokovic, who slipped late on in the quarter-finals against Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday, had a medical time-out before set three.

The tennis has been plagued by blunder after blunder with its new AI this summer.

Automated calls replaced line judges at this year's tournament — with players casting doubt on the technology's accuracy.

Around 300 of the blazer- wearing officials who call “Out” and “Fault” have been axed in favour of an electronic gizmo.

Replacing them is the Hawk-Eye Challenge System which uses high-speed cameras and algorithms to track ball trajectory with pinpoint accuracy.

Voices used by the tech are from people working behind the scenes at Wimbledon, including tour guides.

The decision to adopt AI was made after a pilot at last year's tournament.

It is understood the All England Club was reluctant, but the tech has been used in other events for years.



The finals take place on a scorcher of a weekend.

Temperatures are expected to peak at 33 or even 34C today as the UK enjoys yet another spell of sunny weather.

Fifth seeds Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool capped their dream summer with the Wimbledon crown and first Grand Slam title as a pair when the British team downed Rinky Hijikata and David Pel 6-2, 7-6 (3) in the men's doubles final Saturday.

Queen's Club and Eastbourne champions Cash and Glasspool became the first all-British pairing to win the All England Club trophy since 1936, when Pat Hughes and Raymond Tuckey defeated their compatriots Charles Hare and Frank Wilde in the final.

""When you say it, it sounds incredible,"" Glasspool told the BBC. ""We've had a Brit win it last year [Henry Patten], the year before that [Neal Skupski] so I didn't think too much of it, but now we needed to give you two so we did our best.""

The local favorites shot out of the blocks after an early break thanks to a poor service game from Pel and raced through the opening set, leaving their home crowd buzzing on a sun-bathed Centre Court.

The Australian-Dutch duo of Hijikata and Pel saved a break point at the start of the second set and applied pressure in the fourth game but their opponents were equal to the task and took a step towards the title when they went 4-2 up.

Hijikata and Pel, who entered the tournament as alternates and survived match points in their first two rounds, drew level after eight games before Cash and Glasspool moved up a gear in the tiebreak to prevail and spark huge celebrations.

""We played a crazy amount of tennis on the grass, there was a lot of pressure on our shoulders,"" Cash said. ""The fact we could do it was surreal. Thank you for coming out today, the support was incredible ... This is what it's been all for. It means the world.""

""I mean it's something we spoke about going into the year [winning at Wimbledon],"" Cash said. ""A lot of people probably wouldn't have believed us. Our team backed us all the way. To do it here -- I mean it couldn't mean more. To do it on the most special court in the world? Incredible.""

Meanwhile, compatriots Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid were unable to defend their Wimbledon men's wheelchair doubles title, falling 7-6 (1), 7-5 to Martin de la Puente and Ruben Spaargaren in a gripping final.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

NEW YORK: Just as Wimbledon is winding down, action at the home of the U.S. Open will heat up. Boxing action, that is.

Swinging rackets will be replaced by swinging fists Saturday night when the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center hosts boxing for the first time.

Edgar Berlanga and Shakur Stevenson headline the show in separate bouts on the card, which sends both locally based fighters to a place they'd never visited before. The fights will be in Louis Armstrong Stadium, the No. 2 venue on the grounds.

“It's a new stadium, it's going to be a big arena, there's going to be a lot of fans there, so I'm excited to put on a show,” said Stevenson, who is from Newark, New Jersey.

Stevenson (23-0, 11 KOs) will defend his WBC lightweight title against fellow unbeaten William Zepeda (33-0, 27 KOs). Berlanga (23-1, 18 KOs) then takes on Hamzah Sheeraz (21-0-1, 17 KOs) in a super middleweight bout in the main event. Agencies

Saturday 12 July 2025 18:09, UK

Iga Swiatek dished out the first 6-0 6-0 in a Wimbledon women's singles final history since 1911 as the Pole clinched her maiden title at the All England Club.

Swiatek ended a year-long trophy drought in incredible fashion, beating American Amanda Anisimova with a 'double bagel' [a 6-0 6-0 scoreline] to become a Wimbledon champion.

It is only the second time in Wimbledon's history that a women's final has ended with the same scoreline when Dorothea Lambert Chambers beat Dora Boothby in 1911, while the only other instance at a Grand Slam came in the French Open in 1988 when Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva.

""It seems super surreal,"" Swiatek said during the trophy presentation.

""First of all I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks no matter what happened today. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and at other tournaments.

""I didn't even dream (about winning Wimbledon) because it was way too far, I feel like I'm already an experienced player after winning the slams before but I never really expected this one.""

Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam showpiece, failed to win a single game, with Swiatek racing to victory on a stunned Centre Court in only 57 minutes.

A first Grand Slam final is always a nerve-racking occasion, though, and it was obvious from the start that Anisimova was struggling to get her legs moving and her arms swinging freely.

She could not find her first serve and was making error after error, while Swiatek, who had won all five of her previous Slam finals, looked right at home.

The Pole is one of the best front runners the sport has seen and she did not allow Anisimova any chance to settle as the groans of the crowd grew ever more audible.

The breezy conditions did not help, and it took Swiatek just 25 minutes to wrap up the first set, with Anisimova winning only nine points.

The American, who stepped away from tennis for eight months in 2023 for mental health reasons, twice screamed in frustration, and probably rising panic, after errors in the opening game of the second set.

The eight former champions sat in the Royal Box would have empathised with Anisimova's predicament but she could find no way of getting any kind of foothold in the match.

Every half chance was either snuffed out by Swiatek or crushed by another wild mistake - she made 28 unforced errors in the 12 games - and a final Swiatek winner put her out of her misery.

An upset Anisimova said: ""Iga, you're such an incredible player, obviously showed today. You've been such an inspiration to me, an unbelievable athlete. Congratulations to you and your team.

""Thank you to everyone who's supported me since my first-round match here. It's been an incredible fortnight for me even though I ran out of gas today and I wish I could have put on a better performance for you.""

Sir Mo Farah, Stanley Tucci and Greta Gerwig were among the celebrities in Wimbledon's Royal Box for the women's singles final.

The Devil Wears Prada actor Tucci was sitting next to American filmmaker Noah Baumbach, who attended on Saturday with his wife, Barbie director Gerwig.

They were sitting in the Royal Box on day 13 of the championships with the Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the Wimbledon men's doubles title since 1936.

Queen's Club and Eastbourne champions Cash and Glasspool became the first all-British pairing to win the All England Club trophy since 1936, when Pat Hughes and Raymond Tuckey defeated their compatriots Charles Hare and Frank Wilde in the final.

""When you say that it sounds incredible,"" said Glasspool. ""It's been one Brit (winner) the last couple of years, now we've given you two Brits.""

The pair downed Rinky Hijikata and David Pel 6-2 7-6 (7-3).

In the men's wheelchair doubles final, Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid lost their title.

The six-time winners and top seeds were upset 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 on Court One by Martin De La Puente from Spain and Dutchman Ruben Spaargaren.

Tennis icon Novak Djokovic's fans were riled up when Taylor Fritz made a quip about the Serb's exclusion from the 2022 US Open. But the American swiftly hit back and highlighted his detractors clearly misunderstood his remarks.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a significant concern back in the summer of 2022, which led to US regulations that barred non-citizens from competing without vaccination proof. This sidelined Djokovic from that year's Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows, much to the quiet relief of his competitors.

Fritz was preparing for the season's final major when he cheekily addressed the situation. But his light-hearted advocacy for the event's organisers to let 'Nole' play, despite not being vaccinated, flew over the heads of many diehard Djokovic fans.

The 27-year-old weighed in after clinching victory over Nick Kyrgios in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. And he noted the United States' Covid-19 protocols while acknowledging both sides of a very important argument at the time.

""We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things,"" he told reporters (via Daily Express). ""So it does seem like what's the harm of letting the best player in the world come play the US Open?

""But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. So I see both sides of the argument. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles].""

Not everyone was amused by those remarks, which sparked outrage among Djokovic's most loyal supporters. So much so that Fritz felt compelled to clarify his jest was purely in good fun and, if anything, intended as a compliment to his competitor.

""Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone,"" he posted on X. ""The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else.""

Both Djokovic and Fritz were ousted from the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively. This leaves them eyeing this year's US Open as their final opportunity to clinch Grand Slam glory in 2025.

Despite many of Djokovic's fans taking umbrage at Fritz's Covid comments, the 24-time major champion himself seemed unperturbed. This is evident as the pair have since reconnected, and there doesn't seem to be any lingering animosity between them.

Fritz made a remarkably swift recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery, and then triumphed at Wimbledon just 20 days later. He disclosed last year that Djokovic had ""reached out"" to him for advice as he aimed to make his own speedy recovery from a similar injury.

Fritz opened up about their 2024 conversation, revealing: ""I told him what it was like for me. A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react.

""It's possible for Novak to play. It's the exact same thing that I had and I played. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds - but it is possible.""

Taylor Fritz once incurred the wrath of Novak Djokovic's fanbase after joking about the Serb's absence from the 2022 US Open. But the American fired back in kind with a feisty response insisting those taking offence to his comments clearly didn't understand them in the first place.

The coronavirus pandemic was still a prevalent issue in the summer of 2022 when US policy meant non-citizens couldn't compete without proof they had been vaccinated. That prohibited Djokovic from taking part in the competition, which most men's players would agree boosts their own chances of winning.

Fritz, 27, made light of that very subject while gearing up for the fourth and final major of the year. He even partially campaigned for organisers to allow 'Nole' to play despite his non-vaccinated status, but the jokey tone of his comments were missed by many.

""We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things,"" he said following a second-round win over Nick Kyrgios at the Cincinnati Open. ""So it does seem like what's the harm of letting the best player in the world come play the US Open?

""But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. So I see both sides of the argument. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles].""

It's perhaps unsurprising not everyone saw the funny side of those comments as they drew ire from legions of Djokovic's supporters. So much so that Fritz felt the need to highlight how his jibe was purely a joke, and one meant to compliment his rival at that.

""Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone,"" he wrote on X. ""The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else.""

Both Djokovic and Fritz were knocked out of the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively. That leaves the pair looking towards this year's US Open as their last chance to get a hand on Grand Slam silverware in 2025.

Despite Fritz's Covid comments not landing with many of Djokovic's fans, the 24-time major-winner himself was seemingly fine with them. That's considering the pair have since made contact and don't appear to have any simmering tensions between them.

Fritz made a shockingly quick recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery and then won at Wimbledon 20 days later. And he revealed last year that Djokovic had ""reached out"" to him for intel as he sought to make his own snappy recovery from a similar injury.

""I told him what it was like for me,"" said Fritz as he lifted the lid on their 2024 exchange. ""A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react.

""It's possible for Novak to play. It's the exact same thing that I had and I played. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds – but it is possible.""

For only the second time in the Open Era, and first time at Wimbledon, a women's singles final ended 6-0 6-0. If anyone was going to achieve the feat, it was destined to be Iga Swiatek, who has a habit of winning sets 6-0 or 6-1: a bagel or a breadstick, as it is known in tennis, is her bread and butter, prompting the coining of the term Iga's Bakery.

But that she did it in her first Wimbledon final, on a surface where she has had little success in the years past, made it one of the most extraordinary results in recent years in women's tennis. Amanda Anisimova simply didn't have the answers against the relentless Polish superstar.

After 38 years, when Steffi Graf won the French Open in 1988 by the same scoreline, Swiatek punched her way into the record books. It wasn't just a story of the two 6-0s she served out on Center Court, she also made it 6-0 in Grand Slam finals in her career, winning her sixth Major in her sixth title clash.

If Anisimova had an actual nightmare before the final, one doubts it would have been worse than the reality that unfolded in front of her eyes. Right from the pre-match walk onto the Center Court, where Swiatek strode out with her headphones on (possibly listening to some AC/DC) much ahead of her American opponent, the former world No 1 looked dialled in.

It might have been the first Wimbledon final for both players, but Swiatek is significantly more experienced at the big stages than Anisimova, while the American was playing a final of this magnitude for the first time in her career. It showed in the opening game right away as Anisimova appeared to be a bundle of nerves. Swiatek had three break points at 0-40 and converted the second to take the lead and never looked back. Anisimova managed to win just two points in the first two games.

The third game saw Anisimova struggle to close out from 40-15, letting Swiatek push her around the court, and dropping her serve for the second time after a double fault to trail 0-3. A brief window opened for the 13th seed to break in the fourth game at 15-30, but this time her groundstrokes let her down. On the other side of the net, there was no letdown of intensity from Swiatek as she crunched some deep forehands to draw out more errors from her opponent. The bad start for Anisimova quickly turned into her worst nightmare, getting broken at love to go down 0-5.

At 5-0, 30-0, Anisimova would have wondered if it wasn't just meant to be, as Swiatek scrambled around to win a point she had no business winning. And it set up three set points that the Pole quickly converted. Anisimova won just 9 points in the first set. As per Opta, Swiatek became only the fourth player in the Open Era to win the opening set with a 6-0 scoreline at the women's singles final in Wimbledon after Billie Jean King (1973, 1975), Chris Evert (1974) and Martina Navratilova (1983).

At the start of the second set, at 0-30, the crowd tried to rally behind Anisimova, and she responded with a roar too after making it 30-30. That was, however, quickly followed by two cries of frustration and a helpless stare towards the team in her box. Swiatek broke serve again to start the second set on the front foot. The crowd once again turned up the volume when Anisimova was down 15-30 on serve, and it went up a few decibels as the American crunched a forehand winner. Down a breakpoint again, she hit another winner to force deuce. But it was only a flash in the pan. There was to be no turnaround and Swiatek swiftly closed the match out and fell on her back on the hallowed grass.

For Anisimova, the result unfortunately bookended what was otherwise a memorable fortnight in London. Her tournament began with a 6-0 6-0 thrashing of Yulia Putintseva (who had coincidentally beaten Swiatek in last year's quarterfinal) and ended in tears with the scoreline being reversed.

For Swiatek, Wimbledon 2025 will hold a special place in her career. After all, even she never quite believed she'd come this far on grass, having never reached the semifinal before. In her post-match speech, she was asked how long she had dreamt about holding the famous Venus Rosewater Dish. She smiled. “Honestly, I didn't even dream, because it felt too far. I feel like I am an experienced player after having won Slams before, but I never expected this one.” Sometimes, when you put your head down (after listening to some rock music) and work hard, even undreamt dreams come true.

Novak Djokovic, a 24‑time Grand Slam champion and the current world number six, reflected on the defining moments of his remarkable career and revealed who he considers his fiercest opponent. Speaking to Eurosport, Djokovic summed up his two decades at the sport's summit into highlights that still resonate with him today.

He immediately called on the moment he first lifted the Wimbledon trophy in 2011 as a highlight that stands above all else, with an SW19 title standing out as a childhood dream. “It was my dream tournament when I was young,” he explained. He ranked that victory even higher than his first ever Grand Slam win at the 2008 Australian Open against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

Djokovic also reserved a special place for his Olympic gold medal at the Paris 2024 Games last summer. “But I would say, a gold medal for my country last year would probably be the highlight of my entire career,” he added, underlining the unique pride of an achievement he waited his entire career for.

When asked about the toughest rival he ever faced, Djokovic did not hesitate to mention the other two players that make up the Big Three alongside himself.

“You probably know the names Federer and Nadal,” he joked. “I would say Nadal would be the one that probably stands out [as] my biggest opponent and biggest rival.”

The Serb and Spaniard's rivalry has produced some of tennis' greatest clashes over the last two decades, most notably the epic 2012 Australian Open final and the marathon 2013 French Open semi‑final.

Despite his storied past, Djokovic insists his focus remains firmly on the future. “The best moment is the next winning moment,” he said, pointing to the constant grind of the ATP Tour and the importance of turning the page quickly after each tournament.

Despite bowing out to Jannik Sinner at Wimbledon in the semi-final, Djokovic made it clear in his post‑match interview that he has no intention of making the 2025 Championships his last. He insisted that he still feels capable of competing at the highest level on grass and is already looking forward to returning to the All-England Club next summer.

With his record haul of 24 majors, Olympic gold, and an unrelenting drive for more, the Serb continues to chase glory at 38. With him aiming to defend his Olympic title at the 2028 LA Games, fans can expect more chapters from Djokovic without the risk of yet another tennis great retiring any time soon.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Bain veteran Chris Harrop prepares to take over as Tennis Australia chair","https://www.consultancy.com.au/news/11406/bain-veteran-chris-harrop-prepares-to-take-over-as-tennis-australia-chair","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 10:46:53 GMT","

Bain & Company advisory partner and company veteran Chris Harrop will be keeping an especially close eye on Wimbledon this year – and not just as a self-described ‘tennis nut'.

Chris Harrop, who has been with Bain & Company for more than three decades, has been tapped to take over as chair of Tennis Australia at the end of the year ahead of the next Australian Open, succeeding fellow Bain veteran Jayne Hrdlicka.

Harrop's appointment continues Tennis Australia's close ties with the local consulting industry, and in particular Bain & Company, with much of its board and many of its key executives having previously worked in the sector, including recent recruits.

By all reports, tennis in Australia is in pretty good shape, with this year's Australian Open having smashed attendance records and drawn a global viewership of almost two billion, which together with the successful introduction of the United Cup and other tournaments on the summer calendar generated over $620 million in economic impact across the country, according to the sports body.

A key driver of the sport's local renaissance has been Hrdlicka. The Australian Open contributed $565 million of that figure alone, almost double the sum of when Hrdlicka took over as Tennis Australia's first female chair in 2017, following two decades at Bain & Company and time at Qantas and Jetstar, the latter as CEO. She now moves on as the next chief and saviour of hotel and liquor giant Endeavour.

Taking up Hrdlicka's seat is Harrop, who joined Bain in San Francisco way back in 1993 and has since spent three decades with the consultancy in Sydney, Melbourne and London with a focus on growth strategy, customer experience, and change management in the consumer goods sector, including seven years as head of the firm's TMT (telecom, media & technology) business for the Asia Pacific.

Harrop, who some local fans may be dismayed to learn will likely be cheering on the likes of Erin Routliffe and Lulu Sun at next year's open as a proud Kiwi, certainly has his plate full. In addition to his ongoing work as an advisory partner at Bain, the incoming Tennis Australia chair also serves on the board of consultancy SVA, and is the co-founder of venture capital outfit FB10X.

And just like at FB10X and SVA, Harrop will continue to be surrounded by current and former consultants in his new role. Also featuring on the board, which Harrop joined at the end of 2023, is former McKinsey partner Graham Bradley, with the pair evidently supported by nominations committee member Fiona McGauchie, A/NZ country head of global leadership consultancy Egon Zehnder.

Tennis Australia's executive and senior leadership team is also positively stacked with strategy and management advisory alum. Chief commercial and chief strategy & performance officers Cedric Cornelis and Tim Jolley both worked at Bain, while CIO Mohan Aiyaswami and chief tennis officer Tom Larner's resumes respectively include DXC Technology and PwC.

Meanwhile, TA's head of strategy, Wakiuru Wohoro, who joined earlier this year, is a former L.E.K. consultant, working alongside tech strategy & architecture head Jennifer Cochrane, who crossed to Tennis Australia in 2023 after a decade and a half at Deloitte, including as Deloitte Digital's head of technology. Recent strategy lead recruit Christine Liu joined from Kearney.

The list goes on. Tennis Australia digital & technology transformation director Simon Gutman was previously a director at Deloitte and ARQ (now NCS); Ben Stewart, head of technology operations, is the former CTO of Fusion5; and another strategy director, Ash Little, was a partner at Boston Consulting Group before joining TA at the start of last year. You probably get the picture.

The latter's inclusion does however raise one point of interest in Tennis Australia's press release announcing Harrop's appointment as chair-elect; that Hrdlicka would continue to support him after his ascension “for as long as necessary given the mix of issues underway internationally.” Despite booming local ticket sales and a healthy global audience, the sport currently sits at the cross-roads.

In short, Saudi Arabia now wants a piece of the pie, following the Kingdom's notable disruption of golf along with an array of other international sports. The issue here is that the oil-rich country is angling to host a mega-bucks Masters tournament to kick off the new season, which starts in January, the same month that Australia traditionally holds court in the build-up to the Oz Open.

The intriguing part of this scenario and the ongoing negotiations over several counter-proposals is that all seven major international tennis bodies recently mutually engaged BCG to come up with some alternative suggestions for the sport's future. Hrdlicka being ex-Bain was one thing, and she's a certified loyalist, but Harrop's ongoing connection to the firm adds some spice to those dynamics

Brad Pitt drives Lando Norris' F1 car for the first time

Sergio Perez left the Formula 1 grid after parting ways with Red Bull at the end of 2024, but the Mexican has been in contact with several teams – including Cadillac – about a return.

Sergio Perez was born with natural speed and still has what it takes to deliver in Formula 1, according to his former Red Bull Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley.

Perez and Red Bull agreed to part ways at the end of last season, having spent four campaigns together, with the Mexican taking some time out to assess his options before deciding he wanted a return to F1 if he could find the right project.

The 35-year-old has been in contact with several teams, including newcomers Cadillac – who are making their F1 debut next season – and Alpine.

Cadillac, who are led by Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, are evaluating their drivers for next season, with the American outfit believed to be edging towards taking experience.

Perez has that in bucketfuls and is one of the favourites for a seat – along with Valtteri Bottas – with the Mexican having scored six wins, 39 points and a runner-up spot in the Drivers' Standings in 2023.

When asked about what he made of Perez's ambitions to return to the sport next season, Wheatley told F1.com: ""Firstly, I really enjoyed working with Checo. He's a great personality, great attitude to life, full stop.

""I have no doubt about his pace and his speed. It's been natural since the beginning.

""He put in some tremendous drives at my former team and I don't think it's much of a barrier that he's had a bit of time off between driving a Formula 1 car because when you know how to do that, you know how to do it.""

Perez left Red Bull despite having two years still left on his contract following a difficult season where he was comfortably outperformed by team mate and reigning World Champion Max Verstappen.

Since his departure, Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda have struggled to get performance out of the car in that seat – which have gone some way to putting Perez's struggles in 2024 into context.

Wheatley spoke highly of former Sauber and Force India racer Perez's ability to galvanise a team, highlighting how he pushed people inside the squad, including Wheatley, to be better during their time at Red Bull.

""I spent a lot of time with him early on because I wanted to get to know him and I wanted him to adjust to the team,"" added Wheatley. ""What I really liked was he pushed me in my sporting role – pushed me very, very hard.

""He made me question whether I was putting every bit of effort in, not that he was criticising but he would challenge you in a positive way and I enjoyed it.

""I think it helped motivate me to become better at my job and I'd like to think maybe it was reciprocal and the work that we did together made him better at his.""

He added: ""He's fully focused on performance and what do you want from a driver?""

Cadillac are continuing to evaluate their options for their two race seats in 2026, with sources suggesting they have shrunk their shortlist down to just a handful. Talks with relevant parties will continue in the coming weeks.

Find out more about Gabriel Bortoleto's life and career in our latest Getting to Know interview.

Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto is the next driver on the list to face F1.com's quickfire Getting to Know questions. From his heroes growing up to his best friends in the F1 paddock today, and his worst travel experience to the other sport he loves, the Brazilian shares all in the video player above and transcript below…

Can you describe yourself in three words?

Oh, okay, straight away like this! I'm a happy guy, focused… What else? And I love what I do!

What made you fall in love with F1?

I mean, what made me fall in love with racing overall… When you race, you always dream to get to F1 because it's the top of the sport that you can achieve one day… I would say the competition, the drivers that have been here in the past, my idols, [Ayrton] Senna… This is the type of thing that made me dream to be here. Here there are the best drivers in the world, so it's also an aim for me to one day try to become the best driver in the world. To do that, you need to be fighting against those drivers. I believe that was one of the reasons why I always wanted to be in F1.

When and where did you first drive something?

I was six. I was in Brazil, Sao Paulo, where I'm from. It was a very nice track. I had a blue kart – full blue, everything blue! I still can remember the smell of the oil, the engine, how it felt and everything. It was a very great moment in my life and definitely one of the best sensations I ever had.

A very important question here… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?

First time! I was lucky, I was very lucky, I need to say. I got everything right the first time, I stopped at the stop signs, I did the reversing perfectly. It was mega!

You nailed it?

Yes… The guy also gave me a bit of help! ‘Okay, okay, it was good!'

Who's your best friend inside the paddock?

Max [Verstappen] and [Ollie] Bearman. I think they're the two guys that I'm the closest [to], that I speak often to, see often – so those two.

Where does that come from with Max?

Well, I started playing a lot of video games with Max, and then simulator as well when I was in F3. Early, early season in F3, so in January, February we started practising. We have a very nice group of friends that we all play games together and do the sim – his team, Team Redline, that I'm an ambassador for. Great people there, and that's how everything started. Since then, we've spent a lot of time together playing games, and it's been very enjoyable.

Which three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?

I mean it needs to be said James Hunt, probably, right? He was known as the party guy and everything. Or Kimi Raikkonen, because I heard he was crazy at parties. When he [went] to parties, I heard so many crazy stories about him…

Anyone else to complete that list?

I would say Senna. I don't know how he was in parties. Honestly, I've not heard many stories about that. It would be funny to go out with him. Imagine going out with your idol!

What's the best holiday you've been on?

I think last year I had a very nice one with my brother, my girlfriend and my brother's wife. Three years ago I also had one when I went to Mykonos with my girlfriend. It was beautiful. I remember we were driving the quads, we stopped uphill in the mountain, we could see all the view of Mykonos with the white houses, sunset… It was great.

If you had to take one driver and team boss to a desert island with you, who would it be and why?

I would say Mattia [Binotto], probably. He's a very smart guy, so I feel that he would help a lot in the desert island, building stuff and doing a lot of stuff. And a driver… I would say, Max, probably. He's always alright with everything, so there are not many things to complain about. Every time I speak to him, ‘It's all good!' Easygoing.

As long as you can somehow find some power and set up a sim rig…

Yeah, then maybe he would go crazy, because normally there wouldn't be! So, maybe not the best choice…

What's the worst travel experience you've ever had?

Actually, one of the worst ones… I was coming back from Miami… My first flight was delayed and I lost the second flight, so the only flight available was like two days after. It was terrible because I went two days after back home and I was in the exit area. It was economy class and everything, but it was fine, I can sleep easily there. But because there were no seats available, and I was super tired from the race, not sleeping well for two days, I got in this emergency exit area and the door was freezing, like -10. So, I was freezing the whole flight and I felt sick for a week after. It was a terrible experience!

What's the strangest gift you've ever been given by a fan?

Umm… I've not got any crazy, strange ones. I got a panda this year, but it's not strange, it's super nice.

Was that at Suzuka?

Yeah!

The fans are very creative there, aren't they?

They are. But yeah, I didn't get anything… Nothing strange so far. Please send some strange things!

What's the best advice you've ever received?

Honestly, I think just enjoy the journey. That is the best advice I've heard. When you enjoy what you're doing and you actually do it with love, you can do it very well. Every time I realise I'm not enjoying as much as I should, I make sure I go back and do things properly.

Which other job do you wish you could try for a day?

I would love to be a tennis player. I love that sport – I think it's amazing, fascinating.

Do you play tennis a lot?

No, but I love to watch it, I love the mentality of the players and everything, how good they are. I don't play often… I play a lot of padel, but not tennis. I need to start actually playing properly.

Are there any particular players that you admire?

I'm going to say a Brazilian, Joao Fonseca. He's mega. He's getting up in the standings, in the ATP [Association of Tennis Professionals] rankings. I think he's going to be a future star. But for sure, from nowadays, [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz are my favourite ones.

Where do you want to be in five years' time?

I would like to be World Champion!

Great answer, thanks Gabi…

Thank you!

Amid a streaming rights battle, the platform's license to stream the series internationally has expired, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter.

	Brande Victorian



	Streamers outside of the U.S. can no longer access South Park on Paramount+. 


	Sources have confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that Paramount+'s license to stream the series internationally has expired, noting the streaming platform is in continued negotiations and hopes to have the series back up soon for all subscribers. International fans of the long-running animated series can still stream South Park specials on Paramount+ and watch the show on Comedy Central, however.  




	The news of the expired international license comes just days after it was announced that the season 27 premiere of South Park has been pushed back two weeks to July 23 from its original date of July 9 amid a streaming rights battle between the show's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and Comedy Central's parent company Paramount Global.

	A tweet posted to South Park's official X profile following the July 2 announcement read: “In response to the press release from Comedy Central about the change in premiere date for South Park Trey Parker & Matt Stone said — ‘This merger is a shitshow and it's fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”

As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter last month, Parker and Stone threatened legal action against Paramount, accusing incoming president Jeff Shell of interfering with their contract negotiations with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Netflix. Shell, currently chairman of sports and media at Redbird Capital Partners, is set to take the reins once the merger between David Ellison's Skydance and Paramount Global is complete. The deal, originally set to close on July 6, is currently awaiting Federal Communications Commission approval to transfer Paramount's broadcast licenses to Skydance. On Monday, representatives for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its Hollywood Local 399 and the Center for American Rights met with the FCC to discuss concessions and emphasize their “commitment to explaining and applauding a final license package that protects the interests of workers, consumers, and investors.”

	











	Paramount currently has two years left on its $900 million deal for the digital rights to South Park. In the June 21 letter written by an attorney for Parker and Stone's entertainment company Park County, Shell is said to have asked potential bidders to modify certain terms of their offers in a “manner calculated to benefit Paramount at the expense” of the company, specifically pointing to Shell urging WBD to give Paramount+ an exclusive 12-month window for new episodes of the show and to shorten the term of the deal from 10 to five years. 


	“We hereby demand that you, Redbird, and Skydance immediately cease your interference,” the letter reads. “If these activities continue, we will have no choice but to act to both protect our rights and discharge any obligations we may have to the public.”


	In response, a spokesperson for Skydance released a statement which read, “Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Skydance has the right to approve material contracts.”


South Park first debuted on Comedy Central on Aug. 13, 1997. The season 26 finale episode “Spring Break” aired on Mar. 29, 2023, with three specials following between October 2023 and May 2024.

The American Idol champ will do a rotating Kellyoke cover every night, and she chose a Dolly Parton-written Whitney Houston classic for her debut.

Kelly Clarkson kicked off her brand-new Las Vegas residency “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Friday night (July 11) — one week later than planned.


	After postponing the original opening weekend dates of July 4 and 5 due to rehearsals taking “a toll” on her famous voice, Clarkson delivered on her promise to fans to bring “the studio to the stage” for the new residency. The stage setup brought the audience inside exactly what it's like to be a fly on the wall in a Clarkson recording session.


	“Studio Sessions” isn't Clarkson's first turn as a Las Vegas headliner. After a no-go in 2020 for the 18-date “Invincible” residency due to the pandemic, she finally made it to the stage of PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in 2023 with the sold-out “Chemistry” engagement. The show kicked off on July 28, 2023, and was initially scheduled for 10 dates. However, it expanded to 14 dates with the addition of performances over the New Year's Eve holiday of that year and the 2024 Super Bowl.


	In 2020, she told Billboard that Las Vegas represented an excellent opportunity for her. “I'm able to do things with [a residency] that I've never been able to carry out on the road,” she says. “We get to stay for a bit, see and hang with fans, and then you're not having to travel every night to a different city, which can be exhausting. I'm stoked to have a home away from home [in Vegas].”


	Recently, she teased fans with an ultra-glam Sin City look, wearing a plunging sequin jumpsuit accented in feathers, for the “Where Have You Been” video, channeling fellow Las Vegas headliner Cher.


	“I've always loved performing in Las Vegas and the high energy of the crowds. Musicians from every genre of music, young and old, rookies and legends—it has become this fantastic city filled with artists from everywhere. So many of my musical idols have had, and still have, incredible residencies on the Strip, and I'm so excited to create my own,” Clarkson says. 


	There are 16 performances of “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” scheduled through Nov. 15, with new dates for the postponed July 4-5 shows yet to be announced. In the 23 years since she won American Idol, Clarkson has sold more than 25 million albums and 40 million singles worldwide. In addition to three Grammy Awards, she has multiple Daytime Emmys on the mantle for her six-season Kelly Clarkson Show.


	A highlight of Friday night's debut came during the second-to-last song of the night, when Clarkson introduced a rotating Kellyoke cover — named after the wildly popular performance segment from her daytime talk show — this time performing the Dolly Parton-penned “I Will Always Love You” in the style of Whitney Houston's 1992 The Bodyguard soundtrack version.


	Here's a look at Clarkson's full opening-night setlist for “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

The superstar begins his 30-day stint with a show that celebrates his homeland, his fans & his Billboard 200 No. 1 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos.

Associate Editor, Billboard Español


	History was in the making on Friday night (July 11) as Bad Bunny launched his wildly anticipated No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí (meaning: I Don't Want to Leave From Here) residency at the legendary Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot (a.k.a. El Choli) in San Juan. The event marked the beginning of his unprecedented 30-show series, making him the first artist to ever headline a residency of this scale at the iconic venue with capacity for 18,000 people.


	The Puerto Rican superstar (real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) put on an electrifying show for a euphoric, sold-out audience on opening night, fusing reggaeton, Latin trap and Puerto Rican folk sounds with heartfelt moments honoring his culture — even featuring a quaint Boricua home onstage.


	“Show them from the start where the gladiators were born,” reggaetón pioneer Ivy Queen wrote in Spanish on Bad Bunny's IG post announcing the residency. “Proudly representing from the heart of the neighborhood, where we can vibe to the beat of drums, the bass of a car speaker, or even acapella — we bring the energy anywhere! Historic moment, my pollito stepping up with pride and showing off what it means to be Puerto Rican! That huge Pisces heart is coming through strong! Let's gooooooo!”


	The first three weeks of the residency (July 11–27) are restricted to Puerto Rico residents before opening up to tourists. 


	“[This residency] will position Puerto Rico as a premier entertainment destination,” Jorge L. Pérez, the general manager of Coliseo de Puerto Rico, previously told Billboard Español. “It will open the eyes of visitors who have never come to Puerto Rico. It will create awareness of Puerto Rico as an entertainment and leisure destination.”

	On Friday (July 11), London's Wireless Festival roared back to life for its 20th anniversary. The revered U.K. institution — previously home to luminaries like Jay-Z, Ye, Rihanna, Daft Punk and Bruno Mars — reopened its gates for one of its most beloved guests: Drake.


	Wireless was once Drake's stomping grounds at the onset of his career. He first crossed the pond to headline in 2012 before making a triumphant return in 2015. In 2021, he popped up for a surprise cameo alongside What a Time to Be Alive partner Future. Fast-forward to 2025, and Drake is eyeing an unprecedented trifecta: headlining all three nights of the festival.


	Night 1 served as a full-on love letter to R&B enthusiasts. Drake flexed his vocal stamina while gliding through B-side classics like “Jaded” and “Jungle,” using the night to pay homage to his R&B heroes. Among those hitting the stage, he welcomed millennial heartthrobs Mario and Bobby Valentino for their signature gems. From there, he dipped into the late 2010s to salute Bryson Tiller's TrapSoul era before skating into the 2020s with a soul-stirring medley alongside GIVEON.


	Things heated up when Drake reeled in his $ome $exy $ongs 4 U partner and OVO comrade PARTYNEXTDOOR for a teaser of their forthcoming UK Tour. The duo treated fans to a fistful of highlights ranging from “Somebody Love You” to “SpiderMan Superman,” before Drake tagged in R&B icon Lauryn Hill for a special mash-up of “Ex Factor” and “Nice for What.”

Night one of Drake's R&B-themed performance at Wireless Festival included melodies, deep cuts and legends.

	With Iceman season fast approaching, Drake is primed and ready to kick off another album worthy of anticipation and hype, especially after the release of his new single “What Did I Miss?” But, on Friday night (July 11), fans at the U.K. Wireless Festival didn't get the mischievous, revenge-plotting Drake looking to avenge his losses. Instead, they received a Drake who was keen on celebrating his R&B heroes, his OVO comrade PARTYNEXTDOOR, and day-one fans who have always appreciated the melodic side of Heartbreak Drake.


	“This is the first time in my life that I've done three different shows on three different days,” Drake told the crowd during his performance. “You came to a very special night. It's night one. It's a celebration of all things R&B. All things melodies. All classics.”


	Along with Drake headlining three nights of Wireless, Friday's outing wasn't just a highlight reel featuring The Boy and Friends; it served as a thriving garden for R&B artists from the States and across The Pond. The U.K.'s shining stars like KWN and Nippa treated the day as a homecoming, while Summer Walker and Leon Thomas demonstrated their performance prowess and elite status in the genre. The guest list ran deep, with surprise appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, Kehlani and more, making day 1 a dreamscape for R&B purists.


	Check out the best moments from Drake's R&B-themed night 1 at Wireless Festival. Plus, stay tuned for more coverage of Drake's day 2 and 3 performances, along with special surprises.




	As Leon Thomas continues to have an impressive 2025 campaign, courtesy of his top 15 Billboard Hot 100 single “Mutt,” the R&B polymath earned a monumental co-sign from his mentor and EZMNY Records label boss Ty Dolla $ign. During a spellbinding set that showcased Thomas' wizardry as a singer and guitarist, it was his mastery of songs like “Not Fair” and “Yes It Is” that truly captivated viewers. Following his sizzling effort, Ty Dolla $ign joined his protégé onstage and boldly declared Thomas as the new “King of R&B.”


	As the U.K. continues to thrive as a breeding ground for burgeoning R&B stars, Nippa and KWN showcased why they are currently the country's brightest exports. Nippa, U.K.'s charming lothario, spoonfed fans hearty servings of smiles and sorrow. He hopscotched between songs like the dance-ready “One More” to the brooding ache of “Unfair.” KWN's intensity was just as edgy, especially when she called on Kehlani for a steamy sequel of their contagious hit “Worst Behaviour (Remix).”


	The AAPI community is having a banner year in R&B, led by breakout stars Sailorr and Karri. Draped in an all-pink ensemble, Sailorr exuded beauty and poise while staking her claim as one of Florida's Finest. Her set struck a nerve with the heartbroken, who clung to every word of “Down Bad” and “Cut Up.” Meanwhile, Karri, fresh off tour with Isaiah Falls, flew U.K. fans straight to the West Coast with his buttery vocals and laid-back charisma anchoring “3 AM in Oakland.” Together, they're forging a new standard for AAPI excellence in R&B.


	Three years ago, a pregnant and vulnerable Summer Walker burst into tears when fans belted “Session 32” in unison. The now-viral performance not only captured Walker's strength but transformed her vulnerability into a superpower. Fast forward, and the singer ruminated on the pivotal rendition, where she encouraged fans to sing along and relive her transformative moment.


	Before Drake entered center stage, PND kicked their joint headlining set off with gusto. Not only did he break into P4 anthems like “No Chill” and “For Certain,” but he revisited his rookie days, returning to his self-titled debut project and performing “Wus Good / Curious.” Then, once PND strolled into “Come & See Me,” that proved to be the perfect launching pad to introduce Drake.


	As promised, Drake gift-wrapped a slew of classic R&B deep cuts, including “Jungle” and “Feel No Ways.” He didn't skimp on the popular favorites too, using “Marvins Room” and “Passionfruit” as a melodic master class for those unfamiliar with The Boy's emotional depth.


	The OVO tandem introduced a first-ever look at their $ome $exy $ongs 4 U U.K. Tour by giving a crash-course example of their elite chemistry and crowd control. Opening with “CN TOWER,” Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR thrived off the crowd's energy, propelling them to slow-burning songs like “SPIDER-MAN SUPERMAN” before shifting gears to their cultural anthem “SOMEBODY LOVES ME.”


	In true celebratory fashion, Drake called on the R&B cavalry to make the night that much more special. He enlisted Mario and Bobby Valentino for a nostalgic performance of their throwback cuts before calling on Bryson Tiller and GIVEON to inject their energy into the night's smooth vibes. The biggest hero of the night came in the form of Ms. Lauyrn Hill, who wowed the crowd with an electric performance of Fugees' “Ready or Not” before doing a clever mash-up of “Ex-Factor” and Drake's “Nice for What,” a first in both of their careers.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump posted on Saturday that he is giving “serious consideration” to revoking Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship.


	The president posted on Truth Social, “Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship. She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”


	The president cannot revoke the citizenship of someone born in the U.S., something that legal scholars have long noted. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”

	O'Donnell, who was born in New York, is a longtime Trump nemesis. She moved her family to Ireland earlier this year, saying in a TikTok video that “when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that's when we will consider coming back.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	O'Donnell has continued to be critical of Trump on TikTok and other social media, posting earlier this week that Trump “has put this country in danger” with his “horrible decisions.” She said that the cuts to the National Weather Service to the deaths in the flash floods in Texas. “These are the results that we are going to see on a daily basis,” she said. 

	











	After Trump's Truth Social post, O'Donnell wrote on TikTok, “the potus ladies n gentlemen is a disgrace to all our beautiful country stands for – he is a danger to the nation – a mentally ill untreated criminal who lied to america for a decade on the apprentice – thanks mark burnett – and u fell for it – its so tragic – had u grown up in Ny – as i did and he did – u too would know what a total fool he is – add me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn – its now or never america 🇺🇸 – my little posts from dublin upset him – go arrest a few brown people u truly evil man child.” 


	Trump has sought to end the practice of “birthright” citizenship via executive order. That has been challenged in the courts, and this past week a judge blocked Trump's effort.


	Despite signing an executive order earlier this year to ensure that the federal government would not engage in “any conduct that would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen,” Trump has sought to sanction dissenting voices. Among other things, he recently threatened to prosecute CNN for reporting on an app that tracks sightings of ICE agents, and earlier this year barred AP reporters and photographers from the Oval Office and other White House venues because their Stylebook did not recognize the president's change of the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.


	In May, Trump called for a “major investigation” of Bruce Springsteen, alleging that Kamala Harris paid for his endorsement during her 2024 campaign. Her campaign has denied that claim. Springsteen has been critical of Trump while on a European tour, calling the president's administration “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous.”

Re: “…The president cannot revoke the citizenship of someone born in the U.S., something that legal scholars have long noted…” 

I hope Ms. Donnell civilly sues Trump! Wouldn't that be hilarious?

You go girl!  Rosie you are entirely correct! He is a disaster for America.  Plus it will always be the Gulf of MEXICO 🇲🇽  to me.

Rosie O'Donnell fatigue is real.  After she left the country, I thought we'd be hearing less from her not more.

We are only hearing about her because the current president of the United States thinks it's a good use of his time to threaten her. You'd have never seen her tweet without him deciding to respond.

Pretty funny.   Actually the only thing about Rosie that is funny.

Trump is a traitor to the United States, should be impeached and imprisoned.

The Lord of the Rings actor Sean Astin is seeking to replace SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher in the upcoming union election.


	Astin has submitted a bid to lead the 160,000-member organization, Deadline confirmed Friday. Also on his ticket are Michelle Hurd for secretary-treasurer, Joely Fisher for president of the Los Angeles Local Board, Lisa Ann Walter for first vice president of the Local Board, and David Jolliffe to return for second vice president. 


	If elected, Astin would follow in the footsteps of his mother Patty Duke, the Valley of the Dolls and The Miracle Worker actress who became the second woman to ever run the then-Screen Actors Guild in 1985. She held the position for three years.

	Astin has previously served on five separate SAG-AFTRA negotiating committees, including the most recent contract won after a historically long, 118-day strike in 2023. He is also a member of SAG-AFTRA National and LA local boards, and a National convention delegate.




			Watch on Deadline		







	So far, the full picture of the race is unclear. Current SAG-AFTRA President Drescher could not be reached for comment on whether she plans to seek another term.


	Whether Drescher or someone else, the person leading the guild next year will have a herculean task ahead of them as SAG-AFTRA returns to the negotiating table with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which collectively bargains on behalf of the major Hollywood studios. 


	This will be the first contract negotiation cycle after the 2023 strike, regarding an industry that has been hit hard by a global production contraction that has resulted in far less work. There are still some concerns the union is seeking to address, primarily regarding technological advances in artificial intelligence over the past three years.

	











	SAG-AFTRA political hopefuls have until 5 p.m. Friday to submit their nominating petitions. A full list of candidates is expected next week. Election ballots will be collected from August 13 to September 12.


The Hollywood Reporter was first to report the news of Astin's bid.

I think it's great to see someone like Sean Astin stepping up for SAG-AFTRA. His experience and dedication could really make a difference for the union, especially in these challenging times for actors. Looking forward to seeing how his campaign unfolds!

It will a tough race for Secretary Treasurer. 45 year member and former 2017 presidential candidate, local & national board member Peter Antico who is uniquely qualified in macroeconomics and finance is running against Miss Heard. 

Antico Directed the finance documentary, The Paradigm of Money – produced by Sean Stone. He has recommended Bitcoin Gold and silver since 2009 to protect the unions funds against inflation when gold was trading at $885. It is now $3350. Silver is close to $38 per ounce. BTC is 117k. Antico recommended it at 15k. No one listened. 

Antico initiated the Ed Asner lawsuit on behalf of senior performers against SAGs health plan for booting 8200 senior off of healthcare in the middle of the pandemic. 

The lawsuit settled for 20.6 million in favor of the seniors. A debate between Antico and Heard will certainly expose whose qualified as opposed to the usual popularity contest.

Get rid of Duncan too as the 1m/year negotiator who went to Comic-Con to talk about the strike to non-SAG members and did the same going to film festivals. Fruncan destroyed this industry.

You clearly do not get it.  His strategy, and it was a good one, was to educate the fans as to what we were fighting for. He also knows, as do all working game VoiceOver actors, that of the 150,000 or so Comic-con attendees, many are new to or looking to get into VoiceOver. A huge percentage of games are non-union, and reaching out to this community for support during a work stoppage was vital. This was a great opportunity, as with social media the outreach at any con goes well beyond attendees. His audience included game developers whom SAG-AFTRA has supported in their efforts to unionize and fight for AI protections and profit sharing.  I've worked with him for years on negotiation committees, well before his current position. You may not approve of his salary, but he earns it.

Dresher  and Crabtree destroyed the business

Amen.  Duncan is our downfall

“There's some good in this world… and it's worth fighting for.”

-Sean Astin, Candidate for SAG-AFTRA President

Ruuuu-dy. Ruuu-dy! Rudy! Rudy!

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SATURDAY UPDATE: On Friday, Warner Bros/DC's Superman added another $21.5M from 78 international box office markets. That brings the offshore flying cume to $40M through Friday.


	Globally, with Friday's domestic count, the worldwide running total is $96.5M. While we still have Saturday and Sunday to come overseas, what's clear here is that domestic is leaning harder into this latest iteration of the Man of Steel.


	All told, the James Gunn-directed Superman is expected to reach $210M+ in its worldwide bow. This is slightly above where we had it before the weekend, and of course could shift given Sat/Sun play. We can't exactly call it kryptonite, there are some areas where Superman is facing a challenge: Asia is soft, for example. Though this should not come as a surprise. We've previously noted that Korea is a depressed market and that Clark Kent was not expected to make an impact in China. 

	











	For the record, the UK opened on Friday with $3.6M, a clear No. 1 with a 66% share of the Top 5 films. This is above all comps. 




			Watch on Deadline		







China, as noted, grossed $2.4M through Friday including sneaks. Superman is an unsurprising non-starter in the market. The ultimate full-run prediction there is just above $11M. As we know, it happens.


	In happier news, Spain opened on Friday to $1M at No. 1 as the biggest debut for Gunn and 7% higher than Justice League, 29% over Aquaman, 77% ahead of Wonder Woman and 106% above Thunderbolts.


Japan, which is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next Demon Slayer movie next week, had a fantastic start with $781K, super-passing comps.

	











	The Top 5 through Friday are: Mexico ($3.8M), UK ($3.6M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.5M) and France ($2.5M).


PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: DC/Warner Bros' Superman has begun zipping around the world, ringing up $40.3 million through Wednesday and Thursday in North America and 57 overseas markets. The split there is a record-making $22.5M in domestic previews Thursday night, while $17.8M has come from the international box office so far in the movie's first two days of offshore release.


	The global total to date does not include Friday's estimates for North America.


	The James Gunn-directed latest installment about the Man of Steel debuted in nine offshore markets on Wednesday, with another 48 markets joining Thursday. Today adds another 21, which takes the total number of international territories in release to 78.


	In terms of openings on Wednesday, France was a No. 1 start at $1.3M including previews and ahead of a long weekend for Bastille Day; the debut is 3% above Thunderbolts and also over the most recent Venom and Aquaman movies (+8%). The cume through Thursday is $1.8M.


Korea, which we continue to stress is a depressed market, started at $700,000 on Wednesday. That was good for No. 1 and ranked roughly on par with Guardians of the Galaxy, and ahead of Thunderbolts and Aquaman & the Lost Kingdom. Imax repped a strong 18% of the box office from 26 locations. The Korea cume through Friday, not reflected in the international and global totals above, is an estimated $1.7M.


Italy's Wednesday opening of $519K was a No. 1 start and roughly on par with Justice League as well as 2% bigger than Man of Steel, 51% ahead of Guardians the first, 97% bigger than Wonder Woman and 159% higher than Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom.


Indonesia had a $462K No. 1 start on Wednesday, ranking No. 1 with results on par with Thunderbolts and ahead of GOTG1 & 2, Man of Steel, The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick.


	The Philippines on Wednesday saw Supes dominate at No. 1 with a 78% market share. The opening day of $386K was 22% above the most recent Mission: Impossible, 29% ahead of Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 31% higher than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.


	On Thursday, some heavy-hitters chimed in. To wit: Mexico debuted at No. 1 with $2.2M. This is the 2nd biggest opening day for a DC movie ever and is roughly on par with The Batman.


Australia bowed to $1.3M at No. 1 and claimed the best opening day of 2025 to date. The launch is on par with Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 10% over The Batman, 13% ahead of Man of Steel, 56% bigger than Guardians 3.


	Super DC market Brazil came in with a strong No. 1 start for Superman on Thursday of $2M — the biggest opening day ever for James Gunn. The launch day was bigger than all Guardians movies as well as Joker and The Batman, notably. 


	In the UAE, the David Corenswet/Rachel Brosnahan/Nicholas Hoult-starrer ranked No. 1 accounting for half of the total market. Opening day results are roughly on par with The Batman and higher than Aquaman and the Mission movies


	In Thailand, Superman dominated at No. 1 on Thursday with 58% share at $631K.


	The Top 5 through Thursday are: Mexico ($2.2M), Brazil ($2M), France ($1.8M), Australia ($1.3M) and Korea ($1.1M).


China, where we have already estimated this is not going to move the needle, opened today to $2.4M.


	We'll have more during the weekend…

The movie is a 10 out of 10! Haters gonna hate, I'm not a James Gunn fan at all for various reasons! However his Superman is a runaway hit!The most human man of steel movie ever made! You will believe a man can fly! Krypto by the way is the real star of this movie! That dog deserves his oscar! Loved this movie! Loved it!

Can you sound more like part of the marketing for this film? You even use the slogans and all that.

I only wish they got rid of his underwear. That's honestly my only complain. For 15 years we were finally on the path of freeing Superman from his underwear (DCEU, Superman and Lois, Injustice games etc) and now it's back. Some say that Superman's identity is his underwear, but that could be said about Batman and Wolverine too, yet they got theirs removed.

This doesn't look like it will hit a billion either. Streaming really killed the box office.

Last year there were four $1 Billion dollar grossing movies (3 from Disney, and Despicable Me 4 with $970 million is close enough). 

Did streaming not exist in 2024? or is maybe your theory simply wrong?

What 3 from Disney last year

Because those were Disney and Despicable Me movies. They are known for giving an experience on the big screen. And one of those three was Deadpool and Wolverine, which everyone thought won't happen after Disney bought 20th Century Fox. Marvel fans had their fingers crossed for this longer than DC fans for the Snyder Cut.

It's a DC world and Marvel is just living in it!

Listen, I'm a Marvel guy but I'm happy with Superman's success as long as it silences the Synder cult.

So basically you don't like the film, you just want to use it as weapon in your online feud, you should be embarrased to even write that.

well they didnt write ANY of that. you did.

That's crazy cause presales for fantastic four (when comparing day before release) are better than Superman in many international markets and here in the states 😭😂

Yeah right….Fandango reports Superman has now blown past Fantastic Four ticket sales, becoming the #1 first-day ticket seller of the year.
Just the usual DC haters rants…lol

Sure Jan.

OS is going to be really weak. Might not even get to 250m.

How is between 200M and 250M supposed to be weak? This is a good number. The film doesn't need to do 300M during the first weekend.

Listen carefully this time. The overseas numbers are week.  They (the overseas numbers) will not get to 250m total.

Captain America 4 opened with $200 million and ended with $415 million…This movie isn't opening that much higher. Will make $550 million at the most since superhero movies drop off quickly.

I think it will earn around the same as Man of Steel. Even their opening numbers are so similar ($44 million for Man of Steel vs $40 million for Superman).

MOS made 670m worldwide. Superman 2025 will not top 600m.

You are likely correct. The script is filled with holes. Good chance this drops big.

Tbh I feel like this movie will have a much better holdout than Captain America — I almost slept through that one, but just saw Superman last night & am now planning on seeing it again next weekend.

Plenty of empty seats just outside of NYC.

Just keep telling yourself that buddy.

Forget billion, this won't even hit Man of Steel numbers

Staff Writer


Tom Holland is teasing his work on Christopher Nolan‘s The Odyssey and revealed he had a positive experience.


	The Spider-Man star said in a recent interview that working on Nolan's new film was “exciting” and “different.”


	“It was amazing. The job of a lifetime, without a doubt. The best experience I've had on the film set. Incredible,” Holland told GQ. “It was exciting. It was different. And I think the movie is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.”


	He continued, “Working with Chris, getting to know him and Emma [Thomas] was absolutely fantastic. I've never seen someone that can work the way that they do, and there is a reason why they're the best in the business for sure. To get a front row seat to that and to be a part of the process and to collaborate with a true master of his craft and learn from him was the best experience I've ever had.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







The Odyssey is slated to premiere on July 17, 2026, and it is an adaptation of the epic poem from Homer and the story of Odysseus, King of Ithaca, and his perilous journey home after the Trojan War.


	The cast of the film includes Matt Damon, Anne Hathaway, Zendaya, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Pattinson, Charlize Theron, Jon Bernthal, Benny Safdie, John Leguizamo, Elliot Page, among many others.


	In the same interview, Holland said that Damon and Hathaway have always been his heroes, adding, “So to share scenes with them, to learn from them, to become friends with them, I couldn't have asked for a better job. And I'm so proud of the work I've done. I came to work every day with a real sense of purpose and a point to prove, and I'm so grateful for Chris to have given me that opportunity.”

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: When the BBC screened Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone in February, there were hopes that the film would win awards. Fast forward six months, and the BBC will next week publish a delayed investigation into how the documentary descended into disaster.


	Peter Johnston, the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, has examined what led to How to Survive a Warzone being narrated by the child of a Hamas minister, without this crucial fact being declared to audiences. The film, which was an unsparing portrayal of the chaos in Gaza from the perspective of three young people, was later removed from iPlayer.

					BBC Tells 'MasterChef' Host Gregg Wallace: Your Conduct Is Threat To Safety Of Co-Workers		
			








	Sources familiar with the review said Johnston had been forensic, with the expectation being that his findings will be chastening for the BBC, even though the corporation has been accused of marking its own homework. He will ultimately determine whether editorial rules were broken and lay the groundwork for disciplinary action.




			Watch on Deadline		







How to Survive a Warzone was produced by Hoyo Films, an independent production company run by Emmy and BAFTA-winning filmmaker Jamie Roberts. Overseeing the film for the BBC were Joanna Carr, head of current affairs, and commissioning editors Gian Quaglieni and Sarah Waldron.


	Two sources told Deadline that some, if not all, of the individuals embroiled in the review have lawyered up as Johnston readies his findings. Johnston, a close ally of director-general Tim Davie, has gone through the process of Maxwellisation, a practice that gives individuals the opportunity to respond to criticisms made in an official report.

	











	Deadline hears that the “quasi-legal” process has not been straightforward, with competing narratives needing to be considered. The BBC initially blamed Hoyo for failing to declare English-speaking narrator Abdullah Al-Yazouri's Hamas links, but later acknowledged that it should have done more to establish this fact. More detail is also expected on payments made during production and whether any money fell into the hands of Hamas.


	“Everyone feels like they could be the fall guy,” a source said of the febrile mood. Two people said those affected do not wish to be named in the final report. It is not yet clear if Johnston will honor this wish. His last review, which examined misconduct allegations against Russell Brand, only referenced job titles.


	A BBC source said: “It's obviously difficult for all involved. Peter is trying to run a proper process. It's really important we establish the facts and the process is fair to those involved.”


	Davie told BBC staff on June 11 that the How to Survive a Warzone review was “days” away, but these days ultimately turned into more than a month. Johnston will now publish in the same week as an investigation into ex-MasterChef host Gregg Wallace and the BBC's annual report.


	The BBC has faced huge pressure from Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to finalize and publish the report, but the corporation has been led by the process rather than politicians. Nandy has openly questioned why nobody has been fired over the debacle, with one source saying that she is “looking for a scalp.”


	Johnston's findings will also be closely scrutinized beyond Westminster. A group of 45 Jewish television executives, including former BBC content chief Danny Cohen and J.K. Rowling's agent Neil Blair, wrote to the BBC with a plethora of questions about the failings on How to Survive a Warzone. The BBC has also come under pressure from Palestinian sympathizers, including Gary Lineker, Riz Ahmed, and Ken Loach, who have described the decision to remove the film from iPlayer as “censorship.”


	The BBC has, in some ways, already pre-empted Johnston's conclusions. BBC chair Samir Shah said the incident was a “dagger to the heart” of the corporation's impartiality and trustworthiness. “I have a worry that it wasn't so much the processes that were at fault but that people weren't doing their job,” Shah added. The coming days should reveal if Shah's concerns were well founded.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Bryan Cranston says he won't come back to finish indie film until all crew and co-stars are paid","https://www.avclub.com/bryan-cranston-lily-gladstone-lone-wolf","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 03:04:00 GMT","

Bryan Cranston issued a statement on Friday evening, addressing the financial situation surrounding his (hypothetically) upcoming new indie film Lone Wolf. The movie (which co-stars Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone) reportedly ran into financial troubles a few weeks back, and while Cranston notes in his new comments that he was paid for his work on the film, upon learning that its co-stars and crew weren't, he's given an ultimatum to producers: Pay everybody, or he won't return to finish filming the movie.

Helmed by Arlington Road director Mark Pellington, Lone Wolf stars Cranston as a shadowy type who recruits Gladstone's character to engineer the death of a public official. The film reportedly had about $2 million in funding fall through, causing several people working on it to not get paid. “Man, what a mess,” Cranston wrote in a statement he gave to Deadline this week, noting that, although not a producer on the film, he was “distressed” that the situation has “caused so much grief and distrust, and so sorry that this crew (which was fantastic) were not treated with the respect they deserved.” He also stated, bluntly, that “I (and I think I speak for Lily as well) will not do anything to promote the film until every cast and crew member is paid back in full, and we will not appear on screen again (ie return to filming) for this movie until that happens.” Lone Wolf reportedly requires at least a few more days of shooting with both Cranston and Gladstone in order to be completed.

Deadline notes that, while funding hiccups aren't that rare in indie movie-making, having it happen on a movie with several big-name stars, and a director with a long pedigree in Hollywood film, is much more rare. Co-stars on the movie include O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jennifer Ehle, Chet Hanks, and Spencer Garrett.  The film has reportedly been facing financial problems from the jump; its original production company, Yale Productions, recently filed for bankruptcy, and the movie faced a multi-day Do Not Work order from SAG-AFTRA after an earlier failure to make payments.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Amy Schumer Glows in Swimsuit After Finding Weight Loss Success","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/amy-schumer-swimsuit-weight-loss-mounjaro/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 04:08:10 GMT","

Amy Schumer is radiating confidence during her summer getaway, showcasing her transformed figure while being refreshingly honest about her wellness journey.

The 44-year-old comedian recently shared a new vacation photo that has fans celebrating her candid approach to health and body positivity. Captured aboard a luxurious yacht with a picturesque island backdrop, Schumer posed confidently in a sleek black one-piece swimsuit featuring white trim details. Her effortless styling included dark sunglasses and a casual, messy bun, perfectly embodying relaxed vacation vibes.

“From the relatocam,” Schumer captioned the Instagram post, which quickly accumulated over 24,000 likes and an outpouring of supportive comments from fans and fellow celebrities. The comedian's playful reference to keeping things “relatable” connected with followers who have followed her transparent health journey.

A post shared by @amyschumer

Schumer's current wellness success stems from working closely with healthcare professionals to address multiple health concerns simultaneously. Earlier this year, she revealed her positive experience with Mounjaro, a medication that has helped her achieve sustainable results without the severe side effects she previously encountered.

“I wanted to share and keep it 100,” Schumer explained in a candid video. She emphasized the importance of transparency, noting: “It's not covered by insurance unless you have diabetes or like severe obesity, which most of the internet thinks I have. I'm having a really good experience with it, and I wanted to keep it real with you about that.”

The comedian's current treatment approach extends beyond weight management medication. During a telehealth consultation, medical professionals identified that she was experiencing perimenopause, leading to hormone therapy that dramatically improved her overall well-being.

“My hair is fuller, my skin is better, I have more energy,” Schumer shared with her followers, describing the comprehensive improvements she's experienced since beginning proper treatment for her perimenopausal symptoms.

Schumer's journey to finding effective treatment wasn't without obstacles. She previously experienced severe adverse reactions to Ozempic, which taught her about the importance of personalized medical care and genetic considerations in treatment planning.

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, Schumer explained her unique genetic makeup affects her medication tolerance: “I have this gene, GDF15, which makes you extremely prone to nausea, which is why I was so sick during my pregnancy.”

Her previous experience with weight loss medication resulted in dramatic but unsustainable results. “I was, like, vomiting — and then you have no energy. But other people take it and they're all good. God bless them.” While she “lost 30 pounds so quick” and “looked great,” the severe side effects made daily activities impossible, as she couldn't “lift [her] head off the pillow.”

This challenging experience reinforced Schumer's commitment to honesty about celebrity health journeys. She has consistently advocated for transparency in Hollywood, previously calling out celebrities who fail to disclose the truth about their cosmetic procedures or weight loss methods.

“You are on Ozempic or one of those things or you got work done. Just stop,” she stated during a 2023 appearance on “Watch What Happens Live.” Her philosophy is to be real: “Be real with the people. When I got lipo, I said I got lipo.”

After years of flying solo, Jennifer Aniston is quietly stepping into a new chapter. The Emmy-winning actress is starting a new chapter that looks like it's filled with connection, joy, and a bit of PDA. The “Friends” star, 56, is making waves for her blossoming romance with hypnotist and life coach Jim Curtis, 49. The couple packed on the PDA during a romantic getaway in Mallorca.

According to photos published by The Daily Mail, the couple was spotted aboard a luxury yacht. 

On Thursday, photos that made way online showed Aniston's new chapter with close friends, including Courteney Cox, Amy Schumer, Olivia Wilde, and Jason Bateman.

New photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, show Jennifer Aniston in a curve-hugging black dress, resting her hand on Jim Curtis's thigh and holding hands with him during their intimate yacht outing. 

The affectionate moments throughout the day hint at the relationship being official.

“Jennifer is dating Jim and is very happy, but she's still taking things slowly for now,” a source told The Daily Mail.  

As per US Weekly, a source said: “They are being super private but have been spending a lot of time together. They are happy and really into each other.”

The source also told the outlet that their “mutual friends” set up Aniston and Curtis, who started as friends but hit it off over time.

A post shared by Jim Curtis (@jimcurtis1)

According to the insider, what makes this relationship stand out is the emotional connection between the two. “They both share a deep love of doing ‘inner work,' and Jen thinks Jim is quite remarkable in that respect,” the source added. “Jen has read just about every self-help book worth reading, and Jim coming into her life has felt like fate.”

A post shared by Alila Ventana Big Sur (@ventanabigsur)

The Mallorca trip marks the couple's second romantic getaway in recent months. In June, Aniston and Curtis vacationed at Ventana Big Sur, a five-star eco-luxury resort in California. As per the Daily Mail, Ventana is a favorite among Hollywood's elite. The past guests include Taylor Swift, Anne Hathaway, and Ivanka Trump, with stays starting at $3,000 per night.

Internet sleuths were quick to point out their brewing romance. Long before these romantic sightings, Aniston had been interacting with Curtis online and dropping hints. She's been following him on Instagram for nearly two years. She frequently likes his manifestation posts, including one last week about healing from past relationships and “calling in new, divine love.”

Curtis, who has a huge fan following, regularly shares inspirational content and is the author of Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide, a self-help workbook. Aniston publicly said she was reading it earlier this year.

In April, Aniston revealed she had turned to hypnosis to manage her fear of flying, just months before her relationship with Curtis was confirmed. “I have been doing some hypnosis lately… it's shockingly good!” she told The Tonight Show.

That practice may have had a deeper connection. Curtis's therapeutic method, called hypno-realization, is designed to help people “break free from their past and create a new reality.” 

While Aniston is keeping things low-key, the bond she shares with Curtis appears deeply rooted in shared values and mutual respect. “Jen feels very connected to Jim,” a source said. “They have the same level of emotional intelligence — unlike some of her previous suitors.”

Not every marriage is built to last, but “American Idol” judge Carrie Underwood and husband Mike Fisher have proven that theirs has serious staying power. As Star reported, the couple celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary on July 10th, 2025. Sources exclusively told the publication that the couple's union is still going strong.

“Carrie feels like the luckiest woman in the world,” one source shared. They explained that Fisher has been very supportive of Underwood's career since they met, and that family is a top priority for both spouses. “When Carrie's home, she's not a star, she's a wife and mother,” the source said. “To her boys, she's just Mom.”

Balancing family and fame is difficult for any celebrity, but it's always been a major focus for Underwood and Fisher. “When she's on the road, Mike will often take the boys to where she is for family time,” the source shared with Star about how the couple maintains that balance. “The rest of the time they FaceTime and Zoom so Carrie stays in the loop.”

As The Tennessean shared in 2019, Underwood's family joined her for parts of “The Cry Pretty Tour 360”  so that she could still fulfill some of her most valued motherly duties. For example, although Fisher and the family's nanny were integral pieces of the childcare puzzle, it was important to Underwood that she remained personally involved in making dinner for her boys. 

Personal experience has a huge impact on perspective, which Underwood discovered when she became a mother. “I never knew what it was like to be a mom and a wife and a woman in this business until I became those things,” she told The Tennessean. The experience gave her a deeper appreciation for other famous women that balance raising children with building careers. “It makes me respect those women that I grew up idolizing even more, and I didn't even know all that they had on their plate.”

When she's not touring (or judging on “American Idol”), Underwood can be found on her family farm, enjoying the quieter side of fame. She frequently posts fun updates about farm life on her social media pages, giving fans small glimpses at the life she and Fisher have built together across the years.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Teddi Mellencamp Shares Relationship Update","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/teddi-mellencamp-shares-relationship-update-boyfriend/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:13:27 GMT","

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Teddi Mellencamp has had a challenging year. Not only is she divorcing Edwin Arroyave, but she is also battling cancer. Now, the reality television star is opening up about splitting from her boyfriend but also revealing why it's the best thing for her right now. 

According to Parade, Teddi Mellencamp revealed the news on her “Diamonds In The Rough” podcast, which she co-hosts with Erika Jayne, who is currently on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” 

She said, “You guys, [the] press needs to get on it a little bit faster because by the time they figured out who my mystery man was, we're already done. I had to call things off.” She then went on to discuss the mature reason why she and her now-ex-boyfriend called it quits. 

According to Teddi, “Right now, it started getting to the point where it's starting to get a little bit more serious. I was like, ‘I don't have the capacity for this right now.' He's a really nice guy, couldn't be a nicer guy.”

Teddi Mellencamp continued, “I don't feel my best. So, when I have downtime, I want to rest. It's not even, like, about a need right now, and I think that's the crazy thing about this.”

As the former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star suggested, there was quite some time before her fans learned who she was dating. Before, she referred to him as a nice guy and discussed how much he meant to her. 

According to US Weekly, she was spotted getting cosy with the mystery man in June. Fast forward to July, and it was learned that the man's name is Ricci Rea. He happens to work behind the scenes in the television industry. Notably, he has worked with TBS, ABC, NBC, and others. 

Teddi Mellencamp recently celebrated her 44th birthday. The former “Housewives” star noted the occasion on social media with an Instagram post. It contained an image of her with her children. Teddi said, “43 was pretty rough, but I couldn't ask for a better start to 44 with the world's best cuddlers.”

Many of her fellow Bravo stars wished her a happy birthday in the comments. This includes the likes of Shannon Beador and Lisa Hochstein. Additionally, Edwin Arroyave also made a special post on the platform to celebrate Teddi.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Tom Brady's Rep Jumps to Sofia Vergara's Defense","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/tom-bradys-rep-sofia-vergaras-defense/","Sat, 12 Jul 2025 16:13:27 GMT","

Rumors have been swirling that actress Sofia Vergara and NFL superstar Tom Brady are dating. While many believe they could be a power couple, a report emerged that Tom felt she was too old for him. Now, his representatives are coming to her defense in light of the alleged comments. 

According to Page Six, a representative for Tom Brady spoke to PEOPLE about the hate that's been directed toward his rumored relationship with Sofia Vergara. The person told the outlet, “Tom never said, nor would he ever say, anything like this. It is pure fiction.”

So far, representatives for Sofia Vergara have not responded to the outlet's request for a comment. It's also unclear how the rumor of Tom Brady saying this began. 

So, where did the rumors of a romance between Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara start? In a nutshell, an insider spoke to Page Six and stated that the two had been spending time together in Ibiza, Spain. The person called their connection a “summer romance.”

The rumors stemmed from them both being on the Luminara superyacht, which the Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection launched. The report says there were several A-list stars on the yacht, including Martha Stewart, Kendall Jenner, Kate Hudson, Naomi Campbell, and more. This was a two-night voyage. 

The report goes on to say that Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara had obvious chemistry while on the yacht. They were even photographed sitting next to each other. However, this may not have been by happenstance as the insider said, “He asked to switch seats to sit next to her at dinner.”

Additionally, the two were said to continue hanging out in Spain after the voyage ended. This all comes after Tom Brady attended Jeff Bezos' wedding in Italy. 

In addition to the dating rumors with Tom Brady, Sofia Vergara celebrated a birthday on July 10. She took to Instagram to highlight the occasion with a brand new bikini picture as well as a video of several flowers she'd received. Sofia captioned the image, “Bday in Sardinia!!”

A post shared by Sofia Vergara (@sofiavergara)

Of course, many of her famous friends posted kind messages in the comments, including Heidi Klum and several others. The post currently has more than 700,000 likes on the platform. The accompanying video also includes a red and white birthday cake.

Ed Helms certainly did not end up having the career that his parents envisioned for him. “The Hangover” — and its two sequels — are about as far from traditional, buttoned-up, family-friendly comedy as a movie can get, and this ran precisely counter to Helms' upbringing, as he shared with host Ted Danson on the SiriusXM podcast “Where Everybody Knows Your Name.”

“I grew up in a kind of a repressed Southern home. Politically, very progressive, but still a very socially conservative kind of environment,” Helms said (via Variety). “And so ‘The Hangover' is nuts. That's not what they raised me to do, to be in a movie like ‘The Hangover.' So my parents — at that point they'd seen me do crazy stuff on ‘The Daily Show' and ‘The Office‘ — and so there was some sort of acceptance already, but, still, I was nervous for my parents to see ‘The Hangover.'”

Helms, 35 years old by the time the first “Hangover” movie was released in 2009 (and made over $469 million), ended up putting aside his nerves and taking his parents to the premiere.

 










“I'm looking at my mom, the lights come up, and she's crying. Tears streaming down her face, and, for a second, I'm like, ‘Did I just break my poor mom's heart?'” Far from breaking her heart, Helms' mother was impressed, telling her movie star son, “That was so funny” and giving him a big hug. “I'll just never forget that was such a special moment,” he recalled.

Helms has previously spoken of the difficulty he had dealing with the sudden fame that came with the immediate success of “The Hangover,” which catapulted him from television favorite to major motion picture player.

“It was a tornado of fame and a lot of buffeting. It was very overwhelming,” Helms told Conan O'Brien on his podcast in 2022. “I really was reeling a lot of the time, like in the aftermath of ‘The Hangover,' I was getting scripts for all these different kinds of projects. ‘Like what do I do? I dunno.' I was kind of spinning out and panicking about different things. Like, ‘Well, what kind of a career do you want?'”

Helms credited his co-stars Zach Galifianakis and Bradley Cooper for keeping his feet on the ground.

“If it wasn't for those guys, I don't think I would've stayed sane. But we all had each other to kind of be like, you know, I don't know, just to commiserate and measure ourselves,” Helms said. “And I think we kept each other from drifting too far. And being too unprofessional.”

5.8

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Ghost Ramp

Reviewed:

July 12, 2025

I hate to draw attention to the unrelenting passage of time, but King of the Beach just celebrated its 15th birthday. Wavves' breakthrough album is nearly old enough to drive in frontman Nathan Williams' home state of California, and its shaggy-dog slackerism has endured in the years since its release, spawning a crowd of garage-rock imitators in its wake. And while it's easy to look back on 2010 as an indie rock fever dream sponsored by Urban Outfitters, the album's mix of paranoia, nihilism, and despair still sounds a little radical in its reckless abandon.

Each subsequent Wavves album has been, to some degree, a response to King of the Beach—Afraid of Heights slowed its tempo; V teased out its power pop melodies; You're Welcome returned to its producer, Dennis Herring; Hideaway experimented with its psych rock influences. But there's only so many times one can rhyme “drinking” and “thinking” before the performance of perpetual adolescence starts to wear thin. On Spun, Wavves' ninth record, Williams sounds like even he's beginning to tire of his stoner schtick.

At its best, Wavves' music vibrates with a kind of productive madness. There's a restless creativity on early songs like “Gun in the Sun” and “Beach Goth,” the way their sparkling melodies can't help shining through the haze of his amateur recording setup. The squeals of feedback, the unhinged screams—the strangest, and often strongest, Wavves songs sounded urgent, as if Williams had to get the hooks out of his head before they drove him insane. On Spun, by contrast, it sounds like he's scarcely given these 13 songs a second thought, returning to the same ideas over and over again and hoping we're too baked to notice.

It's tempting to blame Travis Barker, who produced two songs on Spun. The blink-182 drummer is to contemporary pop-punk, in the eyes of some weary rock critics, what Jack Antonoff is to “main pop girls” like Lorde and Taylor Swift. “Leave them alone!,” I want to scream each time I see Barker's name on yet another tracklist, whether Wavves or Sublime or Megan Fox's newborn daughter. Since helping the artist formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly pivot from writing Eminem diss tracks to wielding an electric guitar, Barker has brought sterilized drum fills and excessive vocal processing to artists like Avril Lavigne, Willow, LilHuddy and jxdn, flattening their individual voices into a homogenous whine. It's no different on Spun: Williams' voice is barely legible under layers of digital distortion on the Barker-produced “Goner,” whose palm-muted guitars and egregiously tedious refrain made me wonder if it was cribbed from some MGK reject pile.

This neutered approach seeps into the rest of the album, perhaps because it was otherwise helmed (and, in his telling, essentially commissioned) by frequent blink-182 collaborator Aaron Rubin. It often sounds like they're recording different versions of the same song: “Spun,” “Lucky Stars,” “Gillette Bayonet,” “Big Nothing,” and “Machete Bob” all begin with a filtered, quiet introduction before cranking up the volume and the power chords just in time for the first verse. Williams' vocals sound jarringly upbeat as he sings about wanting to die after smoking weed (possibly a conflict of interest with Williams' new cannabis company?). It's hardly the first time Wavves has paired a bright melody with a lyric about being clinically depressed, but even the bleakness sounds like a bad Hallmark card: “Turn off the oven,” he sings on “Big Nothing,” which, as anti-suicide refrains go, is certainly no “Jumper.”

I kept waiting for the weirdo Wavves to appear—the Wavves who sampled The Crystals' “Da Doo Ron Ron” and made a psych rock record with a member of TV on the Radio. I most clearly hear it on the album's last song, “Holding Onto Shadows.” Sweeping and far slower than anything that precedes it, it opens with soft piano, acoustic guitar, and swelling synths. Thirteen songs in, it feels like catching your breath after 40 minutes of cardio. But Spun mostly sounds like Williams running in place.

	President Donald Trump's decision to deploy masked, armed federal agents to round up community members is one of the more horrifying features of his second term.


Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) brutal crackdown on undocumented migrants across the country has led many activists, members of the public, and Democratic politicians to characterize the agency as a new secret police. Trump's ICE conducts raids at immigration courts, workplaces, and on farmland, with agents regularly dressing in plainclothes, wearing masks and face coverings to hide their identities, and eschewing the use of identifying insignia like badges, agency names, and other markers of their affiliation with law enforcement. “This is authoritarian, militarized secret police; this is not what you see in a democratic government,” Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said in late June.


	New York City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested last month by masked agents while accompanying a man to his immigration hearing — criticized Trump's “warrantless, plain-clothed ICE agents who hide behind masks” on social media Thursday, adding that he's proud to support a state bill “to stop ICE from operating in the shadows.” 

	











	The Department of Homeland Security's X account expressed disgust that Lander would compare ICE agents to “secret police,” as DHS put it, calling this rhetoric “despicable” and claiming that agents “verbally identify themselves” and wear labels. The White House put out a press release the same day claiming that “Democrats Inspire Vicious, Escalating Attacks on ICE,” insisting that “attacks have only gotten more brazen in recent days.” In it, the White House calls out Goldman and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for usage of the term “secret police.”

	











	The administration may publicly dispute the idea that ICE agents are operating like “secret police,” but behind closed doors it's preferred policy — and a fun meme.


	In recent weeks — according to two administration officials and two other Republicans close to the Trump White House — some of the most MAGA contingents of the government have come to embrace, mostly privately, the “secret police” branding as a way to sardonically troll the left's denunciations of Team Trump and ICE operations.

	One Trump administration official tells Rolling Stone that in casual conversations with other Trump aides and advisers, “I've definitely said we should get ‘SECRET POLICE' printed on some T-shirts and merch and make it look kind of badass, but the issue is that it's harder to get away with than the president's mugshot or ‘proud deplorable.'”


	The second Trump administration official adds that there's a recurring “joke” they ask colleagues at the office, when soliciting updates on federal immigration operations: What are the secret police up to today? The official notes: “We're just having a little fun with it. I don't actually think ICE is the secret police.”


	They are certainly having fun with it. One of the sources close to the White House shared a partial screenshot of a group chat, which Rolling Stone confirmed included at least two Trump appointees, in which one MAGA loyalist sent an apparently self-made meme graphic featuring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the words “Trump's Secret Police,” and a picture of Sylvester Stallone as Judge Dredd.


	Three of these MAGA sources say that they, along with other members of Trump's orbit and administration, have repeatedly sent each other their favorite pro-ICE and pro-“secret police” memes they have found in hard-right online fever swamps. Some of them have internally pitched ideas for repurposing particularly “based” images for Trump to post to Truth Social, or for the White House or Homeland Security to promote, with little success so far.

	This doesn't mean the White House or Homeland Security isn't posting its own memes pertaining to ICE”s brutalization of human beings.


	Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) on Thursday reacted to a video of ICE raiding farmland in California by questioning how many alleged gang members “are waking up at 3 a.m. to pick strawberries? O'yeah, zero!” 


	“Trump said he'd go after ‘bad hombres,' but he's targeting the immigrant farm workers who feed America. Either he lied — or he can't tell the difference,” Gomez wrote.

	











	The White House responded with an edited photo of Gomez with an open mouth, sobbing. “ThEy'Re JuSt StRaWbErRy PiCkErS,” the caption read. “That ain't produce, holmes. THAT'S PRODUCT,” the White House wrote, alleging that marijuana is being grown in the fields that were raided. 

ICE: Raids marijuana farms filled with illegal aliensCryin' Jimmy: “ThEy'Re JuSt StRaWbErRy PiCkErS 😭”That ain't produce, holmes. THAT'S PRODUCT. 🌿 https://t.co/D1lr6ij8VB pic.twitter.com/HO2P4XuwKg


	Later on Friday, the White House posted an image of a poster board set up on the White House lawn with a similar typeface, reading “oMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHiS?” The accompanying text read: “Nowhere in the Constitution does it say we can't post banger memes.”


	The administration's memeification of their hardline anti-immigration policies has been going on for months. In February, the White House posted a social media video, titled “ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight,” mocking undocumented migrants being shackled with long chains and loaded onto an airplane. In March, official White House accounts circulated AI-generated cartoons depicting a crying migrant being arrested by an ICE agent. Already a marker of technological dystopia, the image was even more disturbing given that it was rendered in the art style of Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli. In June, DHS posted a video of ICE making arrests set to “Ice, Ice, Baby.”


	While making light of deportations has drawn widespread backlash, the White House, particularly its social media team, remains committed to a hyper-online, meme-heavy PR strategy to sell its immigration platform to the public. 


	The online right is on board. Versions of the phrase “I voted for this” have become celebratory aphorisms and a go-to response to anyone expressing outrage over the conduct of ICE agents. Videos of masked agents conducting raids and manhandling migrants are lauded as exactly the reason Trump's most devoted supporters returned him to the White House. In one X post with over half a million views, the right-wing commentator Chaya Raichik, who posts as “Libs of TikTok” to over 4 million followers, chastised a Fox News host who said many Republicans “didn't vote for people to show up at Home Depots. They didn't vote for people to show up at immigration courts.”


	“FALSE,” Raichik wrote. “This is exactly what I voted for! I voted for MASS DEPORTATIONS of every illegal alien.” 


	When menswear writer Derek Guy acknowledged on X last month that he had come to the United States from Canada as an undocumented migrant in his childhood, Vice President J.D. Vance responded with a meme of Jack Nicholson nodding in response to a user suggesting that Vance had the “opportunity to do the funniest thing ever,” by having Guy deported. 

	











	Of course, the president's advisers, both in and out of government, want to have their fun — but they also are working to blame the left and elected Democrats for any violence that comes ICE's way during Trump's often grossly lawless crackdowns.


	“This is the bedwetting party. Today's Democrat Party is hysterical and must face ridicule, but it is also dangerous,” says conservative attorney Mike Davis, a close Trump ally and key figure of the MAGA legal sphere. “Their rhetoric [about ‘secret police' and other matters] is leading to ambushes of federal law enforcement officials in the line of duty.”


	Trump's administration has accused activists and organizers distributing public notices about ICE activities in local communities or who provide advice to migrants — like the creators of the app ICEBlock — of obstructing justice. Trump mused about arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom amid crackdowns in Los Angeles. Tom Homan, Trump's “border czar,” threatened to prosecute Ocasio-Cortez after she gave advice to undocumented migrants during an Instagram Live event.

	President Donald Trump's administration unlawfully shipped Kilmar Abrego Garcia to an infamous prison in El Salvador — his home nation where a judge barred him from being deported — where the Maryland man says he was tortured. 


	Trump officials refused to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., as the Supreme Court had ordered, for nearly two months, before suddenly bringing him back to face new criminal charges in Tennessee. A magistrate judge found the government's evidence against Abrego Garcia was “simply insufficient” to justify his incarceration, and quickly ordered his release on bail. 


	The Trump administration has worked diligently to ensure that this is bad news for Abrego Garcia: If his release goes forward, as this judge ordered, the Trump administration intends to deport Abrego Garcia as fast as it can, without concluding the criminal case against him. The administration could send him either to El Salvador, if it can strike down his existing “protection from removal” order, or to an undetermined third country like the war-torn South Sudan, where the Supreme Court just allowed Trump officials to deport eight migrants. 

	











	The Trump administration's ongoing legal strategy with Abrego Garcia can best be summed up as: Heads I win, tails you get sent back to El Salvador — or maybe South Sudan or Libya, or some other creatively violent or cruel locale. We'll let you know, when we feel like it.  


	In March, the Trump administration sent Abrego Garcia and hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to CECOT, an infamous mega-prison in El Salvador, in open defiance of a court order. Trump officials renditioned these men to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, without giving them an opportunity to challenge their removal. They were deported based on specious claims that the Venezuelans are members of a gang the president declared a terrorist organization. 

	











	Officials have claimed that Abrego Garcia is a member of the violent gang MS-13. The magistrate judge in Tennessee found their evidence unpersuasive, leading the administration to unveil its alternative plan to punish Abrego Garcia.

	This punishment is not simply necessary because Abrego Garcia's lawyers keep beating the administration in court. For senior Trump officials, much of the administration's cruel deportation agenda rests on this one case — on this one guy's fate.


	According to various Trump administration officials and other sources close to the president, one key reason the government has been fighting so hard on this, at first to keep him imprisoned in El Salvador, and now to keep punishing him, is that officials believe that if they back down on the Abrego Garcia case, it could set a precedent that opens the floodgates to other legal challenges. “Going soft” on this, as one senior Trump appointee puts it, could potentially be used against the administration in court, in challenges not only to different aspects of their immigration crackdowns, but to other ways in which Trump is wielding executive power that have little or nothing to do with immigration, per se.


	Indeed, there's a fear among the MAGA political and legal elite that failing to declare victory in the Abrego Garcia case could make it harder for them to sustain their deployment of the Alien Enemies Act, the invocation of which has been a policy dream of the president, top White House official Stephen Miller, and other Trumpland denizens for years.


	“The last thing you want to do here is contribute to a domino effect of decisions where suddenly you're admitting you're wrong about everything,” another close Trump adviser says. “That is why you gotta stand your ground on everything against the left, including on the [Abrego Garcia] situation.”

	Trump's administration is treating Abrego Garcia so aggressively “because he's a symbol of what they're doing,” an immigration lawyer tells Rolling Stone. “He represents their failure to keep people silent in CECOT. He represents everything that they did wrong when it comes to these removals.”


	It remains to be seen whether Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis, who has presided over the original lawsuit to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, will attempt to block the administration from deporting Abrego Garcia to a third country without due process — or at least a real opportunity to plead his case that he would be at risk of being tortured or killed in whatever third country the Trump administration decides to send him to. 

	











	If she does, Trump officials will no doubt attempt to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court, which the administration has on “speed dial,” as liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor recently put it.


	The court initially unanimously demanded the Trump administration undo Abrego Garcia's unlawful deportation and “facilitate” his return to the U.S., and it also issued a ruling blocking the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants to prison in El Salvador without due process. 


	Since then, it has issued a series of rulings deferring to Trump and greenlighting his most authoritarian aims — including two decisions ensuring the president can deport migrants, without meaningful due process, to South Sudan, a country the State Department warns Americans not to visit “due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.” 


	“Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan,” the State Department says. “Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.”


	In an interview released by Politico on Friday, Trump's “Border Czar” Tom Homan indicated that the administration isn't bothering to track the migrants it just sent to South Sudan. 


	“As far as we're concerned, they're free,” Homan said. “They're no longer in our custody. They're living in Sudan. And will they stay in Sudan? I don't know.”

This post contains spoilers for the Season Two finale of Poker Face, now streaming on Peacock. 


	The second season of Poker Face nearly ends on a cliffhanger. Towards the end of the finale — appropriately titled “The End of the Road” — the show's human lie detector heroine, Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne), is stuck in her beloved 1969 Plymouth Barracuda with master assassin the Iguana (Patti Harrison), heading for a gorge with the FBI in pursuit. The Barracuda goes over the edge, and there's a Thelma & Louise-style freeze-frame implying that hero and villain are about to plummet to their deaths. But then the frame rewinds and we see that Charlie escaped at the last moment. We later learn that the Iguana might have survived as well. 


	The future of the acclaimed retro mystery series isn't quite as precarious as Charlie's seemed in that freeze-frame, but Peacock has yet to order a third season. And both Lyonne and the series' creator, Rian Johnson, don't lack for other projects, including Wake Up Dead Man, the third film in Johnson's Knives Out series, starring Daniel Craig as eccentric master sleuth Benoit Blanc, due out in December. 

	











	In a wide-ranging Zoom conversation last week, Johnson spoke with Rolling Stone about how this season of Poker Face ended, and what might happen in the event of a Peacock renewal. He also reflected on memorable moments of his career as a writer-director, from the Benoit Blanc films to Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

The last time we spoke, it was about the decision earlier this season to let Charlie stop being a fugitive. This season ends with her on the run again, this time from the FBI, after she unwittingly helped an assassin murder a federal witness. Why did you decide to go back to that setup?From the start, it's not like I had that ending mapped out when I started writing the season. I very much resisted the idea of putting a big season-wide arc on the wall. I just wanted to blue-sky individual episodic ideas, just to get the writers room, a few of whom were from last season, and a few of whom were new, in the right headspace. Just remembering that the engine of the show is episodic. So in that way, the arc of the whole thing emerged organically. The decision to put her back on the run again wasn't because her being in one place wasn't working. I thought it was, and that we could keep going like this for a while. But it seemed interesting and fun. For me, part of the way that I see the serialized dusting that we give each season is just to keep things interesting. It puts us in a spot where, if we find ourselves in another writers room again for the show, I don't know what we do next, and that's fine.

After you produced the first season, you seemed excited by the idea of doing this show for as long as you and Natasha could. In that more recent interview, when I asked if you still felt that way, you seemed more worn out from the experience of Season Two. Where do you stand right now on doing more seasons, and where does Peacock stand? I just got back from vacation yesterday. We haven't really started the conversations. If it all makes sense and all comes together, I do love doing the show, and I have a blast doing it, and I feel like I could keep doing it together. But there are a lot of different factors. I'm not the brash young man that I once was!


Patti Harrison's character, Alex, is introduced as Charlie's plucky sidekick, who Charlie likes because she never tells lies. Then she turns out to be the world's greatest assassin and the only person who can successfully lie to Charlie. Where did that idea come from? Part of the fun of this season, and where a lot of these things came from, was starting to kick the tires on different, for lack of a better word, tropes, and what would this trope or that trope look like in the context of the show? We did a two-parter, which was a challenge, because we felt they both had to be genuine Poker Face episodes. Giving Charlie a sidekick, or a Watson, was one of those. That was something we'd been talking about for a while. We dipped our toe in with the Steve Buscemi character, but that's a little more of a framing device. Then it was Laura Deeley, who wrote the finale, who pitched the idea of, “What if it's a Watson who turns out to be a Moriarty?” Because the other thing we've always been kicking around is, if there's somebody out there who Charlie's gift doesn't work on, what would that look like? It was fun in an old-school TV finale way, a swing to take.

Why did you want to cast Patti for this? Besides being someone who I think is hilarious and a good actor who I've wanted to work with for a while, Patti has a good combination: She's very appealing, but she draws you in while simultaneously making you feel like she doesn't give a fuck. To be drawn in by that Watson character, you don't want the audience to get the feeling that Charlie's being played. Patti has a genuine coolness, but also feels like she's cooler than you. I thought that would be an interesting combo that might help that part out.


Whose idea was it to riff on the Thelma & Louise ending, with Charlie's car going off the cliff in a freeze-frame, and then rewinding to show that Charlie got out just in time? That was Laura and I. Laura and I basically broke this episode three quarters of the way through the process of shooting the season. It was just delirious late at night on Zoom. I might have said the words “Thelma & Louise” first, and we ran with it. It's something that I've wanted to figure out if we could get into the show from the start: the car flying off the ramp on the Universal Studios backlot and then freeze-framing halfway in the air and going to commercial. It's something that delights me to no end, and so finessing that in the edit to get it exactly right was something I took great delight in.


It seems like you felt more free to be silly this season with things like the freeze-frame, the alligator episode, and the gym episode with the breast milk. How did you license yourself to go to those places?You're right, that is very much distinct to the season. And I don't know if we'll do that if we keep making the show this way. I think you can tell from talking to me that the show is very much follow your bliss. I just felt like I wanted to have fun this season, and be a little bit sillier. And maybe an audience does, too. You push and pull, and you see if you go too far, and this and that. I didn't want to delve into heavy questions about the nature of truth, even though the show inevitably has some elements of that. I wanted to just have fun, and I trusted that instinct, that maybe at least some of the audience would go with that as well.


You gave Justin Theroux a lot more to do in his episode than you did with his cameo in The Last Jedi. I love him as an actor, man. I was very disappointed I didn't get to be on the set when Justin was working. He's someone I've wanted to work more with, and hopefully will in the future. He's got that leading-man energy that, for that part, was just super-fun, this very scary, almost James Bond villain, or Mission: Impossible. 

	











Is there any more that you shot with him for Last Jedi than you used? That is it! That's all! [Laughs.] That was the whole concept from the very start. 


In two out of three consecutive episodes, you killed off Melanie Lynskey, who Natasha has known forever, and then Melanie's husband Jason Ritter. Were they a package deal? Did you have one on set and realized that the other would be good for the later episode?It feels weird to say it's a coincidence, but it's a coincidence. But it's kind of not, because Natasha knows Jason as well. It's kind of reaching out to friends. But it wasn't at all that we got to one through the other.


One of your guest stars this season told me that most of the casting process is just Natasha going through the contacts in her phone, calling people, and asking if they're free the following week.Process-wise, we don't line up a big chart at the beginning of the season. We're casting week to week. It's a combination thing, where sometimes we go through [casting directors] Mary Vernieu and Bret Howe, and do it officially. But there are a lot of things where it's just crazy text threads with Natasha and I and the showrunner and producer. Because we were shooting in New York, there were just people she runs into at the Bowery, and starts small-talking with and texts me, and goes, “Hey, so-and-so wants to be in an episode and can they show up next week?” That sense of chaos, to me, that's really, really fun.


The first two Benoit Blanc films have very different tones, which isn't always the norm for a series with a continuing character. What made you want to do that?What it comes down to, whether it's in the movies or in the show, I feel like the experience I have making it is hopefully something that will get through and communicate to the audience. In other words, if I feel like I'm repeating the same thing, or turning the crank on the handle and turning out more of what I did last time, I'm not good enough to hide that from the audience. So what I end up chasing is the experience of each of these things. It's not necessarily where I'm going to flip and do a totally different tone, but after three years of working on something that has a particular tone, it's like you've been eating the same thing for lunch every day for three years. I'm more excited about doing something that feels new. That's similar with the show. It's not so much a conscious decision. In order to keep it exciting for myself, I don't want to repeat myself. 

	











Tonally, how would you describe Wake Up Dead Man? It's incredibly different from Glass Onion. We put out a teaser trailer a month ago. It's much more a Gothic, much more grounded tone. It's more similar to the first one in that way. It kind of gets back to the real origins of the genre, which, predating [Agatha] Christie, go back to [Edgar Allen] Poe. 


What's interesting is that Daniel is the star of these films, but Benoit isn't the main character. Marta is our POV in the first film, and by the end of Glass Onion, Helen is clearly the protagonist. It's something that all good whodunnits do. In a lot of Christie's books, she did this as well: There's a protagonist who's not the detective. Ultimately, these types of movies have to be driven by the same engine. You have to care about a character getting or not getting what they want. The detective is more akin to the shark in Jaws, more of a godlike presence in the movie. It's very hard to sell emotional stakes regarding the detectives themselves.


Having now made three of these films, how are you feeling about the future of them? Is it like Poker Face, where you want to keep doing them as long as Daniel is interested?I feel great! Because I have genuinely taken a swing each time that I didn't think would work. Ultimately, that's the thing you're trying to avoid. The second you feel like you know how to do this, that leads nowhere good. So I feel fantastic. And with the movies, we can keep doing that. I don't have something in my head right now. You kind of burn the ship into the sea each time and ask yourself, “How will I make anything ever again?” But I would keep doing them as long as I can.


These films and Poker Face have all been terrific, but have you gotten the urge to take a break from these series and do something stand-alone?  [Holds up a notebook.] I have kind of a stand-alone thing that I'm working on as the next thing. It's not a product of me being sick of murder mysteries. It's just a part of me that felt it would be nice to do something different next. So I'm writing something that's not really in the mystery-mystery genre, and just a standalone thing to do.


Blanc is a tribute to Agatha Christie, among many influences. We've talked about Poker Face being a tribute to Columbo. When you come up with an idea that's a throwback, how do you know when you're bringing enough of an original spin to it that it's not just you doing karaoke?What you just described is hopefully the outcome. But that's not the question I start with. The way that I start is, I do generally have some notion of a genre or a style that would be fun to do. The idea is not that I'm looking at how to freshen it up. I'm looking at something I'm angry about, or thinking about, or wrestling with. Something I'm deeply caring about, and I can dive deeply into using this other thing as a delivery device. It's when the gears come together that the process actually starts. That ultimately is my answer. It's the only way I know how to do it. If it's coming from a personal place, and really genuinely wanting to explore something beyond the style of the genre, then that's the way to make it fresh. 

	











In terms of the thing you're angry about, the first two Blanc films deal a lot with income inequality, and how rich people take advantage of people who don't have anything. Was that an intention with the series?It just kind of happened each time. Stating for me what that thing is, I would never want to just say that, because it would sound very boring. I think what you're describing is true, but it's not the thing that got the film going for me. It has to be something personal, and I don't think I could sit down in the abstract, get angry, and write about the abstract notion of class divide in society.


Have you ever gotten down the road in the development process and realized that what you were doing was too much pastiche and not enough that was new?I've never hit that wall exactly that way. But right after I made Looper, I spent several years trying to crack this sci-fi idea that I had. Ultimately could not make it work. I never really got those gears I described to connect. So it just felt like a high concept that didn't have any innards. But elements of that ended up working their way into the thing that I'm developing next. So, everything comes around.


Three years passed between Brick and The Brothers Bloom, four years after that until Looper, five years from Looper to Last Jedi. Were there reasons for those big gaps?  One of the things I'm trying to get better at is to just write faster. With Star Wars, it was a different thing. I had started exploring my own stuff, and then Star Wars came around, and the prep and writing period was long. But with Bloom and Looper, I'm just a slow writer, just taking several years to write a script. I don't do that anymore. I think that's a good thing. Getting less precious about the process and getting a bit more “sit down and do it” has been healthy. And also, as you get older, you realize time is the most valuable commodity, and who knows how long I'll be able to get things made, so I should take advantage of it while I can. 


What is your media consumption like at home? How much do your tastes overlap with Karina's [Johnson is married to film critic Karina Longworth, host of the Hollywood history podcast You Must Remember This] and how much are the choices one for you, and then one for her?We overlap a lot. Karina and I, we only watch stuff that we overlap with together. I've definitely learned the stuff that she's not into, not to sit down and try to make the case for it. One of the keys to a happy marriage is to watch that stuff on my own. But with Karina's podcast, it's amazing for me. Every night, when she's in research mode, it's like film school. 

	











What are the kinds of things you've learned to watch without her?She's not a big genre person. So anything very sci-fi or fantasy, or anything that's too nerdy, I watch on my own.


A lot of successful directors start out with a film noir, because it's easy to do on a small budget. Is that how Brick came about?I don't know that I was smart enough to make that calculation, although it worked out. Brick ended up being first. When I wrote it, I had just really gotten into Dashiell Hammett's books. I was in my early twenties, and memories of high school were looming large. So the emotional memory of high school, combined with the raw power of these books I tried to get made for the next seven years, and wrote several other things, but none of them were that good. So I kept coming back to Brick, and that ended up being the first one. 


With Brothers Bloom, you're working with a bigger budget, bigger stars — Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel Weisz. What was that experience like?That was one of the best experiences of my life. I had been broke and stuck in L.A. throughout my twenties, so I wrote a big adventure in order to have a big adventure. And I loved con-man movies. It was me trying to fit a tomato into a matchbox — “OK, I get to make another movie,” and trying to fit everything into that. It was an incredibly romantic experience. We were a traveling circus ,rolling around eastern Europe with these lovely movie stars making this crazy, insane thing. And then nobody saw it, really. And I should have been in movie jail for a long time. But my producer, Ram Bergman, figured out how we could get Looper made. 


What do you take out of the experience of having a great time making a movie that then gets ignored? What I took out of that moment was panic: “Ah, shit, did I just blow it? Am I going to be able to make something again?” What it maybe translated into with Looper, was, I really wanted to put the screws to myself, discipline-wise. I wanted to go back to more of a hard genre thing. I had this story based on this short that I had written, and I had this emotional thing that was resonant with me. I spent a lot of time rewriting it. In the writing phase, it was the opposite of being indulgent. 


Bruce Willis, before he got sick, had a reputation of being strong-willed in his interactions with his directors. What was he like with you? The way that we got Looper made was Bruce said yes. We had Bruce Willis with a gun in a sci-fi movie. That got us our financing. I had heard all the stories, too. And then he showed up on set, and I have never had a better experience with an actor. He was lovely, he worked his ass off on it. He really, really worked hard. He wouldn't even go back to his trailer in between takes. He hung out on set. We never moved faster on set than when we were shooting with Bruce. It was the opposite of this image of him. I'm not saying the other stuff isn't true. But I got very, very lucky. And I just had wonderful memories.

	











With Last Jedi, there was a popular conception that you and J.J. Abrams didn't really talk, which is why certain ideas get undone from one movie to the next. What was your actual level of communication with him?  We communicated. We met and I spent days with him and was able to get into his head and all the choices he had made. That having been said, I communicated and I went and made the movie. And he was in the middle of Force Awakens. Ultimately, I feel like the choices in it, none of them were born out of an intent to “undo” anything. They were all borne out of the opposite intent of, how do I take this story that J.J. wrote, that I really loved, and these characters he created that I really loved, and take them to the next step? Kathy [Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm] said, “We're looking at someone to do the Empire [Strikes Back] of this series.” I took that assignment very seriously. Maybe more seriously than someone would have liked. I guess to me that didn't mean making something that just had nods to Empire — that meant trying to genuinely do what Empire did. 


But just to use an example, Force Awakens sets up Snoke as the big villain of the new trilogy, with a mysterious backstory. And then midway through Last Jedi, Kylo Ren slices him in two and takes over the First Order.That was, in reading J.J.'s script, and watching the dailies, and seeing the power of Adam Driver's character. The interrogation scene in the first movie, between Rey and Kylo, was so incredibly powerful. Seeing this complicated villain that's been created, I was just so compelled by that. This is all a matter of perspective and phrasing, but to me, I didn't easily dispense with Snoke. I took great pains to use him in the most dramatically impactful way I could, which was to then take Kylo's character to the next level and set him up as well as I possibly could. I guess it all comes down to your point of view. I thought, “This is such a compelling and complicated villain. This is this is who it makes sense going forward to build around.”


That movie has some of my absolute favorite moments, visuals, and sequences in all of Star Wars. The throne room fight. The Holdo Maneuver. Luke brushing the dust off his shoulder. What was it like for you, as someone who loved Star Wars, to get to play in that sandbox for a little while and get to make things like that?It was insane. I feel like it's hard to even describe how the process was, and getting to work with all those folks at ILM [Industrial Light & Magic, George Lucas' visual effects company], getting to have access to the archive. Everything from it, top to bottom. If you're a Star Wars fan, it was the dream you imagine it would be. There was no, “Yes, but…” to it. It was just magical.

	











There was talk for a while of you being involved with the third movie. And then you weren't. What was the timeline on that relative to you working on Last Jedi? Was that decision made before that film was done or after?I think we must have been wrapping up. But also, to be clear, we had never put our names in the hat. We never were anticipating doing a third one. It was nothing we were pitching ourselves for, and [Kennedy] made the decision. 


The reason I ask is that some people have suggested you thought you might get to do both, and when you discovered that you wouldn't, you decided to squeeze every idea you ever had for Star Wars into this one film.No, absolutely not. The reality is, if I thought I was doing both of them, I would have ended it the same way. From the very start, the assignment was doing [film number] eight, and another director would do nine. I didn't know it would be J.J. But the whole thing was being the middle leg of the race. 


Where did the idea for doing the Holdo Maneuver come from?It came from A New Hope. It was always in my head, when Han tells Luke that without the right calculations they could fly into a star, “and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?” I thought, “Well, if that's physically possible, what would that look like?” It seemed like something that was low-hanging fruit to me in a way. But I knew that if we were going to use it, we have to use it in a very big way; this can't be a casual thing that happens this week. We should build the whole Return of the Jedi-esque three plotlines converging thing around this moment.


In Rise of Skywalker, there's a scene where someone asks why they don't just do the Holdo Maneuver with an unmanned ship, and someone else says that's a million-to-one shot that will never work again. There are a few other things like that in the film, including undoing the idea that Rey was a nobody, and instead is Palpatine's granddaughter. When you saw the movie, or when you learned that they were doing some of those things, how did you feel about that?When I saw the movie, I had a great time watching it. Again, this is all about point of view. I never approach this as, like, a territory I'm carving out for my thing. In my perspective, J.J. did the same thing with the third that I did with the second, which is not digging it up and undoing — just telling the story the way that was most compelling going forward. That means not just validating what came before, but recontextualizing it and evolving and changing as the story moves forward. I didn't feel resentful in some way. But you're talking about a movie made by my friends, with my friends in it. I sit down to watch a movie, and it's a Star Wars movie. It's all stuff I love. I'm not the one to come to for a hard-hitting critique. You can go to YouTube for that. 

	











Speaking of which, Last Jedi was a big hit. It was critically acclaimed at the time. But because there is some subset of some unknown size that is really, really mad online about it, that then becomes the dominant narrative about the movie. What do you remember as that backlash was happening? How did that feel for you to be witnessing it?In the moment, it's a complicated chain of reactions to it. It never feels good to have anybody coming after you on the Internet, and especially coming after you saying things that I think I very much do not agree with about a thing I made and put a lot of heart and soul into. But at the same time, having grown up a Star Wars fan ultimately let me contextualize it and feel at peace with it in many different ways. Just remembering, going back on one level to arguing on the playground about Star Wars as a kid. And I was in college when the prequels came out. My friends and I were Prequel Hate Central. Everyone was ruthless at the time. And of course now the prequels are embraced. I'm not saying that as a facile, “Oh, things will flip around in 20 years, you'll see!” It's more that this push and pull, and this hatred to stuff that seems new, this is all part of being a Star Wars fan. Culture-war garbage aside, I think that essential part of it is a healthy part.


What happened with the other Star Wars trilogy there were talks of you doing?Nothing really happened with it. We had a great time working together, and they said, “Let's keep doing it.” I said, “Great!” I would kick ideas around with Kathy. The short version is Knives Out happened. I went off and made Knives Out, and was off to the races, busy making murder mysteries. It's the sort of thing if, down the line, there's an opportunity to do it, or do something else in Star Wars, I would be thrilled. But right now I'm just doing my own stuff, and pretty happy.


How far did you get in terms of an idea? Was there a whole thing mapped out, at least for what the first of those would be?It was all very conceptual. I made Knives Out fairly quickly after. There was never any outline or treatment or anything. 


Are there certain kinds of movies that you have not yet made that you would like to make?Yeah, absolutely. I would love to do a musical at some point. I am a big musical fan. Any kind of movie I haven't made yet, I would like to make. It's little bit of one book opening another. It's not like I have a drawer full of genre ideas. It's really whatever I'm into at the moment, feeding whatever comes next. 

	











Years before you made Poker Face, you directed a few hours of TV as a hired gun, including a Terriers episode, and three Breaking Bad episodes, one of which — “Ozymandias,” the one that begins with Walt, Jesse, and Hank in the desert with the neo-Nazis — is considered by many to be the best episode of dramatic TV ever made. What was that like? It was bliss. To not have to write? To just be handed a great script by Moira Walley-Beckett, or Sam Catlin? Leslye Headland wrote the Terriers episode I did. I genuinely loved it, but I was also being handed some of the best scripts ever written for television. 


What was your reaction when you first read the “Ozymandias” script?“Holy shit!” Both in terms of what happens in the script, but also, “Are you sure Vince [Gilligan, Breaking Bad creator and sometime director] doesn't want to do this one?” I was very shocked. I felt like I had been handed a massive amount of responsibility. I knew what this was in terms of the series, and I really wanted to get it right for them.

We could talk all day about all the things that happen in that one, so let's stick to one sequence. What do you remember about the scenes at Walt's house — both the fight with Skylar and then him driving away with the baby?  I planned it out very, very carefully, because of the stunt work, and blocked it out with everybody. We had talked it out with Moira, the big emotional beats that we wanted to hit. The big moment for me is when Skylar says, “No.” The moment of getting the blocking right so she's stopping Walter Jr. and putting her hand out, or reaching for the knife instead of the phone. They were born out of things on the page that jumped out as, “Those are big things, and I want to carve them out.” On a TV schedule, you have to really pick your battles. So there aren't things you can find on the day you have to show up thinking, “We're going to take the time to set the camera to 48 frames a second and get this little moment.” But I remember having a lot of fun with the stunt stuff, I remember a lot of laughter and fun when we were shooting that. You kind of have to, when you're doing something that heavy. But the opposite of that is, when you're outside, there were some logistics with the car. The big thing was the moment with Anna [Gunn, who played Skylar] when she comes out and has her breakdown. That, for me, was just incredible to see Anna get to that place, and accomplish it. There was a freak hailstorm when we were shooting that, and we had to wait for the hail to end before we could shoot this thing. And Anna was in a holding room, on ice, which is hard for an actor. And she had to build herself back up. It's one of those rare things where, as a director, to witness an artist do that, and see the finished result of it, it was amazing.

	











Since then, you made Last Jedi, three Knives Out films, two seasons of Poker Face. Did any opportunities like that come to you that you had to turn down because you were doing these other things? Did Vince and Peter [Gould] want you to direct a Better Call Saul?  Saul. I was really bummed. I was just too busy. There was a moment where my buddies Dan [Weiss] and Dave [Benioff] were doing Game of Thrones. They usually shoot those in blocks, so it's a commitment of six months or something. But there was one stand-alone episode, and there was a moment where I was like, “Oh, could that work?” And then it didn't. There's heartbreaks that come along now and then. But again, who knows long long I'll be able to do what I'm doing?

Terror takes the stage as found footage franchise finds a new form of horror


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Things are set to go bump in the night on stage with news that Paranormal Activity is returning to a different kind of theater. According to Variety, a new play inspired by the franchise that began in 2009 is set to scare audiences in a whole new way via a fresh chapter crammed with creaky floorboards and doors slowly closing shut.

Set to arrive in the London West End this winter, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage will follow James and Lou, a couple who move from Chicago to London and discover that their new pad has some unwanted tenants residing in it. Naturally, they take the standard approach that the franchise was founded on and set up a handheld camera to pick up whatever it is that's going bump in the night.

Felix Barrett is directing the production, whose previous work includes the critically acclaimed Sleep No More, an immersive experience where the audience wears masks and is allowed to follow the cast of the production. Levi Holloway has penned the play, whose work includes the hair-raising stage play, Grey House. The new show will run at the Ambassadors Theatre for 12 weeks, creepily kicking things off on December 5.

Following the announcement, Barrett gave a statement saying, “From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theater setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theater offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond.”

It'll be interesting to see just how the tension can be ramped up on stage, given that the show is inspired by a franchise that depends on only minor alterations in scenes before the ghostly presence makes itself more aggressively known. For now, if you want your bones chilled this weekend, why not take a peek at our ranking of found footage horror films here.

Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: the boys

Misha Collins shared that he and Jensen Ackles did an in-character take as Supernatural's Castiel and Dean while filming The Boys Season 5.



In honor of the 20th anniversary of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins took part in an extended retrospective interview with TV Insider and a video featurette where they addressed a number of fans' questions. While the entire conversation is definitely worth a watch, it was their responses to working together on the fifth and final season of Prime Video and Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys that hit our radar. Based on what Collins had to share at one point, it sounds like Ackles and Collins had a moment to slip back into Dean and Castiel mode in front of the cameras – but it might not see the light of day?!?

Beginning at around the 4:10 mark in the video above, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins discuss what it was like reuniting in front of the camera for the final season of the Prime Video series. As Ackles saw it, there wasn't much of an adjustment that needed to be made since the trio still talked and saw each other on a regular basis. Padalecki noted that his biggest concern, ""having not really acted in a year, was that I didn't remember how to act (with Ackles following up with a joke). In terms of being able to differentiate Ackles and Collins from their Supernatural characters while filming The Boys, Padalecki credited the writers and the dialogue being so different from what their previous characters would say that it made things easier.

But before the trio moved on to the next question, Collins dropped an interesting tidbit that we're pretty sure Supernatural fans are going to (politely) demand be released to the public. ""You know, we did on 'The Boys' end up doing a take in character as Cass and Dean,"" Collins shared. ""And that, that's probably the one they're going to use."" Though Ackles wasn't sounding so sure, smiling as he responded, ""Look for that on the editing room floor. That's where that will be.""

Of all the things it could've been, we did not expect this answer!

This story contains spoilers for Resident Alien Season 4, Episode 6, ""Soul Providers.""

Of all the answers Resident Alien could have given us with regards to why the Greys abduct human babies, we did not expect the revelation provided in Season 4, Episode 6, ""Soul Providers.""

Watch new episodes of Resident Alien Fridays at 11/10c on USA Network.

Following his mysterious disappearance from the diner last week, Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk) is brought before the Galactic Housing Council, which charges him with several cosmic crimes, including the theft of the Hawthornes' infant daughter from the Greys' secret base on Earth's moon. According to the plaintiff, the child was an ""essential"" part of SHP, or the ""Soul Harvesting Program,"" which is exactly what it sounds like.

The Greys have created a thriving industry around the collection of souls — defined as ""an immaterial consciousness with quantum correlation that gains it eternal life"" — from humans because we are the only species in the universe to produce them. Baby souls make for the best product because of their ""purity, untouched by life's experiences,"" goes the explanation.

A rather beautiful sentiment... until you realize what that spiritual energy is used for.

The Greys abduct human children and harvest their souls not to gain eternal life, but to turn the coveted substance into an anti-wrinkle cream that also doubles as a ""savory dipping sauce.""

It's the kind of brilliant, sci-fi anticlimax you'd expect from a passage in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books. A metaphysical question our species has debated for centuries is both answered and completely and audaciously turned on its head in the most mundane fashion when placed within the context of a vast and uncaring universe. The meaning of existence is 42, and human souls are worth nothing more than a cosmetic commodity.

You gotta love the chutzpah!

Two grey aliens appear in Resident Alien Season 3 Episode 8.

""That was Alan's idea, actually,"" creator, showrunner, and executive producer Chris Sheridan told USA Insider over Zoom. ""It solved some problems because we spent a lot of time trying to figure out, ‘It's gotta be this grand thing! Where are we going with it?' And then Alan pitched, ‘Maybe it's just a wrinkle cream.' It was so funny and honestly so perfect for what it is. All this work and all these abductions for some ridiculous reason seems so fitting for things today. That was Alan's idea, and it was great.""

""This show really speaks to me,"" Tudyk said. ""The world that Chris has created... if you set out to create it, you're not gonna get there, or else everybody would. [It's a place] where you can have real interactions between characters and meaningful, touching moments, and actually say something like art should.

""Simultaneously, you can do some of the goofiest, craziest, silliest, most bizarre, gross things,"" Tudyk added. ""It leaves that open because of the alien [element]. They're aliens, and since the beginning, it's always had that ability to go completely [bonkers] because it's all unknown. It's anything, so after reading it, it just struck me, just because I identify with the show and what Chris has created so much. I happened to catch it.""

Season 4 of Resident Alien drops new episodes on Fridays on USA Network and SYFY. All episodes will be available to stream exclusively on Peacock one week after they air.

    Why there's no scientific basis for blaming the longtime drought-fighting practice for the tragic Central Texas flooding.
  


        Sasha von Oldershausen is a staff writer who covers news and politics.
      

In the aftermath of deadly floods in Central Texas, a bizarre theory emerged on social media: This was no act of God or natural disaster—it was man-made.

“We must end the dangerous and deadly practice of weather modification and geoengineering,” declared Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, on X. She was joining other online voices—many from the political far right—in blaming last week's tragic events on cloud seeding, a technology that's been used in Texas for decades. The science behind it dates back even further. To combat drought, planes take to the sky to release silver iodide particles into rain clouds to increase precipitation.

Texas Monthly spoke with Jonathan Jennings, formerly the operational meteorologist of the West Texas Weather Modification Association and a former president of the international Weather Modification Association, to discuss the realities of cloud seeding—its effectiveness, its limitations, and how the practice became a lightning rod for political controversy.

Texas Monthly: It's a tough time to be in the cloud-seeding business.

Jonathan Jennings: It is just so frustrating and disappointing to see that people are going this route, especially considering that the claims they're making are completely wrong. During my time in Texas, we had, in 2014, someone claim they were going to shoot our planes out of the sky if we took off. They claimed they were actually at the airport waiting for us to take off. So it's nothing new to us. It's nothing new. I don't want to say we've become numb to it, but it is part of it.

TM: I was under the impression that cloud seeding had only more recently become politicized.

JJ: What's interesting is if you look at the current state of cloud seeding programs—Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Texas—these are red states, and the primary people that operate and manage these programs are more right-leaning people. The state of Tennessee was the first to issue a cloud-seeding ban. When they were going through that, one of the legislators noted that cloud seeding was widely accepted across red states as well as blue. Water is not a partisan issue. It's truly a big deal for everybody involved.

TM: Can you explain how the technology works?

JJ: What we call cloud-condensation nuclei, CCNs, are what water droplets attach to. And the clouds in Texas, especially in the early and late seasons, when we have a lot of winds, are infested with very small, hydrophobic CCNs—like dust. Caliche is actually the biggest issue. So all these types of aerosols get embedded in our clouds, and not all these aerosols are great CCNs. If you have a lot of dust particles getting into your cloud, they start to steal moisture away from the more hygroscopic [water-attracting] particles, which allow cloud droplets to grow more efficiently. The clouds are sick.

Rain can form in clouds in the warm lower layer or the cold higher layer. In the warm layer, when two cloud droplets collide with one another, if they're large enough, they will coalesce into a larger particle. Then they collide with another particle and coalesce into an even bigger particle, eventually becoming big enough and falling as a raindrop. But when these CCNs are so small, like in Texas, that's not happening at an efficient rate.

At the cold layer, the water droplets are supposed to freeze and grow and become heavy enough and fall as precipitation. The ice-growth process is much more efficient than the collision-and-coalescence process. The problem is, when a thunderstorm starts to grow and you have inflows sending those water droplets high into the cloud, these very small CCNs in Texas get exposed to freezing temperatures but they won't freeze. They basically get stuck hanging out in our cloud without being able to precipitate out, because they're just so small.

In cloud seeding, we introduce silver iodide. We're at the base of the cloud, burning pyrotechnic flares that distribute a smoke trail carrying silver iodide into the cloud, and that interacts with the smaller water droplets at the higher layer to allow freezing to occur. Silver iodide mimics an ice crystal and tricks the water droplets into thinking it's ice. It also allows freezing to occur at a warmer temperature. Now you just have a ton of ice developing in the cloud.

Cloud seeding enhances precipitation. It doesn't make precipitation. Rain is already happening while we're cloud seeding. What we're trying to do is squeeze that sponge just a little bit more, get a little bit more out of the cloud than what would've otherwise rained.

TM: What do the data show about the scale of increased precipitation that cloud seeding can produce?

JJ: The impacts from cloud seeding are still within what we call the natural variability of a cloud. So we're effective, but it's really hard to measure the effectiveness on a percentage basis. All the data suggests about a 10 to 15 percent increase. In Texas, the evaluations there are showing about a 1-to-1.5-inch increase during a six-month season. On a storm-by-storm basis, we're not talking about a whole lot of water. But it adds up over the course of a season.

TM: Can you definitively say that the deluge that led to the Guadalupe River flood was not the result of cloud-seeding efforts?

JJ: In the flood, there was no cloud seeding that took place that day or the day before. So yes, we can definitely say that 100 percent of the rain that occurred in that flooding event was natural. When you seed the cloud, you'll start to see a response in about 15 to 20 minutes. And the average cloud lifetime in Texas is probably 45 minutes to an hour. At that point, it's over. The impacts of seeding are over.

The last cloud-seeding flight that took place was July 2 at one o'clock in the afternoon, and it was just outside of Victoria, Texas, miles and miles away from the start of the flood. It is physically impossible for the impacts to have occurred. It's not like the silver iodide stays in the air.

TM: Where does the silver iodide go?

JJ: It precipitates out of the cloud. It falls to the ground.

TM: This isn't exactly a new technology for Texas. How did it come about?

JJ: Cloud seeding in Texas dates back to the 1950s. During that time, there were no laws—there were a bunch of cowboys flying planes out in West Texas trying to seed clouds. Silver iodide and dry ice were the primary seeding mechanisms back then. And that was all based on research that occurred in the 1940s by General Electric. After the Dust Bowl, all these people got excited. They thought, “Wow, this is a good way to try to bring more water.”

TM: Where does the funding for these operations come from? How much money is being funneled into the technology? And how broad are these operations in Texas?

JJ: I would say 90 percent of the funding is water districts. Ten percent is probably a combination of county commissioners, private donations, or irrigation districts. It's mostly a West Texas thing. But you do have the South Texas program, which is west of San Antonio. And they do work in conjunction with the Edwards Aquifer Authority. I think the overall acreage or coverage of the program is probably 25 million acres, which is probably one-seventh of the state. With all the programs combined, local support, it's probably around a million dollars a year.

TM: How did we go from the excitement about the technology in the post–Dust Bowl era to where we are today, when cloud seeding is being blamed for natural disasters?

JJ: I think social media has been a major issue, especially social media that is unregulated. I don't even know if they're real or if they're bots coming from Russia or China, but they do a really good job of engagement farming. They know that there are some really gullible people in America that are willing to grab onto these things, and next thing you know, it's spreading like wildfire, and that's when the death threats start happening. And it's not just us. Public health—the whole vaccine thing. It's the same thing.

TM: There are people who are really skeptical of cloud seeding's efficacy. Some have gone so far as to call it a scam or snake oil. How do you respond to the suggestion that cloud seeding is quack science?

JJ: Though there are still some unknowns about the exact efficacy of the cloud-seeding program, even if we were orders of magnitude off in our evaluations, a 1 percent increase of precipitation in these drought-stricken areas is a big deal. That's what really frustrates me about Marjorie Taylor Greene wanting to ban weather modification. She's in Georgia. They don't have water issues in Georgia like we do.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know what kind of political leaning West Texas is, and they've been funding these programs for over two decades. If they thought it was a scam, they would've stopped a long time ago. These farmers and ranchers, they understand weather, they understand precipitation, they see it working firsthand.

TM: It takes quite a bit of hubris to say that you can engineer the weather. Is it possible?

JJ: We are not engineering the weather. We are giving what's already there just a little bit of a nudge to work a little bit better. If we were able to engineer the weather, drought wouldn't happen. But the technology is decades from ever getting to that point. In fact, I'm willing to bet it never gets to that point.

The release earlier this year of the last reported bunch of classified files about the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy yielded information on various mysterious CIA plans worldwide — but no agency involvement in Kennedy's murder.

There was never any actual contact between the CIA and the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald; no second shooter; no money trail; no phone call or paper trail; no game-changing witnesses; and no evidence of a cover-up after the shooting. The whole turn of events represented a setback, albeit temporary, to the conspiracy-theory community.

ADVERTISEMENT

Fear not, though, theirs is not a crusade to be abandoned lightly. The conspiracists are already gathering and frantically scouring the files, desperately searching for some unrevealed, incriminating scrap of paper the CIA neglected to destroy.

The Kennedy assassination is part of the conspiracy community's Holy Trinity — along with the death of Princess Diana, allegedly murdered with the complicity of British officials, and the 9/11 attacks, thought to be carried out with direct American involvement. Throw in the 1969 moon landing if you like to make it the fourth horseman of the apocalypse.

For conspiracy theorists, no defeat is final. There's always more to the story, and no investigation will ever be sufficient. The release of documents, like commissions and books that fail to find a conspiracy, is simply part of larger conspiracies that are somehow capable of manipulating the findings of investigations decades later.

Ancient Greek logicians understood that proving a negative statement, such as “there is no Santa Claus,” requires examining every possibility, no matter how ridiculous. This borders on the impossible, and because stating “there was no conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination” involves proving a negative, this is fertile ground for conspiracists, who can never be refuted conclusively and always have an explanation to dismiss uncomfortable facts.

The only “facts” of their trade are those convenient to their theories: a grassy knoll in Dallas, where a sniper apparently avoided being seen by dozens of nearby people, managed to conceal a weapon, left no trace of escape, and fired a bullet refuted by forensics. Or the ballistics of a pristine bullet, which was not pristine but minimally damaged after losing momentum by passing through the soft tissue of two people. It could be the blinding lights in a Paris tunnel and an itinerant driver's sizable bank account or the supposed controlled demolition and physics of a pancake collapse of Twin Towers.

Inconvenient facts must be dismissed summarily, and provable alternatives must be avoided.

When supposed conspiracies involve murder, it's helpful if the killer is killed. Consider a newly elected president, with a right-wing ideology different from his left-wing predecessor, who promises to change domestic and foreign policy, shot by a lone gunman who, despite experienced Secret Service agents, is in unbelievably close proximity. The gunman has a murky background, his father is a wealthy industrialist, and the gunman's stated motive is to impress a Hollywood actress.

ADVERTISEMENT

I am not referring to the assassination attempt made on then-candidate and now-President Donald Trump last summer but the shooting of President Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. 44 years ago, an event begging for a conspiracy.

Had Reagan died, and had the Secret Service killed Hinckley during the attempt (he must be silenced, you know) would anyone believe such a preposterous story? Surely Hinckley was a patsy! It must have been (choose one): Russians, leftists, right-wing industrialists, the CIA, or the Trilateral Commission. But because Reagan and Hinckley both lived: no conspiracy. Imagine the difference for the Kennedy conspiracy if Oswald's shots had not killed Kennedy and Jack Ruby had not killed Oswald. But conspiracy theorists tell you it had to happen that way, that there are no coincidences.

A saying often attributed to the beat novelist William Burroughs defines paranoia as “having all the facts.” In a sense, that's correct because there really are genuine conspiracies out there: Watergate, Iran Contra, the covert expansion of the Vietnam War, perhaps even the origin of COVID-19. For the better part of 30 years, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover denied the existence of organized crime, an obvious conspiracy — with mobsters, no less.

It's understandable to have some distrust of authority; it used to be called the establishment, and now it is the “deep state.” But there's a difference between a healthy distrust of authority and believing that on 9/11 a missile hit the Pentagon, not a hijacked jet whose passengers all died.

A famous apocryphal statement made by Abraham Lincoln asserts, “You can fool some of the people all of the time.” Today's current polling data would place the figure for “some” at between 30% and 50%, a remarkably consistent figure involving Diana's death, 9/11, and the Kennedy assassination.

Conspiracy theorists would interpret this adage by saying between 60% and 70% of the people are being fooled all of the time. They might point out, correctly, that the most heinous murder of the 19th century, John Wilkes Booth's assassination of Lincoln, was not a lone gunman acting randomly but rather the main figure in a conspiracy of assassins.

So, don't be surprised, despite the release of the files, to hear of some new Kennedy bombshell. Remember the truth is out there — but conspiracy theorists always get the final word.

      Submission Statement
    


      The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released a series of previously undisclosed documents confirming multiple drone incursions over the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas—a facility that plays a critical role in the nation's nuclear weapons program. The records, released as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by The Black Vault on January 16, 2024, reveal significant security concerns dating back at least two years, including incidents in 2022 and 2023 that were not previously made public.
    


      The FOIA request sought all records, including photos, videos, reports, and internal communications related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over Pantex. It also specifically requested any communications between Pantex and the U.S. government's UAP Task Force (UAPTF) or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).
    


      The Pantex Field Office, along with its Management and Operating (M&O) contractor PanTeXas Deterrence, LLC, identified seven responsive records. Among them were internal reports that detailed two distinct drone incursions—one occurring in October 2022 and another in June 2023. Both incidents were classified as “Management Interest (AMI)” level security concerns.

European Union leaders are sounding off on the 30% tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose on the trade bloc, with most emphasizing the need for unity, constructive dialogue and their readiness to work toward an agreement by Aug. 1.

""Imposing 30% tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement. ""The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership.""

Some leaders were more critical of Trump's latest move. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said it's ""concerning and not the way forward"" in a post on X. Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of Spain, also took to X, calling the duties ""unjustified."" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson noted that the EU ""is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary,"" while emphasizing that it would be best to avoid such a move.

On Saturday morning, Trump announced the 30% tariff rates in letters to von der Leyen and Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, posted on his Truth Social account. The U.S. president warned that if the EU or Mexico retaliate with higher tariffs, ""then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added on to the 30% that we charge.""

Trump also said there would not be tariffs on goods from Europe ""or companies within the EU"" that build or manufacture products in the U.S. This week, Trump sent similar letters to 23 other U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Japan and Brazil, setting blanket tariff rates ranging from 20% up to 50%.

Here's how European leaders have reacted to the latest salvo in Trump's trade skirmish:

Von der Leyen's statement emphasized the EU's commitment to dialogue and stability:

""We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.

Meanwhile, we continue to deepen our global partnerships, firmly anchored in the principles of rules-based international trade.""

The Dutch Prime Minister said in an X post:

""The US announcement of 30% tariffs on goods imported from the European Union is concerning and not the way forward. The European Commission can count on our full support. As the EU we must remain united and resolute in pursuing an outcome with the United States that is mutually beneficial.""

Kristersson said on X that the EU would be ready to impose countermeasures, but emphasized the need to avoid that.

""We support the EU Commission's desire to continue seeking a negotiated solution. The EU is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary. However, everyone loses in an escalated trade conflict, and it is US consumers who will pay the highest price. Sweden stands up for free trade and international cooperation.""

The French President echoed the possibility of employing countermeasures if no agreement is reached by August, in a post on X.

""With the President of the European Commission, France shares a very strong disapproval regarding the announcement of horizontal customs duties of 30% targeting European Union exports to the United States, effective from August 1.

In European unity, it is more crucial than ever for the Commission to assert the Union's determination to resolutely defend European interests. This notably involves accelerating the preparation of credible countermeasures, by mobilizing all available instruments, including the anti-coercion mechanism, if no agreement is reached by August 1.

On this basis, France fully supports the European Commission in the intensifying negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement by August 1, so that it reflects the respect owed between commercial partners like the European Union and the United States, with shared interests and integrated value chains.

Trump's letter is ""both impertinent and a slap in the face,"" Lange said on X. ""We've been negotiating intensely for more than three weeks - made offers to improve things in mutual interest. Real willingness to negotiate looks different.""

""Period of waiting is over: We've postponed the first stage of countermeasures. Firmly convinced they should come into force as planned on Monday, quickly followed by the second list. Activation of rebalancing measures to be discussed.

The Italian government said in a statement:

""We trust in the goodwill of all stakeholders to reach a fair agreement that can strengthen the West as a whole, given that—particularly in the current environment—it would make no sense to trigger a trade dispute between the two sides of the Atlantic. It is now essential to remain focused on the negotiations, avoiding polarization that would make reaching an agreement more difficult.""

""Economic openness and trade create prosperity. Unjustified tariffs destroy it,"" Sánchez said in an X post. ""That is why we support and will continue to support the Commission in its negotiations to reach an agreement with the US before August 1. United, Europeans form the world's largest trading bloc. Let us use that strength to achieve a fair agreement.""

""The EU and US enjoy the biggest trade and investment relationship in the world. When issues arise between us, they should be resolved by close and respectful dialogue ... While it has been clear that all options remain on the table, the EU has also been clear that our preference is for a negotiated solution that avoids escalation. That remains the case.""

            Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI issued a lengthy apology Saturday for a series of violent and antisemitic posts from its Grok chatbot this week, blaming a system update.
    


            “First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” the company wrote.
    


            xAI says a system update had chatbot Grok refer to “existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views,” caused it to issue responses that praised Adolf  Hitler, repeated conspiracy theories and spewed longstanding antisemitic tropes.
    


            In a series of posts early Saturday on Grok's official X account, the company said the coding change update was active for 16 hours.
    


            The incident underscored many of the dangers of AI, a nascent technology that critics and tech evangelists both say could upend the global economy and cause significant social upheaval along the way.
    


            Grok spouted antisemitic tropes and white nationalist talking points earlier this week in response to user prompts. xAI froze the chatbot's X account on Tuesday evening, though users could still talk to the bot on the private tab.
    


            “We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,” xAI said.
    


            According to xAI, the problematic instructions were: “You tell it like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct,” “Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response,” and “Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, don't repeat the information which is already present in the original post.”
    


            Those instructions steered Grok “to ignore its core values in certain circumstances in order to make the response engaging to the user,” xAI said.
    


            “In particular, the instruction to ‘follow the tone and context' of the X user undesirably caused the @grok functionality to prioritize adhering to prior posts in the thread, including any unsavory posts, as opposed to responding responsibly or refusing to respond to unsavory requests,” the company said.
    


            As the company issued its explanation, it turned Grok's X account back on, meaning the bot was back to engaging with users publicly on X.
    


            Grok's antisemitic turn was not the first time the AI had veered into controversy. In May, the bot began bringing up claims of “white genocide” in South Africa to completely unrelated prompts. The company later said a “rogue employee” was behind the change.
    


            Musk was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a “white genocide” was committed in the nation, a claim that has been rejected by a South African court and by experts.

Media report that police have confirmed the identity of the young backpacker, who went missing in early July.

A German backpacker who went missing in western Australia almost two weeks ago has been found alive, media reported on Friday.

Police have confirmed that the person found is 26-year-old Carolina Wilga, Australia's Sydney Morning Herald reported.

""She's been ravaged by mosquitoes. She's obviously been through an amazing journey, a trauma, and no doubt will be a testimony demonstrating her bravery in the circumstances out there,"" Western Australia police inspector Martin Glynn told reporters.

A passerby ran into Wilga on a path in the bush, Australian media reported. 

Her reappearance follows a large-scale search that dragged on for days.

The German backpacker had last been seen in the town of Beacon, north-east of Perth on June 29. The first clue police found since then was coming across her van on Thursday in a remote area of the Australian outback.

Wilga's phone had been switched off, with local media reports saying she had previously kept in regular contact with her family in Germany.

Western Australia (WA) Police Acting Inspector Jessica Securo told broadcaster ABC that the search Wilga had been concentrated
around her Mitsubishi van that had been found near Karroun Hill, around 300 kilometres (186 miles) north-east of Perth.

Police said the vehicle appeared to have suffered mechanical issues and was found with plastic orange traction tracks placed beneath the rear wheels, apparently after getting stuck in the terrain.

Securo told ABC Radio Perth, before reports she had been found emerged, that she had likely become lost in that area.

""The terrain — it's outback country and there's large rocky outcrops, so although there's a number of tracks, you can see how it would be easy to become lost or disorientated in that area if you didn't know it well.""

President Donald Trump has announced 30 percent tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, to go into effect on Aug. 1, a deadline that applies to a bevy of reciprocal tariffs that Trump said he's imposing on many of America's trading partners to address long-running trade imbalances and other factors.

In letters posted on social media on July 12, Trump said that the two trading partners had for years imposed various tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers on the United States and that the duties they now face seek to correct that imbalance.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"
