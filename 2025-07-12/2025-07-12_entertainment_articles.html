                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With four kids under the age of four—including newborn twins—the young couple has reached a major milestone faster than Jed's parents ever did. “We've known each other five years,” Katey shared. Jeremy Vuolo didn't hesitate to ask the obvious: “So you guys are four in four years—are you going to keep going?” Jed responded, “We're just praying about that,” while Katey added they're currently taking a “sabbatical” from growing the family. “We would love to just enjoy the kids we have right now for a good minute,” she said. “It's an insanely busy season, the little years—especially because we have two infants right now. Still, they admitted they “both have a number in mind.” Katey revealed, “We'd love to have five or six kids.” As noted by TV Insider, Jim Bob and Michelle's fourth child, Jill Duggar, wasn't born until their eldest, Josh Duggar, was three years old. Parenting four kids under four isn't easy, and Jed and Katey are the first to admit it—especially now that they've entered the world of twins. No, we're both changing them at the same time.” The couple also opened up about naming their oldest, Truett. “We love Chick-fil-A,” Jed joked, “but that's not why we named him that.” Katey clarified, “The meaning of the name is ‘warrior for Christ,' and his middle name, Oliver, means ‘peace.' Their fast-growing family may be a handful, but they wouldn't have it any other way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pentagon deleted and reposted a video boasting about how President Donald Trump's administration will increase its use of drone warfare. In the video, former Fox News host and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the military will manufacture and use more drones. “We were brought here to rebuild the military,” he says. So while our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us, we were mired in bureaucratic red tape. “In June, President Trump issued an executive order unleashing American drone dominance to bolster our drone industry and arm our war fighters, because that's what we're all about.” As he speaks, a quadcopter holding what appears to be a blank piece of paper is hovering above Hegseth's head. “This afternoon, representatives from X reached out to DoD regarding a video posted to our social media page and asked that the video be removed due to a copyright issue with the song ‘Enter Sandman' by Metallica. The video has been taken down, corrected, and re-uploaded to our page,” said Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson. During his first time in office, Trump dramatically increased the military's use of drone strikes. An instrumental version of “Enter Sandman” played during the president's recent lackluster military parade, which outraged Metallica fans. Rolling Stone reported that parade organizers were even issued a cease-and-desist letter over “illegally” playing “He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,” after they were explicitly told they could not use the song. So many musicians have opposed Trump's use of their music that there is a Wikipedia page devoted to it, listing more than 40 artists. “Metallica got wind of this and they said, ‘Hey, please don't use our music because we don't want to promote violence. In 2016, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich told Vulture there's not much the band can do about the military using its music that way. “I've had to sit there and answer questions like, ‘How do you feel about the U.S. military using your songs to torture prisoners?' I mean, as much as that makes me squirm, when you hand those recording master tapes to the FedEx guy and then the music goes out into the world, you've gotta let it go. So if [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan likes Metallica, hallelujah, it's fine with me.” Why Trump's Admin Insists on Terrorizing Kilmar Abrego Garcia From Grateful Dead to Metallica, These Band Tees Are Under $30 for the Last Few Hours of Amazon Prime Day Ulrich was born in Denmark and is not a U.S. citizen. When asked about his thoughts on Bruce Springsteen calling Trump a “moron,” he explained: “If Bruce Springsteen felt that, then he should say it.

More than 128,000 tickets were sold for 465 screenings of 108 features, 23 documentaries, and 44 shorts. “A funny valentine to the fading art of being true to yourself, Miro Remo's delightfully inventive documentary is a portrait of bickering twin brothers who may live a weird, off-grid life on their dilapidated farm but who, in a world as mad as ours, actually might be the sanest people on earth,” the Crystal Globe jury, which consisted of Nicolas Celis, Babak Jalali, Jessica Kiang, Jiří Mádl, and Tuva Novotny, wrote in a statement that the film. “In the lifestyle it portrays but also in the filmmaking risks it takes and the raucously loving brotherhood it admires, ‘Better Go Mad in the Wild' feels like a gulp of fresh, woody air, or a quick dip in an outdoor pond, or a moment of contemplation as a cow chews on your beard.

Pia Tjelta won Best Actress for Norway's “Don't Call Me Mama,” directed by Nina Knag, while Àlex Brendemühl won Best Actor for Spain's “When a River Becomes the Sea,” directed by Pere Vilà Barceló.

The Proxima Grand Prix, worth $15,000, was given to “Sand City” from Bangladesh, directed by Mahde Hasan. Wrote the jury, “A realm unknown, where architecture breathes and silence screams. Time drips sideways in this fractured hourglass, and color spills like memory. They also awarded a Special Jury Prize worth $10,000 to Colombia's “Forensics.” “For years, streaming giants have commodified Latin American stories of violence and have transformed them into consumable drama,” their assessment wrote. Films that decolonize the gaze and propose new paradigms, because the old ones justify colonial narratives and systems of exclusion, whose consequences are bodies silenced, erased, and disappeared into the void of war — never to return. The judges gave a special menton to “Before / After,” directed by Manoël Dupont from Belgium, writing, “Sometimes a film comes along that surprises you — not with spectacle, but with honesty. ‘Before / After' is one of those rare stories: simple, odd, and deeply human.

In a new interview, the Last of Us alum revealed that although MAGA supporters think Ron would've voted for Trump, Offerman gave examples as to why the fictional character would've “despised” him. Like, dumb people insist that Ron Swanson would've voted for Trump,” Offerman said in an interview with IndieWire. “And I don't deign to answer myself. I take it to Mike Schur, the main creator of Ron, and he said, ‘Swanson would've despised Trump, because Ron loved capitalism. And Trump made the stupidest move you could make as a capitalist, which is to go into public service. And that's just an example of all the people and value sets that Ron would despise, because Ron is a good person.” RELATED: ‘Civil War' Premiere: Nick Offerman On If Donald Trump Inspired His POTUS Take & If He Would Run For Office With Megan Mullally Offerman has been a critic of Trump and, during the 2024 Presidential election, revealed that he was “Proud to Be a Kamala man.” The actor released a song to help raise funds for Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SATURDAY UPDATE: On Friday, Warner Bros/DC's Superman added another $21.5M from 78 international box office markets. That brings the offshore flying cume to $40M through Friday. Globally, with Friday's domestic count, the worldwide running total is $96.5M. While we still have Saturday and Sunday to come overseas, what's clear here is that domestic is leaning harder into this latest iteration of the Man of Steel. All told, the James Gunn-directed Superman is expected to reach $210M+ in its worldwide bow. This is slightly above where we had it before the weekend, and of course could shift given Sat/Sun play. We can't exactly call it kryptonite, there are some areas where Superman is facing a challenge: Asia is soft, for example. Though this should not come as a surprise. We've previously noted that Korea is a depressed market and that Clark Kent was not expected to make an impact in China. 1 with a 66% share of the Top 5 films. China, as noted, grossed $2.4M through Friday including sneaks. Superman is an unsurprising non-starter in the market. The ultimate full-run prediction there is just above $11M. In happier news, Spain opened on Friday to $1M at No. 1 as the biggest debut for Gunn and 7% higher than Justice League, 29% over Aquaman, 77% ahead of Wonder Woman and 106% above Thunderbolts. Japan, which is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next Demon Slayer movie next week, had a fantastic start with $781K, super-passing comps. The Top 5 through Friday are: Mexico ($3.8M), UK ($3.6M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.5M) and France ($2.5M). PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: DC/Warner Bros' Superman has begun zipping around the world, ringing up $40.3 million through Wednesday and Thursday in North America and 57 overseas markets. The split there is a record-making $22.5M in domestic previews Thursday night, while $17.8M has come from the international box office so far in the movie's first two days of offshore release. The global total to date does not include Friday's estimates for North America. The James Gunn-directed latest installment about the Man of Steel debuted in nine offshore markets on Wednesday, with another 48 markets joining Thursday. Today adds another 21, which takes the total number of international territories in release to 78. In terms of openings on Wednesday, France was a No. 1 start at $1.3M including previews and ahead of a long weekend for Bastille Day; the debut is 3% above Thunderbolts and also over the most recent Venom and Aquaman movies (+8%). Korea, which we continue to stress is a depressed market, started at $700,000 on Wednesday. Imax repped a strong 18% of the box office from 26 locations. Italy's Wednesday opening of $519K was a No. 1 start and roughly on par with Justice League as well as 2% bigger than Man of Steel, 51% ahead of Guardians the first, 97% bigger than Wonder Woman and 159% higher than Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom. 1 with results on par with Thunderbolts and ahead of GOTG1 & 2, Man of Steel, The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick. The Philippines on Wednesday saw Supes dominate at No. This is the 2nd biggest opening day for a DC movie ever and is roughly on par with The Batman. 1 and claimed the best opening day of 2025 to date. Super DC market Brazil came in with a strong No. The launch day was bigger than all Guardians movies as well as Joker and The Batman, notably. 1 accounting for half of the total market. Opening day results are roughly on par with The Batman and higher than Aquaman and the Mission movies The Top 5 through Thursday are: Mexico ($2.2M), Brazil ($2M), France ($1.8M), Australia ($1.3M) and Korea ($1.1M). China, where we have already estimated this is not going to move the needle, opened today to $2.4M. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Haters gonna hate, I'm not a James Gunn fan at all for various reasons! However his Superman is a runaway hit!The most human man of steel movie ever made! You will believe a man can fly! Can you sound more like part of the marketing for this film? You even use the slogans and all that. I only wish they got rid of his underwear. For 15 years we were finally on the path of freeing Superman from his underwear (DCEU, Superman and Lois, Injustice games etc) and now it's back. Some say that Superman's identity is his underwear, but that could be said about Batman and Wolverine too, yet they got theirs removed. This doesn't look like it will hit a billion either. Last year there were four $1 Billion dollar grossing movies (3 from Disney, and Despicable Me 4 with $970 million is close enough). or is maybe your theory simply wrong? Because those were Disney and Despicable Me movies. They are known for giving an experience on the big screen. And one of those three was Deadpool and Wolverine, which everyone thought won't happen after Disney bought 20th Century Fox. Listen, I'm a Marvel guy but I'm happy with Superman's success as long as it silences the Synder cult. So basically you don't like the film, you just want to use it as weapon in your online feud, you should be embarrased to even write that. well they didnt write ANY of that. That's crazy cause presales for fantastic four (when comparing day before release) are better than Superman in many international markets and here in the states 😭😂 Yeah right….Fandango reports Superman has now blown past Fantastic Four ticket sales, becoming the #1 first-day ticket seller of the year. OS is going to be really weak. How is between 200M and 250M supposed to be weak? They (the overseas numbers) will not get to 250m total. Will make $550 million at the most since superhero movies drop off quickly. I think it will earn around the same as Man of Steel. Tbh I feel like this movie will have a much better holdout than Captain America — I almost slept through that one, but just saw Superman last night & am now planning on seeing it again next weekend. Forget billion, this won't even hit Man of Steel numbers We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

IndieWire's Ben Travers gave the series cautiously positive marks, writing, “Dexter's new lease on life may actually be worth waking the dead.” New episodes will continue weekly through September 5. Michael C. Hall has been playing Dexter now, off and on, since 2006. While Hall has certainly appeared in numerous other projects in the 19 years since the pilot aired — from “The Crown” to “Safe” and “Game Night” — the “Dark Passenger” (Dexter's nickname for his thirst to kill) has been character he just can't shake, though he assured Vanity Fair in an interview that leaves Dexter's unsavory qualities on set. Related Stories Lena Dunham's ‘Too Much': A Guide to All Those Cameos — and Each Wink to Her Own Celebrity Lore Wisconsin Just Passed New Tax Credits for Film and TV with Bipartisan Support — Read That Again “Thankfully, I'm not predisposed to act on the kind of compulsions that Dexter's afflicted by — but yeah, I mean, certainly when we finish shooting a season, I need some time to just put it away, if nothing else,” he explained. I could never live a life this fraught with stress. Hall does speculate, though, on why he is able to play the character, for which he has received six Emmy nominations, so well. I intuitively know how to play him, but I don't know — he's probably done a number on me that I couldn't even tell you about because the lines are so blurred. Asked by Vanity Fair what his “Dark Passenger” was, Hall responded, “None of your business.” Hall also described the new season — which moves the action from Los Angeles to New York City — as an opportunity for the character to have “a second chance at life,” saying that Dexter has “been finally released from what's been a burdensome relationship to his past.” Take a look at the “Dexter: Resurrection” trailer below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Lynne‘s Electric Light Orchestra canceled what was meant to be their final concert Sunday due to the frontman battling an infection. Lynne and ELO's farewell tour, which launched in August 2024, was scheduled to conclude July 13 at London's Hyde Park. However, the band announced Saturday, a day before the Hyde Park gig, “Jeff Lynne is heartbroken to report that he will not be able to perform… Jeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule.” While the group didn't elaborate on the nature of Lynne's health issue, he was unable to play guitar at recent U.K. shows in his hometown of Birmingham, England this past week due to a hand injury he sustained in an incident involving a taxi. However, doctors ultimately advised Lynne to cancel ELO's final concert. After resurrecting in 2014 as Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra, the reformed, Rock Hall-inducted band staged their first gig back at Hyde Park. “I had all these negative thoughts before agreeing to play Hyde Park,” Lynne told Rolling Stone in 2016, “but the crowd just went bananas all the way through. It was the best show I'd ever been involved with up until that point.” Justin Bieber Proves He's More Than OK on the Genuinely Pretty Great 'Swag' Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene wrote of the band's farewell show at Madison Square Garden, “Time has been very kind to Jeff Lynne‘s wonderfully unique fusion of prog rock, orchestral music, disco, and pop.” He added that the tour is “a well-deserved victory lap for a true pop genius, and a gift for fans to take a ride on his spaceship one last time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Latin superstar launched his unprecedented 30-show residency with a three-hour masterclass in culture, history and music. 1 on the Billboard 200, and carves out a legacy shared only by once-in-a-lifetime icons. A history-making residency kickoff on Friday night (July 11) at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot (aka El Choli) in San Juan. Dubbed No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí (I Don't Want to Leave From Here), the event marks the beginning of an unprecedented 30-show series at Puerto Rico's most iconic venue with a capacity crowd of 18,000. To a full house on opening night, Benito delivered three hours of spectacle, celebration, and pure corazón boricua, cementing Puerto Rico as the world's main stage. At times, the show felt like an immersive celebration of Puerto Rican history and identity. ET, a giant screen projected facts about the island's roots, culture and resilience. Messages in Spanish like “Puerto Rico is an archipelago, not just an island” and “San Juan is one of the oldest cities in the Americas. It was founded in 1521” educated the crowd, fusing pride with context. Others underscored the island's distinctiveness: “Puerto Rico has two native musical genres: bomba and plena,” a tribute to its African and working-class traditions, and “In Puerto Rico, they celebrate the longest Christmas season in the world.” Even lighter truths got a moment in the spotlight: “Sancocho cures anything, according to our grandmothers.” This mix of history and pride set the tone for an unforgettable night. Benito appeared on stage wearing a Taíno-inspired outfit — a beige ensemble with straw accents, dark shades and a winter-trapper-style hat — as if embodying the island's ancient roots while stepping firmly into the modern world. With a set that featured lush green hills and intricate cultural motifs, the visuals matched the depth of his message: Puerto Rican culture was front and center — not for explanation but for celebration. He opened with “DTmF” and spanned through hits from his latest album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, like “KETU TeCRÉ,” “EL CLúB,” “PIToRRO DE COCO” and “WELTiTA.” He also performed older classics including “La Santa” (originally feat. Daddy Yankee), “El Apagón,” “Si Estuviésemos Juntos” and “Ni Bien Ni Mal,” totaling up to over 30 songs — transitioning between bomba, plena, salsa, Latin trap and reggaetón. He brought Puerto Rico's ancestral rhythms to life with hypnotic percussion and dancers wearing traditional straw hats. Rocking a classic cream suit styled from that '70s era, he channeled the spirit of legends like Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colón, Rubén Blades and Tito Puente, Benito gave a nod to the iconic Fania All-Stars era — most importantly, to the generations of Puerto Ricans in New York City who sustained these sounds long after they left the island. trailblazers who shaped reggaetón and Latin music: Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Don Omar, Wisin y Yandel, Ñengo Flow and many others. For us,” he said, pulling the crowd even closer to his vision. “This residency is more than a concert series — it's a defining moment for our island,” Jorge L. Pérez, the venue's general manager, told Billboard Español. With Puerto Rico about to experience an influx of over 250,000 visitors during the residency's run, Benito has positioned the island as an entertainment destination, creating waves that will benefit the local economy, uplift small businesses and draw global eyes to its unique identity. Pérez continues: “It inspires the next generation to believe that success doesn't require leaving home. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of flying solo, Jennifer Aniston is quietly stepping into a new chapter. The “Friends” star, 56, is making waves for her blossoming romance with hypnotist and life coach Jim Curtis, 49. On Thursday, photos that made way online showed Aniston's new chapter with close friends, including Courteney Cox, Amy Schumer, Olivia Wilde, and Jason Bateman. New photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, show Jennifer Aniston in a curve-hugging black dress, resting her hand on Jim Curtis's thigh and holding hands with him during their intimate yacht outing. The source also told the outlet that their “mutual friends” set up Aniston and Curtis, who started as friends but hit it off over time. “They both share a deep love of doing ‘inner work,' and Jen thinks Jim is quite remarkable in that respect,” the source added. As per the Daily Mail, Ventana is a favorite among Hollywood's elite. The past guests include Taylor Swift, Anne Hathaway, and Ivanka Trump, with stays starting at $3,000 per night. Internet sleuths were quick to point out their brewing romance. Long before these romantic sightings, Aniston had been interacting with Curtis online and dropping hints. She's been following him on Instagram for nearly two years. She frequently likes his manifestation posts, including one last week about healing from past relationships and “calling in new, divine love.” Aniston publicly said she was reading it earlier this year. In April, Aniston revealed she had turned to hypnosis to manage her fear of flying, just months before her relationship with Curtis was confirmed. “I have been doing some hypnosis lately… it's shockingly good!” she told The Tonight Show. Curtis's therapeutic method, called hypno-realization, is designed to help people “break free from their past and create a new reality.” While Aniston is keeping things low-key, the bond she shares with Curtis appears deeply rooted in shared values and mutual respect.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club‘s resident TV Critic Saloni Gajjar and Staff Writer Mary Kate Carr. Sister Midnight, a whimsical film from British director Karan Kandhari, opens with an almost 10-minute-long dialogue-free scene. Every single enthralling shot during this brief time is used to unravel Uma's (Radhika Apte) state of mind against the backdrop of noisy, vibrant Mumbai streets. Don't mistake Sister Midnight for a stereotypical or simple story about Uma's resilience and journey of self-discovery, although those are very much the running themes. The movie takes inspiration from Wes Anderson's stylistic choices and David Lynch's magical realism to spin a pretty extraordinary yarn about defying expectations. Despite the obvious influences, Kandhari helms a wholly original and surprisingly feral saga (complete with stop-motion animated goats) about finding your agency against all odds. Is there more to her declining mental and physical health than just sheer loneliness? This question pops up halfway through Sister Midnight, when the movie reveals itself as an absurd horror comedy with teeth. Hunger to be seen and valued; hunger for connection, friendship, love, and sex; hunger to feel at home in a city that is as strange to her as her spouse and neighbors. Kandhari turns Mumbai into a spectacular canvas for Uma's quarter-life crisis, capturing its beautiful locations, sounds, and people to reflect on how they slowly change her. Apte has always been a remarkable performer (check out Monica, O My Darling, Lust Stories, and Raat Akeli Hai on Netflix), but this is easily her career-best performance. But it doesn't take away from what is a refreshing take on South Asian clichés, presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner, with excellent needle drops to boot. The movie, which earned Kandhari a BAFTA nomination this year, is available to rent on various platforms. But might I recommend a book by Annabel Monaghan, who's one of my favorite romance authors to emerge in the last few years? Monaghan's writing is both hot and breezy, deceptively simple while still packing a punch, and most of her books are actual, literal summer romances (two even have Summer in the title). There are a few excellent qualities you'll always find in an Annabel Monaghan book. Instead, she strikes the perfect balance of character and relationship development. Another thing Monaghan does well is inject a bit of Hollywood fantasy into her stories without being too unrealistic. It's clear from her work that the author understands the industry, so that the fame-adjacent plots in books like Nora Goes Off Script and Same Time Next Summer are fun but grounded without ever getting too “inside baseball.” And the plots that do touch Hollywood only do so lightly; the bulk of her tales take place in cozy East Coast beach towns so lovingly observed you can practically feel the sand beneath your toes. Growing up on television and being raised by a single mother, Jane Jackson developed some real neuroses and people-pleasing habits that still hamper her in her adult life. Getting away from Los Angeles and spending time with her professional nemesis, Dan Finnegan, sets Jane on a path to finally becoming her own person, a worthwhile tale even without the steamy, chemistry-filled romance. My personal favorite Annabel Monaghan romance remains Nora Goes Off Script, about a Hallmark-esque romance screenwriter whose catastrophic divorce inspires an Oscar-worthy magnum opus. Her encounter with Hollywood dreamboat Leo Vance is a classic Notting Hill-type fantasy, but something about the grounded simplicity with which their story unfolded touched me deeply the first time I read it. Summer is a time brimming with possibility, for romance or otherwise.

Kelly Clarkson kicked off her brand-new Las Vegas residency “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Friday night (July 11) — one week later than planned. “Studio Sessions” isn't Clarkson's first turn as a Las Vegas headliner. The show kicked off on July 28, 2023, and was initially scheduled for 10 dates. In 2020, she told Billboard that Las Vegas represented an excellent opportunity for her. “I'm able to do things with [a residency] that I've never been able to carry out on the road,” she says. Recently, she teased fans with an ultra-glam Sin City look, wearing a plunging sequin jumpsuit accented in feathers, for the “Where Have You Been” video, channeling fellow Las Vegas headliner Cher. Musicians from every genre of music, young and old, rookies and legends—it has become this fantastic city filled with artists from everywhere. So many of my musical idols have had, and still have, incredible residencies on the Strip, and I'm so excited to create my own,” Clarkson says. There are 16 performances of “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” scheduled through Nov. 15, with new dates for the postponed July 4-5 shows yet to be announced. In addition to three Grammy Awards, she has multiple Daytime Emmys on the mantle for her six-season Kelly Clarkson Show.

The movie (which co-stars Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone) reportedly ran into financial troubles a few weeks back, and while Cranston notes in his new comments that he was paid for his work on the film, upon learning that its co-stars and crew weren't, he's given an ultimatum to producers: Pay everybody, or he won't return to finish filming the movie. Helmed by Arlington Road director Mark Pellington, Lone Wolf stars Cranston as a shadowy type who recruits Gladstone's character to engineer the death of a public official. The film reportedly had about $2 million in funding fall through, causing several people working on it to not get paid. “Man, what a mess,” Cranston wrote in a statement he gave to Deadline this week, noting that, although not a producer on the film, he was “distressed” that the situation has “caused so much grief and distrust, and so sorry that this crew (which was fantastic) were not treated with the respect they deserved.” He also stated, bluntly, that “I (and I think I speak for Lily as well) will not do anything to promote the film until every cast and crew member is paid back in full, and we will not appear on screen again (ie return to filming) for this movie until that happens.” Lone Wolf reportedly requires at least a few more days of shooting with both Cranston and Gladstone in order to be completed. Deadline notes that, while funding hiccups aren't that rare in indie movie-making, having it happen on a movie with several big-name stars, and a director with a long pedigree in Hollywood film, is much more rare. Co-stars on the movie include O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jennifer Ehle, Chet Hanks, and Spencer Garrett. The film has reportedly been facing financial problems from the jump; its original production company, Yale Productions, recently filed for bankruptcy, and the movie faced a multi-day Do Not Work order from SAG-AFTRA after an earlier failure to make payments. Bryan Cranston says he won't come back to finish indie film until all crew and co-stars are paid Krysten Ritter spent the last two years lying about Jessica Jones</p>
