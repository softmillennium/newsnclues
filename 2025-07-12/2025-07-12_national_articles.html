                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What good is being in a position of power when you could be podcasting? I MUST GET OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE POSITION OF “DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI” (where I am HELPLESS to see what's really going on), so that I can get to the bottom of this Jeffrey Epstein situation! (Kash Patel can come with me if he wants.) I have always felt that you get the most direct line to what the FBI is doing when you are as far away from the FBI as possible, ideally in some sort of podcast studio or BASEMENT with a BULLETIN BOARD that has a lot of RED THREAD on it—and KETTLEBELLS! (How I have missed my kettlebells!) I should have remembered: The people who really know what the government is doing are the ones who don't work anywhere near it. That is how they GET YOU! No, someone has to leave the government and start digging, because there is a conspiracy here for certain. (I think it goes all the way to the top but I can't be sure!) I believe this is all the fault of Pam Bondi. She is keeping things from the American people, I think. I was in all the meetings and saw all the files she saw but I couldn't see ANYTHING in them (which I believe to have been the WITCHCRAFT OF PAM!) First Pam says the Epstein client list is on her desk? And then we put out a statement saying that there was nothing to see in the files and that we cannot release any more. And then we release a video to help demonstrate that he killed himself but that is missing a minute of footage? And then she says, Oh, this always happens? What are we trying to pull over on the American people?! Even Donald Trump is trying to move the conversation away from Epstein on the grounds that we've already talked about him for years? That has never once stopped him! That's why you have to get me out of the government. I can't think straight in the FBI. I need all of this (and, of course, Pam's resignation) to understand what's really happening here! All the director and I can do is sit around and administer unwanted polygraphs to our resentful employees! This is NOT the best use of my time. I should be doing REPS and GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS and FILLING MY WHOLE T-SHIRT, LIKE SOMEONE POURED ME INTO IT AND FORGOT TO SAY “WHEN,” which I can't do here! We need Dan Bongino on the case! GET DAN BONGINO OUT OF THE FBI SO DAN BONGINO CAN FINALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FBI IS HIDING FROM US!</p>

Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., spoke with Fox News Digital about his bipartisan bill to codify oversight of foreign adversaries, including China, buying American farmland. A key China ally with presidential ambitions in Peru traveled late last month to California to participate in a sending-off ceremony for a batch of trains donated by the Biden administration, according to reporting by Peruvian news outlets. Peruvian outlet Justo Medio reported at the time that Lima Mayor Rafael Lopez Aliaga, who is rumored to be considering a run for president of Peru in 2026, was in California late last month to discuss the transport of a batch of CalTrain locomotives, which were donated to Lima by the U.S. government under the Biden administration. Nate Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), recently published a study on Lopez Aliaga's "deep" financial ties to China through his company PeruRail, which has seen its revenue rise to over $65 million per year due to increased shipments from Minera Las Bambas, a Chinese-owned joint venture counting state-owned mining giant China Minmetals as its majority backer. The report alleged that China has been "cultivating" Lopez Aliaga for higher office in Peru in hopes of growing its mineral and battery supplies harvesting in South America. The report goes so far as to dub Lopez Aliaga "China's man in Peru." Xi Jinping (Left) and former Secretary of State Antony Blinken (Right) at a November 2024 train donation ceremony in Lima, Peru. "China's mining presence in Peru is a direct boon for López Aliaga," the report said, giving Beijing "a powerful beachhead in Peru." The report said, "This leaves an influential Peruvian political leader aligned with and linked to China, its resource project, and the broader Belt and Road Initiative of which it is part." According to NBC News, China invested $1.3 billion in a massive deepwater port in Chancay, Peru, just north of Lima. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a meeting at the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, China, October 18, 2023. According to Picarsic, China has also been investing heavily in Lima's infrastructure, most notably dominating its electricity industry, all of which Lopez Aliaga has been a "linchpin" piece in moving Chinese dominance forward. Now, with Lopez Aliaga possibly entering Peru's presidential race, Picarsic explained that this all "looks like a telltale sign of China's handiwork." He also called the U.S.'s donation of trains to Peru "too little, too late" to combat China's growing influence in the region. The coast of Lima, Peru, on Thursday, June 20, 2024. But this guy, who is in cahoots with China, who's coming to take them and he's taking them back to run on Chinese rail feeding into a Chinese port, helping to move goods from a Chinese mine." "I am so proud to have Caltrain be a member of that mutually beneficial relationship." Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first warning of impending disaster some Texas Hill Country residents  received came in the form of rushing water, strange noises from passing debris and the screams of victims swept down a raging river. One week later, serious questions remain about what actions local leaders took after ominous warnings from the National Weather Service, echoing other recent high-profile natural disasters marked by accusations of government complacency. Texas has faced criticism in the wake of disaster before, during 2021's devastating winter weather, and allegations of inefficiency and mismanagement have also followed the wildfires in Los Angeles and Maui — underscoring why figuring out exactly what happened before and during disasters is so critical. The potential for heavy rain first prompted state emergency management officials to begin pre-positioning resources in the region last week. Just over three hours later, forecasters at the NWS issued a flood watch listing Kerrville and surrounding areas at risk for flash flooding and 5 to 7 inches of rainfall. But a more serious NWS alert came at 1:14 a.m. on Independence Day morning, warning residents of central Kerr Country of “life-threatening flash flooding,” followed a few hours later by a series of flash flood emergency notices as the Guadalupe River burst its banks and tore through summer camps, homes and recreational vehicles. Despite repeated attempts by reporters and community members to seek answers, it remains unclear what, if anything, Kerr County public safety leaders did after the first early morning notice of imminent danger from forecasters. While some local residents described receiving text notifications from the NWS, many did not. And despite spotty cell service in parts of western Kerr County, it's unclear how county leaders acted following the first NWS flash flood warning, and if they sent out evacuation notices of their own or attempted making physical contact with people in the potential impact zone. It's also unclear whether county leaders were on the initial Thursday phone call with the Texas Department of Emergency Management, nor is it understood how closely local officials were monitoring forecast reports. In response to multiple questions, some state and local leaders have grown defensive, insisting their focus is on the rigorous and back-breaking work still underway to find the missing. Greg Abbott pushed back when asked about accountability. “Who is to blame?” Abbott said, repeating a reporter's question. “Know this, that's the word choice of losers.” !,” the National Weather Service posted on social media a day before the blazes, describing an impending windstorm as “LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE.” A LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE, Widespread Windstorm is expected Tue afternoon-Weds morning across much of Ventura/LA Co. Areas not typically windy will be impacted. Despite that warning, an investigation by The Los Angeles Times found the city's fire department opted to not deploy in advance about 1,000 personnel and fire engines to respond to any potential fires that might be sparked by the fury of wind that began descending on the area. The Los Angeles Fire Department chief, who was relieved of duty after the fires, had previously complained about cuts to the department's budget, saying they had “adversely affected the Department's ability to maintain core operations, such as technology and communication infrastructure, payroll processing, training, fire prevention, and community education.” And when flames started chewing through Los Angeles area neighborhoods, many residents in some of the hardest-hit areas said they had received no evacuation warning at all. “None of us got a red (mandatory evacuation) alert before we felt ready to leave our houses,” local resident Mark Douglas told CNN. So a lot of us gave up on the alert system at that point.” An investigation into the response is still ongoing. An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people and left $6 billion in damage in August 2023 revealed a spate of problems with emergency preparation and coordination before and during the disaster. Investigators concluded there was “minimal” pre-positioning of staff and equipment after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning prior to four major wildfires breaking out. As wind-fueled fires whipped their way across communities, Maui County's 80 emergency sirens meant to warn residents of imminent danger remained silent. They would have sent people into danger and not away from it. Authorities vowed to conduct a full assessment of siren operations. A deadly deep freeze and winter storm slammed Texas in February 2021. Families across the Lone Star State were forced to scavenge for firewood or spend nights in their cars, trying desperately to stay warm in the more than﻿ weeklong freeze. While the dangerous days-long power outages were still underway, Gov. Abbott did also say he was “taking responsibility for the current status of ERCOT,” adding, “I find what has happened unacceptable.” ﻿Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz also faced criticism for flying to Cancun, Mexico, as the state froze – a decision he ultimately said was “obviously a mistake.” While Kerr County residents await answers on what attention local leaders paid to the warnings from forecasters, it's evident from past disasters that getting to the bottom of what officials did or did not do is critical. Clearly the heartbreak with respect to this development is that those warnings were not received.” CNN's Nicquel Terry Ellis, Natasha Chen, Holly Yan, Eric Levenson and Dakin Andone contributed to this report</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats. FIRST ON FOX: Mahmood Mamdani, the father of socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing "genocide", and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers. Also on its website, Mahmood Mamdani is listed as a member of the group's "advisory policy council" and is mentioned as having attended the group's official launch in London last year. New York mayoral candidate, State Rep. Zohran Mamdani (D-NY) stands with his mother, Mira Nair, and father, Mahmood Mamdani, as they celebrate during an election night gathering at The Greats of Craft LIC on June 24, 2025, in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. Zohran Mamdani has also promoted BDS as recently as May, when he declined to say whether Israel has a right to exist and said his support of BDS "is consistent with my core of my politics, which is non-violence." Mahmood Mamdani, the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at Columbia University, has also faced criticism on social media in recent days over a resurfaced book excerpt where he expressed sympathy for the way suicide bombers are viewed. "Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism," the elder Mamdani wrote in his 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror. "We need to recognize the suicide bomber, first and foremost, as a category of soldier." The Gaza Tribunal's founder and members have deep ties to anti-Israel movements, with at least one being deported from the United States due to terror ties. Falk has a long history of espousing anti-Israel views and was repeatedly accused of using his "Special Rapporteur" United Nations position to "spread unsubstantiated allegations against Israel," according to Canary Mission, a watchdog organization that works to expose antisemitism. Falk faced backlash in 2007 for comparing Israel's government to the Nazis by accusing them of ushering in a "Palestinian Holocaust" and rhetorically asking, "Is it an irresponsible overstatement to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity? Democrat mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a rally at the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council headquarters in New York, Wednesday, July 2, 2025. The Princeton University professor emeritus also demanded a boycott of corporations in 2012 that do business with Israel, saying they "should be boycotted until they bring their operations into line with international human rights and humanitarian law and standards." However, a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) fired back, warning the UN that Falk "has repeatedly abused his position as special rapporteur to unleash unrestrained hatred and disdain for Israel" and that the "United Nations should not be complicit in this wholly unjustified effort to single out Israel." In a statement to Fox News Digital, Falk said that he advocates for "nonviolent solidarity initiatives with the Palestinian struggle for their basic rights, including BDS." "I believe that Israel's occupation policies in Gaza and the West Bank have persecuted Palestinians on their own homeland," Falk added. "Also, I believe that this pattern of displacing the native population is illustrative of settler colonial political projects that depend for their success on an apartheid-like domination and exploitation of the native population. If such a regime encounters prolonged resistance it almost inevitably relies on genocidal tactics to subdue the civilian population, either by marginalization, ethnic cleansing, or massive killing, all of which have been occurring in Gaza during the 20 months since October 7." Falk added that Jewish voters in New York City "should not worry" about Mamood Mamdani's ties to the tribunal or about Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for mayor. Bazian has been a controversial anti-Israel figure for decades due to his inflammatory rhetoric about Israel and Jews, including during a 2014 convention speech, where he called on attendees to "get to work" on calling for BDS on college campuses and doing sit-ins in Congressional offices. He would go on to say, "They're gonna say some Palestinian being too radical – well, you haven't seen radicalism yet." He has also faced backlash for antisemitic posts on social media, which drew backlash from several student groups, including one that mocked Hassidic Jews, with one saying "Mom, look! I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs and steal the land of Palestinians ‘Yay' #Ashke-Nazi." Another social media post insinuated Jews control UC Berkeley, which is a classic antisemitic trope about their "power." Zohran Mamdani told CNN on Thursday that he has "many critiques" of capitalism. Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida professor who admitted to conspiring to aid the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group in 2006, was also present at the Gaza Tribunal launch meeting. He recently posted on X that he was "very honored and proud" to have contributed to the Gaza Tribunal's "The Sarajevo Declaration," which accuses Israel of "genocide, and its decades-long policies and practices of settler colonialism, ethno-supremacism, apartheid, racial segregation, persecution, unlawful settlements, the denial of the right to return, collective punishment, mass detention, torture and cruel and inhuman treatment." The declaration went on to "call for an end of the smearing of UNRWA and other humanitarian workers, for the free and unhindered access of UNRWA," a group that has been slammed for alleged ties to terrorism, including allegedly working with Hamas. Then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said in 2006 that the disgraced professor had denied involvement with the terror group for a decade before prosecutors had enough evidence to bring charges. "He further admitted that he performed various services for the PIJ in 1995 and thereafter, knowing that the PIJ had been designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist and that the PIJ engaged in horrific and deadly acts of violence." Socialist former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long been labeled as antisemitic due to various anti-Israel statements, is also a member of the Gaza Tribunal Advisory Council. In 2020, an investigation into antisemitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found Corbyn's Labour Party had broken the law in the way it handled complaints of antisemitism when Corbyn was in charge. Corbyn was eventually suspended from the Labour Party over charges of antisemitism. A 2019 poll showed that a whopping 87 percent of Jewish people in Great Britain believed Corbyn was antisemitic, pointing to many incidents and remarks, many of them involving his staunch support for Palestinians and perceived hostility toward Israel. Britain's main opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks at the launch of the Labour Party race and faith manifesto, in London, Tuesday Nov. 26, 2019. Zohran Mamdani's stance on Israel has been a widely discussed topic so far during the mayoral campaign, and he sparked controversy by refusing to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which has become a rallying cry for anti-Israel protesters in the United States ever since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in Israel. Mamdani, who was the co-founder of Bowdoin College's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his four years, expressed support for an academic boycott of Israel in the school's paper. Mamdani has been widely criticized by Jewish groups in New York City over his past positions and comments as he tries to position himself to win the general election in November against current Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Zach Nunn (R-IA) on Friday confirmed he is running for reelection in the House next year, shutting down months of speculation he would run for governor in Iowa. Zach needs our full support to win Iowa-03,” he posted on Truth Social. “He is fighting for the Farmer, and everything else that Iowa stands for, including, of course, Lower Taxes, and our always under siege Second Amendment. Zach Nunn has my Complete and Total Endorsement. Nunn will face off against two Iowa Democrats, state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst and state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, in a bid to keep his House seat. He is the only declared Republican candidate so far. “Combat veteran Zach Nunn has a proven record of results for this community, and that's why Iowans will send him back to Congress next year,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said in a statement. Nunn previously expressed interest in launching a gubernatorial bid instead after Gov. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also passed on a gubernatorial run earlier this month. If he ran for governor, the House Republican would have vied for the top primary slot with Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA). He also received key endorsements from prominent Iowa Republicans — Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and Lt. Gov. Nunn was first elected to the House in 2022 after receiving endorsements from Trump, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). Nunn represents Iowa's Third Congressional District, which he flipped in 2022.</p>

A copy of “The Salt Path”, by Raynor Winn is on display in a book store, in London, Friday, July 11, 2025. But now, the book and the film are mired in a controversy that could see them suffer that very modern phenomenon — being canceled. On Friday, publisher Penguin Michael Joseph agreed with author Raynor Winn to delay the publication of her next book, “On Winter Hill” from this October after “intrusive conjecture” about her husband's health. Winn's book tells how she and her husband of 32 years, Moth Winn — a well-to-do couple — made the impulsive decision to walk the rugged 630 miles (around 1,000 kilometers) of the South West Coast Path in the southwest of England after losing their house because of a bad business investment. Broke and homeless, the memoir relays how the couple achieved spiritual renewal during their trek, which lasted several months and which saw them carry essentials and a tent on their back. It sold 2 million copies, became a regular read at book clubs, spawned two sequels and the film adaptation, which was released this spring, to generally positive reviews. Ultimately, it is a portrayal of home, and how it can be lost, rebuilt, and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.” The newspaper said that the couple lost their home following accusations that Winn had stolen tens of thousands of pounds from her employer. And perhaps more damaging, the newspaper said that it had spoken to medical experts who were skeptical about Moth having CBD, given his lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them. The book's ability to engender empathy from its readers relied on their personal circumstances. Without those hooks, it's a very different tale. Any memoir may have omissions or hazy recollections. But making things up is a clear no-no. This is the true story of our journey.” She fleshed out her response on Wednesday, describing the previous few days have been “some of the hardest of my life,” while acknowledging “mistakes” in her business career. She also linked documents appearing to show Moth had been diagnosed with CBD, and described how the accusations that Moth made up his illness have left them “devastated.” Those should start emerging in the coming days. In addition, there are questions now as to whether the film will find a U.S. distributor and whether Winn, in particular, will face compensation claims, potentially even from readers. Winn was meant to be in the western England town of Shrewsbury on Friday on the Saltlines tour, a “words and music collaboration” between her and folk band The Gigspanner Big Band. Her legal team said that Winn is “deeply sorry to let down those who were planning to attend the Saltlines tour, but while this process is ongoing, she will be unable to take part.”</p>

Deputies joked about the cross-country trip to retrieve Stevenson, pointing out it took nearly 24-hours to conduct the mission. "I am happy to report that after 2 direct flights, 4 time zone changes, and 21 straight hours, he was booked into the WCRJ," officials said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Calvin Endo looks out at private property behind his home where tall grass grows brown during wildfire season on Saturday, July 5, 2025, in Waianae, Hawaii. walks a flock of sheep to a pasture at Kaʻala Farm for the animals to eat grass as one way community members mitigate wildfire risks in Waianae, Hawaii on Thursday, April 17, 2025. WAIANAE, Hawaii (AP) — When there's enough rain, the mountain-framed expanse of vacant land behind Calvin Endo's house looks like the lush and verdant landscape that makes tropical Hawaii famous. But in the summer, when the jungle of eyeball-high invasive grasses and spindly tree branches fade to brown, he fears it could become a fiery hellscape. This isn't Maui, where most of Lahaina burned down during a massive wildfire in August 2023. Endo's duplex is in Waianae on the west side of Oahu. But Waianae and Lahaina have a lot in common. They're both situated on parched western island coasts, with road access pinched by topography, and are bastions of Native Hawaiian culture. Both have sections crisscrossed by overhead power lines atop aging wooden poles, like those that fell in high winds and caused the Lahaina fire. It's been nearly two years since Lahaina provided a worst-case scenario of the destruction from wind-whipped flames fueled by overgrown brush. With 102 deaths, it's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century. Even though Waianae residents have long known about their wildfire risks, only now is one of its neighborhoods close to gaining Firewise status. Communities become Firewise by organizing a committee, creating a hazard assessment, developing an action plan and volunteering hours toward reducing risk, such as removing overgrown brush. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service considers Lahaina and Waianae to be at much higher risk than other U.S. communities for a wildland fire, noted Honolulu Fire Department Battalion Chief Keith Ito. “With all that being said, I think that the high-risk wildfire potential is a state-wide problem, not really specific to Waianae or Lahaina.” Nani Barretto, co-director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, struggles to understand why fire-prone communities like Waianae have yet to join the Firewise movement. There are also no Firewise communities on the island of Kauai. Organizing a community can be challenging because it requires residents to put in time and step up as leaders, she said. The process got underway around 2018 but picked up momentum after Lahaina, she said. Sea Country recently completed a hazard assessment and has planned some mitigation events, including a park cleanup in August, said Ashley Bare, the Firewise support specialist for Oahu. Lahaina also provided the spark for opening an emergency access route in Waianae, Tupola said. Military officials who control a mountain pass above Waianae started talking about letting civilians access the route after Lahaina, she said. A Hawaiian homestead community in Waianae's Nanakuli Valley is also trying to achieve Firewise status, said Diamond Badajos, spokesperson for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. Home to the largest concentration of Native Hawaiians, Waianae is rich in Hawaiian culture and history. But much of the coast also struggles with poverty and homelessness. Residents have grown accustomed to wildfires in the dry summer months, said Republican state Rep. Chris Muraoka: “It's almost like if it doesn't burn, something's not right.” However, Muraoka said he thinks communities along the coast would benefit more from fire-prevention and safety education in schools rather than organizing to be Firewise. Muraoka, who lives in Makaha, said communities in Waianae have unique needs that being Firewise might not address, including sections with neighborhoods that are more spread out than in Lahaina and blazes that are often started by arsonists or kids playing with fire. Some residents already do what they can, especially with the dry season underway. Some properties in Waianae Valley use sheep to eat the overgrown vegetation. Retired firefighter Shermaih “Bulla” Iaea recalls fighting blazes in the brush near Endo's home and Makaha Elementary School. In 2018, his farm burned down during high winds from a passing hurricane. He was using a herd of sheep on his property until wild dogs killed them in April. Neighborhoods banding together to become Firewise is another tool that will help, he said. “There's a 100 percent chance that will happen here,” he said. It's not clear why Makaha ended up with a long street named Lahaina, which can mean “relentless sun” in Hawaiian. Some neighborhoods above Lahaina Street are newer and have underground utilities, like Endo's. But toward the ocean, older neighborhoods are laced by overhead power lines. Power lines are blamed for sparking the Lahaina blaze.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Right-wing figures Charlie Kirk and Megyn Kelly on Friday alluded to the reported feud between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Department of Justice‘s botched handling of the Epstein files. While speaking at a Turning Point USA event in Tampa, Florida, Kirk asked the crowd whether they preferred Bongino or Bondi. “He's been in the trenches,” she added before questioning whether Bondi “really gets MAGA.” The conservative commentator doesn't think she does. Earlier Friday, reports surfaced of Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel's dissatisfaction with Bondi over the Epstein files. The attorney general repeatedly promised she would release troves of information on late financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein‘s client list, but the DOJ now says no such list exists. The Department of Justice also concluded Epstein's death was caused by suicide, not homicide, in prison. To show there was no foul play in his death, DOJ officials released footage showing the area outside Epstein's prison cell the night he died. As a result, Bongino and Patel are reportedly considering resigning from their positions. “I worked closely with [Patel] and [Bongino] on the joint FBI and DOJ memo regarding the Epstein Files,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche posted on X. The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false.” Bondi “brought in some of our best influencers, people that I care about deeply,” Kirk said, naming Jack Posobiec, Chaya Raichik, who goes by Libs of TikTok on social media, and Rogan O'Handley, also known as DC Draino, out of the 15 total influencers present for the publicity stunt. You shouldn't be upset at the influencers. They were handed these binders like there was something incredible in them.” Kelly said that is “what you would do to an enemy.” She also took issue with Bondi's empty promises on Fox News that the Epstein files, including the client list that the DOJ head at one point said was sitting on her desk, would be released shortly after she reviewed them. Liz Wheeler, in particular, told Kelly that she and the other influencers were promised another trove of information and told that the binders contained little new information. “I trust [Dan Bongino] not to actively mislead me or you,” Kelly said on Emily Jashinsky's podcast After Party. “However, Pam Bondi has definitely made multiple inconsistent statements, and I'm sorry, but she does not deserve the benefit of my good opinion, and I'm not prepared to give it to her.”</p>

Officials with the National Park Service confirmed that Brian Astle, 42, of Provo, UT fell while descending a steep, off-trail climbing route from the west face of Mount Gould inside Glacier National Park on Wednesday. The accident happened just before 6 p.m. on July 9, when Glacier National Park Dispatch received a report of an individual who had fallen from Mount Gould above the Highline Trail. Park rangers worked with aerial search and rescue crews to locate Astle. However, the operation was postponed overnight to ensure Astle's body could be safely recovered.

The National Parks Service said Grant Marcuccio, 32, of Whitefish, Montana was found dead after suffering from "traumatic injuries" from an "apparent fall." Officials said "Marcuccio separated from his party to summit McPartland Peak alone and planned to rendezvous at a designated location" but "Rangers were alerted by the hiking party that Marcuccio never made it to the rendezvous spot." Glacier National Park is known for its "beautiful glacial lakes, waterfalls, valleys, and alpine meadows," FOX Weather reports, but it can also "experience quickly changing and extreme weather."

This photo provided by the National Parks Service shows smoke from wildfires in the Black Canyon of Gunnison National Park in Colorado on Thursday, July 10, 2025, after high temperatures, very low humidity, gusty winds, and very dry vegetation across the region led to extreme fire danger. This photo provided by the Bureau of Land Management shows aerial resources working to suppress White Sage wildfire burning north of Grand Canyon National Park in Ariz., on Thursday, July 10, 2025. This image provided by Eddie Vallee and taken from the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona shows smoke over the park's North Rim on Thursday, July 10, 2025. Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed until further notice after lighting strikes sparked blazes on both rims, park officials said. The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake. The conditions there have been ripe for wildfires with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday. Fire danger has ramped up in the West as drought conditions have worsened across several states. Firefighters saved Black Canyon's visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn. In Arizona, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby. “Gusty and erratic winds” spread the flames Thursday afternoon and inhibited firefighters from containing the blaze, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Rachel Carnahan said. By Friday afternoon it had burned about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) with zero containment, and dark clouds of smoke settled over the Grand Canyon. About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joëlle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place. Melinda Rich, whose family owns the 102-year-old Jacob Lake Inn known for its homemade cookies, evacuated 75 employees Thursday and guests in about 35 cabins that were rented out at the time. “It's tricky for us because we were half booked and now we have to refund all of those things, and that's a challenge financially for us,” she said. Some guests had just checked in when the inn got a call from the sheriff's office saying everyone should leave immediately, Rich said. The staff began calling and emailing guests who were out exploring, she said. In 2020, a wildfire came within 20 feet (6 meters) of some cabins. “We had one of those incredible, miraculous moments, a lot of prayers and then wind adjusted just enough that it passed us by about a mile,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA. McLaughlin said, “Enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests. Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts, and a range of businesses. The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots, where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.” ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens detained, was “physically assaulted … for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.” In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said. Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say their access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” was denied on several occasions since June, according to court documents. Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7, attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA; however, the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out, and deployed chemical munitions akin to tear gas. He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” tactics for getting people to sign papers agreeing to leave the country before consulting an attorney. Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.U.S.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Routh, the second alleged would-be assassin of President Donald Trump, told the Florida judge presiding over his case on Friday that he wants to offer himself to Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea as part of a prisoner exchange with one of the foreign adversaries. “I had wished for a prisoner swap with Hamas, Iran for a female protester, or China for Jimmy Lai or one of the 40 others or to freeze to death in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier so that I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts,” he wrote to Cannon. “Perhaps you have the power to trade me away.” Jimmy Lai is the jailed media tycoon and pro-democracy activist who protested Beijing's national security crackdown on Hong Kong in 2019. The “40 others” Routh is likely referring to are the 47 pro-democracy figures arrested by Beijing in 2021 for organizing an unofficial primary election in Hong Kong. Routh says his part in a prisoner swap would make sense for Trump, whose administration has prioritized the release of people wrongfully imprisoned, including the Israeli captives held by Hamas. “What an easy diplomatic victory for Trump to give an American he hates to China, Iran, or North Korea, or wherever, as a gesture of peace in exchange for an unjustly held democratic prisoner,” he wrote. Routh faces numerous federal charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty, in addition to state charges brought by the Florida attorney general. Until Cannon issues a ruling, his lawyers will remain on the case. Routh explained in the letter how he feels unsupported and ignored by his legal defense team and apologized to the judge for being a burden. If convicted, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.</p>
