                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Testing revealed the shrew had a previously unidentified strain of orthoreovirus. Viruses in this genus are known to infect humans, white-tailed deer, bats and other mammals. While orthoreoviruses' effects on humans are not yet well understood, there have been rare reports of the virus being associated with cases of encephalitis, meningitis and gastroenteritis in children. "The bottom line is we need to pay attention to orthoreoviruses, and know how to rapidly detect them," said Lednicky, a research professor in the PHHP Department of Environmental and Global Health and a member of UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute. "There are many different mammalian orthoreoviruses and not enough is known about this recently identified virus to be concerned," said the paper's lead author Emily DeRuyter, a UF Ph.D. candidate in One Health. "Mammalian orthoreoviruses were originally considered to be 'orphan' viruses, present in mammals including humans, but not associated with diseases. More recently, they have been implicated in respiratory, central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases." Given the propensity of viruses to constantly evolve, paired with the team's sophisticated lab techniques, finding new viruses isn't entirely surprising, Lednicky said. "I'm not the first one to say this, but essentially, if you look, you'll find, and that's why we keep finding all these new viruses," Lednicky said. Like influenza virus, two different types of orthoreovirus can infect a host cell, causing the viruses' genes to mix and match, in essence, creating a brand new virus, Lednicky said. Next steps would include serology and immunology studies to understand the threat Gainesville shrew mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain UF-1 may hold for humans, wildlife and pets. He has shown no signs of illness from his outdoor adventures and will likely continue to contribute to scientific discovery through specimen collection. There is a lot of information that can be gained."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, the story of Alzheimer's research has been dominated by a battle between A-beta and tau amyloids, both of which can kill neurons and impact the brain's ability to function. A new study suggests, however, that these sticky brain plaques may not be operating alone. Johns Hopkins University researchers have identified more than 200 types of misfolded proteins in rats that could be associated with age-related cognitive decline. The findings could lead the way to finding new therapeutic targets and treatments in humans that could provide relief for the millions of people over 65 who suffer from Alzheimer's, dementia, or other diseases that rob them of their memories and independence as they age. But we're seeing hundreds of proteins misfolding in ways that don't clump together in an amyloid and yet still seem to impact how the brain functions," said Stephen Fried, an assistant professor of chemistry and protein scientist who studies how molecules in the brain change during aging. The results were published on July 11 in Science Advances. For the first time, scientists were able to determine for a large number of proteins whether individual proteins were misshapen or folded incorrectly, allowing the researchers to work out which proteins misfold for all the rats and are associated with aging in general versus which proteins specifically misfold in cognitively impaired rats. Misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, so cells have a natural surveillance system that identifies and destroys these misbehaving proteins. "And that suggests these misfolded proteins have ways of escaping this surveillance system in the cell." Next, the team plans to look at misfolded proteins under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of what their deformities look like at the molecular level. "Understanding what's physically going on in the brain could lead to better treatments and preventive measures."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fossilized lower jaw he found represents a completely new species of multituberculate -- an extinct group of early mammals known for the distinctive tubercles on their posterior teeth. This discovery, published in Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, marks the first multituberculate jaw found at Swanage since Victorian times, and its unique size and shape confirmed it as an entirely new species. Dr Roy Smith and Emeritus Professor David Martill, who supervised the research, enlisted the expertise of Dr Steve Sweetman, a former Portsmouth student and now honorary research fellow, who specializes in rare Early Cretaceous mammal fossils from the Isle of Wight and Isle of Purbeck regions. Dr Sweetman said: "This is a remarkable find that reminds me of when Grant found those extraordinary eutherian mammal teeth. It's incredible that Durlston Bay keeps delivering such significant mammal discoveries by our undergraduate students." The delicate fossil presented challenges, with pieces of rock obscuring vital details. The team then collaborated with Jake Keane, a former Portsmouth paleontology student now working in Abu Dhabi (UAE), who processed the CT scans digitally. Within hours, Keane had digitally removed all surrounding rock and performed "digital dental surgery" to isolate individual teeth for detailed study. Portsmouth paleontology student Hamzah Imran created an artistic reconstruction showing the animal as a small, furry creature with speculative spots and stripes. The fossil evidence suggests Novaculadon mirabilis was omnivorous, likely feeding on small invertebrates such as worms and insects. I especially appreciated that all team members were University staff or present and former students -- a true team effort including academics, technicians, alumni, and students with diverse talents across three departments." Multituberculata represents the most diverse order of Mesozoic mammals, with over 200 known species ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These mammals occupied various ecological niches over their 130-million-year evolutionary history, from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree climbers. The University of Portsmouth's BSc (Hons) Palaeontology degree offers a uniquely hands-on learning experience, thanks to its location near the Isle of Wight -- nicknamed "Dinosaur Island" for its rich fossil heritage. Students benefit from frequent field trips to world-famous fossil sites like the Isle of Wight and the Jurassic Coast, gaining real-world experience that complements classroom learning. Accredited by The Geological Society of London, the course combines cutting-edge facilities, expert teaching, and a flexible "Connected Degree" structure that allows for paid placements or self-employment years, preparing graduates for careers in science, consultancy, or museum work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Depending on how finely we distinguish, there are several hundred to several thousand different types of nerve cell in the human brain according to the latest calculations. When scientists produced nerve cells from stem cells in Petri dishes for their experiments in the past, it was not possible to take their vast diversity into account. Until now, researchers had only developed procedures for growing a few dozen different types of nerve cell in vitro. "Neurons derived from stem cells are frequently used to study diseases. But up to now, researchers have often ignored which precise types of neuron they are working with," says Barbara Treutlein, Professor at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich in Basel. However, this is not the best approach to such work. "If we want to develop cell culture models for diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and depression, we need to take the specific type of nerve cell involved into consideration." Treutlein and her team have now successfully produced over 400 different types of nerve cell. The ETH researchers achieved this by working with a culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells that had been generated from blood cells. In these cells, they used genetic engineering to activate certain neuronal regulator genes and treated the cells with various morphogens, a special class of signalling molecules. They are not distributed uniformly within an embryo but occur in a variety of concentrations forming spatial patterns. Accordingly, morphogens help to determine what grows where in the embryo. The researchers used various analyses to prove that they had produced over 400 different types of nerve cell in their experiment. They examined the RNA (and therefore genetic activity) at the level of individual cells, as well as the external appearance of cells and their function: for example, which type of cell appendage they had in which quantities and which electric nerve impulses they emitted. Nonetheless, the researchers now have access to a much larger number of different cell types than they had before. They would like to use in-vitro nerve cells to develop cell culture models for studying serious neurological conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, sleep disorders and multiple sclerosis. But there is a challenge to overcome before this can happen: the researchers often produced a mixture of multiple different types of nerve cell in their experiments. They are now working to optimise their method so that each experimental condition only produces one specific cell type. They already have some initial ideas as to how this might be achieved.
