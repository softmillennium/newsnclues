      Submission Statement
    


      The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released a series of previously undisclosed documents confirming multiple drone incursions over the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas—a facility that plays a critical role in the nation's nuclear weapons program. The records, released as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by The Black Vault on January 16, 2024, reveal significant security concerns dating back at least two years, including incidents in 2022 and 2023 that were not previously made public.
    


      The FOIA request sought all records, including photos, videos, reports, and internal communications related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over Pantex. It also specifically requested any communications between Pantex and the U.S. government's UAP Task Force (UAPTF) or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).
    


      The Pantex Field Office, along with its Management and Operating (M&O) contractor PanTeXas Deterrence, LLC, identified seven responsive records. Among them were internal reports that detailed two distinct drone incursions—one occurring in October 2022 and another in June 2023. Both incidents were classified as “Management Interest (AMI)” level security concerns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Terror takes the stage as found footage franchise finds a new form of horror When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Set to arrive in the London West End this winter, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage will follow James and Lou, a couple who move from Chicago to London and discover that their new pad has some unwanted tenants residing in it. Following the announcement, Barrett gave a statement saying, “From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theater setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theater offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond.” It'll be interesting to see just how the tension can be ramped up on stage, given that the show is inspired by a franchise that depends on only minor alterations in scenes before the ghostly presence makes itself more aggressively known. For now, if you want your bones chilled this weekend, why not take a peek at our ranking of found footage horror films here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Of all the things it could've been, we did not expect this answer! This story contains spoilers for Resident Alien Season 4, Episode 6, "Soul Providers." Of all the answers Resident Alien could have given us with regards to why the Greys abduct human babies, we did not expect the revelation provided in Season 4, Episode 6, "Soul Providers." Watch new episodes of Resident Alien Fridays at 11/10c on USA Network. Baby souls make for the best product because of their "purity, untouched by life's experiences," goes the explanation. A rather beautiful sentiment... until you realize what that spiritual energy is used for. The Greys abduct human children and harvest their souls not to gain eternal life, but to turn the coveted substance into an anti-wrinkle cream that also doubles as a "savory dipping sauce." A metaphysical question our species has debated for centuries is both answered and completely and audaciously turned on its head in the most mundane fashion when placed within the context of a vast and uncaring universe. The meaning of existence is 42, and human souls are worth nothing more than a cosmetic commodity. Two grey aliens appear in Resident Alien Season 3 Episode 8. "That was Alan's idea, actually," creator, showrunner, and executive producer Chris Sheridan told USA Insider over Zoom. "It solved some problems because we spent a lot of time trying to figure out, ‘It's gotta be this grand thing! And then Alan pitched, ‘Maybe it's just a wrinkle cream.' "This show really speaks to me," Tudyk said. "The world that Chris has created... if you set out to create it, you're not gonna get there, or else everybody would. [It's a place] where you can have real interactions between characters and meaningful, touching moments, and actually say something like art should. "Simultaneously, you can do some of the goofiest, craziest, silliest, most bizarre, gross things," Tudyk added. "It leaves that open because of the alien [element]. They're aliens, and since the beginning, it's always had that ability to go completely [bonkers] because it's all unknown. All episodes will be available to stream exclusively on Peacock one week after they air.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, TV | Tagged: the boys Misha Collins shared that he and Jensen Ackles did an in-character take as Supernatural's Castiel and Dean while filming The Boys Season 5. In honor of the 20th anniversary of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins took part in an extended retrospective interview with TV Insider and a video featurette where they addressed a number of fans' questions. While the entire conversation is definitely worth a watch, it was their responses to working together on the fifth and final season of Prime Video and Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys that hit our radar. Based on what Collins had to share at one point, it sounds like Ackles and Collins had a moment to slip back into Dean and Castiel mode in front of the cameras – but it might not see the light of day?! As Ackles saw it, there wasn't much of an adjustment that needed to be made since the trio still talked and saw each other on a regular basis. Padalecki noted that his biggest concern, "having not really acted in a year, was that I didn't remember how to act (with Ackles following up with a joke). In terms of being able to differentiate Ackles and Collins from their Supernatural characters while filming The Boys, Padalecki credited the writers and the dialogue being so different from what their previous characters would say that it made things easier. "You know, we did on 'The Boys' end up doing a take in character as Cass and Dean," Collins shared. Though Ackles wasn't sounding so sure, smiling as he responded, "Look for that on the editing room floor.</p>
