                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI issued a lengthy apology Saturday for a series of violent and antisemitic posts from its Grok chatbot this week, blaming a system update. ‚ÄúFirst off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,‚Äù the company wrote. xAI says a system update had chatbot Grok refer to ‚Äúexisting X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views,‚Äù caused it to issue responses that praised Adolf  Hitler, repeated conspiracy theories and spewed longstanding antisemitic tropes. In a series of posts early Saturday on Grok's official X account, the company said the coding change update was active for 16 hours. Grok spouted antisemitic tropes and white nationalist talking points earlier this week in response to user prompts. ‚ÄúWe have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,‚Äù xAI said. According to xAI, the problematic instructions were: ‚ÄúYou tell it like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct,‚Äù ‚ÄúUnderstand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response,‚Äù and ‚ÄúReply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, don't repeat the information which is already present in the original post.‚Äù Those instructions steered Grok ‚Äúto ignore its core values in certain circumstances in order to make the response engaging to the user,‚Äù xAI said. As the company issued its explanation, it turned Grok's X account back on, meaning the bot was back to engaging with users publicly on X. In May, the bot began bringing up claims of ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù in South Africa to completely unrelated prompts. Musk was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù was committed in the nation, a claim that has been rejected by a South African court and by experts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‚Ä¢ Women's champion crowned: Polish star Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek dominated her Wimbledon singles final against American Amanda Anisimova. It's also the first time in that era that a women's player has won the title without giving up a game. ‚Ä¢ Emotional remarks: A jubilant ≈öwiƒÖtek, who had struggled on grass courts prior to this tournament, said after the match that she could hardly process the victory. Anisimova, who has been open about mental health struggles and took a break from the sport in 2023, lauded her opponent and thanked her support system in tearful on-court remarks. After two weeks of exceptional tennis from both Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek and Amanda Anisimova, today's women's singles final was over before it even really began. It took just 57 minutes for ≈öwiƒÖtek to dispatch her American opponent. 4 did not drop a single game on her way to lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish. She won just 26% of her first-serve points and double-faulted five times. It was easy to tell which player had experience in grand slam finals. ≈öwiƒÖtek's poise contrasted starkly with Anisimova's increasing frustration. During the second set, the American had opportunities to win her first game but ended up letting out a scream when that chance eluded her again. 12, both during the match and afterward when she gave an emotional on-court interview. Anisimova's fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff was also quick to offer her support, writing in a post on X: ‚Äúkeep your head up.‚Äù so much to be proud of Amanda‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è keep your head up üëë The 24-year-old displayed her impressive forehand once again to round out a tournament in which she has far outperformed her previous self ‚Äî she had only made it as far as the quarterfinals before this year. But, in truth, it was her ability to stay in rallies and wait for Anisimova's errors that proved most decisive. ≈öwiƒÖtek now has a Wimbledon title to add to her 2022 US Open win, and the four she has claimed at Roland Garros. The 6-0, 6-0 scoreline hasn't happened in a women's Wimbledon singles final since 1911. She broke Anisimova's serve in the very first game and never looked back. It was the first grand slam final for Anisimova, and it will be one the American wants to forget. The new Wimbledon champion simply can't believe what she's just pulled off and isn't letting go of the Venus Rosewater Dish anytime soon. ‚ÄúIt seems super surreal,‚Äù she said in her on-court interview after the final. ‚ÄúFirst of all, I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks. No matter what happened today, you should be proud of the work you're doing, and I hope we're gonna play in many more finals here and other tournaments ‚Äî you have the game for that, so congrats to your team as well. ‚ÄúHonestly, I didn't even dream because, for me, it was just way too far. Today marks not only the first time in the Open Era ‚Äî and first time since 1911 ‚Äî that a player has won a women's singles final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club without dropping a game. Today is ≈öwiƒÖtek's day, but we'll be hearing from Anisimova again. After taking some time to compose herself, the American jokingly thanked her opponent for the thrashing on Centre Court today. ‚ÄúThank you, Iga,‚Äù she said, before praising the Polish star. You guys have still been there for me and lifted me up today, so thank you so much,‚Äù she said. Anisimova then thanked her mom and burst into tears when her mom's face appeared on the big screens inside the court. ‚ÄúI wouldn't be standing here if you guys didn't fly in and support me throughout the rest of the tournament,‚Äù she said to her friends and family. ‚ÄúYou guys were my extra motivation and inspiration that I needed. My mom, who flew in this morning, I definitely would not be standing here.‚Äù It's commonplace for the runner-up to give a post-match interview on court, but you could forgive organizers for breaking that tradition today. The Polish star has created history for herself and you can see how much it meant to her after that match point whistled past the American. The 24-year-old fell to her back on the grass, before she picked herself up and gave her opponent a massive hug. The new Wimbledon champion then ran through the crowd to her player's box where she celebrated with her team. Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek has been crowned the women's singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time with an unprecedented 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova. Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek is now just one game away from winning her first grand slam at Wimbledon. The Polish sensation has bulldozed her way to a 5-0 lead in the second set and is making light work of her first final in SW19. Anisimova will be hoping to at least get one game on the board before this final ends. This has become less about who wins Wimbledon, and more can the American win a game. It doesn't look great for her at the moment, though. The crowd really is pushing her on and going crazy whenever she wins a point and gets the better of a rally. Problem is, those moments are very few and far between. ≈öwiƒÖtek double faults to take it back to deuce, but aces and then has too much again for her opponent on the following point. It's nothing more than small consolation for Anisimova. It's going from bad to worse for Anisimova in this match and it's her serve letting her down the most. It's form that simply isn't good enough for any tennis match at this level, nevermind the Wimbledon final and you can see she knows it. This would not have been how Amanda Anisimova envisaged her first grand slam final going. It's hard not to feel sorry for Anisimova given how this match is going, but her opponent is looking so assured right now. ≈öwiƒÖtek has historically struggled on grass, but is dominating here ‚Äì her serve reaches 117 mph on the way to another hold. She's made to work for this one a bit more, with Anisimova tying the score at 30-30 before the Pole takes control again. This is actually getting quite hard to watch now. Anisimova had chances to win her first service game there but produced two unforced errors when it really mattered. She let out two screams during that game, the loudest when her opponent took yet another break point opportunity to take the lead again in this second set. It wasn't to be, however, for the American who dropped yet another service game. ≈öwiƒÖtek's dominance when attacking Anisimova's second serve is proving vital as she gets yet another break to fall her way. It was a dominant opening set from ≈öwiƒÖtek, but this is nothing new for the Polish star. She is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 ‚Äî referred to as a ‚Äúbagel‚Äù ‚Äî and 6-1 ‚Äî a ‚Äúbreadstick‚Äù ‚Äî has led to jokes from tennis fans about ≈öwiƒÖtek running a bakery. Anisimova will be hoping ≈öwiƒÖtek's bakery closes early today. You've really got to feel for Anisimova here. She's certainly feeling the heat in more ways than one here. We've barely even gotten going on Centre Court, and already ≈öwiƒÖtek has claimed the first set. She fails to return ≈öwiƒÖtek's first two serves, before losing the next point after an excellent rally. It has been a tough start for Amanda Anisimova and she now trails 5-0 after losing yet another service game. Iga ≈öwiƒÖtek is now in complete control and just one game away from taking an early 1-0 set lead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company to a private security company called City Shield. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students into caf√©s, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield, a private security agency based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. Massive Blue, a company based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly targeting college protesters and activists labeled as ‚Äúradicalized.‚Äù These bots are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect. The tech stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers, real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce product, has been linked to student protest monitoring. These tools don't just observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene before a rally even begins. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Although aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of ‚Äúefficiency,‚Äù it can only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy under the guise of relief. Within the United States, university officials have increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies, whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media posts, drone-mapping encampments, and even identifying masked protestors through AI-enhanced facial recognition. These companies aren't developing tools for student safety. They're developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets. In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with mass arrests. In the same month, Jewish Currents reported on Yale University's use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. The technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence. Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events. Surveillance reports included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads. Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel, both of which specialize in identifying ‚Äúemerging threats‚Äù by combing through vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. And universities have become willing partners in this process. What we're seeing on U.S. campuses today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction. And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad. The money behind these technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms, defense contractors, and government agencies. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the U.S. These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking Palestinians and other ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù populations. Now, they are used on American campuses to monitor solidarity. There is a historical precedent to this kind of repression. The FBI's targeting of student and civil rights activists through COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover's tactics were both coercive and widely normalized. Rather than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats, and alert authorities to so-called ‚Äúescalation indicators.‚Äù Recently, billionaire investor Kevin O'Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns. While O'Leary was widely condemned, his dystopian vision isn't far from the reality already taking root. Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial image or a Twitter handle. Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. The pipeline between Gaza and Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. Surveillance technologies once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S. university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating for Palestine. Many were tested on Palestinians and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds for next-generation policing. University administrators often claim that surveillance is about safety. Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry, dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is inevitable. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. It is a community‚Äëdriven project that deploys interactive maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders, subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque surveillance networks transparent. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is not a threat. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers ‚Äî that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump. We rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has thanked the North Korean troops who helped liberate Russia's Kursk Region earlier this year from a cross-border incursion by Ukraine. Kiev's forces captured some of the border areas in Kursk Region last August before being gradually pushed back. Russia fully liberated the territory this past April. A monument to the North Korean troops who fought in Kursk Region will be erected in Russia, he said, adding that the initiative is ‚Äúfully backed by our North Korean friends.‚Äù When asked if there were plans to deploy North Korean forces elsewhere in the Ukraine conflict, Lavrov explained that the arrival in Kursk Region of troops from North Korea was in response to a proposal made by the country's leader, Kim Jong-un. The deployment took place under a defense pact signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in June 2024. ‚ÄúWe had no reason to refuse this sincere manifestation of solidarity, and we proceed from the fact that North Korea itself determines the forms in which it implements our agreement on strategic partnership,‚Äù he said. Last month, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu announced that around 6,000 North Korean personnel will soon be sent to Kursk Region in line with a decision by Kim. Some 1,000 mine clearance specialists will help with de-mining the territory, while the other 5,000 will be military engineers who will take part in ‚Äúrebuilding infrastructure destroyed by the occupants,‚Äù he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three locations used by Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime as torture and execution sites 50 years ago have been added by Unesco to its world heritage list. Unesco's world heritage list lists sites considered important to humanity and includes the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India and Cambodia's Angkor archaeological complex. About 15,000 people were imprisoned and tortured there. Choeung Ek, located about 15km (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 and immediately herded almost all the city's residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighbouring Vietnam. Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Manet, issued a message on Friday directing people to beat drums simultaneously across the country on Sunday morning to mark the Unesco listing. ‚ÄúMay this inscription serve as a lasting reminder that peace must always be defended,‚Äù Hun Manet said in a video message posted online. ‚ÄúFrom the darkest chapters of history, we can draw strength to build a better future for humanity.‚Äù But naming the three sites to the Unesco list will play a role in educating younger generations of Cambodians and others worldwide. ‚ÄúThough they were the landscape of violence, they too will and can contribute to heal the wounds inflicted during that era that have yet to heal,‚Äù he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A commonsense rule created building requirements for projects receiving federal funds. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. President Donald Trump traveled to central Texas on July 11, one week after flash floods ravaged the region. Officials at the National Weather Service have said that Trump's recent staffing cuts did not impact weather forecasting or alerts, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bristled at questions about whether a different government response could have lessened the death toll. But Trump's National Weather Service cuts are just one facet of a policy agenda that has long been outright hostile to emergency preparedness and climate science writ large. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order revoking a set of federal flood protections known as the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. The rule ‚Äî which was also revoked by Trump during his first term and reinstated under Joe Biden's presidency ‚Äî required federally funded infrastructure projects to comply with certain design requirements. The goal of the standards were not only to protect human lives and homes, but also to save taxpayer money, preventing a never-ending cycle of destroy-rebuild-repeat. Rebuilding structures outside of floodplains would reduce the amount of FEMA money funneled to disaster repair ‚Äî but by acknowledging that climate change exists, the rules simply don't fit Trump's agenda. That risk will only grow as storms get more intense and destructive. ‚ÄúWhy on earth would the federal government want it to be rebuilt to a lower standard and waste our money so that when the flood hits, if it gets destroyed again, we're spending yet more money to rebuild it?‚Äù Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said in an April interview with Grist. According to The New York Times, at least five water treatment plants in Florida that were exempt from tougher national building standards received about $200 million in federal funding. Those plants sustained damage from the storms, including water line breaks and power losses. Another seven water plants, rebuilt to lower flood standards with $100 million in public funds, were identified as high risk but escaped damage during Milton and Helene. Whether any of those structures were impacted by these floods remains to be seen. But from Texas to North Carolina, Los Angeles to Maui, it's clear that nowhere is truly safe from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. As we push for the phaseout of planet-warming fossil fuels, we must also make strides to protect communities that are already in harm's way. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers ‚Äî that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative. But independent journalists at Truthout face mounting political repression under Trump. We rely on your support to survive McCarthyist censorship.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki called upon President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 11 to allow full-scale exhumations of Polish victims of the Volyn massacres, according to RMF24, even as the long-stalled process had already resumed in April. The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Speaking at a ceremony in the eastern Polish city of Chelm marking the 82nd anniversary of the massacres, Nawrocki said the victims "do not cry out for revenge, but for a cross, a grave, and memory," and urged Ukraine to authorize further work across multiple sites. "Poles are waiting for this truth," Nawrocki said, according to Polish news outlet RMF24. It was the first such effort since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium after a wave of vandalism targeting Ukrainian memorials in Poland. Nawrocki emphasized his moral obligation to speak for the victims. "As the future president of Poland, I am obliged to speak with their voice. No one will release me from this," he said. "We need to talk about this history openly," he said. Apologize and apologize, but also honor the memory of those victims who need it, on both sides of the border." Current Polish President Andrzej Duda recently signed legislation establishing July 11 as the National Day of Remembrance for Polish victims of the Volyn massacres. The law was passed with near-unanimous parliamentary support and declares that the "atrocities committed between 1939 and 1946" must remain in Poland's national memory. Ukrainian historians argue that thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliatory actions and insist that the conflict be viewed as mutual ethnic violence rather than genocide. The first exhumation since 2017, at Puzhnyky, where 50 to 120 Poles were killed, was seen as a breakthrough, with both governments pledging to expand joint efforts. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich. While Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the sanctions package itself is not objectionable, his government has blocked the proposal over concerns about a separate EU plan to fully phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Russia continued its attacks on western Ukrainian cities overnight on July 12, striking communities far from the front line with drone swarms and missile attacks for the third straight night. Speaking at a ceremony in Chelm marking the 82nd anniversary of the 1943-44 Volyn massacres, Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki said the victims "do not cry out for revenge, but for a cross, a grave, and memory," and urged Ukraine to authorize further work across multiple sites. The arms will be supplied in a "high triple-digit quantity," he said. Russia launched 623 aerial weapons overnight, including 339 Shahed-type drones, various decoy UAVs, and 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles, the Air Force said. Benjamin Aser, originally from Hungary, was previously a contracted soldier in the Hungarian Defense Forces. Germany will provide Ukraine with a grant worth 40.5 million euro ($47.4 million) to support small and medium-sized Ukrainian businesses, Ukraine's Finance Ministry announced on July 11.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least two people were killed and 28 injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a mass attack against Ukraine for the second night in a row, rocking Ukraine's capital and cities far from the front lines overnight on July 10. Throughout late spring and early summer 2025, Russia has ramped up aggression against Ukraine with a series of record-breaking mass strikes. Reporters said large numbers of drones were flying over the Pechersk neighborhood, a historical district in the city center. At least an hour of near-constant explosions rolled through the city. Blast waves also set off car alarms throughout Kyiv, adding to the roar of drones, ballistic missiles, and air defense fire. Air raid alerts ended at approximately 7 a.m. in Kyiv Oblast. Ukraine's Air Force issued multiple alerts overnight, warning that groups of Russian drones were targeting regions throughout the country, including the far-western Ternopil and Rivne oblasts. The attack caused fires at apartment buildings in Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi and Darnytskyi districts, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. At least 28 people have been injured, with at least 10 hospitalized, local authorities reported, adding that some of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds. Among the injured are two children, Tkachenko said. In the Podilskyi district, a primary healthcare center "was almost completely destroyed" in the Russian attack, Klitchsko later reported. While no employees were injured, filming equipment sustained damage, causing a temporary disruption to broadcasting. It remains unclear whether Russia targeted or hit any military or other strategic targets in the attack, as Ukrainian authorities largely do not disclose such information for security reasons. This makes the full extent of casualties and damage impossible to verify. Russian forces launched 397 drones against Ukraine overnight, with almost 200 of them being Shahed-type kamikaze drones and the rest decoys used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, according to the Air Force. Some 204 drones and missiles reportedly disappeared from radars or were intercepted by electronic warfare. "This is a clear escalation of terror by Russia ‚Äî hundreds of 'Shaheds' every night, constant strikes, and massive attacks on Ukrainian cities," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. Meanwhile, in Kherson, two people were injured by drone strikes during the countrywide mass assault overnight on July 10. They suffered blast injuries and multiple shrapnel wounds. Another four were injured by Russian artillery fire in Kherson late on July 9. Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich. While Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the sanctions package itself is not objectionable, his government has blocked the proposal over concerns about a separate EU plan to fully phase out Russian gas imports by 2028.

German Major General Christian Freuding confirmed that the weapons systems' initial deliveries are expected by the end of July. The arms will be supplied in a "high triple-digit quantity," he said. Russia launched 623 aerial weapons overnight, including 339 Shahed-type drones, various decoy UAVs, and 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles, the Air Force said.

WONSAN /North Korea/, July 12. /TASS/. Pyongyang has reaffirmed its unequivocal support for all the goals of Russia's special military operation and Moscow's actions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a press conference following talks with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui in Wonsan.

"We exchanged views on the situation surrounding the Ukrainian crisis," he noted. "Our Korean friends confirmed their firm support for all the objectives of the special military operation, as well as for the actions of the Russian leadership and armed forces. In turn, we once again expressed our sincere gratitude for the contribution of Korean People's Army servicemen to the successful liberation of the Kursk Region from Ukrainian Nazis and foreign mercenaries," Lavrov added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's Western allies believe that US President Donald Trump is predisposed to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as his negotiating partner, and Vladimir Zelensky as the main obstacle to peace, the Financial Times reported citing sources. "There's a little bit of overexcitement based on a shift in tone," said one of the officials. "But we're not seeing that translate into major actions." The sources said that the American Patriot complexes are crucial for the protection of Ukraine, but they will not affect its ability to strike back and will not change the overall dynamics of the conflict as a whole. Earlier, Zelensky said that the US arms supplies to Ukraine had resumed. On July 2, the New York Times reported that Washington would suspend supplies to Kiev of missiles for Patriot anti-aircraft systems, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, Stinger man-portable air defense systems and a number of other weapons. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned John Ginkel, charge d'affaires of the United States in Kiev, while Zelensky noted that Europe was not able to replace American supplies. On July 3, Trump said that Washington continues to provide military assistance to Kiev, adding that the United States itself needs weapons. On July 7, Trump actually resumed arms and military equipment supplies to Ukraine. On June 10, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the supply of American weapons continues under a schedule agreed between the Washington administration and Congress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California since April.Mario Tama/Getty Images A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles. Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one who was held despite showing agents his identification. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA. Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility. U.S. detainees describe worm-filled food, inhuman treatment at ‚ÄòAlligator Alcatraz' migrant centre Protesters and federal agents clash during immigration raid at Southern California farm ‚ÄúEnforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.‚Äù Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was under way after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an ‚Äúarbitrary arrest quota‚Äù and based on ‚Äúbroad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.‚Äù It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who ‚Äúlooked Hispanic.‚Äù McLaughlin said ‚Äúenforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence‚Äù before making arrests. In some cases, they also operated off ‚Äútargeted, individualized packages,‚Äù he said. Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as ‚ÄúB-18‚Äù on several occasions since June, according to court documents. Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys ‚Äúattempted to shout out basic rights‚Äù at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed. Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them. Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President says Kyiv ‚Äòpreparing new European defence packages'; Ukraine says its drones hit fighter aircraft plant and missile production facility inside Russia. The US has resumed military supplies to Ukraine and senior officials in Kyiv will work on military cooperation next week with Washington's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Friday. He restated that Ukraine had received high-level signals from Washington and its other western allies that arms supplies, paused for a time last week, had now resumed. ‚ÄúWe are currently working with partners on new supplies, increased weapons production in Ukraine and better support for our army,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNext week, we will continue working with the US side on a military level ‚Ä¶ We are also preparing new European defence packages.‚Äù Kellogg, interviewed by the Ukrainian media outlet Novyny.LIVE while attending a conference about Ukraine in Rome, said: ‚ÄúWe'll be in Kyiv Monday. During an interview with NBC News, the US president said: ‚ÄúSo what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.‚Äù ‚ÄúRussia has increased its attacks against civilians to really cause as much pain ‚Ä¶ and that's unacceptable,‚Äù the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said. Brussels was considering an 18th round of sanctions against Moscow and ‚Äúwe are also still in negotiations to put the oil price cap on, that would deprive Russia from the means to fund this war‚Äù, she told AFP. ‚ÄúI also expressed that it has consequences for European aid to Laos if something like this is happening,‚Äù Kallas said. ‚ÄúIf you [Laos] contribute to that existential threat, we can't have good cooperation,‚Äù she warned. Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks killed three people in Russia on Friday. Russian air defence systems intercepted 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow said. There was one dead in Russia's Lipetsk region and another was killed in the western Tula region from the drone attacks, local officials said. Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region, causing explosions and fires at both. Ukraine's military said on Telegram the aviation facility in the town of Lukhovitsy, about 135km (84 miles) south-east of Moscow, produced MiG fighters. Nato will need more long-range missiles in its arsenal to deter Russia from attacking Europe because Moscow is expected to increase production of long-range weapons, a US army general told Reuters. ‚ÄúThe Russian army is bigger today than it was when they started the war in Ukraine,‚Äù Maj Gen John Rafferty said at a US military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. Speaking to Russian magazine Expert, Peskov said that many media outlets have been closed, while some reporters have left the country in the past three years. ‚ÄúBut don't forget the situation we are in. Now is the time of military censorship, unprecedented for our country. Russian authorities also blocked X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
