                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 12: FIFA President Gianni Infantino speaks during a media scrum at the ... More Trump Tower ahead of FIFA Club World Cup Final on July 12, 2025 in New York City. A day prior to the final, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed that the FIFA Club World Cup "has been a huge, huge, huge success" and that the "golden era of football has started." However, there might be some other individuals out there in the soccer universe to think otherwise, especially players and coaches, who have had to endure the heat and thunderstorms of the U.S. summer. Infantino said during a press conference in Manhattan in New York City on Saturday morning, according to BBC.com. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadiums. That's around 40,000 spectators per match - there is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams and these are neutral stadiums. "We heard financially it would not work but I can say we generated over $2 billion in revenues with this competition. We earned on average $33 million per match. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33 million per match. On the financial end, it appears to have been successful. They will note that many matches were played in the afternoon, at noon and 3 p.m., when the temperatures are either rising or at their highest. LONDON, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 30: Juergen Klopp, Manager of Liverpool, reacts during the Premier ... More League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool FC at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on September 30, 2023 in London, England. "People who have never had anything to do with day-to-day business or who no longer have anything to do with it come up with something. "This means no real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally." PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - JULY 04: Enzo Fernandez #8 of Chelsea FC celebrates following the FIFA ... More Club World Cup 2025 quarter final match between SE Palmeiras and Chelsea FC at Lincoln Financial Field on July 04, 2025 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On Friday, Chelsea captain and defender Enzo Fernandez, a member of the Argentine squad that captured the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, complained about competing in the scorching heat. "Honestly, the heat is incredible," he said during a press conference. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?" MIAMI, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 05: FIFA President Gianni Infantino presents The FIFA Club World Cup ... More Trophy during the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup Draw at Telemundo Studios on December 05, 2024 in Miami, Florida. In terms of avoiding the heat, Infantino said that in contrast to the Club World Cup, the 2026 World Cup will have four stadiums with roofs - Atlanta (Mercedes-Benz Stadium), Dallas (AT&T Stadium), Houston (NRG Stadium) and Vancouver (BC Place). It should be noted that there is a dozen other 2026 World Cup venues that won't have roofs and will be susceptible to weather (heat and thunderstorms). The FIFA president said that added that his organization is studying methods to improve playing conditions. "Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyze what can do better," Infantino added. "Of course, the heat is an issue. WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 28:  U.S. President Donald Trump (R) and FIFA President Gianni Infantino ... More pose for photographs with a soccer uniform in the Oval Office at the White House August 28, 2018 in Washington, DC. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico and will be the first World Cup in history to be held in three countries at the same time. Infantino said that that U.S. President Donald Trump will attend Sunday's final between UEFA Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain and UEFA Conference League champion Chelsea. Earlier in the week, Infantino announced that FIFA would open an office at Trump Tower. "President Trump will be at the final," he said, according to www.espn.com. You can't stage tournaments like this without his support."</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ — There's only one more trophy left to be raised by Paris Saint-Germain. And they hope to cap off one of the most historic seasons in the sport's history with a victory against English side Chelsea in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium. “We really want to make history, and we're hungry for a win,” PSG's Brazilian captain Marquinhos said. Watching them work is truly a spectacle for the sport. They thrive off pressuring the opposing team, then attack with quick thinking and decisive passes in harmony. Mind you, this was a club that featured Argentine World Cup champion Lionel Messi, French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé and Brazilian star Neymar just two years ago. And now, they're somehow playing better without them. “Right now, they're the best team in the world — without a doubt,” Messi said after losing 4-0 against his former club with Major League Soccer's Inter Miami in the round of 16 on June 29. This PSG group has its fair share of unheralded stars who will surely be recognized more after their Champions League win, and if they secure the Club World Cup title. Désiré Doué is also rising French star, and Moroccan defender Achraf Hakimi both shined during their Champions League run. Fabián Ruiz, who helped Spain win Euro 2024 last summer, had two goals against Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semifinal. PSG often start matches by just kicking the ball out of bounds like a NFL punter, immediately applying pressure on their opponent. Dembélé leads the charge defensively so he can make an immediate offensive impact. It causes some to fluster, like Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois did, when PSG routed them 4-0 in their July 9 semifinal. “I told [Dembélé] after the game that he was pressing a lot, and he told me that's what he had to do,” Courtois told reporters after the semifinal. “On a clearance, I have half a second to think about where I'm going to shoot, because they're pressing you.” Added Marquinhos: “We have a very offensive gameplan. We always want to have ball possession. Luis Enrique has been the architect of PSG's season — 10 years after leading Messi and Barcelona to a Champions League title. Enrique has inspired PSG's style, awake even further after they dropped a 1-0 match in the group stage to Brazilian side Botafogo in the tournament. “A team with 11 stars, that's the goal. Enrique knows PSG could face defeat in the Club World Cup final — or any of the matches that follow them into next season.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eagle-eyed fans at MetLife Stadium may have noticed a stage being built in the sky. Is this where either Chelsea or Paris Saint-Germain will be crowned world champions on Sunday? Or, more logically, is it where the final's halftime show will be performed? This stage, high in the nose-bleed sections of the stadium, will be where J Balvin, Doja Cat, Tems and Emmanuel Kelly will make history for FIFA. Global Citizen, which partnered with FIFA and is leading the halftime show with Coldplay's Chris Martin, revealed more details to U.S. magazine ‘Rolling Stone' on Friday. It took six semi-trucks to deliver all this material to the venue, Global Citizen said, with the stage itself made up of 4,000 feet of pipe bracing and LED displays with nearly 16 million pixels. “By building our platform high in the stands, we ensured that the newly installed natural grass remains untouched while delivering an unforgettable show that is designed to be time-efficient and visually stunning,” Hugh Evans, Global Citizen's chief executive, told ‘Rolling Stone'. The 15-minute halftime show is a curious addition to FIFA's tournament lineup, but it falls in line with the body's theme of expanding and growing this new-look competition as much as it can. Halftime shows are more a tradition in American sports than European soccer, with the NFL's Super Bowl spectaculars being the biggest example of what this can look like. While FIFA has notably never hosted a halftime performance in the past, last year, South American equivalent Conmebol took a risk when it tapped Shakira to debut in Copa América's inaugural halftime show at its final in Miami, Florida. It will be interesting to see if there are any gripes now that FIFA's in charge of a similar performance, or if the sky-high staging at MetLife helps alleviate any of those potential grievances. The way foreign executives see it, Americans have successfully merged sport with entertainment in a way that is unmatched elsewhere in the world. It's why so many soccer tournaments have come to the U.S. in recent years, and it's why next year's World Cup, co-hosted with Canada and Mexico, is fully embracing this in not-so-subtle ways, such as a halftime show. This weekend's Club World Cup final will also feature a pre-match ceremony. There will also be “a powerful tribute to the tournament hosts”, with the U.S. national anthem performed, a military color guard and a “dramatic flyover and dazzling pyrotechnics (that) will electrify the stadium”, in FIFA's words. There is still plenty we don't know about the halftime show – like whether performers will be limited to that stage, or if we'll see anyone pull a Lady Gaga. How could anyone forget her big leaps and dramatic exit during the 2017 Super Bowl in Houston, Texas? One sure thing is that whatever happens this weekend will likely offer lessons and instruction for 2026. Melanie Anzidei  is a Staff Writer for The Athletic covering soccer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa president Gianni Infantino was speaking alongside footballing legends like Ronaldo Nazario, Roberto Baggio and Kaka at Trump Tower Infantino, who has led world football's governing body since 2016, claims the competition has generated more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in revenue, which he says is worth "$33m (£24m) per match". As a result, he believes the tournament has been a "huge success", adding "the golden era of global club football has started". Chelsea midfielder Fernandez said the heat was "very dangerous", while his manager Enzo Maresca complained it is "impossible" to have a normal training session. Speaking at Trump Tower in New York on the eve of Sunday's final between Chelsea and Paris St-Germain (20:00 BST), Infantino said: "The golden era of global club football has started. That's around 40,000 spectators per match - there is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams and these are neutral stadiums. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match. Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea? In New Jersey, where Sunday's final - set to be attended by US President Donald Trump - will take place, temperatures have reached 38C in recent days. Infantino accepted the high summer temperatures in the US are "definitely an issue" after Fernandez called on Fifa to consider player welfare before next summer's 2026 World Cup. Earlier this month, players' union Fifpro said it believed Chelsea's game against ES Tunis in Philadelphia, among others, should have been delayed or postponed because of the heat. "Of course, the heat is definitely an issue," said Infantino.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There were also doubts about the level of interest the competition would generate among fans but Infantino said he was satisfied with the attendances at matches - despite many games being far from sold out - and claimed it had been a major success financially. "The golden age of club football has started. We can definitely say this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge success," Infantino told reporters at Trump Tower on New York City's Fifth Avenue, where FIFA has just opened an office. "We heard that financially it would not work, that nobody is interested, but I can say we generated almost 2.1 billion dollars in revenues, for 63 matches," he said. "That makes an average of $33 million per match - no other club competition in the world comes close. But the head of world football's governing body dismissed suggestions that Klopp might be speaking for most observers in Europe. "We shouldn't say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it is not true," said Infantino, who was appearing on a stage alongside numerous footballing greats including the Brazilian Ronaldo. "All the teams who have come here have been happy - some teams who didn't come here because they didn't qualify were calling us to see how they could qualify. The next Club World Cup is due to take place in 2029, with Infantino refusing to commit when asked whether the tournament could be played every two years or be expanded to feature more teams.

That's because U.S. men's national team midfielder Malik Tillman has signed with Leverkusen, it was announced on Saturday. The 23-year-old Tillman, whose 33 goal involvements helped PSV win back-to-back Dutch Eredivisie titles in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns signed a five-year contract. The 23-year-old attacker's arrival follows Florian Wirtz's transfer to defending English Premier League champions Liverpool on 20 June. “This club has always played great football,” Tillman said, according to Bundesliga.com. “In the last four or five years, Leverkusen have grown enormously and become attractive to a lot of players throughout Europe. Tillman, one of the USMNT standouts during its recent run as Concacaf Gold Cup runners-up, has scored three goals in 25 international appearances. Born in Nuremberg, Tillman spent eight years in the Bayern Munich system, playing for the record champions' various youth teams before making his professional debut and scoring his first senior club goal in the 2021-22 season. He made seven first-team appearances for Bayern before he was loan to Glasgow Rangers, recording 12 goals and five assists in 43 matches across all competitions during the 2022-23 Scottish Premiership season. Tillman was loaned out to PSV the following campaign, with the move made permanent after he contributed nine goals and 10 assists to PSV's 2023-24 league title.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández heads into Sunday's Club World Cup final wary of the weather, along with Paris Saint-Germain. “Honestly, the heat is incredible,” Fernandez said Friday. Chelsea and PSG play starting at 3 p.m. EDT in MetLife Stadium, also site of next year's World Cup final. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle.” Temperature at kickoff is forecast to be 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) with humidity that will make it feel like 91 F (33 C). “I think we've played in it a fair amount now, so I'd say we're slowly, slowly getting used to it.” Both teams were allowed by FIFA not to have media availabilities on Saturday. PSG seeks to complete a quadruple after winning Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and its first Champions League title. Chelsea is trying for its second world championship after winning in 2021. The Blues have a fourth day of rest after beating Fluminense 2-0 on Tuesday, a day before PSG routed Real Madrid 4-0. Lowest ticket prices dropped from $330 earlier in the week to $199.60 on Saturday. “I agree with most of the people that they say that they are the best team in Europe, the best team in the world, and the reason why is because they are showing this — they show in France, they show in the Champions League, they are showing in this competition,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said. “We really want to go grab this title and this would make it an absolutely perfect season, which would be very hard to replicate,” PSG captain Marquinhos said. “Everyone is picking up our opposition,” James said. NOTES: Maresca said winger Noni Madueke had left the team to sign elsewhere.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer players like Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea are very concerned about the heat at the World Cup next summer. They struggled with the high temperatures and humidity at the Club World Cup this year so they are asking FIFA to reconsider its schedule for 2026. The solution is very simple if you ask me! They just so happened to arrive right in the middle of a massive heatwave. Temperatures spiked well above 80º, 90º and even 100º during the group stage. South American clubs did not seem to have a huge issue with the weather. They don't know how to handle it. Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea is the latest player to voice his worries for next summer. Honestly, I don't know how to explain it. He also asked FIFA to reevaluate the upcoming tournament. Let's hope that next year they change the schedule. At least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right? Should they do the same for North America? Six host venues at the 2026 World Cup could be an issue. Atlanta, Dallas and Houston are domed so that is not a problem. Kansas City, Miami, Monterrey, Philadelphia, Foxborough and Guadalajara are not. Extreme temperatures might be a factor during those matches like they were at the Club World Cup. However, the most prominent temperature issues this year came during a heat wave. That would be a very lucky break. Stu Holden also pointed to the different temperatures at different international and domestic cities on the some day Fernandez made his scathing comments. They were fairly standard across the board. Honestly— enough of the “USA conditions aren't safe for players”. Where do you want to play it Enzo? Here is a graphic showing the current temperatures in NYC, London, Paris, and Madrid. I am not going to discount the humidity. I know 84º in New York was considered a fairly tepid summer day. Much like the MLS, matches should be scheduled according to venue. A match played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be air conditioned. It can be played at any hour of the day without issue. Put those matches during the peak of daylight. A match played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami will be hot during the day. Put those matches late in the evening or after sunset. FIFA is probably going to do whatever makes the most sense for its television broadcast partners and for its financial gain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid center back Raúl Asencio has acknowledged he fell short of expectations in the team's Club World Cup run this summer. A defensive injury crisis plagued Xabi Alonso's squad in the United States. Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba and Éder Militão were all injured in the opening stages, leaving the new manager with just Asencio and new signing Dean Huijsen as senior center-back options. He conceded a penalty and was hooked at half-time of the 1–1 draw with Al Hilal, before earning a straight red card just seven minutes into the group game against Pachuca. Suspended against RB Salzburg and benched to take on Juventus, Asencio managed five minutes as a late substitute in the quarterfinal win over Borussia Dortmund, but he was then restored to the starting lineup for the semifinal against Paris Saint-Germain. In his hour on the pitch, Asencio was guilty of an error which led to an early goal for PSG, although he was by no means the only player to disappoint in the humbling 4–0 defeat. It was a bitterly disappointing end to a breakout season at Madrid from Asencio, who took to social media to apologize for his performances at the Club World Cup. “Madridistas, a season in which I have fulfilled my dream of being part of the best club in the world is ending but it has ended in the way I least wanted,” Asencio wrote on Instagram. “I feel like I haven't been up to it in a demanding Club World Cup but now it's time to disconnect and recharge. Militão caught the eye in his brief return from injury this summer and may be the favorite to start alongside Huijsen, particularly as Rüdiger still has one game left on his six-match suspension issued towards the end of last season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Kansas City has hosted its share of major sporting events, including NCAA championship games, all-star games, four World Series and six of the last seven AFC Championship Games, but the FIFA World Cup 26 quarterfinal on July 11, 2026 — one year from Friday — will be the biggest sporting event the city's ever seen. “You can't match the global scale,” Paul Carr, who attended the 2010 Uruguay-Ghana quarterfinal in South Africa, said. Carr was in South Africa working as a researcher for ESPN and said Uruguay's penalty-kick shootout win was the greatest sporting event he's ever attended. “I've been to Final Fours, NCAA tournaments, World Series, World Cup qualifiers, etc., but there's just a united passion that you get,” he said. It's the biggest sporting event most of these fans will ever be at or be involved in or root for, so all of that just comes out.” KCK Community College women's soccer coach Jefferson Roblee attended the 1994 Brazil-Netherlands quarterfinal at the old Cotton Bowl in Dallas. “You have intensity that the game means something, but it's on a global level. You also have just the energy of the game would be like a gigantic Super Bowl, World Series type of event, except for on a global level.” Roblee attended Brazil's win en route to the World Cup title with his twin brother and some friends. “To be honest, there were a lot of Netherlands fans, but the Brazil fans seemed to just engulf the stadium. Recent World Cup finals have drawn between 517 million and 571 million global viewers, while the typical quarterfinal draws roughly 250 million viewers around the world, which dwarfs the estimated 186.2 million people who watched the Chiefs beat San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII. ... Making that jump from the quarters to the semis is legacy building for both players and teams.” KSHB 41 reporter Tod Palmer covers sports business and eastern Jackson County.</p>
