                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Few would have believed it if they were told, at the start of Wimbledon, that Iga Swiatek would end up winning the title. In fact, I think even she would have laughed at the notion. After all, she had historically struggled on grass, and whenever given the chance, would play down her chances of ever succeeding on the surface. It was perhaps this refreshing lack of expectation which helped propel her to such success, as she touched upon in her press conference. Naturally, the six-time Grand Slam champion was in an upbeat mood as she strolled into the media room. After all, she had just captured yet another major, and on the grass of Wimbledon no less. Few expected such a result on this surface, least of all Iga Swiatek. With that in mind, one reporter asked her to compare this latest triumph to her many French Open successes, drawing a smile from the Polish star. “Oh my God, that's always the hardest question,” she began. “It feels like the emotions are bigger. Here I wasn't sure of that. I have so much respect to the other tournaments. I worked really hard to win all the other Slams. There's no point in choosing between them. It was more of just good tennis and working to make it happen without this baggage on your shoulders.” Swiatek was not finished there though, taking time to lambast Polish media for their treatment of her and her team. Despite being openly proud of her heritage, she took particular disdain with their framing of her as she steadily progressed through Wimbledon. “For sure, the past months, how the media sometimes described me, I gotta say, unfortunately Polish media, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant. I have the best people around me. I hopefully am gonna have freedom from them to let me do my job the way I want it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ATP Tour returns to clay and hard courts this week, with three ATP 250 events taking place. Andrey Rublev is the highest-ranked player in action, competing at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos, a hard-court event that has shifted from its traditional February slot to July. 1) Rublev Makes Debut: The 17-time tour-level champion Rublev is set to make his Los Cabos debut as the top seed. Rublev arrives in Baja California with a 21-15 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result being a title run at the ATP 500 in Doha. 2) Foki's Summer Heats Up: It has been a memorable few months for Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who married his longtime girlfriend Paloma Amatiste in June and then reached the Eastbourne semi-finals, followed by a third-round run at Wimbledon. The Spaniard reached two finals earlier this year, in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and now sets his sights on a maiden tour-level title in Los Cabos, where he is seeded second. 3) #NextGenATP Stars: The Mexican crowd will be in full force for home favourite Rodrigo Pacheco Mendez, the 20-year-old lefty who is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. Also in the Los Cabos field is fellow #NextGenATP contender Nishesh Basavareddy, who is sixth in the Race To Jeddah. While the American is bidding for a return to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Pacheco Mendez is chasing his maiden trip to the 20-and-under event. 4) Shapo Among Other Seeds: Third seed Denis Shapovalov brings plenty of firepower to his Los Cabos debut. Shapovalov owns a 12-6 hard-court record this season. Fourth seed Quentin Halys and fifth seed Daniel Altmaier look to spoil the party and claim their first tour-level trophy. Doumbia and Reboul are looking for their second title of the season, having triumphed in Geneva. Finalists in Acapulco earlier this year, can they go one step further this time in Mexico? Ruud is 13-4 on clay this season, highlighted by his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Madrid. Gstaad will mark Ruud's first tournament since Roland Garros. He withdrew from Wimbledon due to a knee injury. The Kazakh reached his maiden Slam quarter-final at Roland Garros, followed by a title run in Halle, where he lifted his fifth tour-level crown. After a disappointing first-round exit at Wimbledon, Bublik looks to return to his winning ways as the second seed in Gstaad. 3 Stan Wawrinka is set for his 12th appearance in Gstaad, a tournament he first competed at in 2003. Wawrinka could meet Bublik in the second round, while fellow Swiss Dominic Stricker is also in the field, with a potential second-round clash against Ruud. Swiss Jerome Kym is also in the draw. 4) #NextGenATP Pathway: Spaniard Martin Landaluce is using a Next Gen Accelerator spot to gain entry into the main draw. Players aged 20-and-under who are ranked in the Top 250 of the PIF ATP Rankings are eligible for one ATP 250 main draw spot, an effort to support young talent and their development pathway. The 19-year-old Landaluce, seeking his second tour-level win, is World No. 5) Doubles Draw: Portugal's Francisco Cabral and Austrian Lucas Miedler spearhead the doubles field, which also features Stan Wawrinka playing alongside countryman Henry Bernet, this year's Australian Open boys' singles champion. 2) Defending Champ Borges: It was a memorable week for Nuno Borges last year in Bastad, where he captured his first tour-level trophy and upset 92-time tour-level titlist Rafael Nadal in the final. Borges, seeded third, looks to successfully defend the title. Borges became the second Portuguese ATP Tour titlist, joining Joao Sousa. 3) Baez Seeking More Clay Success: Sebastian Baez won the clay ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro for the second consecutive year and reached two additional finals on the surface in Santiago and Bucharest. 4) Other Seeds: Camilo Ugo Carabelli, Luciano Darderi, Damir Dzumhur and Vit Kopriva are seeded fifth through eight, respectively. 5) Doubles Top Seeds Andreozzi/Arends: Guido Andreozzi and Sander Arends are the top seeds in Bastad doubles. Romain Arneodo and Manuel Guinard are seeded second. Ruud is 13-4 on clay this season, highlighted by his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Madrid. Gstaad will mark Ruud's first tournament since Roland Garros. He withdrew from Wimbledon due to a knee injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iga Swiatek crushes Amanda Anisimova 6-0 6-0 in Wimbledon women's singles final; Follow scores, reports and our live blog from the men's final on Sunday; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24 It is only the second time in Wimbledon's history that a women's final has ended with the same scoreline when Dorothea Lambert Chambers beat Dora Boothby in 1911, while the only other instance at a Grand Slam came in the French Open in 1988 when Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva. A NINTH different women's singles champion 2016 Serena Williams 2017 Garbine Muguruza 2018 Angelique Kerber 2019 Simona Halep 2021 Ashleigh Barty 2022 Elena Rybakina 2023 Marketa Vondrousova 2024 Barbora Krejcikova 2025 Iga Swiatek "It seems super surreal," Swiatek said during the trophy presentation. "First of all I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks no matter what happened today. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and at other tournaments. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam showpiece, failed to win a single game, with Swiatek racing to victory on a stunned Centre Court in only 57 minutes. A first Grand Slam final is always a nerve-racking occasion, though, and it was obvious from the start that Anisimova was struggling to get her legs moving and her arms swinging freely. She could not find her first serve and was making error after error, while Swiatek, who had won all five of her previous Slam finals, looked right at home. The breezy conditions did not help, and it took Swiatek just 25 minutes to wrap up the first set, with Anisimova winning only nine points. The American, who stepped away from tennis for eight months in 2023 for mental health reasons, twice screamed in frustration, and probably rising panic, after errors in the opening game of the second set. Every half chance was either snuffed out by Swiatek or crushed by another wild mistake - she made 28 unforced errors in the 12 games - and a final Swiatek winner put her out of her misery. "Thank you to everyone who's supported me since my first-round match here. Sir Mo Farah, Stanley Tucci and Greta Gerwig were among the celebrities in Wimbledon's Royal Box for the women's singles final. The Devil Wears Prada actor Tucci was sitting next to American filmmaker Noah Baumbach, who attended on Saturday with his wife, Barbie director Gerwig. "When you say that it sounds incredible," said Glasspool. "It's been one Brit (winner) the last couple of years, now we've given you two Brits." In the men's wheelchair doubles final, Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid lost their title. The six-time winners and top seeds were upset 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 on Court One by Martin De La Puente from Spain and Dutchman Ruben Spaargaren.

It wasn't just a story of the two 6-0s she served out on Center Court, she also made it 6-0 in Grand Slam finals in her career, winning her sixth Major in her sixth title clash. If Anisimova had an actual nightmare before the final, one doubts it would have been worse than the reality that unfolded in front of her eyes. Right from the pre-match walk onto the Center Court, where Swiatek strode out with her headphones on (possibly listening to some AC/DC) much ahead of her American opponent, the former world No 1 looked dialled in. It showed in the opening game right away as Anisimova appeared to be a bundle of nerves. A brief window opened for the 13th seed to break in the fourth game at 15-30, but this time her groundstrokes let her down. On the other side of the net, there was no letdown of intensity from Swiatek as she crunched some deep forehands to draw out more errors from her opponent. The bad start for Anisimova quickly turned into her worst nightmare, getting broken at love to go down 0-5. At 5-0, 30-0, Anisimova would have wondered if it wasn't just meant to be, as Swiatek scrambled around to win a point she had no business winning. That was, however, quickly followed by two cries of frustration and a helpless stare towards the team in her box. Down a breakpoint again, she hit another winner to force deuce. But it was only a flash in the pan. There was to be no turnaround and Swiatek swiftly closed the match out and fell on her back on the hallowed grass. For Anisimova, the result unfortunately bookended what was otherwise a memorable fortnight in London. Her tournament began with a 6-0 6-0 thrashing of Yulia Putintseva (who had coincidentally beaten Swiatek in last year's quarterfinal) and ended in tears with the scoreline being reversed. For Swiatek, Wimbledon 2025 will hold a special place in her career. “Honestly, I didn't even dream, because it felt too far. I feel like I am an experienced player after having won Slams before, but I never expected this one.” Sometimes, when you put your head down (after listening to some rock music) and work hard, even undreamt dreams come true.</p>

We might even ask ourselves what we've done to deserve the rise of this rivalry, so soon after the end of our Big 3 Golden Era. If Sinner and Alcaraz can come close to reproducing their Roland Garros classic on Centre Court, we may remember this as a golden men's tennis summer of its own, up there with Borg and McEnroe in the early 80s, and Federer and Nadal in the late-aughts.Alcaraz likes it, too.“I think the things that we are doing right now I think is great for tennis,” he says. We're just fighting for the tennis to be bigger.” We might even ask ourselves what we've done to deserve the rise of this rivalry, so soon after the end of our Big 3 Golden Era.

Each has had an earlier hiccup in this tournament, but each seems to have put it behind him.Alcaraz's issue was his erratic level of play in the early going, which saw him need five sets to subdue 38-year-old Fabio Fognini, and four sets to beat Jan-Lennard Struff. He said he starting feeling more comfortable with his serve late in that match, and it showed in his wins over Cam Norrie and Taylor Fritz. By the semis, Alcaraz was feeling confident enough in his serve to start following it to the net.“I just serving really good,” he said.

Sinner's issue was physical—and it put him on the brink of defeat. That, and Dimitrov's excellent play, left Sinner in a two-set hole. Sinner hasn't dropped a set since, and while he has worn a sleeve on his right arm, he hasn't shown any ill effects from it.“No issue for Sunday,” Sinner says of his elbow. “I think we are handling this small problem at the moment very well.

Kate, the Princess of Wales, and other celebrities attended the Wimbledon Tennis Championships to watch Poland's Iga Swiatek shut out American Amanda Anisimova in her first game on Centre Court.

The final began at 4 p.m. local time in London, which is 11 a.m. EDT, and it lasted under an hour. Swiatek won the women's final in consecutive sets, 6-0, 6-0.

Kate, the wife of Prince William, presented the trophy to Swiatek, the winner of the women's singles final. She didn't attend the match last year while she was recovering from cancer.

Jannik Sinner says Carlos Alcaraz favourite in men's singles final at Wimbledon, won't compare rivalry to big three

Jannik Sinner played down the impact of his painful defeat against Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final as he prepared for a rematch at Wimbledon on Sunday.

The world number one crushed seven-time champion Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in under two hours on Friday to set up a title showdown against the Spanish two-time defending champion.

Alcaraz had earlier dispatched US fifth seed Taylor Swift in four sets on Centre Court.

Just weeks ago at Roland Garros, Alcaraz came back from two sets down against Sinner, saving three match points to win a fifth grand slam.

But Italy's Sinner, 23, played down the lingering impact of that loss in the aftermath of his semi-final win against Djokovic.

“I think if it would be a lot in my head, I would not be in the situation to play a final again, I guess,” he said. “I'm very happy to share once again the court with Carlos. It's going to be difficult, I know that.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephanie Petit is a Royals Editor, Writer and Reporter at PEOPLE. Kate Middleton is back at one of her favorite summer outings: Wimbledon. Kate, who took her seat in the royal box at Centre Court, continued her recent streak of tailored elegance in a white belted blazer-style top and cream pleated skirt — a silhouette she also embraced earlier this week during the French state visit. As patron, Kate also wore a Wimbledon purple and green bow pinned to the left side of her top. On July 2, Princess Kate visited Colchester Hospital in Essex, where she spoke candidly about her cancer journey. "You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' " she said. "But the reality is you go through hard times." Kate also met 12-year-old Sophie Kneen, set to do the coin toss for the women's final, along with ball boys, ball girls and honorary stewards. Crossing the bridge, she smiled and waved to hundreds of waiting fans. Guided by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, a former pro, Kate greeted the welcoming party and briefly chatted about their tournament experiences. Kate has regularly attended Wimbledon over the years, even before Queen Elizabeth appointed her as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2016. She has watched the tournament in person every year since she married Prince William in 2011, apart from the 2013 matches, which took place when she was "heavily pregnant" with Prince George and doctors advised against her attending, and when Wimbledon was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Princess Kate's return to Wimbledon comes after she attended the men's singles finals in July 2024, marking one of her few appearances of the year as she mainly remained out of the spotlight amid her cancer treatment. On July 14, 2024, the royal received a standing ovation as she made her way to her seat in the front row of the Royal Box at Centre Court, joined by her daughter, Princess Charlotte, and sister, Pippa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>KATE Middleton dazzled at Wimbledon as she handed the trophy to winner Iga Swiatek. Kate then comforted her while she presented Anisimova with the runner-up trophy. She was followed by Iga who repeatedly thanked the Princess while she was presented with the trophy. It is only the second time in the Open Era that a 'double bagel' [6-0, 6-0] score has been achieved in a women's match. It has cemented Swiatek's position among the world tennis champions, as she has now won majors on all three surfaces - the youngest woman to do so since Serena Williams. The beaming Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, looked classy in a white belted blazer-style and cream pleated skirt as she watched Iga Swiatek beat Amanda Anisimova in straight sets. Kate also donned a Wimbledon purple and green bow on the left-hand side of her top. A massive cheer went up as she smiled and waved before taking her seat in the Royal Box, with the beloved Princess getting a standing ovation. She briefly greeted American ace Martina Navratilova, 68, as she walked along the first row of the VIP seating section. Tennis legend and six-time Wimbledon winner Billie Jean King, 81, then curtseyed to the royal before the pair shook hands. As she accepted the cheers from the packed 15,000 crowd, a smiley Kate waved twice – once with her left and right hands -- prompting another huge cheer. Earlier, the Princess first spoke with women's wheelchair tennis champion Wang Ziying – only moments after she won her final in straight sets. She also talked with Sophie Kneen, 12, who will do the coin toss for this afternoon's women's final, ball boys and girls, and honorary stewards. Kate was guided around the grounds by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, who is a former professional player. She shook hands with each member of the greeting party and had a brief chat about their time at the tournament so far. In an adorable moment, beaming Princess appeared to ask young Lydia, who overcame a brain injury and had to learn how to walk again, if she had any advice for the big day. The brave girl seemed to reply: "Don't be nervous." Sophie, 12, is part of the foundation's women and girls inclusion project, and said of being chosen to do the coin toss: "I'm really excited, it's always been a dream of mine to go out on Centre Court." Hundreds of spectators gathered in and around the grounds to try and catch a glimpse of the Princess as she entered Wimbledon. She will take part in a special ceremony before moving to the best seat in the house to watch the ladies' final, which is tipped to be an all-time classic. The  Princess of Wales and 15,000 fans on Centre Court will have to battle scorching temperatures of up to 31 degrees as the third heatwave of the summer baked Britain. The Women's Singles final this afternoon will see a showdown between American Amanda Anisimova, 23, and Pole Iga Swiatek, 24 — neither of whom have won in West London before. Seeded eighth for this year's tournament, she arrived having made only one final since her French Open victory last year. Her first peak was marked by a semi-final run at the 2019 French Open, but her rapid rise was soon halted and she took a four-month health break before returning to the sport last year. She arrived at the All England Tennis Club seeded 13th. Anisimova waved and blew kisses to the crowd earlier in the championships after securing a remarkable 6-4 4-6 6-4 victory against world number one Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court. The Men's doubles final on Centre Court earlier today saw Aussie Rinky Hijikata, 24, and Dutch David Pel, 34, face off against Brits Julian Cash, 28, and Lloyd Glasspool, who is 31. Alongside the princess in the Royal Box will be Barbie mastermind Greta Gerwig, Mo Farrah, Stanley Tucci and Billie Jean King. Also present will be Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and Labour's Lisa Nandy. Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay are also expected to be there. Eyes will also be on the thermometers this weekend, as temperatures of up to 33 degrees could bake fans. Kate's mother-in-law Queen Camilla was also back at Wimbledon on Wednesday to watch her favourite player Novak Djokovic in action. Princess Kate has rarely missed attending Wimbledon since marrying Prince William. She did skip the championships in 2013 - and missed Andy Murray's first Wimbledon victory - but this was due to her being heavily pregnant with Prince George at the time. Princess Kate used to take tennis lessons at the elite Hurlingham Club in Fulham, and even set up training sessions for Prince George with tennis legend Roger Federer. Last year, she handed champion Carlos Alcaraz his golden cup as he retained his Wimbledon title against rival Djokovic. Djokovic looked emotional as he trundled off following a first Wimbledon semi-final defeat for 13 years yesterday. Physical problems had prevented him from taking this the full distance as he lost 6-3 6-3 6-4 to the outstanding Jannik Sinner. Both matches would ordinarily begin on Wimbledon's most famous stage at 2pm. While Sunday's opening match will be the women's doubles final at 1pm, with the men's singles final also following at 4pm. All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton explained that the change in schedule will allow the men's and women's finals to attract the "largest possible worldwide audience" with both singles finals starting at 11am ET in New York. Djokovic, 22 years a pro, is still good enough to beat 98 per cent of the ATP Tour players yet against Sinner and two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz he comes up short. Next year, he will be 39-years-old and he accepts his body is breaking down after years of playing the sport. At one hour and 55 minutes, it was the shortest defeat he had experienced, aside from two mid-match SW19 retirements. Djokovic, who slipped late on in the quarter-finals against Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday, had a medical time-out before set three. Automated calls replaced line judges at this year's tournament — with players casting doubt on the technology's accuracy. Around 300 of the blazer- wearing officials who call “Out” and “Fault” have been axed in favour of an electronic gizmo. Replacing them is the Hawk-Eye Challenge System which uses high-speed cameras and algorithms to track ball trajectory with pinpoint accuracy. The decision to adopt AI was made after a pilot at last year's tournament. It is understood the All England Club was reluctant, but the tech has been used in other events for years. Temperatures are expected to peak at 33 or even 34C today as the UK enjoys yet another spell of sunny weather.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner do it again on Sunday, this time at Centre Court, Wimbledon, still the only place in their sport worth talking about. They do it again after a French Open final between them that made tennis feel as big as it did when Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic were beating everyone and winning everything. Here comes Alcaraz-Sinner II, another Grand Slam final between them. The last one, in Paris, was the best tennis match I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them. Now, barely over a month later, the two of them fight for the heavyweight title of their sport all over again. Back in the Wimbledon final of 1980, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe played what will always be known as the “tiebreaker match” because of a 4th set tiebreaker that ended up 18-16 for McEnroe after 22 minutes. Alcaraz vs. Sinner at Roland Garros, on the second Sunday in June: Five hours and 29 minutes. Alcaraz coming from two sets to none down. Alcaraz fighting off three straight match points in the fourth set. At that point, after everything we had seen from him and from Sinner, somehow the kid did this amazing thing: He turned into a combination of Nadal AND Federer. He fired away from the baseline, from both sides, the way Nadal did, ran down balls the way Nadal always did back when Jimmy Connors used to say that Nadal “plays like he's broke.” Somehow, though, in this same stretch of luminous tennis, he was also able to show you the same feathery touch and imagination that Federer had. They have combined to win eight majors already, and the last seven in a row. If Alcaraz wins, this will be his sixth major, and will make him 6-0 in Grand Slam finals (he has also only lost one five-set match in his life). If you are looking for historical context, Nadal had five majors by the time he was 22, Federer had one, Djokovic one. So if Alcaraz gets Sinner again, he will have just one fewer major title than Federer and Nadal and Djokovic combined had at the same age. It's also worth noting that Djokovic — still stuck on 24 majors after losing to Sinner in the Wimbledon semis on Friday — didn't win his sixth major championship until he was 27 years old. But Djokovic is the past now, whether he comes back for one more Wimbledon or not. Alcaraz beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon finals of 2024 and '25. They have played just 12 matches so far, Alcaraz with an 8-4 edge (Borg and McEnroe only played 14 times before Borg walked away from the sport at 24). One U.S. Open and two Australian Opens for Sinner. “I watch [highlights of the French Open final] sometimes and still can't believe that I did it,” Alcaraz said recently. There are no great rivalries in team sports these days. You have Patrick Mahomes in the NFL, but he has a lot of rivals at quarterback, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson and now Jalen Hurts, too. We did have Aaron Judge vs. Shohei Ohtani for a blink last October, but you know it's different in baseball, even with the two most prodigious sluggers or our time. LeBron went at Steph Curry in a couple of NBA finals, but that never felt like Bird against Magic, it just didn't. On the women's side, of course there was Chris Evert vs. Martina Navratilova, as good a rivalry as there ever was in anything, both of them walking away with 18 major titles in singles. Truly, the most memorable opponent Serena Williams ever had was her sister, Venus. But maybe there is a chance now with Alcaraz and Sinner. By early Sunday evening in London we really will know whether the two of them have done it again, produced another major final that will be remember barely over a month from their first one. We will see if the contrasts in their styles, the kind of contrast we had with Ali vs. Frazier once, will already have us hoping they do it a third time this year, at Arthur Ashe Stadium in the finals of the U.S. Open in September, and wouldn't that be something? A match like that wasn't just about tennis. We still come to sports for moments exactly like it. Maybe Alcaraz and Sinner can give us another one at Wimbledon. In case you're keeping score at home, the option for 2026 belongs to Cody Bellinger. And right now, it's good being Cody Bellinger. DJ LeMahieu had some big years for the Yankees, and we all remember a big swing he made against the Astros in the American League Championship Series before Jose Altuve made a swing of his own that everybody around here kind of remembers. But by the end, Willie Randolph had more range than him at second base. Wait, are we still talking about how Tom Thibodeau didn't play his bench guys enough? If Deuce McBride and Landry Shamet had just gotten more burn it would have been Canyon of Heroes here they come. Juan Soto actually should have been an All-Star. Pretty sure that the walk-off home run Ceddanne Rafaela hit against the Rays at Fenway on Friday night has to have come down by now. Got this email from a Yankee fan the other day: “The Yankee front office will sell you on Anthony Volpe's OPS or some other metrics, but for those of us who watch this kid play baseball every day, here is the question we ask when we apply the eye test — Is he really better than he was as a rookie two years ago?” Did anybody really learn anything from Mike Brown's meet-and-greet the other day? Somehow, late in the game, Novak Djokovic can't just lose, it has to turn into the opera when he does. So it was when he lost to Sinner in the semis on Friday at Wimbledon. Djokovic clearly couldn't move the way he wanted to after taking a bad spill at the end of his quarterfinal win over Flavio Cobolli, and he sure didn't quit even though there were a few times when it looked as if he might. But it was a legendary Aussie Davis Cup captain named Harry Hopman who once said this: Do the Red Sox miss Rafael Devers yet? Our son Alex and his wife Jen welcomed their first child — a daughter — to their world, and ours, a few days ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis icon Novak Djokovic's fans were riled up when Taylor Fritz made a quip about the Serb's exclusion from the 2022 US Open. The Covid-19 pandemic was a significant concern back in the summer of 2022, which led to US regulations that barred non-citizens from competing without vaccination proof. This sidelined Djokovic from that year's Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows, much to the quiet relief of his competitors. But his light-hearted advocacy for the event's organisers to let 'Nole' play, despite not being vaccinated, flew over the heads of many diehard Djokovic fans. "We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things," he told reporters (via Daily Express). "But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. So I see both sides of the argument. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles]." Not everyone was amused by those remarks, which sparked outrage among Djokovic's most loyal supporters. So much so that Fritz felt compelled to clarify his jest was purely in good fun and, if anything, intended as a compliment to his competitor. "Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone," he posted on X. "The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else." Despite many of Djokovic's fans taking umbrage at Fritz's Covid comments, the 24-time major champion himself seemed unperturbed. This is evident as the pair have since reconnected, and there doesn't seem to be any lingering animosity between them. Fritz made a remarkably swift recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery, and then triumphed at Wimbledon just 20 days later. He disclosed last year that Djokovic had "reached out" to him for advice as he aimed to make his own speedy recovery from a similar injury. Fritz opened up about their 2024 conversation, revealing: "I told him what it was like for me. A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds - but it is possible."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bain & Company advisory partner and company veteran Chris Harrop will be keeping an especially close eye on Wimbledon this year – and not just as a self-described ‘tennis nut'. Chris Harrop, who has been with Bain & Company for more than three decades, has been tapped to take over as chair of Tennis Australia at the end of the year ahead of the next Australian Open, succeeding fellow Bain veteran Jayne Hrdlicka. Harrop's appointment continues Tennis Australia's close ties with the local consulting industry, and in particular Bain & Company, with much of its board and many of its key executives having previously worked in the sector, including recent recruits. A key driver of the sport's local renaissance has been Hrdlicka. The Australian Open contributed $565 million of that figure alone, almost double the sum of when Hrdlicka took over as Tennis Australia's first female chair in 2017, following two decades at Bain & Company and time at Qantas and Jetstar, the latter as CEO. Taking up Hrdlicka's seat is Harrop, who joined Bain in San Francisco way back in 1993 and has since spent three decades with the consultancy in Sydney, Melbourne and London with a focus on growth strategy, customer experience, and change management in the consumer goods sector, including seven years as head of the firm's TMT (telecom, media & technology) business for the Asia Pacific. Harrop, who some local fans may be dismayed to learn will likely be cheering on the likes of Erin Routliffe and Lulu Sun at next year's open as a proud Kiwi, certainly has his plate full. Also featuring on the board, which Harrop joined at the end of 2023, is former McKinsey partner Graham Bradley, with the pair evidently supported by nominations committee member Fiona McGauchie, A/NZ country head of global leadership consultancy Egon Zehnder. Meanwhile, TA's head of strategy, Wakiuru Wohoro, who joined earlier this year, is a former L.E.K. consultant, working alongside tech strategy & architecture head Jennifer Cochrane, who crossed to Tennis Australia in 2023 after a decade and a half at Deloitte, including as Deloitte Digital's head of technology. Recent strategy lead recruit Christine Liu joined from Kearney. Tennis Australia digital & technology transformation director Simon Gutman was previously a director at Deloitte and ARQ (now NCS); Ben Stewart, head of technology operations, is the former CTO of Fusion5; and another strategy director, Ash Little, was a partner at Boston Consulting Group before joining TA at the start of last year. The latter's inclusion does however raise one point of interest in Tennis Australia's press release announcing Harrop's appointment as chair-elect; that Hrdlicka would continue to support him after his ascension “for as long as necessary given the mix of issues underway internationally.” Despite booming local ticket sales and a healthy global audience, the sport currently sits at the cross-roads. The intriguing part of this scenario and the ongoing negotiations over several counter-proposals is that all seven major international tennis bodies recently mutually engaged BCG to come up with some alternative suggestions for the sport's future. Hrdlicka being ex-Bain was one thing, and she's a certified loyalist, but Harrop's ongoing connection to the firm adds some spice to those dynamics Consultancy.org works with three partnership levels: Local, Regional and Global. is a Local partner of Consultancy.org in Middle East, Netherlands.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the American fired back in kind with a feisty response insisting those taking offence to his comments clearly didn't understand them in the first place. The coronavirus pandemic was still a prevalent issue in the summer of 2022 when US policy meant non-citizens couldn't compete without proof they had been vaccinated. That prohibited Djokovic from taking part in the competition, which most men's players would agree boosts their own chances of winning. He even partially campaigned for organisers to allow 'Nole' to play despite his non-vaccinated status, but the jokey tone of his comments were missed by many. "We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things," he said following a second-round win over Nick Kyrgios at the Cincinnati Open. "But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles]." It's perhaps unsurprising not everyone saw the funny side of those comments as they drew ire from legions of Djokovic's supporters. So much so that Fritz felt the need to highlight how his jibe was purely a joke, and one meant to compliment his rival at that. "Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone," he wrote on X. "The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else." That leaves the pair looking towards this year's US Open as their last chance to get a hand on Grand Slam silverware in 2025. Fritz made a shockingly quick recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery and then won at Wimbledon 20 days later. And he revealed last year that Djokovic had "reached out" to him for intel as he sought to make his own snappy recovery from a similar injury. "I told him what it was like for me," said Fritz as he lifted the lid on their 2024 exchange. "A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds – but it is possible."
