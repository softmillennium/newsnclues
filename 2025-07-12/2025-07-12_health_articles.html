                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus has upended decades of neuroscience dogma, revealing that dopamine, a neurotransmitter critical for movement, motivation, learning and mood, communicates in the brain with extraordinary precision, not broad diffusion as previously believed. This groundbreaking research offers fresh hope for millions of people living with dopamine-related disorders, marking a significant advance in the quest for precision-based neuroscience and medicine. But new research, published today in Science, found that dopamine acts more like a finely-tuned postal service, delivering highly localized messages to specific nerve cell branches at exact moments in time. Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought. We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine." Using advanced microscopy techniques, researchers found that dopamine is released in concentrated hotspots which enable targeted, rapid responses in nearby brain cells, while broader signals activate slower, widespread effects. This dual signaling system allows dopamine to simultaneously fine-tune individual neural connections and orchestrate complex behaviors like movement, decision-making, and learning. Dopamine system dysfunction plays a central role in a wide range of brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease, addiction, schizophrenia, ADHD and depression. Current treatments largely focus on restoring overall dopamine levels but this research suggests that the precision of dopamine signaling may be just as crucial. "We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," said Ford. "More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases. The goal, of course, would then be to build on those findings to come up with new and improved treatments for those disorders." Discrete spatiotemporal encoding of striatal dopamine transmission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The term 'oral health' refers to the health of the mouth, teeth, gums, and other related structures, and it is closely linked with our well-being and quality of life. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in understanding how oral health is linked to and influences our overall health. For example, it was found that gum disease may be associated with various diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease. Poor oral health can also affect a person's diet, which further increases a person's risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Now, in a new study published online in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation on April 17, 2025, a team of researchers led by Professor and Chairman Mitsuyoshi Yoshida and his colleagues from the Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Japan, have examined the association between oral health and different lifestyle-related diseases. "Our main aim was to investigate the link between oral health and blood test results for glucose metabolism, lipid levels, and kidney function," says Prof. Yoshida. In this study, the researchers examined 118 individuals aged 50 or above who had undergone regular health check-ups. More specifically, they collected information from dental examinations in 2021, as well as annual physical examinations in 2021 and 2023. These individuals were subjected to seven different oral function tests to gauge their oral health-these included measurements of tongue coating index (TCI) (an indicator of oral hygiene), oral dryness, the number of remaining functional teeth, maximum tongue pressure, masticatory function, swallowing problem, and oral diadochokinesis (OD), a test that measures the speed and accuracy with which a person can repeat certain syllables. In addition, the participants were divided into two groups based on whether their blood test results (including fasting blood glucose and cholesterol) were within the reference range or not. The resulting statistical analyses showed many interesting links between the oral function test results and blood test results. Similarly, the group with cholesterol values outside the standard range had higher levels of TCI and lower OD values. The group with non-standard values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (a test that measures kidney function) also showed significant differences in some of the oral function tests. "Overall, our results suggest that a decline in oral function can be a risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases. We believe this study is an achievement that will pave the way for Japan's vision of introducing and supporting universal dental health check-ups," concludes Prof. Yoshida.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how an anti-complement homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata ameliorates acute pneumonia with H1N1 and MRSA coinfection through rectifying Treg/Th17 imbalance in the gut–lung axis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The coinfection of respiratory viruses and bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the development of vaccines and powerful antibiotics. As a macromolecule that is difficult to absorb in the gastrointestinal tract, a homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata (HCPM) has been reported to exhibit anti-complement properties and alleviate influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced lung injury; however, the effects of HCPM without in vitro antiviral and antibacterial activities on more complicated pulmonary diseases resulting from viral-bacterial coinfection remains unclear. This study established a representative coinfection murine pneumonia model infected with H1N1 (0.2 LD50) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 107 CFU). The results indicate the beneficial effects of an anti-complement polysaccharide against viral–bacterial coinfection pneumonia by modulating crosstalk between multiple immune regulatory networks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how ALKBH3-regulated m1A of ALDOA potentiates glycolysis and doxorubicin resistance of triple negative breast cancer cells. Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic management for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but chemoresistance significantly impacts patient outcomes. This research indicates that Doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant TNBC cells exhibit increased glycolysis and ATP generation compared to their parental cells, with this metabolic shift contributing to chemoresistance. It was discovered that ALKBH3, an m1A demethylase enzyme, is crucial in regulating the enhanced glycolysis in Dox-resistant TNBC cells. Knocking down ALKBH3 reduced ATP generation, glucose consumption, and lactate production, implicating its involvement in mediating glycolysis. ALKBH3 regulates ALDOA mRNA stability through m1A demethylation at the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). Clinical analysis demonstrated that ALKBH3 and ALDOA are upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and higher expression of these proteins is associated with reduced overall survival in TNBC patients. This study highlights the role of the ALKBH3/ALDOA axis in contributing to Dox resistance in TNBC cells through regulation of ALDOA mRNA stability and glycolysis. In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Bioresponsive materials have gained prominence as innovative tools for advancing drug delivery systems, particularly in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These materials respond to biological stimuli such as pH, glucose, enzymes, or temperature, thereby enabling spatiotemporally controlled drug release. This article examines recent progress in the design strategies, activation mechanisms, and therapeutic applications of these materials in diabetes care. Key focus areas include macromolecular insulin delivery systems and oral hypoglycemic agents, with emphasis on their efficacy in regulating blood glucose homeostasis. Despite their promise, challenges persist in translating these technologies to clinical practice, including scalability limitations, insufficient clinical validation, regulatory hurdles, and healthcare system compatibility. Current therapeutic shortcomings, such as frequent injections and adverse effects compromising patient adherence, are discussed. By synthesizing contemporary research developments and implementation barriers, this work provides critical insights into optimizing bioresponsive platforms for clinical translation. The analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address technical and practical constraints, and ultimately engineer patient-centric, scalable solutions that enhance therapeutic outcomes and quality of life. Future directions include bridging material innovation with clinical needs to develop next-generation diabetes management systems. In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study, published in Addiction, shines a light on how industries associated with health harms-such as tobacco, fossil fuels, and in this case, alcohol-can distort the evaluation of scientific research through industry-friendly commentary. A team of researchers led by UVic's Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR), analyzed 268 critiques of alcohol and health studies published online since 2010 by the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research, or ISFAR. However, members have continuing alcohol-industry connections, says Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study. Although ISFAR has long-standing ties to the alcohol industry, it is still frequently quoted in the media as an authoritative voice on matters relating to alcohol and health. We had observed their critiques seemed to favour studies finding health benefits from alcohol, and to be critical of those that said otherwise. We set out to test this impartially and comprehensively." Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study The researchers' hypotheses were confirmed, whether using data generated by human coders or by computer-based text analysis of the ISFAR critiques. The team found studies supporting an industry-friendly narrative were ten times more likely to receive a positive review from ISFAR than those suggesting otherwise. Notably, ISFAR's favorability ratings were completely unrelated to the studies' level of scientific merit as assessed by an independent expert who was not otherwise involved in the project. "This analysis confirms the impression that ISFAR is an industry-friendly echo chamber whose critiques are determined more by whether they like the conclusions contained in research papers than by scientific merit," says Stockwell. "We've seen this playbook before with the tobacco industry trying to discredit science around smoking's harms." It's a reminder that we need to be mindful of where our information is coming from and who is paying for its creation, says Stockwell. In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent years, some scientists and advocates have warned that playing contact sports like football and hockey may increase the risk of brain diseases like Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to a buildup of a specific protein in the brain. But a new Northwestern Medicine study of 174 donated brains, including some from former high school and college football players, pumps the brakes on that theory. The long and short of it is no, this protein in this specific brain region is not increased in people who played football at the amateur level. It throws a little bit of cold water on the current CTE narrative." Dr. Rudolph Castellani, corresponding author, professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine neuropathologist It raises important questions about how scientists interpret subtle brain changes associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and repetitive head impacts. The study analyzed brain tissue from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, which collects brain donations from people who had psychiatric conditions (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression, general anxiety, substance use disorder, etc.) Of the 174 samples collected from older adult men (with a median age of 65 at death), 48 men participated in football in high school or college while 126 had no history of playing a contact or collision sport. The study did not include brains from professional athletes. This region has been shown to accumulate phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein - which is often present in neurodegenerative disease - in a variety of contexts, including normal aging, Alzheimer's disease and in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts. But the findings suggest p-tau buildup in CA2 isn't specific to contact sports. Instead, the presence of p-tau in this region was statistically associated with age. "What's novel here is a return to the null hypothesis - that there may be no link between repeated head injuries and p-tau buildup in this location," said Castellani, who also is the neuropathology core director of the Northwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "Rather than assuming p-tau in CA2 is inherently pathological, we're asking whether it might be part of normal aging or a non-specific response to environmental factors." In particular, the authors point to the difficulty of assigning clinical meaning to subtle pathological findings. The paper's section, "Knowledge gaps and implications for future research," underscores how even expert consensus groups struggle to define CTE in clinically meaningful terms. "Modern studies on CTE may be expanding the boundaries of what's considered normal variability in the human brain," Castellani said. "This work reminds us to be cautious in interpreting pathology without clear clinical correlation." The authors call for larger studies to better understand how p-tau relates to aging and head injuries, while urging the scientific community to critically evaluate assumptions about what constitutes neurodegenerative disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One in three adults in the U.S. has three or more risk factors for a newly recognized but increasingly common condition: cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. First recognized by the American Heart Association (AHA) in a 2023 presidential advisory, CKM connects heart and metabolic health with kidney function as intertwined drivers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Long before CKM was defined, millions of Americans were unknowingly progressing through the condition's dangerous stages. In a first-of-its-kind analysis, Tarang Parekh, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware College of Health Sciences, and colleagues at Houston Methodist Hospital and Harvard Medical School, examined the state-level prevalence of CKM syndrome, using self-reported data from the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System from 2011 to 2023. Parekh's analysis, recently published in the journal JAAC: Advances, found that 80% of the population has some form of CKM syndrome. West Virginia had the highest prevalence, with nearly 87% of residents affected by 2023. Delaware wasn't far behind, with rates climbing from 76% to 83% over the same period. "This is an alarming trend that's a result of our fragmented healthcare system," Parekh said. CKM, like many chronic diseases, progresses in stages. At Stage 1, individuals are obese or prediabetic. Stages 2 and 3 involve kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes or a combination of risk factors that dramatically raise their risk for CVD. That's where we see a clinical CVD diagnosis, including heart failure, stroke or coronary heart disease, or kidney failure." While Stage 4 rates declined steadily nationwide, Minnesota was an exception, seeing significant increases in the most dangerous stage of the condition. Routine health screenings are key to slowing the progression of CKM and reducing CVD. "We must educate the public about the intersection of these conditions, so they realize CKM syndrome is more than just taking care of obesity, diabetes, or CVD in isolation," said Parekh. "Without lifestyle and behavioral changes, one risk factor can snowball into several." Significant variation in state-level programs also complicates the matter. We must expand those programs to include other risk factors for CVD to reduce CKM syndrome progression," Parekh added. Parekh also emphasized that individuals must take charge of their health. "People need to know their weight, blood pressure, and BMI," said Parekh. "Routine point-of-care testing during wellness visits is essential. To combat rising CKM rates, the AHA has launched a pilot preventive health initiative focused on improving care for people in select cities and regions, including Atlanta, San Diego, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Washington, D.C, Maryland, and Ohio, including the Cincinnati metro area and parts of Kentucky. These locations were selected due to disease prevalence, health system infrastructure and community characteristics. The AHA plans to expand the CKM Health Initiative to 15 geographic regions nationwide, ultimately reaching 250,000 Americans at 150 existing healthcare sites. Looking ahead, Parekh plans to analyze clinical data using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct a more detailed understanding of CKM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have discovered how a key protein helps maintain strong connections between brain cells that are crucial for learning and memory. Our research indicates that developing treatments or therapies that specifically focus on the protein cypin may help improve the connections between brain cells, enhancing memory and thinking abilities. These findings suggest that cypin could be used to develop treatments for neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases, as well as brain injuries." Firestein has been studying cypin for more than two decades. Her latest work uncovered several important aspects of how cypin functions and why it is significant for brain health. One of the crucial discoveries is that cypin helps add a special tag to proteins in synapses connecting neurons. This tag ensures proteins are correctly positioned and able to send signals effectively. Proper tagging and movement of proteins are essential for the neurons to function correctly. Another important finding is that cypin interacts with a complex of proteins, known as the proteasome, which is responsible for breaking down proteins. When cypin attaches or binds to the proteasome, it slows down this breakdown process, leading to an accumulation of proteins. This buildup can positively affect various cellular functions, which are important for the communication between neurons. Firestein's research also shows that when there is more cypin present, the levels of important proteins in the synapses increase. These proteins are vital for effective communication between neurons, empowering learning and memory. The work highlights the importance of cypin in maintaining healthy brain function and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions. "Even though this study is what we call 'basic research,' it eventually can be applied in practical, clinical settings," said Firestein, who already is conducting such "translational" work in parallel. Translational research is a type of research that takes discoveries made in the lab and turns them into practical treatments or solutions to improve human health. For example, healthy synaptic function is often disrupted in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In addition, the protein's role in promoting synaptic plasticity – the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time – means it may be used to help counteract the synaptic dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries. The study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NINDS), the Coalition for Brain Injury Research, a charitable foundation dedicated to the memory of Dennis John Benigno, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in junior high school; and private donors Jamuna Rajasingham and Dyan Rajasingham. Other scientists from Rutgers involved in the study include Kiran Madura, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; Srinivasa Gandu, Mihir Patel, Ana Rodriguez, former doctoral students in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience. Jared Lamp and Irving Vega of Michigan State University also contributed to this research. Cypin regulates K63-linked polyubiquitination to shape synaptic content. In the interview, Lloyd M.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A third of women who died during or in the year after pregnancy were known to Children's Social Care – higher than previously reported, new research reveals. The authors say urgent changes are needed to prioritize and improve mothers' care. It is the first to detail the situations of the 1695 women who died within a year of pregnancy; of whom 420 were in contact with children's social care. The study finds three quarters of the mothers known to social services died between six weeks and the year after pregnancy and most deaths were due to suicide (20%), other psychiatric causes including drug related deaths (30%), and homicide (5%). Women with social care involvement more frequently died from homicide and mental health related causes than women without involvement. Two thirds (65%) of women with Children's Social Care involvement reported domestic abuse before or during pregnancy, compared to 3% of women without social care involvement. One in three disclosed abuse during childhood compared to 2% of women without social care involvement. The researchers also conducted a confidential care review, which looked at anonymised care records for 47 of these women. This resulted in overwhelming appointment schedules, and compounded the adversity the women were facing rather than helping them. In several case reviews, women had more than thirty different appointments during pregnancy. In many instances, risk management solely focused on safeguarding the infant, disregarding the mother's own safeguarding needs. What the analysis tells us is that these women come from backgrounds of trauma and abuse, and yet despite their efforts to keep up with demanding appointment schedules, they often face scrutiny and judgment rather than receiving support for the issues they are facing. When women have access to designated multi-disciplinary teams, with specialist knowledge and capacity to provide integrated and holistic care, these barriers can be overcome. Kaat De Backer, first author from King's College London They say urgent changes to practice, clinical guidance and policy are required to prioritise mothers with social care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood. Naomi Delap, Director at the charity Birth Companions, said: "This study highlights the acute need for better care for women with Children's Social Care involvement, and the significant barriers that get in the way of providing that care. "To help improve things, we need coordinated national policy and clear expectations across the health and social care systems. In response to this study, Birth Companions is launching work to co-design a national care pathway, in order to deliver consistent, compassionate support for all women who have Children's Social Care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood. This work holds the potential to transform care, break cycles of harm, and help ensure fewer mothers lose their lives in such tragic circumstances." Senior author Dr Nicola Vousden, from Oxford Population Health's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, said "This study adds to findings from MBRRACE-UK that women with multiple disadvantages prior to, and during pregnancy, are at increased risk of worse outcomes. We've identified practical changes that are required within maternity care. We also need joined up pathways of care across maternity, social care and community health partners to support the needs of women with children's social involvement, including domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Recently, the team led by Chief Physician Quan Zhang and Associate Professor Feng Liu at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital systematically evaluated the genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain structures using large-scale genome-wide association summary statistics and advanced statistical genetic methods. The related findings were published in Research under the title "Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis reveals shared genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain volumes". Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder worldwide. Beyond glucose dysregulation, it exerts significant effects on the central nervous system. Epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence indicates that individuals with T2DM are at substantially increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which is closely linked to degenerative changes in brain structure—particularly within subcortical regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and thalamus. Current neuroimaging studies have systematically characterized the structural brain abnormalities associated with T2DM. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving these changes remain unclear. T2DM is a prototypical polygenic disorder, with large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) having identified hundreds of associated genetic loci. Likewise, the volume and morphology of subcortical brain structures are known to be strongly influenced by genetic factors. Emerging evidence suggests potential genetic overlap between T2DM and brain structure. For instance, the T2DM risk gene TCF7L2 has been linked to amygdala volume, and the Hp 1-1 gene has been associated with hippocampal volume. Moreover, polygenic risk scores for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) have shown associations with gray matter volume, and the genetic risk of several hippocampal morphological traits has been related to T2DM. While these findings provide preliminary insights, a comprehensive investigation into the shared genetic architecture between T2DM and brain structural abnormalities is still lacking. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways and biological mechanisms. MiXeR analysis revealed that T2DM has high polygenicity and low discoverability, and shares varying degrees of genome-wide genetic overlap with subcortical brain regions, with Dice coefficients ranging from 22.4% to 49.6% . Furthermore, conjunctional false discovery rate analysis revealed 129 shared loci jointly associated with T2DM and subcortical volumes. Among them, rs429358 on chromosome 19 (located in the APOE gene) showed the strongest association with both bilateral accumbens volume and T2DM, and exhibited a high functional pathogenicity score. Developmental trajectory analysis revealed that genes shared between T2DM and multiple subcortical brain regions were highly expressed during the fetal period and gradually declined after birth, suggesting their potential role in early brain development. Further transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) validated the dual association of several key genes (e.g., TUFM, JAZF1) with both T2DM and the volumes of specific brain regions. This study systematically revealed the genetic overlap between T2DM and subcortical brain structures, clarifying their shared genetic loci, shared genes and the potential biological pathways involved. This interdisciplinary work not only deepens our understanding of how T2DM affects brain health, but also promotes a shift in metabolic disease research from a traditional focus on peripheral metabolism to the central nervous system. The findings provide critical genetic evidence for risk prediction, biomarker identification, and early intervention strategies targeting T2DM-related brain structural alterations, offering new directions for clinical translation and precision prevention in the brain-metabolism interface.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions arise when the body's immune system fails to distinguish between "self" and "foreign" cells, and mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, resulting in persistent inflammation and tissue damage. Central to these autoimmune responses are CD4+ T cells, a class of immune cells that can either promote or suppress the condition. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a special subtype of CD4+ T cells that act as the immune system's peacekeepers. Treg cells, marked by protein Foxp3, help in suppressing harmful immune responses. Therefore, boosting the development and activity of Treg cells is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach, but the mechanisms underlying its effective regulation remain unclear. The study was conducted in a well-established animal model of MS, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to confirm the mechanisms. Elaborating more, Dr. Wu, the lead author of this study, says "We started by screening the genes that appeared different between mice with mild and severe EAE." Further, he adds, "Among the top identified genes in CD4+ T cells, Egr-1 stood out as significantly downregulated in severe disease." After identifying Egr-1 as a regulatory gene, the team assessed its role by using genetically engineered mice lacking Egr-1 in CD4+ T cells. These mice were induced with EAE and tracked for disease progression. The researchers also conducted additional in vitro experiments. By analyzing isolated human CD4+ T cells from MS patients and healthy donors, they confirmed that both Egr-1 and Foxp3 levels were reduced in patient samples. Further, to determine whether Egr-1 directly regulates Foxp3, the researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation, which revealed that Egr-1 binds to the Foxp3 promoter. Additionally, using luciferase reporter assays, they also confirmed that Egr-1 binding increases Foxp3 gene activity. They then traced the pathway to TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor Beta) signaling via the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates Egr-1. What's more, the researchers also investigated the effect of a natural compound, Calycosin, which acts as an Egr-1 agonist. Overall, the study underscores the essential role of Egr-1 in Treg cell development and function, identifying it as a central molecular switch in immune regulation. By elucidating its mechanism and validating the effect of a natural Egr-1 agonist, the study suggests that targeting Egr-1 may offer a promising treatment strategy, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. This study investigated the relationships among intestinal microbial dynamics, metabolite profiles, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in patients with breast cancer. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the species diversity and abundance of the intestinal microbiome significantly decreased, and these trends were not correlated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy. Fusobacterium abundance remained significantly higher in poor responders than good responders post-NAC, thus suggesting its association with chemoresistance. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in patients with breast cancer than healthy controls, and was correlated with the therapeutic response: this ratio rose post-NAC but remained suboptimal in poor responders. Untargeted metabolomics identified upregulated amino acids (Thr-Thr and histidine) in poor responders and elevated lipids (C17-sphinganine) in good responders. ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis validated these metabolites (AUC >0.7) as predictive biomarkers. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in mTOR signaling, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signaling pathways. These findings underscore the intestinal microbiome's potential as a predictor of NAC efficacy and a therapeutic target. Modulating Fusobacterium or metabolite pathways may enhance chemotherapy response. Effects of the Intestinal Microbiome and Metabolites on Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Efficacy in Breast Cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Using artificial intelligence, researchers show how γ-secretase recognizes substrates - an important advance for fundamental and translational research. The γ-secretase enzyme is capable of cleaving more than 150 different membrane proteins. This includes the amyloid precursor protein, from which the deposits typical for Alzheimer's disease are formed, and the Notch1 protein, which plays an important role in cell communication and carcinogenesis. For a long time, however, it was unclear how γ-secretase recognizes its target proteins. Although many proteases identify substrates by means of characteristic amino acid sequences, γ-secretase does not. An interdisciplinary team from LMU's Biomedical Center, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) has now managed to clarify details of the mechanism. The researchers have shown that substrates of the enzyme possess a complex physicochemical profile which is decisive for their recognition and cleavage. The team developed a novel technique called Comparative Physicochemical Profiling (CPP), which allows them to compare the physicochemical properties of known substrates against reference proteins and identify characteristic patterns. In combination with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the team was also able to render visible the features that are characteristic for substrates of γ-secretase. "The substrates of γ-secretase possess a specific physicochemical profile, which spans the entire transmembrane domain and adjacent sequence regions," explains Prof. Harald Steiner (LMU and DZNE), who led the study together with Dmitrij Frishman (TUM). Particularly close to the cleavage site of the substrates, the researchers discovered, substrates have the potential to develop an extended conformation as an alternative to their helical structure - a property that is supported by experimental data from γ-secretase enzyme-substrate complexes. "We wanted to understand what actually defines a substrate, and not just generate a black-box prediction," adds lead author Dr. Stephan Breimann, who played a major part in developing the CPP method. "The use of explainable AI has given us precisely this transparency." Using the CPP method, the researchers also managed to identify several previously unknown substrates of the enzyme, including proteins that play an important role in immune regulation and carcinogenesis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women diagnosed with premenstrual symptoms have a slightly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life. This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Cardiovascular Research. The symptoms, which appear a few days before menstruation and then subside, can be both psychological and physical. The study included more than 99,000 women with premenstrual symptoms who were followed for up to 22 years. The researchers compared their health with women without these symptoms – both in the general population and by comparing them with their own sisters to take into account hereditary factors and upbringing. The results show that women with premenstrual symptoms had about a ten per cent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. When the researchers also looked at different types of cardiovascular disease, they found that the link was particularly strong for heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias), where the risk was 31 per cent higher, and for stroke caused by a blood clot, where the risk was 27 per cent higher. Even after the researchers took into account other factors such as smoking, BMI and mental health, the link between premenstrual symptoms and increased disease risk remained. The increased risk was particularly clear in women who were diagnosed before the age of 25 and in those who had also experienced postnatal depression, a condition that can also be caused by hormonal fluctuations." Yihui Yang, PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet and first author of the study One is that women with premenstrual symptoms may have a disrupted regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which controls blood pressure and fluid balance in the body, among other things. The second is that these women have increased levels of inflammation in the body, which is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and other heart problems. Finally, it may be because women with premenstrual symptoms may have metabolic abnormalities, which are linked to an increased risk of both stroke and heart attack. "We hope that our findings will contribute to greater awareness that premenstrual disorders not only affect daily life but can also have consequences for long-term health," says Donghao Lu, associate professor at the same department and last author of the study.
