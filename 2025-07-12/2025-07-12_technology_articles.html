Someone would if given the time and infrastructure. This, on the other hand, is more DOGE-style idiocy. Even as an anime grump, I liked this one. It should be incredibly clear that the motivation for these folks isn't reducing government spending (or cutting waste).The problem is the programme is at NOAA, and NOAA tells a story about the climate that some folks don't like. So they trash the messenger and his tools. So they trash the messenger and his tools. The political intent behind a new dark age makes sense if you think of the goal as being to destroy competent institutions which represent a real threat to an anti-science, post-truth administration I literally do not care if someone feels more liberal or conservative in their heart of hearts. There is more that unites people than the pissantry propaganda that plays to divide us.Rather, like you, I hate waste, which this budget, through underfunding, will create. Probably also like you, I also strongly dislike know-nothing propaganda, especially regarding things about which I am well informed.Post-truth millieu is a lie. Truth is more adaptive to long term survival.> For example they often have attended college and believe in science.One doesn't believe in science.

How do those arguments grow to the scale of a whole society? Science at the scale of society doesn't happen in the language of scientific papers, but rather in rhetoric: in appeals to what the Greeks categorized as Ethos (Emotion), Pathos (Authority), and Logos (Logic).At its most brilliant this is "Schroedinger's cat," which in two words encodes in our collective consciousness an appeal to logic which entreats us through contradiction to consider a philosophically meaningful set of ideas about the nature of reality.

Yes, this is precisely that which they do not believe in. Plug your ears, bury your head in the sand, and whatever you do, do not use cause and effect, data, or evidence to backup your claims and positions. That is the platform upon which they stand. In recent years, the operating environment in orbital space has changed rapidly, and it isn't just the number of objects. These changes are outside the design assumptions of traditional orbital traffic systems, degrading their effectiveness. In response to this reality, governments with significant space assets have been investing in orbital traffic systems that are capable of dealing with the modern environment. However, these rely heavily on classified technology and capability to address the limitations of the older systems.An argument could be made that it no longer makes sense to fund a public system that is descending into obsolescence due to lack of capability and which can't be meaningfully fixed because that would require exposing classified technical capabilities that no one is willing to expose. In this scenario, the private sector is acting as an offramp from a system that had no future technically.Space has turned into an interesting place, in the curse sense.

There's no evidence that this is anything more than yet another round of ideologically-fueled maladministration. This might also be a program in which the goals of a privatized for-profit company are rather bad in the broader context. If you pay me millions to track and possibly control your satellite in orbit so it doesn't collide... I'll invest in rocket companies to launch more satellites. Even if they are very silly satellites.After all, if they collide, the debris will most likely miss the shareholders, and then you get more satellites to get contracts for.And who cares if some of those invaluable scientific systems with year-long plans get knocked out?

And who cares if some of those invaluable scientific systems with year-long plans get knocked out? There is a lot of trouble with bureaucrats defending fiefdoms that would be better consolidated, but you can't fix that with an axe. The vast majority of the government budget is "entitlements and military" because donors have their pork classified as those things when they don't want it to be cut. A lot of entitlement programs are structured as handouts to the companies providing those services (e.g. drug and healthcare companies, or landlords) or vote buying of affluent retirees who don't actually need a government subsidy. And I'd like to see someone try to claim with a straight face that there is no waste in the military budget.But even within those budgets, most of the waste and corruption isn't a single program going to a single place. And then it doesn't matter if you classify the program as military or entitlements or something else; what matters is if the program is worth the candle.The problem is that everybody will say that their program is worth it, many them are lying, and it's hard to tell who isn't.But the thing that's unambiguously true is that the amount of government revenue has been stable as a percentage of GDP for generations and has been growing in terms of real dollars per capita, and yet the amount of government spending has outpaced that by a huge and growing amount.Is DOGE making a hash of things? Maybe, but then let's do a better job instead of using it as an excuse to keep running reckless deficits until the largest item in the federal budget is interest.

Yes, military investments have paid off in new technologies (e.g., Arpanet) but as a whole only reward the owners of the Military Industrial Complex.

Satellite operators obtain much their space situational awareness data directly or indirectly from US govt sources. The fact that collisions are presently infrequent because satellite operators act on that data isn't a particularly good reason to eliminate much of it We've been lucky that this is the only publicly known satellite to collide with another satellite, other than satellites that got shot down as a demonstration of power. Which means Starling would probably pay for most of it.Then there are various spy satellites countries have that they dont want tracked?

I'd stand up a joint agency for this requirement across DOD, NASA, NOAA, FAA, and Commercial Space/Newspace.

I'm surprised the future of technology is in the hands of a few people who have absolutely no clue what's happening outside their computers.Building a large data center near a town can strain the power grid, drain local water supplies, generate constant noise, release excess heat, harm the environment, disrupt traffic during construction, raise security concerns, and offer very little long-term benefit to the local community.So, yeah, the solution is to cover the earth with data centers, right?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The practice stems from the early 1900s, when World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine. Once associated with high-profile figures like John Belushi, River Phoenix and Chris Farley, this dangerous polysubstance use has become a leading cause of overdose deaths across the United States since the early- to mid-2010s. As these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment. Combining stimulants and opioids—the former's “rush” with the latter's calming effect—creates a dangerous physiological conflict. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately 70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022 also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality. However, with the proliferation of fentanyl—which is far more potent than heroin—this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl is often mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine, sometimes without the user's knowledge, leading to unintentional overdoses. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased 50-fold, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually. The toxic and contaminated drug supply has exacerbated this crisis. Stimulants like cocaine increase heart rate and blood pressure, while opioids suppress respiratory function. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. People who use both substances are more than twice as likely to experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone. The conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making. Speedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, including hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. Increasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. There is a great need for better access to treatment for people with stimulant use ddisorder—a condition defined as the continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this and other substance use disorders are underfunded and less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing. Implementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations, and health care providers, such as providing fentanyl test strips and naloxone—a medication that reverses opioid overdoses—can save lives. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the most common cause of pollen allergy in Central Asia and Europe. “Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn't disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they're so insufferable), meaning Tabynov's team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals' natural antibodies. “What's exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. So, is this something we'll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Tabynov's most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment's protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this month, the DOE announced a conditional agreement made with private firms Westinghouse and Radiant to conduct the first reactor tests at its Demonstration on Microreactor Experiment (DOME) facility, located at Idaho National Laboratory. The DOE defines microreactors as small reactors that generate between 1 and 50 megawatts of power. That being said, these microreactors aren't meant to power crowded cities. Rather, the compact efficiency of microreactors could greatly benefit small, remote sites that run on less efficient sources. The average U.S. household consumes about 30 kilowatt-hours, or 0.03 megawatts worth of electricity daily—meaning, in theory, Kaleidos on its own could supply many homes in a distant rural area. Not only that, these microreactors are relatively easy to assemble and transportable by train, truck, or plane. That makes them potentially useful in unexpected situations such as blackouts caused by natural disasters or cyberattacks. For eVinci and Kaleidos in particular, the DOE's intention is to employ the microreactors as a possible power source for remote data centers and an alternative to diesel generators, respectively. “These DOME experiments will test new reactor designs that will be counted on in the future to reliably power our homes, military bases, and mission-critical infrastructure.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

As AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX approaches its launch, unofficial benchmark results have been posted to the Geekbench database, revealing some details about its performance. While the CPU clearly shines in AMD-conducted benchmarks showing its potential for professional workstation workloads, when it comes to the drag race-style Geekbench benchmark, it is not all that clear-cut. For now, there are multiple test results of AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in the Geekbench database. Since the new CPU is based on the improved Zen 5 microarchitecture and runs at a higher frequency, it is pretty much expected that it would be 14% faster in this benchmark. However, as expected given its workstation focus, the single-thread performance of AMD's Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in Geekbench isn't competitive with consumer PC-oriented processors. The latter are designed for burst performance for a short while to guarantee system responsiveness and fluent user experience. By contrast, the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX barely hits its 5.40 GHz turbo frequency in GB6's single-thread scenarios. When it comes to GB6's multi-thread performance, there is another peculiarity with AMD's workstation-oriented Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. Meanwhile, one should remember that Geekbench 6 multi-tread test is a short-duration benchmark designed to simulate everyday tasks like file compression, PDF rendering, and image filtering. Because of its quick runtime and bursty workloads, it can't fully exploit the capabilities of ultra-high-core-count CPUs like the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. Many of GB6's MT tests scale only up to 8–32 threads efficiently, leaving a large portion of the 9995WX's cores underutilized, but leaving headroom for Apple's, AMD's, and Intel's client CPUs to thrive in consumer workloads because of their high clocks.

But there weren't any surprises at the end, despite rumors that Samsung would unveil a trifold phone. “I expect we will be able to launch the trifold phone within this year,” TM Roh, head of Samsung's mobile business, told The Korea Times. The trifold phone, rumored to be called the Galaxy G Fold, would have a normal screen on the front and two hinges that let you open it up as a tablet-sized screen. Huawei first unveiled its trifold, the Mate XT, in China last year, with an eye-watering price of 3,499 euros ($4,090~), and Samsung showed off a concept version at Mobile World Congress 2025. Considering it has upped the price of its Galaxy Z Fold7 flagship to $2,000, expect a high cost. Samsung is also expected to launch its Android XR mixed reality headset in the fall, so the trifold could land alongside it. AI startup Hugging Face has announced a new coding robot called Reachy Mini, mere months after acquiring Pollen Robotics, the company behind the Reachy 2 humanoid robot. Think of it like a STEM toy or a Raspberry Pi (in fact, the Robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 minicomputer)—you have to build it yourself, and there are more than 15 “robot behaviors” so you can learn how to use it out of the box. It has a camera, microphone, and speakers for interacting with its surroundings. Reachy Mini owners will be able to upload and share these robot behaviors with the Hugging Face community, and download other ones too. It'll ship this fall, though the Reachy Mini Lite, which isn't wireless, will arrive first, late summer. The public beta for Apple's iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 is expected to launch next week, but some drama has been brewing after the recent developer beta 3 for iOS 26. That's drawn criticism online that Apple has changed it too much, though there was plenty of backlash and readability concerns when Apple debuted the design at WWDC 2025. In more Apple news, the company is expected to debut a new Apple Vision Pro later this year, powered by the M4 chipset that's in some MacBooks and iPads. The hardware itself won't look any different, though Bloomberg reports there will be a more comfortable strap. It's a new day for smart home strategy at popular Swedish furniture purveyor Ikea, as the company announced more than 20 new Matter smart lights, sensors, and remotes using the Thread protocol. That means you can snag some of Ikea's affordable wares and use them directly with your Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings setup, without having to purchase an Ikea hub. And Ikea's David Granath told The Verge there are “more new product types and form factors to come.” Folks with Ikea's Dirigera hub will also be pleased to learn that Ikea is activating the built-in Thread radio and adding Matter support. That means it can serve as a Matter Controller and a Thread Border Router, enabling it to hook up and control any Matter devices in your home. Sadly for some, this signals the end for Zigbee support, as Ikea plans to replace its Zigbee gadgets with Matter devices. Ikea also unveiled two new Bluetooth speakers this week—one that looks like a retro radio and another that doubles as a lamp. Both have a dedicated Spotify Tap button that allows you to jump straight back into whatever you were last listening to on Spotify. It was five plus for OnePlus this week, as the company unveiled a slew of new devices. A smaller, 43 mm, version of the Watch 3 that's far more comfortable, but has less stamina than its larger sibling, is now available from OnePlus for $300 (a full $100 less than the 47 mm model). If your budget is more limited, the Nord CE 5 sports a similar look, but has a slightly smaller 6.77-inch display, slower MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Apex processor, and is lower specced across the rest of the board, but starts at £249. Both models will get four years of Android updates. It starts from £199, but you can jump to 8 GB of RAM and get LTE connectivity for just £30 more. It seems like only yesterday we crowned the Honor Magic V3 as the world's thinnest folding phone (it was last September). That's just slimmer than Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold7, by 0.1 mm. The Honor Magic V5 is some feat of engineering, weighing 217 grams (lighter than Apple's 16 Pro Max, but 2 grams heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold7). It's no slouch inside with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, backed by 16 GB of RAM. The screens are LTPO OLED panels with up to a 120-Hz refresh rate. Throw in Honor's generous suite of AI features, and you have a luxurious top-tier device on your hands. The Honor Magic V5 launched in China last week, but unlike the Oppo Find N5, Honor plans to bring the Magic V5 to international markets soon, so folks craving a slim foldable better get saving.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ticks and the many illnesses they carry, like Lyme disease, are a growing public health threat. And though the worst tick species are especially common in the Northeast, disease-carrying populations are steadily spreading further across the U.S. What's more, scientists are still continuing to discover new viruses and bacteria spread by ticks that can potentially sicken people. We spoke to Bente about why ticks are becoming a bigger problem, the best ways right now to protect ourselves against them, and the potential innovations that could eventually help us beat back the tick menace. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. Ed Cara, Gizmodo: I live in the northeastern U.S., and my friends and family, especially dog owners, often complain about needing to look out for ticks sooner than they used to. Is the tick season really getting longer and larger? And what seem to be the major reasons why? Bente: Yes, your friends and family are absolutely correct in their observations. The evidence shows that ticks are now active in winter due to climate change, with adult deer ticks active at temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit [-10 degrees Celsius]. This has led to a year-round need for vigilance, as ticks now emerge whenever the ground is unfrozen and temperatures exceed freezing, extending their season beyond traditional months. Climate warming accelerates tick development, increases survival, and enables northward expansion at about 28 miles [45 kilometers] per year, especially in the Northeast. Factors like recovering deer populations, reforestation, landscape fragmentation, and fire suppression have also promoted tick populations by providing ideal habitats and microclimate regimes that favor tick survival. Gizmodo: When it comes to tick germs, people are probably most familiar with Lyme disease. What are some of the lesser-known tickborne diseases that keep you up at night? And are these diseases, like Lyme, becoming more common? Powassan virus (POWV) stands out as perhaps the most frightening tickborne pathogen in North America. This flavivirus can cause severe encephalitis with mortality rates approaching 18.8% and devastating neurological consequences in 72.7% of survivors. Unlike other tickborne diseases, POWV can be transmitted within just 15 minutes of tick attachment, giving victims almost no opportunity for preventive tick removal. Bourbon virus (BRBV) was first identified in 2014 and remains poorly understood. Only 5 human cases have been reported in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, but blood tests suggest that it is much more widespread. Borrelia miyamotoi causes hard tick relapsing fever, a disease that often goes undetected despite being transmitted by the same ticks that carry Lyme disease. Between 2013 and 2019, 300 cases were identified through surveillance in just nine states that conduct active monitoring. This likely represents massive underreporting, as the disease is often misdiagnosed. While Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) remains the most severe, newly recognized rickettsial pathogens are emerging that can cause similar severe illness. Gizmodo: Are there any treatments, vaccines, or other innovations in development that could possibly help us beat these germs? Bente: Yes, there are indeed promising treatments, vaccines, and innovative technologies in development that could help us finally gain the upper hand against tickborne diseases. Developed jointly by Pfizer and Valneva, this represents a major advancement over previous failed attempts. Results are expected by the end of 2025, with potential regulatory approval in 2026. Experimental Anti-Tick Vaccine Aims to Stop Bites That Could Spread Lyme Perhaps even more exciting than pathogen-specific vaccines are anti-tick vaccines that could prevent multiple tickborne diseases simultaneously by targeting the tick itself. Researchers have developed mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines containing cocktails of tick salivary proteins. This vaccine causes rapid erythema development in the skin, early tick detachment, and decreased tick feeding by creating an immune response that alerts hosts to tick presence and prevents pathogen transmission when ticks are removed promptly. TP-05 is an investigational oral, systemic formulation of lotilaner developed by Tarsus Pharmaceuticals; it represents a revolutionary approach to tickborne disease prevention. This isoxazoline compound has successfully completed Phase 2a human trials, demonstrating 97% tick mortality within 24 hours of attachment, with a single dose providing protection for at least 30 days. Since ticks typically require 36 to 48 hours of attachment to transmit Lyme disease, killing them within 24 hours provides highly effective prophylaxis with an excellent safety profile in healthy volunteers. Gizmodo: In the meantime, how do we best keep these tiny pests from ruining our time outdoors? Bente: For reliable tick protection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends EPA-registered repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE). The effectiveness is remarkable: permethrin-treated clothing has shown nearly 100% protection against tick attachment. Stay on trail centers and avoid wooded, brushy areas during peak tick season (April to September). Daily tick checks are the most critical prevention measure. Most tickborne diseases require 24 to 48 hours of attachment for transmission, so quick removal dramatically reduces infection risk. Clean the bite area and hands with alcohol or soap. Be sure to photograph the tick for identification if symptoms develop and avoid folk remedies like matches or nail polish—these increase disease transmission risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For example, if you were buying a TV, you may want to know the resolution, and if you showed up to Best Buy and the tag on your brand-spanking-new Sony said “kind of, sort of, 4K,” you'd probably have some questions. Same goes for AR glasses, in my opinion, but that didn't stop Viture from slapping “4K-like” branding on all of its new frames. It also doesn't stop me from wanting them all the same. Viture announced a few pairs of upcoming AR glasses this week, but the most exciting one is “Beast.” Yes, that's really the name. Beast is aptly named for being the most spec'd-out glasses of Viture's current generation and comes with an impressive 58-degree field of view and Sony's micro-OLED panel, which offers—and here's the kicker—a “4K-like” resolution, according to Viture. But this 1080p is sharper, according to Viture, (50 percent sharper than the Viture Pro) and makes its AR glasses the “sharpest on the market.” I haven't had a chance to use Viture's Beast myself because they don't launch until October, but Viture's previous AR glasses already had the edge in clarity, so I'm curious to see how its new iteration moves the ball forward. In an official explanation, Viture says, “The term ‘4K-like' was inspired by users. When people first saw the display, they often asked, ‘Is this 4K?' To be honest, I'm willing to forgive some iffy marketing if these things are actually as crisp as Viture says they are, especially because of all the other stuff Beast has going for it. On top of its nice micro-OLED display and supposed class-leading sharpness, Viture's glasses also have a Harman-tuned audio, electrochromic dimming so you can go from shades to clear depending on if you're inside or outside, 1,280 nits of brightness, and even a depth sensor for “spatial computing” like the Vision Pro. Viture says Beast weighs about 88 grams, which is double other “smart glasses” like Meta's Ray-Bans but with quadruple the capabilities and an actual display in them. All of that good stuff will cost you, though. When orders are available in October, Viture says its Beast glasses will cost $549, and those aren't even the most expensive pair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Taiwanese memory specialist Team Group has introduced a new M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD, designed for mission-critical environments. Many industrial storage device makers crow about the ruggedness and durability of their devices, and Team Group is no exception with the P250Q-M80. The device has many great durability stats that you might look for. It boasts MIL-STD 810G vibration endurance, MIL-STD-202G shock resistance, storage integrity temperatures spanning -55°C (-67°F) to +95°C (203°F), an MTBF of over three million hours, a three-year warranty, S.M.A.R.T. S/W Quick Erase is a software method that “erases all data while retaining device functionality.” Users can choose this option if they intend to reuse the drive at a later date. It is thus “ideal for repeated use,” according to Team Group. We aren't sure of the wiping algorithm or tech, so we would assume there remains a chance of data recovery after this software-powered wipe, or partial wipe. The H/W Quick Erase function "uses high-voltage breakdown technology to physically destroy NAND Flash, ensuring data is irrecoverable," asserts Team Group. So, there's a visual and olfactory sign that data has been destroyed, in case you aren't certain that you have chosen to fry the 3D TLC NAND. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Begin hardware destruction simply by holding the big red button for 10 seconds when ‘secure deletion becomes mission-critical,' advises memory products maker. Team Group says the H/W Quick Erase has a “precise focus on Flash IC destruction.” Therefore, if you are a soldering whizz, you may be wondering if it is possible to re-use this drive by swapping the ICs. Team Group says the NAND used is paired with a specific control chip, so reusing or repairing a H/W Quick Erased device might be more effort than it is worth. If anything, we think that the term 'H/W Quick Erase' is a little understated for the physical frying of NAND that occurs here. If we hadn't absorbed Team Group's PR, product pages, and video, it would be quite natural to assume H/W Quick Erase is perhaps a hardware-accelerated erase function. Several computer utilities I have used offer S/W and H/W toggles in their UIs, and none physically destroy any hardware if the latter is selected. If this flashed once per second, it would be a useful guide to whether you are opting to do a quick data erase or physically destroy your NAND. Hopefully, that detail is shared in the instruction booklet. Text shared by Team Group alongside the video we embedded also mentions that data destruction can be triggered by a “physical or event-based trigger,” which indicates there can be other ways to wipe or destroy a P250Q-M80 than the big red button. The new P250Q-M80 offers decent speeds from its 3D TLC NAND and PCIe Gen4x4 controller. Transfers speeds of up to 7.0 GB/s reads, and 5.5 GB/s writes are claimed. We already mentioned various other durability claims for the P250Q-M80, above. Team Group's P250Q-M80 self-destructing SSD is being marketed in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities. We don't have pricing and availability details at the time of writing. Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. In the northern hemisphere, it's hard not to spend the winter in a state of slumbering sloth, just waiting for sunshine and good times to start again. Conveniently, Prime Day fitness tracker deals (all four days of them) drop right in the middle of summer, which makes this a great time to pick up the smartwatch or smart ring that you just didn't have the cash for at Christmas. This year, you have four whole days to shop the Amazon deals, but if you don't want to take that much time, I've highlighted the sales on some of our favorite fitness trackers and smart rings. Perhaps our list of the best Amazon Prime Perks can convince you to sign up. Updated July 11, 2025: We've added new deals on the Garmin Forerunner 165 and Garmin Fenix 8, pulled dead deals, and checked all prices. As you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models. If you're not looking to spend big, Garmin's Forerunner 165 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great compromise. The battery life is decent, and you'll get extras like Garmin's Morning Report, a wake-up feature that tells you the basics of your sleeping stats, weather, and more. Before I even started this job, I had purchased the original Withings Steel HR, which was the first of Withings' gorgeous fitness trackers that don't even look like regular fitness trackers. The Scanwatch 2 follows in that tradition with a comprehensive suite of health features and Withings' new cardiac-focused health features, like Cardio Check-Up, which lets you send your cardiac data instantly to Withings' board of certified cardiologists. WIRED editor and fitness expert Adrienne So called it “the best outdoor sports watch money can buy” thanks to its litany of features that work with both Android and iPhones, from Garmin's proprietary off-grid maps for sports like golfing and skiing, to leakproof buttons for scuba, and even a built-in flashlight. If you want a killer luxury outdoor tracker, this is it. I have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why? Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features. Garmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. It may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. It's tough, too, with a titanium case and 10 ATM/IP68 ratings. Samsung announced a newer version of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but it's actually the same watch with 64 GB of storage and a new color, so it's smart to snag this one for half its MSRP. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included “lifetime subscription,” meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now. Here's proof that reliable tracking doesn't have to be expensive. Most Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes—they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band. Slick looks, Fitbit integration, and bags of features, the Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Wear OS watch for folks with an Android phone. It's no slouch as a health and fitness tracker, with electrocardiogram readings, sleep tracking, heart rate readings, blood-oxygen measurements, and stress tracking. Samsung phone owners should consider this wearable as it offers excellent health and fitness tracking and some exclusive features that only work when paired with a Samsung phone, such as FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. It's a great discount but that's partly because the new one has just arrived. It has ECG functionality, and can track your stress. While fitness trackers generally have built-in heart rate monitors, a separate strap on your bicep or around your chest is far more accurate when things get sweaty and intense during a tough workout. Polar's strap has a comfortable buckle connector and silicone dots to keep it in place. If you still have a humble bathroom scale, it may be time to upgrade to one that has fancy new tricks, like tracking your vascular age and visceral fat. The Withings Body Comp connects directly to the Withings app (so you don't need to have your phone nearby) and shows a staggering amount of data, everything from your weight to muscle mass, heart rate, pulse wave velocity, and weird things like the air quality and your body water percentage.
