                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brad Pitt drives Lando Norris' F1 car for the first time Find out more about Gabriel Bortoleto's life and career in our latest Getting to Know interview. Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto is the next driver on the list to face F1.com's quickfire Getting to Know questions. From his heroes growing up to his best friends in the F1 paddock today, and his worst travel experience to the other sport he loves, the Brazilian shares all in the video player above and transcript below… Can you describe yourself in three words? Oh, okay, straight away like this! What made you fall in love with F1? I mean, what made me fall in love with racing overall… When you race, you always dream to get to F1 because it's the top of the sport that you can achieve one day… I would say the competition, the drivers that have been here in the past, my idols, [Ayrton] Senna… This is the type of thing that made me dream to be here. I believe that was one of the reasons why I always wanted to be in F1. When and where did you first drive something? It was a very great moment in my life and definitely one of the best sensations I ever had. A very important question here… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test? Yes… The guy also gave me a bit of help! Who's your best friend inside the paddock? Where does that come from with Max? Well, I started playing a lot of video games with Max, and then simulator as well when I was in F3. We have a very nice group of friends that we all play games together and do the sim – his team, Team Redline, that I'm an ambassador for. Great people there, and that's how everything started. Since then, we've spent a lot of time together playing games, and it's been very enjoyable. Which three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why? I mean it needs to be said James Hunt, probably, right? He was known as the party guy and everything. Or Kimi Raikkonen, because I heard he was crazy at parties. When he [went] to parties, I heard so many crazy stories about him… Anyone else to complete that list? I don't know how he was in parties. Honestly, I've not heard many stories about that. It would be funny to go out with him. Imagine going out with your idol! What's the best holiday you've been on? Three years ago I also had one when I went to Mykonos with my girlfriend. If you had to take one driver and team boss to a desert island with you, who would it be and why? He's a very smart guy, so I feel that he would help a lot in the desert island, building stuff and doing a lot of stuff. And a driver… I would say, Max, probably. He's always alright with everything, so there are not many things to complain about. Every time I speak to him, ‘It's all good!' What's the worst travel experience you've ever had? Actually, one of the worst ones… I was coming back from Miami… My first flight was delayed and I lost the second flight, so the only flight available was like two days after. It was terrible because I went two days after back home and I was in the exit area. It was economy class and everything, but it was fine, I can sleep easily there. But because there were no seats available, and I was super tired from the race, not sleeping well for two days, I got in this emergency exit area and the door was freezing, like -10. So, I was freezing the whole flight and I felt sick for a week after. What's the strangest gift you've ever been given by a fan? Umm… I've not got any crazy, strange ones. But yeah, I didn't get anything… Nothing strange so far. What's the best advice you've ever received? Honestly, I think just enjoy the journey. That is the best advice I've heard. I would love to be a tennis player. Do you play tennis a lot? No, but I love to watch it, I love the mentality of the players and everything, how good they are. I need to start actually playing properly. Are there any particular players that you admire? I'm going to say a Brazilian, Joao Fonseca. I think he's going to be a future star. But for sure, from nowadays, [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz are my favourite ones. Where do you want to be in five years' time? I would like to be World Champion!</p>
