            Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI issued a lengthy apology Saturday for a series of violent and antisemitic posts from its Grok chatbot this week, blaming a system update.
    


            “First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced,” the company wrote.
    


            xAI says a system update had chatbot Grok refer to “existing X user posts; including when such posts contained extremist views,” caused it to issue responses that praised Adolf  Hitler, repeated conspiracy theories and spewed longstanding antisemitic tropes.
    


            In a series of posts early Saturday on Grok's official X account, the company said the coding change update was active for 16 hours.
    


            The incident underscored many of the dangers of AI, a nascent technology that critics and tech evangelists both say could upend the global economy and cause significant social upheaval along the way.
    


            Grok spouted antisemitic tropes and white nationalist talking points earlier this week in response to user prompts. xAI froze the chatbot's X account on Tuesday evening, though users could still talk to the bot on the private tab.
    


            “We have removed that deprecated code and refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse,” xAI said.
    


            According to xAI, the problematic instructions were: “You tell it like it is and you are not afraid to offend people who are politically correct,” “Understand the tone, context and language of the post. Reflect that in your response,” and “Reply to the post just like a human, keep it engaging, don't repeat the information which is already present in the original post.”
    


            Those instructions steered Grok “to ignore its core values in certain circumstances in order to make the response engaging to the user,” xAI said.
    


            “In particular, the instruction to ‘follow the tone and context' of the X user undesirably caused the @grok functionality to prioritize adhering to prior posts in the thread, including any unsavory posts, as opposed to responding responsibly or refusing to respond to unsavory requests,” the company said.
    


            As the company issued its explanation, it turned Grok's X account back on, meaning the bot was back to engaging with users publicly on X.
    


            Grok's antisemitic turn was not the first time the AI had veered into controversy. In May, the bot began bringing up claims of “white genocide” in South Africa to completely unrelated prompts. The company later said a “rogue employee” was behind the change.
    


            Musk was born and raised in South Africa and has a history of arguing that a “white genocide” was committed in the nation, a claim that has been rejected by a South African court and by experts.

            • Women's champion crowned: Polish star Iga Świątek dominated her Wimbledon singles final against American Amanda Anisimova. The more experienced Świątek did not lose a single game en route to a straight sets victory over a rattled Anisimova, who struggled in her first grand slam final.
    


            • Historic performance: Świątek is the first Polish Wimbledon singles champion — men's or women's — in the Open Era. It's also the first time in that era that a women's player has won the title without giving up a game.
    


            • Emotional remarks: A jubilant Świątek, who had struggled on grass courts prior to this tournament, said after the match that she could hardly process the victory. Anisimova, who has been open about mental health struggles and took a break from the sport in 2023, lauded her opponent and thanked her support system in tearful on-court remarks.
    


            After two weeks of exceptional tennis from both Iga Świątek and Amanda Anisimova, today's women's singles final was over before it even really began.
    


            It took just 57 minutes for Świątek to dispatch her American opponent. The world No. 4 did not drop a single game on her way to lifting the Venus Rosewater Dish.
    


            Anisimova — who has one of the best returns on the WTA Tour — had no reply for the Polish star's dominance when serving. The American forced deuce once in the second set but failed to muster a single break point throughout.
    


            But it was on her own serve that the 23-year-old really lost the match. She won just 26% of her first-serve points and double-faulted five times. Alongside that, she committed 28 unforced errors.
    


            At times, it was a difficult watch at the All England Lawn Tennis Club. It was easy to tell which player had experience in grand slam finals. Świątek's poise contrasted starkly with Anisimova's increasing frustration.
    


            During the second set, the American had opportunities to win her first game but ended up letting out a scream when that chance eluded her again.
    


            For its part, the crowd at Centre Court got behind the struggling world No. 12, both during the match and afterward when she gave an emotional on-court interview.
    


            Anisimova's fellow American tennis star Coco Gauff was also quick to offer her support, writing in a post on X: “keep your head up.”
    

so much to be proud of Amanda❤️❤️❤️ keep your head up 👑


            But it was Świątek's day. The 24-year-old displayed her impressive forehand once again to round out a tournament in which she has far outperformed her previous self — she had only made it as far as the quarterfinals before this year.
    


            The world No. 4 hit three aces, won 72% of her first-serve points and converted 67% of her break points. But, in truth, it was her ability to stay in rallies and wait for Anisimova's errors that proved most decisive.
    


            Świątek now has a Wimbledon title to add to her 2022 US Open win, and the four she has claimed at Roland Garros. The feat sees her become the eighth woman in the Open Era to win grand slam singles titles on all three surfaces, according to Opta.
    


            Iga Świątek overwhelmed Amanda Anisimova on Saturday to win her first Wimbledon title and her sixth grand slam overall.
    


            The 6-0, 6-0 scoreline hasn't happened in a women's Wimbledon singles final since 1911. It's also the second time it's ever happened in any grand slam since Steffi Graf did it in 1988.
    


            Świątek is the first Polish player — man or woman — to ever win the Wimbledon singles title. She broke Anisimova's serve in the very first game and never looked back.
    


            It was the first grand slam final for Anisimova, and it will be one the American wants to forget. Her frustration was evident throughout the match. But her talent is clear from the two weeks she's spent at the tournament, and it likely won't be the last we see of her.

            It's going to take a while for Iga Świątek to stop smiling today.
    


            The new Wimbledon champion simply can't believe what she's just pulled off and isn't letting go of the Venus Rosewater Dish anytime soon.
    


            “It seems super surreal,” she said in her on-court interview after the final.
    


            “First of all, I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks. No matter what happened today, you should be proud of the work you're doing, and I hope we're gonna play in many more finals here and other tournaments — you have the game for that, so congrats to your team as well.
    


                    “Honestly, I didn't even dream because, for me, it was just way too far.
                


                    Iga Świątek, 2025 Wimbledon women's singles champion
                


            “I feel like I'm already an experienced player after winning the slams before, but I never really expected this one, so I want to thank my team because I feel like they believed in me more than I did.”
    


            Today marks not only the first time in the Open Era — and first time since 1911 — that a player has won a women's singles final at the All England Lawn Tennis Club without dropping a game.
    


            It is also just the second time ever in the modern era, which began in 1968, that a grand slam singles final has been won in such a manner, after Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 at Roland Garros in 1988, according to Opta.
    


            The consolation for Anisimova is that Zvereva would go on to finish her career having been the world No. 1 and winning four singles titles and 20 grand slam doubles and mixed doubles titles.
    


            Today is Świątek's day, but we'll be hearing from Anisimova again.
    


            A tearful Anisimova steps up for her post-match interview with the crowd cheering her on.
    


            After taking some time to compose herself, the American jokingly thanked her opponent for the thrashing on Centre Court today.
    


            “Thank you, Iga,” she said, before praising the Polish star.
    


            The 23-year-old also said she would never forget her Wimbledon experience this year, adding she simply “ran out of gas.”
    


            “I wish that I could put on a better performance for all of you. You guys have still been there for me and lifted me up today, so thank you so much,” she said.
    


            Anisimova then thanked her mom and burst into tears when her mom's face appeared on the big screens inside the court.
    


            “I wouldn't be standing here if you guys didn't fly in and support me throughout the rest of the tournament,” she said to her friends and family.
    


            “You guys were my extra motivation and inspiration that I needed. My mom, who flew in this morning, I definitely would not be standing here.”
    


            A very emotional end to what has been a brilliant tournament for the American.
    


            While Świątek celebrated the win, Anisimova walked off the court, maybe just to collect her thoughts.
    


            It's commonplace for the runner-up to give a post-match interview on court, but you could forgive organizers for breaking that tradition today.
    


            Considering how poorly Anisimova performed in that match, it's easy to forget how well Iga Świątek played.
    


            The Polish star has created history for herself and you can see how much it meant to her after that match point whistled past the American.
    


            The 24-year-old fell to her back on the grass, before she picked herself up and gave her opponent a massive hug.
    


            The new Wimbledon champion then ran through the crowd to her player's box where she celebrated with her team.
    


            Real emotion from a true champion.
    


            Iga Świątek has been crowned the women's singles champion at Wimbledon for the first time with an unprecedented 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova.
    


            It is the first time in the Open Era that a women's player has won the final without giving up a game, and the first time overall since 1911.
    


            Blink and you'll miss it.
    


            Iga Świątek is now just one game away from winning her first grand slam at Wimbledon.
    


            The Polish sensation has bulldozed her way to a 5-0 lead in the second set and is making light work of her first final in SW19.
    


            Anisimova will be hoping to at least get one game on the board before this final ends.
    


            This has become less about who wins Wimbledon, and more can the American win a game.
    


            It doesn't look great for her at the moment, though.
    


            The crowd really is pushing her on and going crazy whenever she wins a point and gets the better of a rally.
    


            Problem is, those moments are very few and far between.
    


            We see the best showing so far from the American who forces deuce before losing a long rally.
    


            Świątek double faults to take it back to deuce, but aces and then has too much again for her opponent on the following point.
    


            It's nothing more than small consolation for Anisimova.
    


            It's going from bad to worse for Anisimova in this match and it's her serve letting her down the most.
    


            The American has managed to get just 41% of her first serves in, producing four double faults in the process.
    


            It's form that simply isn't good enough for any tennis match at this level, nevermind the Wimbledon final and you can see she knows it.
    


            This would not have been how Amanda Anisimova envisaged her first grand slam final going.
    


            The American is still yet to win a single game in the matchup and now faces a 3-0 deficit and an uphill climb in the second set.
    


            The crowd is starting to will the 23-year-old towards her first game of the match, but their efforts are in vain as things stand.
    


            While Anisimova has struggled with her serve, Świątek has been at her very best to punish her opponent and is dominating with her strong return game.
    


            It's hard not to feel sorry for Anisimova given how this match is going, but her opponent is looking so assured right now.
    


            Świątek has historically struggled on grass, but is dominating here – her serve reaches 117 mph on the way to another hold. She's made to work for this one a bit more, with Anisimova tying the score at 30-30 before the Pole takes control again.
    


            This is actually getting quite hard to watch now.
    


            Anisimova had chances to win her first service game there but produced two unforced errors when it really mattered.
    


            She let out two screams during that game, the loudest when her opponent took yet another break point opportunity to take the lead again in this second set.
    


            After losing the opening set 6-0, Anisimova would have been hoping to get on the board as early as possible in the second.
    


            It wasn't to be, however, for the American who dropped yet another service game.
    


            Świątek's dominance when attacking Anisimova's second serve is proving vital as she gets yet another break to fall her way.
    


            This could be over very quickly.
    


            It was a dominant opening set from Świątek, but this is nothing new for the Polish star.
    


            She is unmatched in her ability to sweep aside opponents in brutal fashion, and her habit of winning sets 6-0 — referred to as a “bagel” — and 6-1 — a “breadstick” — has led to jokes from tennis fans about Świątek running a bakery.
    


            Anisimova will be hoping Świątek's bakery closes early today.
    


            You've really got to feel for Anisimova here.
    


            She hasn't even completed 30 minutes of her first grand slam final and she's already one set down.
    


            The American walks over to her chair and wraps an ice towel around her neck, while rubbing an ice pack on her face.
    


            She's certainly feeling the heat in more ways than one here.
    


            We've barely even gotten going on Centre Court, and already Świątek has claimed the first set.
    


            Anisimova is having to endure a nightmare start, and this game is no better. She fails to return Świątek's first two serves, before losing the next point after an excellent rally. Świątek then seals the deal to take the game to 0.
    


            If Anisimova is going to get anything from this, she's going to have to come out for the second set playing completely differently.
    


            It has been a tough start for Amanda Anisimova and she now trails 5-0 after losing yet another service game.
    


            Serving has been a struggle throughout the opening stages for the American, and this theme continued for the 23-year-old throughout the latest game.
    


            Iga Świątek is now in complete control and just one game away from taking an early 1-0 set lead.

From Gaza to the US, military-grade surveillance tools are being deployed to monitor and punish student dissent.

In early June 2025, The Guardian revealed that the University of Michigan paid over $800,000 to Amerishield, parent company to a private security company called City Shield. It was part of a broader $3 million public‑security budget, which included surveillance of pro‑Palestinian student activists. The university hired plainclothes agents who trailed students into cafés, harassed them, and even staged confrontations, including faking a disability to falsely accuse them of theft. City Shield, a private security agency based out of Detroit, used the supposed evidence collected by their agents against these students to prosecute them and send them to jail. 

Massive Blue, a company based in New York, has created a surveillance tool called Overwatch that uses AI to monitor online spaces. Although this tool is sold and marketed as a public safety tool, the technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence, particularly targeting college protesters and activists labeled as “radicalized.” These bots are created to imitate human behavior, making them very hard to detect.

The tech stack these agencies deploy is formidable: geofencing tools, license plate readers, real-time social media surveillance, predictive analytics. Even Radian6, a Salesforce product, has been linked to student protest monitoring. These tools don't just observe behavior, they anticipate it, allowing administrators and police to intervene before a rally even begins.

This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach. It is an act of intimidation, one that reflects an ideological alignment with systems of repression abroad. In Gaza, for example, humanitarian aid is increasingly distributed only through biometric registration, leaving starving Palestinians with no choice but to submit to facial and fingerprint scans to access food. Although aid agencies and occupying forces justify this as a form of “efficiency,” it can only be seen as coercive surveillance, stripping Palestinians of dignity and autonomy under the guise of relief.

Within the United States, university officials have increasingly turned to firms like ShadowDragon, Skydio, and Stellar Technologies, whose tools are capable of profiling, analyzing, and geolocating social media posts, drone-mapping encampments, and even identifying masked protestors through AI-enhanced facial recognition. These companies aren't developing tools for student safety. They're developing battlefield tech and students are the new targets.

In April 2024, when students at Columbia University set up a peaceful encampment to protest the genocide in Gaza, few expected the administration to respond with mass arrests. Fewer still understood the extent to which military-grade surveillance technologies were already in place to track them. In the same month, Jewish Currents reported on Yale University's use of drones, surveillance cameras, and plainclothes officers to monitor pro-Palestine student activists. Surveillance footage was used to identify students who had not violated any laws but had simply been present.

The technology uses AI-generated virtual characters that infiltrate online groups, take part in conversations, and collect intelligence.

Meanwhile, in May 2025, it was revealed that LAPD used Dataminr to track the social media activity of students organizing pro-Palestine events. Surveillance reports included screenshots of Instagram stories, private group chats, and Twitter threads. Some of this data was sourced using tools built by Dataminr and Social Sentinel, both of which specialize in identifying “emerging threats” by combing through vast amounts of social media data tools originally developed for use by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. In addition, in March 2024, it was revealed that Elon Musk's X was also selling user data to Dataminr. 

The logic is chillingly consistent: Dissent is pathologized, monitored, and neutralized while capitalists keep making money. And universities have become willing partners in this process.

In my Ph.D. research, I studied surveillance infrastructures, particularly in contexts where settler colonial regimes seek to erase dissent. What we're seeing on U.S. campuses today mirrors repression models from places like East Turkestan (Xinjiang), where everyday resistance is quelled through predictive monitoring and data extraction. What this tells us is that surveillance isn't about protection, it's about power. And American universities are rapidly becoming test beds for the kind of repressive technology we associate with authoritarian states abroad.

The money behind these technologies flows through a familiar nexus of venture capital firms, defense contractors, and government agencies. ShadowDragon, for example, has been celebrated by the World Economic Forum and boasts contracts with U.S. law enforcement and military branches. Cobwebs Technologies, Xtend, and Oosto are Israeli surveillance companies whose products are now being deployed against student activists in the U.S. These firms have marketed their tools based on effectiveness in tracking Palestinians and other “high-risk” populations. Now, they are used on American campuses to monitor solidarity.

There is a historical precedent to this kind of repression. During the civil rights and antiwar movements of the 1960s and 70s, FBI programs like COINTELPRO targeted student activist groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and organizations like the Black Panther Party, with infiltration, wiretaps, and blackmail. The FBI's targeting of student and civil rights activists through COINTELPRO is well-documented, as explored in this Yale News interview with historian Beverly Gage, who says J. Edgar Hoover's tactics were both coercive and widely normalized. Hoover was the first director of the FBI, serving from 1924 until his death in 1972. However, the difference today is scale and automation. Rather than needing a human informant in every room, university administrators can now rely on machine learning algorithms to scan student emails, monitor group chats, and alert authorities to so-called “escalation indicators.”

This surveillance is not merely bureaucratic overreach. It is an act of intimidation.

Recently, billionaire investor Kevin O'Leary called for permanently destroying the digital lives of student protesters using AI-based doxxing campaigns. While O'Leary was widely condemned, his dystopian vision isn't far from the reality already taking root. Companies like Babel Street and Stellar Technologies offer tools with the explicit promise of identifying individuals based on minimal data inputs like a partial image or a Twitter handle.

Tools like NesherAI claim to identify masked individuals in a crowd using behavioral and gait analysis. Corsight AI advertises facial recognition that works through masks, hoods, and sunglasses. These are not theoretical tools. They're being piloted now, often in secret, and often in tandem with increasing police presence on campuses.

These developments must be viewed in the broader context of the militarization of civilian life. The pipeline between Gaza and Georgia Tech is not rhetorical. Technologies field-tested in war zones are refined and normalized on American campuses, where students are reduced to data points in behavioral prediction models. Israeli firms developed surveillance for use in Gaza and the West Bank are now contracted domestically. 

Surveillance technologies once reserved for military and foreign operations are now being deployed on U.S. university campuses, targeting student protestors, particularly those demonstrating for Palestine. These tools are not isolated innovations. Many were tested on Palestinians and Uyghurs before being repurposed for U.S. settings. This is not a breakdown of democratic norms but their systematic redirection using universities as testbeds for next-generation policing.

University administrators often claim that surveillance is about safety. But whose safety? Lately, surveillance tools have mostly targeted the most vulnerable in our communities: Muslims, Indigenous people, undocumented immigrants, Black people, and anyone who supports Palestinian liberation and an end to the U.S.-sponsored genocide in Gaza. They claim that these tools are here to protect us, but in truth, they only serve to erase us, discipline us, and punish us. 

It doesn't have to be this way. Campuses have historically been sites of inquiry, dissent, and transformation, not laboratories for digital repression, and we must fight to keep them that way. We must reject the narrative that surveillance is inevitable. It is not. It is a political choice, made behind closed doors, mostly without consent or oversight of those who are affected the most. 

Surveillance Watch is one intervention in this landscape, an attempt to shift the power back to those being watched. It is a community‑driven project that deploys interactive maps and databases to reveal the web of surveillance companies, their funders, subsidiaries, affiliations, and global operations in an effort to make opaque surveillance networks transparent. However, we need more. We need more public and legal accountability, more student organizing, more media scrutiny, and way more institutional courage. We need to say, unequivocally, that resistance is not a threat. It is a right.

We are not subjects. We are watching back.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has thanked the North Korean troops who helped liberate Russia's Kursk Region earlier this year from a cross-border incursion by Ukraine.

Kiev's forces captured some of the border areas in Kursk Region last August before being gradually pushed back. Russia fully liberated the territory this past April. The Defense Ministry in Moscow estimated that Ukraine sustained more than 76,000 casualties in its failed incursion.

During a meeting with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui at the Wonsan Kalma resort on Saturday, Lavrov stressed that “the heroic soldiers of the the Korean People's Army together with the Russian servicemen brought closer the liberation of Kursk Region with the cost of their blood and even their lives.”

The minister expanded on the issue during a press conference with Russian journalists later in the day, saying that Moscow again thanked Pyongyang for its contribution to freeing the area from “the Ukrainian Neo-Nazis and foreign mercenaries.”

A monument to the North Korean troops who fought in Kursk Region will be erected in Russia, he said, adding that the initiative is “fully backed by our North Korean friends.”

When asked if there were plans to deploy North Korean forces elsewhere in the Ukraine conflict, Lavrov explained that the arrival in Kursk Region of troops from North Korea was in response to a proposal made by the country's leader, Kim Jong-un. The deployment took place under a defense pact signed between Moscow and Pyongyang in June 2024.

“We had no reason to refuse this sincere manifestation of solidarity, and we proceed from the fact that North Korea itself determines the forms in which it implements our agreement on strategic partnership,” he said.

Last month, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoigu announced that around 6,000 North Korean personnel will soon be sent to Kursk Region in line with a decision by Kim. Some 1,000 mine clearance specialists will help with de-mining the territory, while the other 5,000 will be military engineers who will take part in “rebuilding infrastructure destroyed by the occupants,” he said.

            Man's best (super)friend has prime placement in the new “Superman” movie, and the pooch's path to the cinematic spotlight may be worth a movie itself.
    


            Krypto is a CGI flying white mutt who dons a red cape to match the Man of Steel's. The unruly dog – who first appeared in DC Comics way back in 1955 – comes in handy at several pivotal moments throughout the movie, in spite his lack of obedience and training.
    


            Here are the most surprising and sweet things to know about the furry scene stealer.
    


            The film's director James Gunn previously announced that Krypto would be inspired by his real-life rescue dog, Ozu. More recently, Gunn told The New York Times that his greyish pup  became the physical model for the computer-generated super-pet. The process, which Gunn said Ozu “despised,” required the dog to perch on a table surrounded by cameras capturing angles of him from all sides to create a 3D image.
    


            Gunn said he worked with three visual effects companies to develop and fine-tune Krypto, including a team that created Rocket Raccoon from the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films. He also used his own personal pet videos of Ozu playing with his cat as the basis for some of Krypto's movements onscreen.
    


            “I have tons of videos of them playing,” the director told the Times. “In fact, when Krypto is jumping on Superman at the beginning of the movie, that's all based on footage of him playing with my cat.”
    


            Ozu “came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs & never knew human beings,” Gunn shared in a social media post. The director said at first his dog “was problematic to say the least.”
    


            “He immediately came in & destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture - he even ate my laptop,” Gunn wrote. “It took a long time before he would even let us touch him.”
    


            He also wrote that he had adopted Ozu shortly after he had started writing the script for “Superman,” which was how the dog made its way into the story.

            “I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?' - and thus Krypto came into the script & changed the shape of the story as Ozu was changing my life,” Gunn wrote in his post.
    


            Krypto maintains the decidedly unruly nature of the dog upon which he is based, a funny foil to Superman's (played by David Corenswet) kind and composed comportment.
    


             In the end, the “not-so-good-good-boy” – as Gunn described him – truly earns the distinction of superhero in his own right.
    


            Toward the end of the film, we learn that Superman's cousin Kara Zor-El – yes, Supergirl, as played by “Sirens” star Milly Alcock – is the actual owner of the Krypto. In the movie, Supergirl is a bit of a party girl who asked her cousin to watch over her dog while she was off catching a buzz in outer space.
    


            But it seems both she and her beloved pet will be back, since Alcock is slated to star in a feature-length “Supergirl” film out next year. The movie is currently listed as being in post production on IMDb.
    


“Superman” is in theaters now. The film is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, which is owned by CNN's parent company.

The three Cambodian sites' inscription coincides with the 50th anniversary of the rise to power of the brutal regime

Three locations used by Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime as torture and execution sites 50 years ago have been added by Unesco to its world heritage list.

The three locations were inscribed to the list by the UN cultural agency on Friday during the 47th session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris.

The inscription coincided with the 50th anniversary of the rise to power by the communist Khmer Rouge government, which caused the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians through starvation, torture and mass executions during a four-year reign from 1975 to 1979.

Unesco's world heritage list lists sites considered important to humanity and includes the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India and Cambodia's Angkor archaeological complex.

The three sites listed on Friday include two notorious prisons and an execution site immortalised in the Hollywood film The Killing Fields.

The Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, located in the capital Phnom Penh, is the site of a former high school used by the Khmer Rouge as a notorious prison, better known as S-21. About 15,000 people were imprisoned and tortured there.

The M-13 prison, located in rural Kampong Chhnang province in central Cambodia, also was regarded as one of the main prisons of the early Khmer Rouge.

Choeung Ek, located about 15km (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The story of the atrocities committed there are the focus of 1984's The Killing Fields, based on the experiences of New York Times photojournalist Dith Pran and correspondent Sydney Schanberg.

The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on 17 April 1975 and immediately herded almost all the city's residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighbouring Vietnam.

Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Manet, issued a message on Friday directing people to beat drums simultaneously across the country on Sunday morning to mark the Unesco listing.

“May this inscription serve as a lasting reminder that peace must always be defended,” Hun Manet said in a video message posted online. “From the darkest chapters of history, we can draw strength to build a better future for humanity.”

Youk Chhang, the executive director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, said the country was “still grappling with the painful legacies of genocide, torture and mass atrocity”. But naming the three sites to the Unesco list will play a role in educating younger generations of Cambodians and others worldwide.

“Though they were the landscape of violence, they too will and can contribute to heal the wounds inflicted during that era that have yet to heal,” he said.

A commonsense rule created building requirements for projects receiving federal funds. Trump revoked it twice.

President Donald Trump traveled to central Texas on July 11, one week after flash floods ravaged the region. With 120 people confirmed dead and another 170 still missing, the Trump administration and Texas Republican state leaders are facing intense scrutiny for management and budgetary decisions that could have potentially mitigated the devastation. Officials at the National Weather Service have said that Trump's recent staffing cuts did not impact weather forecasting or alerts, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bristled at questions about whether a different government response could have lessened the death toll. “Who's to blame?” Abbott said, in response to a reporter's question on July 8. “Know this, that's the word choice of losers.”

But Trump's National Weather Service cuts are just one facet of a policy agenda that has long been outright hostile to emergency preparedness and climate science writ large. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order revoking a set of federal flood protections known as the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. The rule — which was also revoked by Trump during his first term and reinstated under Joe Biden's presidency — required federally funded infrastructure projects to comply with certain design requirements. Critical buildings such as schools, libraries, water treatment plants, public highways, and fire stations would have to be rebuilt to withstand flooding and rising seas — either located outside of vulnerable floodplains or constructed to be more resilient — in order to receive disaster aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

The National Association of Home Builders, the lobby group for the home-building industry, vehemently opposed the rule when former President Barack Obama first proposed it in 2016. The group claimed that the regulatory burden would increase construction costs; echoing the industry line, Trump called various infrastructure permitting rules a “massive, self-inflicted wound on our country” when he first rolled them back in 2017.

The reality, however, is that the rule was based on common sense: As the climate crisis worsens, structures destroyed by floods should be rebuilt in ways that would reduce the risk of the same thing happening again. The goal of the standards were not only to protect human lives and homes, but also to save taxpayer money, preventing a never-ending cycle of destroy-rebuild-repeat. On paper, this is a policy Republicans should support: Trump, of course, often cites the need to save taxpayer dollars as an excuse to cut vital public programs, including his proposal to start “phasing out” FEMA, purportedly to leave disaster management to the states. Rebuilding structures outside of floodplains would reduce the amount of FEMA money funneled to disaster repair — but by acknowledging that climate change exists, the rules simply don't fit Trump's agenda. 

Now, with those guidelines thrown out the window, the recovery response to the floods could replicate a destructive pattern. The hilly terrain and thin topsoil of the Texas Hill Country has always made the region particularly vulnerable to flash flooding. That risk will only grow as storms get more intense and destructive. 

“Why on earth would the federal government want it to be rebuilt to a lower standard and waste our money so that when the flood hits, if it gets destroyed again, we're spending yet more money to rebuild it?” Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said in an April interview with Grist.

The consequences of Trump's first rollback of the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard began to come into view last fall, after Hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeastern U.S. According to The New York Times, at least five water treatment plants in Florida that were exempt from tougher national building standards received about $200 million in federal funding. Those plants sustained damage from the storms, including water line breaks and power losses. Another seven water plants, rebuilt to lower flood standards with $100 million in public funds, were identified as high risk but escaped damage during Milton and Helene. Berginnis told the Times that “hundreds of millions if not billions” have been spent on buildings that are unprepared for intense floods.

Whether any of those structures were impacted by these floods remains to be seen. But from Texas to North Carolina, Los Angeles to Maui, it's clear that nowhere is truly safe from the devastating impacts of the climate crisis. As we push for the phaseout of planet-warming fossil fuels, we must also make strides to protect communities that are already in harm's way. The only “word choice of losers,” as Governor Abbott put it, is pretending that the emergency isn't already here.

Sex workers targeted by ICE need the migrant justice movement's full solidarity. 

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Since January 2025, police raids on massage parlors have intensified, targeting immigrant women suspected of sex work. Amid nationwide protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), these workers — among ICE's most systematically targeted — are largely excluded from community defense.

“I'm scared to go to work,” a migrant massage worker in New York City told Red Canary Song, a New York-based collective of Asian and migrant sex workers. “Police cars, plainclothes cars, we all hide when [we] see them … we'll be arrested as soon as we go out.”

On June 11, ICE and local police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, raided nine massage parlors, detaining 10 Chinese women — their names and whereabouts have not been released. They disappeared into ICE's sprawling detention system, with facilities from the U.S. to El Salvador and South Sudan. Yet not a single organization called for their release.

Over 90 days in January and February, nearly 1,000 arrests in Queens, New York, targeted immigrant sex workers and street vendors. In Arizona, over 200 arrests were made. In Texas, 11 parlors were closed in February and May under emergency powers that bypass criminal charges. Across 20+ cities this year, police collaborated with ICE in similar raids.

Most go unreported, buried in sealed indictments. In Sanctuary Cities, ICE exploits legal loopholes to deport people through administrative channels, without judicial oversight, masking the true scale of its operations.

In other labor sectors, worksite raids sparked massive outpourings of solidarity and creative resistance, including “Adopt a Day Laborer” campaigns and street vendor buyouts. But sex workers are left to fend for themselves.

Few immigrant rights organizations defend migrant sex workers. Support mainly comes from other sex workers in underfunded grassroots groups like Red Canary Song, Trans Immigrant Project, and DecrimSexWorkCA, the last of which has organized ICE patrols, and distributed over $20,000 in emergency relief to undocumented and other sex workers since 2023. Their model is mutual aid, not charity.

“Our undocumented sex worker fam are terrorized and without resources,” wrote Cocoa Makati, coordinator of DecrimSexWorkCA. Sex work is migrant women's day labor; massage parlors are their “Home Depot.” Street-based sex workers are street vendors. Like other precarious workers, they build safety networks to resist raids.

But the broader immigrant rights movement calibrates its messaging to appeal to moderate respectability — complying with lines drawn between the “deserving” and the disposable. When ICE targets sex workers, many remain silent.

The result is devastating — masked abductions, multiagency entrapments, worksite raids. To some, these actions appear unprecedented. But for those organizing with sex workers, they're all too familiar. For years, ICE has used migrant sex workers as testing grounds for its most aggressive tactics.

During Operation Restore Roosevelt in Queens, massage workers described “turning to riskier and riskier clients and accepting clients they don't feel good about,” said Yin Q, a lead organizer with Red Canary Song. They feel “they are being asked to perform more services for lower fees,” she added.

Many fear leaving their workplace at night to go home. “They bring vans to arrest people, waiting to fill them. Undercover cops take photos, and patrol officers come after,” said Mateo Guerrero of the Trans Immigrant Project.

Guerrero described how the intensified raids led to increased police sexual abuse. A trans Latina sex worker was stripped on the street in winter, and mocked in police custody, Guerrero told Truthout. Others were forced to provide oral sex in a police car to avoid arrest, Guerrero said. In March, two NYPD officers were indicted for sexually assaulting and burglarizing a massage parlor while on duty.

The broader immigrant rights movement calibrates its messaging to appeal to moderate respectability — complying with lines drawn between the “deserving” and the disposable.

“Sexual harassment is the number two form of police violence,” Guerrero said. “Under Operation Restore Roosevelt, it dramatically increased.”

Chilling fear spread throughout the community. In vibrant Jackson Heights, known for its LGBTQ bars and Mexican food carts, the streets became empty. “Not just trans folks — the general migrant community was afraid to go out for a beer.”

Despite mounting evidence of abuse, most immigrant rights groups hesitate to support sex workers. “There's respectability politics because of political conditions, and I understand that as a strategy,” Guerrero said, “but leaving our folks behind is harmful in the long term.”

That's because policing and deportations begin on the margins — with sex workers, trans migrants, street vendors. Once normalized, these tactics expand to the broader public.

Technologies funded to police sex work now monitor everyone. ICE's surveillance tools and ballooning budgets were built over decades by targeting sex workers under the guise of anti-trafficking.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (2015) authorized the creation of the Cyber Crimes Center within ICE, enabling wiretaps and internet surveillance. Between 2014 and 2018, DHS funneled over $3 million to local police for license plate readers to combat trafficking — now used in broader workplace raids.

Authorities justified travel bans, surveillance, racial profiling, raids, detentions, deportations, asset seizures, even sexual assault as anti-trafficking measures to protect women and children. But these measures do more harm than good, exposing migrants to additional forms of violence. Most funding went to prosecutions and public campaigns promoting false statistics and racist stereotypes, not victims' services — fueling misguided vigilantism and MAGA fearmongering around child trafficking.

Both Democrats and Republicans supported the expansion of ICE through anti-trafficking legislation. First established as part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the aftermath of 9/11, ICE structured its operations as two departments in 2023: Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), which carries out deportations, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which conducts investigations. This division creates a loophole that lets police in Sanctuary Cities share data with ICE through HSI.

Under Donald Trump's first term, Congress gave DHS $819,000 for the “Blue Campaign”, expanding HSI's anti-trafficking focus to target massage parlors. Under Biden, ICE's 2023 budget increased to $8.48 billion, adding $15 million to its Center for Countering Human Trafficking and $2 million for surveillance. Today, HSI's multibillion-dollar budget funds workplace enforcement operations, fusion centers, and joint police task forces.

Law enforcement increasingly uses facial recognition, license plate readers, Stingrays, Mobile Fortify, and other surveillance technologies — allegedly to help victims of trafficking, but in practice, to build cases for prosecution and deportation.

State and local law enforcement agencies use Traffic Jam (Marinus Analytics) to scrape escort ads and match faces to biometric databases — without evidence of trafficking. Data brokers like Babel Street and ShadowDragon scrape data from over 200 social platforms, including online games and dating websites. Officers use fake accounts to monitor and entrap targets, buying geolocation data and using geofence warrants to monitor their movements. They gather search queries, and metadata from chat apps like WhatsApp, to profile suspected sex workers.

To enhance what they term “early detection,” DHS recently launched StreamView, a program that uses AI to scan livestreams from public cameras for “suspicious behavior” — like walking on streets where known sex workers walk. Ordinary acts become grounds for arrest, when performed by people with short skirts or foreign accents. This practice legitimized profiling and surveilling the public based on patterns, rather than evidence, of criminal activity.

The National Human Trafficking hotline, run by anti-trafficking organization Polaris, proudly began partnering with Palantir in 2012. Palantir now holds a $30 million contract to build a “master database” for ICE, and is in talks to develop a larger database on all U.S. citizens.

The One Big Beautiful Bill (HR 1) allocated $2.5 billion to ICE specifically for AI systems and biometric data collection — including facial recognition, iris scanning, and DNA — shared between ICE, the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and state law enforcement. Much of this funding will go to Palantir, which has already secured over $1.3 billion in federal contracts in 2025. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) also received over $6 billion for the expansion of Autonomous Surveillance Towers (AST) and biometric screening technologies. This bill turns previously small-scale biometric pilots into foundational national infrastructure.

In New York, ICE accessed over 480 plate readers logging 16.2 million scans in a week — tracking people without warrants or probable cause. In California, police shared plate data with ICE despite sanctuary laws. ICE uses these tools to raid farms, construction sites and food processing plants in Nebraska, California, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania. The technology that once policed sex workers now targets all migrant workers.

The first U.S. immigration law and the nation's first federal policing agency were both born out of the criminalization of immigrant sexuality.

The Page Act of 1875 barred entry to the U.S. for Chinese women, all suspected of prostitution — the first law excluding immigrants by race, gender, and perceived morality. It set the stage for the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which closed the formerly open borders of the country.

The Mann Act of 1910 criminalized interstate travel for “immoral purposes,” a vague category used to police interracial relationships and sex work by targeting Black and migrant men. The FBI — the nation's first federal police agency — expanded through the enforcement of the Mann Act. Today's raids echo the same moral panic of the “white slave trade” — invoking imagined threats and racialized assumptions about migrant immorality to justify broader policing and immigration control.

Mainstream immigrant advocacy champions the “good migrant” — the student, mother, farmhand, and domestic worker. But immigration enforcement began not with “respectable immigrants,” but those hardest to defend. Migrant sex workers defy the “good/bad migrant” binary — and that's powerful. Most Asian massage workers are older women escaping poverty wages in other more exploitative jobs. Sex work is precarious, but for many, it offers more autonomy — feeding families and providing some with the only available startup capital for other businesses, like bakeries.

As Red Canary Song urgently warns: “Neighborhoods at the margins are testing grounds for how policing and neighborhood vigilantism can expand and become embedded into the daily life of the city … the plan is to normalize the horror.”

For years, undercover officers posed systematically as clients, soliciting services in plain clothes, before arresting sex workers with impunity to earn overtime. It's now a national tactic — turning workplaces into traps, as masked ICE agents raid immigrant workplaces to meet federal quotas.

Reversing the expansion of ICE under anti-trafficking rhetoric requires eliminating the legal loopholes that allow local police to collaborate with ICE. It requires removing the 10-year travel ban and “moral turpitude” clause from immigration law — a vague provision used to deport sex workers and other migrants for minor nonviolent offenses.

Protecting migrants also means confronting whorephobia, racism, and criminalization. Otherwise, the state will keep using the same fascist playbook: target sex workers and the most marginalized first, then expand its reach to others. Defending the rights of migrant sex workers is essential to a broader movement for immigrant justice.

            Rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has only played five MLB games. But in that short time, the Milwaukee Brewers starlet has produced such impressive performances that he was named a National League All-Star on Friday, an honor he achieved after the fewest MLB games ever.
    


            The 23-year-old was named as a replacement for the Chicago Cubs' Matthew Boyd, who will be inactive since he is expected to start on Saturday against the New York Yankees ahead of Tuesday's All-Star Game.
    


            Wielding a fastball that has reached speeds as high as 103 mph (166 kph), Misiorowski has long been tipped for All Star honors – the only surprise, perhaps, is just how quickly he achieved that.
    


            He only began his MLB career last month, with a streak of 11 no-hit innings, more than any other starter has managed at the start of their career since baseball's modern era began in 1900.
    


            On his five starts for Minnesota, he has gone 4-1 with a 2.81 ERA. He has averaged 99.3 mph (160 kph) on his fastball, with 89 pitches reaching 100 mph (161 kph).

            Still, Misiorowski said the call-up left him “speechless,” per MLB. Brewers manager Pat Murphy told him just three minutes before he lined up for the national anthem ahead of their 8-3 win over the Washington Nationals on Friday but told him to keep it a secret.
    


            Murphy then announced the news to the entire Brewers team after the game before an emotional Misiorowski addressed his teammates.
    


            “I honestly have no words guys,” he said. “I don't know what to say. It's an honor and, you know, there's a lot of older guys around that have been around for a lot longer than I have so I just wanted to say thank you for all the help you guys have given me to get through these couple of weeks I've been here, it's been huge.”
    


            Misiorowski's selection comes just a year after the Pittsburgh Pirates' Paul Skenes made history by earning All-Star honors 11 games into his MLB career. Before Skenes, three players reached All-Star selection after 13 games – Mark Fidrych in 1976, Hideo Nomo in 1995 and Dontrelle Willis in 2003.
    


            Elsewhere, Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh took his season total of home runs to 38, breaking the American League record and putting him just one shy of Barry Bonds' MLB record for the most homers hit before the All-Star break.
    


            He hit two home runs on Friday – the second of which was a grand slam – propelling the Mariners to a 12-3 win over the Detroit Tigers.
    


            “Trying to go hit home runs is probably not going to help me,” he said afterward. “I'm going to do my best to stay within myself.”

Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki called upon President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 11 to allow full-scale exhumations of Polish victims of the Volyn massacres, according to RMF24, even as the long-stalled process had already resumed in April.

The Volyn (Volhynian) massacres of 1943-1944 took place in the Nazi-occupied territory of what is now western Ukraine during World War II. Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) members killed at least tens of thousands of Poles, while thousands of Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.

Speaking at a ceremony in the eastern Polish city of Chelm marking the 82nd anniversary of the massacres, Nawrocki said the victims "do not cry out for revenge, but for a cross, a grave, and memory," and urged Ukraine to authorize further work across multiple sites. 

"Poles are waiting for this truth," Nawrocki said, according to Polish news outlet RMF24.

Nawrocki's remarks follow the restart of exhumations in April at the destroyed village of Puzhnyky in Ukraine's Ternopil Oblast. It was the first such effort since 2017, when Ukraine imposed a moratorium after a wave of vandalism targeting Ukrainian memorials in Poland.

Ukrainian and Polish officials have since announced additional exhumations of Polish soldiers killed during World War II in Zboiska and the nearby district of Pid Holoskom in Lviv Oblast in June.

Nawrocki emphasized his moral obligation to speak for the victims. A historian by profession, the Polish president-elect has long argued that Ukraine should not be allowed into the EU before the Volyn issue is resolved, a view shared by other Polish politicians across the political spectrum.

"As the future president of Poland, I am obliged to speak with their voice. No one will release me from this," he said. The ceremony in Chelm also marked the planned construction of a new museum to commemorate those killed.

Ukrainian Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar, who attended the event, reportedly voiced support for further dialogue and acknowledged the importance of honoring victims on both sides of the historical divide. 

"We need to talk about this history openly," he said. "Of course, to call the crime a crime. Apologize and apologize, but also honor the memory of those victims who need it, on both sides of the border."

Current Polish President Andrzej Duda recently signed legislation establishing July 11 as the National Day of Remembrance for Polish victims of the Volyn massacres. The law was passed with near-unanimous parliamentary support and declares that the "atrocities committed between 1939 and 1946" must remain in Poland's national memory.

Poland's Institute of National Remembrance estimates that some 100,000 Poles were killed in the Volyn region, now part of western Ukraine. Ukrainian historians argue that thousands of Ukrainians were also killed in retaliatory actions and insist that the conflict be viewed as mutual ethnic violence rather than genocide.

The first exhumation since 2017, at Puzhnyky, where 50 to 120 Poles were killed, was seen as a breakthrough, with both governments pledging to expand joint efforts.

Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich.



While Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the sanctions package itself is not objectionable, his government has blocked the proposal over concerns about a separate EU plan to fully phase out Russian gas imports by 2028.

Russia continued its attacks on western Ukrainian cities overnight on July 12, striking communities far from the front line with drone swarms and missile attacks for the third straight night. 



The man, identified only as Yevgeny, reportedly served in a Wagner assault unit and fought in eastern Ukraine, including in Bakhmut and around Selydove.

"This is a story about humanity, the incredible power of a parent's decision, and the chance for life even in the most difficult times," the hospital said in a statement.

German Major General Christian Freuding confirmed that the weapons systems' initial deliveries are expected by the end of July. The arms will be supplied in a "high triple-digit quantity," he said.

Russia launched 623 aerial weapons overnight, including 339 Shahed-type drones, various decoy UAVs, and 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles, the Air Force said.

"Cut off the head, impale it on a pike, throw it the f**k away," says the voice attributed by HUR to a company commander from Russia's infamous 155th Marine Brigade. The intelligence agency said the order, intercepted on July 10, concerned a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW).

Benjamin Aser, originally from Hungary, was previously a contracted soldier in the Hungarian Defense Forces. 

The number includes 1,070 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.



Germany will provide Ukraine with a grant worth 40.5 million euro ($47.4 million) to support small and medium-sized Ukrainian businesses, Ukraine's Finance Ministry announced on July 11.

            Watching Issa Nlareb's swing, you'd never know he didn't take a golf lesson until five years after turning professional. For 13 years, observing others and reading two-time major champion Greg Norman's book were the closest things the Cameroonian had to formal instruction.
    


            Nlareb was just 11 years old when his mom died. Living on the streets near a golf course, he began collecting balls to earn money to survive, eventually picking up the game himself and becoming a caddie. However, his life dramatically changed in 2018 when he contracted bacterial meningitis while at a tournament in Egypt.
    


            The golfer developed sepsis, fell into a coma and required the amputation of both legs and most of his fingers. He wasn't sure he'd ever play the sport again.
    


            Life has thrown a lot of challenges Nlareb's way in his 34 years, yet while speaking to CNN Sports, he's as laid-back and confident as ever, believing he can be one of the top disabled golfers in the world.
    


            Nlareb lived with his dad and stepmom in a house near Yaoundé Golf Club in Cameroon's capital after his mother's death, leaving school and taking care of four step-siblings before running away from home a year later.
    


            Eleven years old, “pissed off” at the situation and living on the streets, most nights he was picked up by the police and brought in to sleep in the station. One evening, though, he ran.
    


            “I hid myself in the golf course. When I stand up in the morning in the golf course, I was looking around me and I found a golf ball. And I took two golf balls, I went out, and I see the golf course. When I see the golf course, I was like, ‘Wow,'” Nlareb said.
    


            Impressed by the scale and grandeur of the course and thinking the balls belonged to the players on the hole, he washed and offered them to the men. They gave him a dollar in return.
    


            “That was my first contact with golf,” Nlareb said.
    


            With no school, he spent a lot of his time watching the players at Yaoundé Golf Club﻿, thinking about how the players could improve their shots. He visualized this all without owning a club or having played a round.
    


            There was one man – who Nlareb recalls as “Mr. Davou” – who attempted the same shot day after day on the 13th hole.
    


            “There's out of bounds to the right, water in front of the green and behind the green. So, the guy was trying to go over the water every time and he lost some balls,” Nlareb said, smiling at the memory. “I was laughing, and he say, ‘Stop laughing. What can you do in this position?'”
    


            Despite never having swung a club, the 11-year-old had been learning the game since earning that first dollar and decided to offer some wisdom: “I say, ‘You got to play to the left, and you come back right to play the green.' And he said, ‘Come, we make a challenge.'”
    


            Davou handed him a three iron – not an easy club for even a more seasoned golfer. But Nlareb was up for the challenge and made it onto the green following the path he advised Davou to take. His success earned him his first golf club – that hard-to-hit three iron.
    


            Nlareb continued collecting and cleaning balls, practicing with his iron and developed friendships with the golfers. He often helped players aim shots and find their balls on the hilly course.
    


            All that time, he was on his own from age 11 to 17; no family, no school, just the money he could earn at markets and on the course. It was only once an aunt learned of his whereabouts and that he hadn't heard from his father in six years that Nlareb returned home and went back to school to take his caddie exams.
    


            “I was playing golf when I was 12, but I was not playing the regular golf like stroke play, 18 holes. No, I was playing three holes, one hole, half a hole sometimes,” Nlareb remembered.
    


            Caddying at Yaoundé Golf Club allowed him to play complete rounds once a week – usually Mondays after events finished for the day. Things soon accelerated after that.
    


            “After a year, I was number one of the caddies,” Nlareb said. “So, I turned pro in 2009 in Yaoundé.” He didn't buy his first set of clubs until after turning professional.
    


            “My dream was to be the best player in the world, but my other was to beat Tiger Woods,” Nlareb said. “(But) I realized that there's a big difference between the course Tiger Woods is playing and the course I play. … So, I (got) my first golf lesson when I was 24 (in 2015),” Nlareb told CNN Sports.
    


            After more than five years competing on African tours, Nlareb set goals for himself to slowly work toward those dreams. In 2015, he decided to try his hand at qualifying for the third division circuit in Europe, the Alps Tour. He had three young children and, with two quick wins at the Gabon and Senegal Opens, was at the peak of his career and personal life up to that point. That is until he fell ill at the Ein Bay Open in Egypt in February 2018.
    


            He awoke from a five-day coma to learn he had contracted bacterial meningitis and had developed septic shock. A terrified Nlareb was told he needed to have both legs above the knee and both arms above the elbow amputated.
    


            “I refused because I was so afraid,” Nlareb said. “I say, ‘Why?' and I say, ‘No, no, no, don't do that. Leave me dead.'”
    


            The fear was all-encompassing: Nlareb couldn't imagine a life with no arms or legs. He waited a month until his visa in Egypt ended and transferred to a Cameroonian hospital. There, he once again heard a prognosis he wasn't ready to accept.
    


            His stepmother was working in Belgium at the time and called local hospitals to see if they would take Nlareb's case. He flew to Brussels where his latest doctor sat him down and explained amputation was his only viable option, although things had slightly improved.
    


            “He wrote everything (down for) me. He showed me. And I (saw) that difference between the last two months where I would get to be amputated and where I would be amputated right now.”
    


            Three months after waking from his coma, Nlareb underwent an operation and had both legs below the knee and most of his fingers amputated.
    


            In his recovery process, the doctor explained the importance of taking things slow – starting with just 30 minutes a day of getting used to his prosthetics and building up from there. However, after a further three months in isolation to rebuild his immune system, he was eager to establish his new normal as soon as possible.
    


            “When they put me in the prosthetics, I walked all day long. But it was a big mistake,” he remembered. “I wore off my skin. I was not able anymore to put the prosthetics on my feet.
    


            “There'd be pain for me. I was tight in my heart. I cry.”
    


            Nlareb refused to think about golf after his amputations: “I forget about golf. I give up.” He went “back (to Cameroon) to take care of my family, enjoy my life,” adding that he didn't “want to play anymore golf because I was so sad.”
    


            However, his friends had other plans. They forced him back onto a course a couple of months post-surgery to help his physical and mental recovery.
    


            His first swing back on the course went “50 meters (55 yards) with one hand.”
    


            For the 6-foot-4-inch Nlareb, who was used to crushing his drives well over 200 yards before his illness, it was a difficult thing to take.
    


            It was at that point that he turned his focus to teaching. He went to school for two years to grow and develop as a golf teaching professional and began coaching a team in Cameroon: “I learned how to share my passion with people.”
    


            However, a tournament at the end of 2019 left him fuming. “They played so bad. … I was so pissed off,” Nlareb said. “How'd they do that? Even me, (hitting) 50 meters, I can make bogey in the hole. How can they play so bad?”
    


            Angry and disappointed, he didn't expect his then five-year-old daughter to find the solution.
    


            “She smiled and said, ‘Dad, you need to play golf,'” Nlareb recalled. His daughter suggested wrapping a strap around his hands and club to give him the power and grip to swing with two hands again.
    


            “It was eight o'clock – in Cameroon, night comes at seven – I was like, ‘Why don't you come with (me) and we run and go directly to golf?'” The father and daughter spent all night at the course.
    


            In 2019, Nlareb returned to the pro game via the African Golf Tour. Two years later, now residing in France, he made a remarkable comeback, making the cut in the very Alps Tour tournament he contracted meningitis three years earlier.
    


            The World Golf rankings for people with disabilities was created in 2019, a year after Nlareb's illness and amputations, while the Golf for the Disabled (G4D) Tour didn't launch until February 2022. Disability golf events are still in their infancy.
    


            Last year, Nlareb played in the third annual US Adaptive Open – his first time visiting the United States – where he won the multiple limb amputee category and placed fourth overall for men. He won the same category and finished tied for seventh overall this year.
    


            What did he earn for twice winning his category and two top-10 finishes? Nothing.
    


            “There is not currently a purse for the U.S. Adaptive Open,” the USGA confirmed in an email to CNN Sports. “We announced recently that Deloitte will provide financial support in the form of travel-related expense reimbursements to all players in the field this year, and we are incredibly excited about that.”
    


            Nlareb estimated it would have cost $10,000 to take part in the US Adaptive Open if he didn't have sponsors and hadn't received an exemption into the tournament due to his result at last summer's edition.
    


            “You pay for your flight ticket. You pay your reservation hotel, your car, and you pay your entry fee,” the eighth-ranked player in the World Ranking for Golfers with Disability said.
    


            And he's lucky in that he's received free prosthetics since 2021 after meeting with Alain Montean, the then-president of a prosthetics company. Without these, Nlareb estimated it would cost him $50,000 every two years to replace.
    


            The exposure gained from the US Adaptive Open is significant, but paying thousands for events is not sustainable. Nlareb needs to play more golf to gain a following, but he can't play tournaments without sponsors and external funding. It's a vicious cycle that's hard to see a way out of.
    


            “I know I have good level, but it's not that easy without a sponsor because it's very expensive,” Nlareb said. “Just to register in the event it's very expensive. Today, I'm a dad of three and it's not easy for me to take care of my children and to play my golf.”
    


            “It's a big event. … So to be there, I'm coming close to my dream because from there, the world can know about my story,” the 34-year-old told CNN Sports. “I need the support. I need the help. And I got a good game. I live for golf. I can't live without golf. Golf is my life.”

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated. 

At least two people were killed and 28 injured in Kyiv as Russia launched a mass attack against Ukraine for the second night in a row, rocking Ukraine's capital and cities far from the front lines overnight on July 10.

Throughout late spring and early summer 2025, Russia has ramped up aggression against Ukraine with a series of record-breaking mass strikes. The night of July 10 saw yet another wave of aerial terror from Moscow.

At around 1:15 a.m. local time, Kyiv Independent journalists on the ground began reporting explosions in the capital and the buzzing of Shahed-type drones. Reporters said large numbers of drones were flying over the Pechersk neighborhood, a historical district in the city center. 

Later in the night, reporters said they heard several dozen explosions and the distinctive sound of ballistic missiles. At least an hour of near-constant explosions rolled through the city. 

Blast waves also set off car alarms throughout Kyiv, adding to the roar of drones, ballistic missiles, and air defense fire. Air raid alerts ended at approximately 7 a.m. in Kyiv Oblast.

Ukraine's Air Force issued multiple alerts overnight, warning that groups of Russian drones were targeting regions throughout the country, including the far-western Ternopil and Rivne oblasts.

The attack caused fires at apartment buildings in Kyiv's Shevchenkivskyi and Darnytskyi districts, Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported. Gas stations and garages are also in flames, he said, and medics have been dispatched to the scene.

Two people were killed in the Russian attack, Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported. Both fatalities were women – a 68-year-old resident and a 22-year-old police officer, the Interior Ministry said.

At least 28 people have been injured, with at least 10 hospitalized, local authorities reported, adding that some of the injured sustained shrapnel wounds. Among the injured are two children, Tkachenko said.

In the Podilskyi district, a primary healthcare center "was almost completely destroyed" in the Russian attack, Klitchsko later reported.

The attack damaged the studio of the Kanal 5 television channel, owned by former President Petro Poroshenko. While no employees were injured, filming equipment sustained damage, causing a temporary disruption to broadcasting.

It remains unclear whether Russia targeted or hit any military or other strategic targets in the attack, as Ukrainian authorities largely do not disclose such information for security reasons. This makes the full extent of casualties and damage impossible to verify.

Russian forces launched 397 drones against Ukraine overnight, with almost 200 of them being Shahed-type kamikaze drones and the rest decoys used to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, according to the Air Force.

Russia also fired eight Iskander-M ballistic missiles, six Kh-101 cruise missiles, and four S-300 guided air defense missiles, targeting primarily Kyiv, the statement read.

Ukrainian air defenses shot down 164 Shahed-type drones, eight Iskander-M missiles, and six Kh-101 missiles. Some 204 drones and missiles reportedly disappeared from radars or were intercepted by electronic warfare.

"This is a clear escalation of terror by Russia — hundreds of 'Shaheds' every night, constant strikes, and massive attacks on Ukrainian cities," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

"Today, I will be speaking with partners — in particular within the Coalition of the Willing — about additional funding for the production of interceptor drones and the supply of air defense systems for Ukraine."

Meanwhile, in Kherson, two people were injured by drone strikes during the countrywide mass assault overnight on July 10.

"A 63-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man were hit. They suffered blast injuries and multiple shrapnel wounds. The victims were hospitalized in moderate condition," the Kherson City Military Administration said in a Telegram post.

Another four were injured by Russian artillery fire in Kherson late on July 9.

The night before, Russia slammed Ukraine with its largest missile and drone attack since the start of the full-scale war, targeting the western city of Lutsk with its heaviest barrage. 



Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich.



While Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the sanctions package itself is not objectionable, his government has blocked the proposal over concerns about a separate EU plan to fully phase out Russian gas imports by 2028.

Russia continued its attacks on western Ukrainian cities overnight on July 12, striking communities far from the front line with drone swarms and missile attacks for the third straight night. 



The man, identified only as Yevgeny, reportedly served in a Wagner assault unit and fought in eastern Ukraine, including in Bakhmut and around Selydove.

"This is a story about humanity, the incredible power of a parent's decision, and the chance for life even in the most difficult times," the hospital said in a statement. 

Speaking at a ceremony in Chelm marking the 82nd anniversary of the 1943-44 Volyn massacres, Polish President-elect Karol Nawrocki said the victims "do not cry out for revenge, but for a cross, a grave, and memory," and urged Ukraine to authorize further work across multiple sites. 

German Major General Christian Freuding confirmed that the weapons systems' initial deliveries are expected by the end of July. The arms will be supplied in a "high triple-digit quantity," he said.

Russia launched 623 aerial weapons overnight, including 339 Shahed-type drones, various decoy UAVs, and 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles, the Air Force said.

"Cut off the head, impale it on a pike, throw it the f**k away," says the voice attributed by HUR to a company commander from Russia's infamous 155th Marine Brigade. The intelligence agency said the order, intercepted on July 10, concerned a Ukrainian prisoner of war (POW).

Benjamin Aser, originally from Hungary, was previously a contracted soldier in the Hungarian Defense Forces. 

The number includes 1,070 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.



Germany will provide Ukraine with a grant worth 40.5 million euro ($47.4 million) to support small and medium-sized Ukrainian businesses, Ukraine's Finance Ministry announced on July 11.

WONSAN /North Korea/, July 12. /TASS/. Pyongyang has reaffirmed its unequivocal support for all the goals of Russia's special military operation and Moscow's actions, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a press conference following talks with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui in Wonsan.

"We exchanged views on the situation surrounding the Ukrainian crisis," he noted. "Our Korean friends confirmed their firm support for all the objectives of the special military operation, as well as for the actions of the Russian leadership and armed forces. In turn, we once again expressed our sincere gratitude for the contribution of Korean People's Army servicemen to the successful liberation of the Kursk Region from Ukrainian Nazis and foreign mercenaries," Lavrov added.

LONDON, July 12. /TASS/. Ukraine's Western allies believe that US President Donald Trump is predisposed to consider Russian President Vladimir Putin as his negotiating partner, and Vladimir Zelensky as the main obstacle to peace, the Financial Times reported citing sources.

"There's a little bit of overexcitement based on a shift in tone," said one of the officials. "But we're not seeing that translate into major actions."

The sources said that the American Patriot complexes are crucial for the protection of Ukraine, but they will not affect its ability to strike back and will not change the overall dynamics of the conflict as a whole.

Earlier, Zelensky said that the US arms supplies to Ukraine had resumed.

On July 2, the New York Times reported that Washington would suspend supplies to Kiev of missiles for Patriot anti-aircraft systems, GMLRS precision-guided munitions, Hellfire guided missiles, Stinger man-portable air defense systems and a number of other weapons. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned John Ginkel, charge d'affaires of the United States in Kiev, while Zelensky noted that Europe was not able to replace American supplies.

On July 3, Trump said that Washington continues to provide military assistance to Kiev, adding that the United States itself needs weapons.

On July 7, Trump actually resumed arms and military equipment supplies to Ukraine. On June 10, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the supply of American weapons continues under a schedule agreed between the Washington administration and Congress.

Norway will provide Ukraine with 25 million Norwegian krone ($2.5 million) to support the country's cybersecurity defenses by the end of 2025, Ukraine's Digital Transformation Ministry announced on July 11.

Norway's new commitment for Ukraine comes as Oslo announced it has become the 12th country to join the Tallinn Mechanism on cybersecurity to help protect Ukraine against cyber threats.

"The Tallinn Mechanism is a key instrument of international support that helps Ukraine resist these attacks while building long-term digital resilience," Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement, as Oslo announced it's participation in the international mechanism during the final day of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

Ukraine and 10 partner countries established the Tallinn mechanism in December 2023, with the aim of coordinating civilian cyber capacities to strengthen Ukraine's defense in cyberspace and long-term resilience.

"Norway's accession to the Tallinn Mechanism is a powerful political gesture of support for Ukraine and a signal of the democratic world's readiness to further consolidate efforts to counter cyber threats and strengthen the global cybersecurity architecture," Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs for Digital Development Anton Demyokhin said in a statement.

Having previously joined the Tallinn mechanism as an observer, Norway joins Canada, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, the U.K., and the U.S., as a permanent member of the international mechanism.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale war in February 2022, Russia has launched thousands of cyberattacks on Ukraine's critical infrastructure, including power grids, telecom networks, the financial system, in an attempt to disrupt the country's abilities to sustain its defenses.

In addition to coordinating cyberattacks against Ukraine, the Kremlin continues to target Ukraine's Western allies as it attempts to disrupt military supplies for the embattled country and damage Western resolve.

Norway's cybersecurity support comes following its announcement on July 10 that Oslo will commit $200 million aimed at restoring and transforming Ukraine's energy sector. Norway also separately committed 42 million euros ($49 million) to the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, targeting infrastructure protection against Russian attacks and development of more sustainable energy networks.

Russia's position, conveyed to both U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian officials, marks a notable shift given Russia's historical public advocacy for Iran's right to enrich.



While Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said the sanctions package itself is not objectionable, his government has blocked the proposal over concerns about a separate EU plan to fully phase out Russian gas imports by 2028.

Russia continued its attacks on western Ukrainian cities overnight on July 12, striking communities far from the front line with drone swarms and missile attacks for the third straight night.

German Major General Christian Freuding confirmed that the weapons systems' initial deliveries are expected by the end of July. The arms will be supplied in a "high triple-digit quantity," he said.

Russia launched 623 aerial weapons overnight, including 339 Shahed-type drones, various decoy UAVs, and 26 Kh-101 cruise missiles, the Air Force said.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one who was held despite showing agents his identification.

The filing in U.S. District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility.

Frimpong issued the emergency orders, which are a temporary measure while the lawsuit proceeds, the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government was violating the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the constitution.

She wrote in the order there was a “mountain of evidence” presented in the case that the federal government was committing the violations they were being accused of.

The White House responded quickly to the ruling late Friday. “No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy – that authority rests with Congress and the President,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said. “Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview (or) jurisdiction of any judge. We expect this gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.”

Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was under way after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.”

When detaining the three day labourers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them is that they were Latino and were dressed in construction work clothes, the filing in the lawsuit said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.”

Federal immigration agents seeking to detain a Honduran landscaper chased him into a Southern California surgical center and quickly found themselves in a tense standoff as clinic staff demanded to see identification and a warrant. He was eventually arrested.

The Associated Press

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an e-mail that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin colour are disgusting and categorically FALSE.”

McLaughlin said “enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests.

After the ruling, she said “a district judge is undermining the will of the American people.”

ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens who was detained, was “physically assaulted ... for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighbourhood.”

Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn't involved.

Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances” including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field.

In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said.

“The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said.

A confrontation erupted Thursday between protesters and federal officials carrying out a raid on a Southern California farm.

The Associated Press

Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say they also have been denied access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” on several occasions since June, according to court documents.

Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7 attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA when the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out and chemical munitions akin to tear gas were deployed.

Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests and it has since been restored.

Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and that the people detained are also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them.

He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” to getting people to sign papers to agree to leave the country before consulting an attorney.

Friday's order will prevent the government from solely using apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone's occupation as the basis for reasonable suspicion to stop someone. It will also require officials to open B-18 to visitation by attorneys seven days a week and provide detainees access to confidential phone calls with attorneys.

Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.

President says Kyiv ‘preparing new European defence packages'; Ukraine says its drones hit fighter aircraft plant and missile production facility inside Russia. What we know on day 1,235

Read all our Ukraine war coverage

The US has resumed military supplies to Ukraine and senior officials in Kyiv will work on military cooperation next week with Washington's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Friday. He restated that Ukraine had received high-level signals from Washington and its other western allies that arms supplies, paused for a time last week, had now resumed. “We are currently working with partners on new supplies, increased weapons production in Ukraine and better support for our army,” he said. “Next week, we will continue working with the US side on a military level … We are also preparing new European defence packages.” Kellogg, interviewed by the Ukrainian media outlet Novyny.LIVE while attending a conference about Ukraine in Rome, said: “We'll be in Kyiv Monday. We'll be there all week.”

Donald Trump confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine, Andrew Roth writes. During an interview with NBC News, the US president said: “So what we're doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons.” He added: “I'm disappointed in Russia, but we'll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.”

The EU's top diplomat has said the 27-nation bloc was pondering a new raft of sanctions against Moscow. “Russia has increased its attacks against civilians to really cause as much pain … and that's unacceptable,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said. Brussels was considering an 18th round of sanctions against Moscow and “we are also still in negotiations to put the oil price cap on, that would deprive Russia from the means to fund this war”, she told AFP.

Kallas said she was assured by Laos's top diplomat that Vientiane had “no intention or willingness” to send military help to Russia, following claims that Moscow was planning to involve military personnel from Laos to bolster its efforts in Ukraine. “I also expressed that it has consequences for European aid to Laos if something like this is happening,” Kallas said. “If you [Laos] contribute to that existential threat, we can't have good cooperation,” she warned.

Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks killed three people in Russia on Friday. Russian air defence systems intercepted 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow said. There was one dead in Russia's Lipetsk region and another was killed in the western Tula region from the drone attacks, local officials said. Ukrainian shelling later killed another civilian in the border region of Belgorod, the governor announced. The Russian defence ministry said out of the 155 downed Ukrainian drones, 11 were bound for Moscow.

Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region, causing explosions and fires at both. Ukraine's military said on Telegram the aviation facility in the town of Lukhovitsy, about 135km (84 miles) south-east of Moscow, produced MiG fighters. The other site was the Instrument Design Bureau, which specialised in producing anti-aircraft missiles and missile-gun systems, it said. “Defence forces continue to take all steps to undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian occupiers,” the military said.

Russian bombardments on eastern Ukraine overnight on Friday forced the evacuation of a maternity centre in Kharkiv and wounded nine people. Zelenskyy said a medical facility was hit in the attack on the country's second-largest city. “Among the wounded are women in a maternity hospital – mothers with newborns, women recovering from surgery,” he wrote on social media. “Fortunately, no children were injured.” He added that several other regions were attacked overnight.

Nato will need more long-range missiles in its arsenal to deter Russia from attacking Europe because Moscow is expected to increase production of long-range weapons, a US army general told Reuters. “The Russian army is bigger today than it was when they started the war in Ukraine,” Maj Gen John Rafferty said at a US military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. “And we know that they're going to continue to invest in long-range rockets and missiles and sophisticated air defences. So more alliance capability is really, really important.”

The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that wartime censorship in Russia is justified amid the conflict with Ukraine and the closure of opposition-minded media. Speaking to Russian magazine Expert, Peskov said that many media outlets have been closed, while some reporters have left the country in the past three years. “But don't forget the situation we are in. Now is the time of military censorship, unprecedented for our country. After all, the war is going on in the information space too,” Peskov told the magazine. Russian authorities also blocked X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. “It would be wrong to turn a blind eye to the media that are deliberately engaged in discrediting Russia,” he said.

What good is being in a position of power when you could be podcasting?

DAN BONGINO HERE! I MUST GET OUT OF THIS TERRIBLE POSITION OF “DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI” (where I am HELPLESS to see what's really going on), so that I can get to the bottom of this Jeffrey Epstein situation! (Kash Patel can come with me if he wants.) I have always felt that you get the most direct line to what the FBI is doing when you are as far away from the FBI as possible, ideally in some sort of podcast studio or BASEMENT with a BULLETIN BOARD that has a lot of RED THREAD on it—and KETTLEBELLS! (How I have missed my kettlebells!)

I've wasted so much time here. I should have remembered: The people who really know what the government is doing are the ones who don't work anywhere near it. If I can see a single classified file, I am still TOO CLOSE! That is how they GET YOU!

No, someone has to leave the government and start digging, because there is a conspiracy here for certain. Only, I can't get to the bottom of it from here, within the ranks of the FBI's top leadership. (I think it goes all the way to the top but I can't be sure!)

I believe this is all the fault of Pam Bondi. (Pam ought to resign!) She is keeping things from the American people, I think. I was in all the meetings and saw all the files she saw but I couldn't see ANYTHING in them (which I believe to have been the WITCHCRAFT OF PAM!)

Look—I know conspiracy theories, and let me just say: The way we have released the Epstein evidence is the LEAST convincing thing I've EVER SEEN! First Pam says the Epstein client list is on her desk? And then she says, no, she meant something different? And then we put out a statement saying that there was nothing to see in the files and that we cannot release any more. And then we release a video to help demonstrate that he killed himself but that is missing a minute of footage? A whole minute? And then she says, Oh, this always happens? What are we trying to pull over on the American people?! I am desperate to get to the bottom of what is going on here! EXTREMELY SUSPICIOUS STUFF.

Even Donald Trump is trying to move the conversation away from Epstein on the grounds that we've already talked about him for years? Has Donald heard himself speak before? That has never once stopped him! That's why you have to get me out of the government. I can't think straight in the FBI. I have to wear a tie and a LONG-SLEEVE SHIRT and it makes me MISERABLE and CONFUSED! I get addled, like an egg. I need the reassuring air of my podcast studio (and my kettlebells, my most trusted sources!) I need all of this (and, of course, Pam's resignation) to understand what's really happening here! The Deputy Director's chair at the FBI is probably the worst place or the second-worst place to find out what's really going on. Kash and I are helpless! All the director and I can do is sit around and administer unwanted polygraphs to our resentful employees! This is NOT the best use of my time. I should be doing REPS and GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS and FILLING MY WHOLE T-SHIRT, LIKE SOMEONE POURED ME INTO IT AND FORGOT TO SAY “WHEN,” which I can't do here! As soon as I'm out of this stifling environment I will find those responsible, I'm sure. We need Dan Bongino on the case!

Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., spoke with Fox News Digital about his bipartisan bill to codify oversight of foreign adversaries, including China, buying American farmland.

A key China ally with presidential ambitions in Peru traveled late last month to California to participate in a sending-off ceremony for a batch of trains donated by the Biden administration, according to reporting by Peruvian news outlets.

Peruvian outlet Justo Medio reported at the time that Lima Mayor Rafael Lopez Aliaga, who is rumored to be considering a run for president of Peru in 2026, was in California late last month to discuss the transport of a batch of CalTrain locomotives, which were donated to Lima by the U.S. government under the Biden administration.  

Nate Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), recently published a study on Lopez Aliaga's "deep" financial ties to China through his company PeruRail, which has seen its revenue rise to over $65 million per year due to increased shipments from Minera Las Bambas, a Chinese-owned joint venture counting state-owned mining giant China Minmetals as its majority backer.

The report alleged that China has been "cultivating" Lopez Aliaga for higher office in Peru in hopes of growing its mineral and battery supplies harvesting in South America. The report goes so far as to dub Lopez Aliaga "China's man in Peru."

"China's mining presence in Peru is a direct boon for López Aliaga," the report said, giving Beijing "a powerful beachhead in Peru."

The report said, "This leaves an influential Peruvian political leader aligned with and linked to China, its resource project, and the broader Belt and Road Initiative of which it is part."

In the last several years, Chinese investment in South America, and Peru especially, has significantly increased. 

According to NBC News, China invested $1.3 billion in a massive deepwater port in Chancay, Peru, just north of Lima. 

Chinese President Xi Jinping participated in the port's opening ceremony in 2024, during which he called the port the start of China's 21st-century maritime Silk Road, according to the outlet.

According to Picarsic, China has also been investing heavily in Lima's infrastructure, most notably dominating its electricity industry, all of which Lopez Aliaga has been a "linchpin" piece in moving Chinese dominance forward.

Now, with Lopez Aliaga possibly entering Peru's presidential race, Picarsic explained that this all "looks like a telltale sign of China's handiwork."

He also called the U.S.'s donation of trains to Peru "too little, too late" to combat China's growing influence in the region.

"We're coming with a donation of some number of decommissioned rail cars. But this guy, who is in cahoots with China, who's coming to take them and he's taking them back to run on Chinese rail feeding into a Chinese port, helping to move goods from a Chinese mine."

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken participated in a train-donation ceremony last November in Lima, Peru, where he praised the project as an opportunity to "strengthen the ties between Peru and the United States" and said the trains "are not just a symbol, but the practical manifestation of possibilities – the possibilities that come when we connect to each other."

"This agreement is a testament to the strength and durability of the U.S. and Peru's longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship," he added. "I am so proud to have Caltrain be a member of that mutually beneficial relationship."

            The first warning of impending disaster some Texas Hill Country residents  received came in the form of rushing water, strange noises from passing debris and the screams of victims swept down a raging river.
    


            The usually serene bend of the Guadalupe River in Kerr County rapidly transformed into a torrent of destruction in the early hours of July 4. The catastrophe has claimed the lives of at least 120 people, with more than 150 still missing.
    


            One week later, serious questions remain about what actions local leaders took after ominous warnings from the National Weather Service, echoing other recent high-profile natural disasters marked by accusations of government complacency.
    


            Texas has faced criticism in the wake of disaster before, during 2021's devastating winter weather, and allegations of inefficiency and mismanagement have also followed the wildfires in Los Angeles and Maui — underscoring why figuring out exactly what happened before and during disasters is so critical.
    


            The potential for heavy rain first prompted state emergency management officials to begin pre-positioning resources in the region last week.
    


            On the morning of July 3, “there was a 10 o'clock weather call,” to discuss the situation, said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. “And judges and mayors are invited to be on the call.”
    


            Just over three hours later, forecasters at the NWS issued a flood watch listing Kerrville and surrounding areas at risk for flash flooding and 5 to 7 inches of rainfall.
    


            But a more serious NWS alert came at 1:14 a.m. on Independence Day morning, warning residents of central Kerr Country of “life-threatening flash flooding,” followed a few hours later by a series of flash flood emergency notices as the Guadalupe River burst its banks and tore through summer camps, homes and recreational vehicles.
    


            Despite repeated attempts by reporters and community members to seek answers, it remains unclear what, if anything, Kerr County public safety leaders did after the first early morning notice of imminent danger from forecasters.
    


            While some local residents described receiving text notifications from the NWS, many did not. And despite spotty cell service in parts of western Kerr County, it's unclear how county leaders acted following the first NWS flash flood warning, and if they sent out evacuation notices of their own or attempted making physical contact with people in the potential impact zone.
    


            It's also unclear whether county leaders were on the initial Thursday phone call with the Texas Department of Emergency Management, nor is it understood how closely local officials were monitoring forecast reports.
    


            In response to multiple questions, some state and local leaders have grown defensive, insisting their focus is on the rigorous and back-breaking work still underway to find the missing. They say a review of the actions of government officials will come later.
    


            In a news briefing on Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott pushed back when asked about accountability.
    


            “Who is to blame?” Abbott said, repeating a reporter's question. “Know this, that's the word choice of losers.”
    


            But the questions being asked by reporters mirror the very same ones coming from devastated local residents.
    


            After the deadly Los Angeles fires earlier this year, which claimed the lives of 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes, local government leaders faced an onslaught of criticism.
    


            “HEADS UP!!!,” the National Weather Service posted on social media a day before the blazes, describing an impending windstorm as “LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE.”
    

HEADS UP!!! A LIFE-THREATENING, DESTRUCTIVE, Widespread Windstorm is expected Tue afternoon-Weds morning across much of Ventura/LA Co. Areas not typically windy will be impacted. See graphic for areas of greatest concern. Stay indoors, away from windows, expect poweroutages. #LA pic.twitter.com/yl83LxeMEc


            Despite that warning, an investigation by The Los Angeles Times found the city's fire department opted to not deploy in advance about 1,000 personnel and fire engines to respond to any potential fires that might be sparked by the fury of wind that began descending on the area.
    


            The Los Angeles Fire Department chief, who was relieved of duty after the fires, had previously complained about cuts to the department's budget, saying they had “adversely affected the Department's ability to maintain core operations, such as technology and communication infrastructure, payroll processing, training, fire prevention, and community education.”
    


            And when flames started chewing through Los Angeles area neighborhoods, many residents in some of the hardest-hit areas said they had received no evacuation warning at all.
    


            “None of us got a red (mandatory evacuation) alert before we felt ready to leave our houses,” local resident Mark Douglas told CNN. “You know, we felt heat and fire and that trumps any alert. So a lot of us gave up on the alert system at that point.”
    


            In language similar to what's now being used by officials in Texas Hill Country, LA's fire commission president said it was “out of line” to blame any local official for the magnitude of the fires shortly after the tragedy, insisting the focus should be on helping the residents who lost everything.
    


            An investigation into the response is still ongoing.
    


            An investigation of the catastrophic Maui wildfires that killed 101 people and left $6 billion in damage in August 2023 revealed a spate of problems with emergency preparation and coordination before and during the disaster.
    


            Investigators concluded there was “minimal” pre-positioning of staff and equipment after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning prior to four major wildfires breaking out.
    


            As wind-fueled fires whipped their way across communities, Maui County's 80 emergency sirens meant to warn residents of imminent danger remained silent.
    


            In the days after, officials offered several explanations amid growing frustration: The sirens were broken. They weren't activated. They would have sent people into danger and not away from it.
    


            Authorities vowed to conduct a full assessment of siren operations.

            A deadly deep freeze and winter storm slammed Texas in February 2021. The NWS issued alerts ahead of the dangerous winter weather, and by February 14, every county in the state of Texas was under an active winter storm warning.
    


Power went out for 4.5 million homes and businesses due to the combination of snow, ice and prolonged cold. Families across the Lone Star State were forced to scavenge for firewood or spend nights in their cars, trying desperately to stay warm in the more than﻿ weeklong freeze. In addition to the widespread power outages, water system failures and breakdowns in infrastructure soon followed. More than 200 people died.
    


            While the dangerous days-long power outages were still underway, Gov. Abbott blamed the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state's power grid, for what he said were failures to prepare the state for the winter storm.
    


            Abbott did also say he was “taking responsibility for the current status of ERCOT,” adding, “I find what has happened unacceptable.”



            ﻿Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz also faced criticism for flying to Cancun, Mexico, as the state froze – a decision he ultimately said was “obviously a mistake.”
    


            Cruz was also on a preplanned family vacation when the deadly floods ravaged the Texas Hill Country on Friday. The senator “promptly booked a flight back home” and returned Sunday evening, his office said in a statement.
    


Cruz came back ‘as fast as humanly possible' from Greece vacation after floods hit Texas, his office says



            While Kerr County residents await answers on what attention local leaders paid to the warnings from forecasters, it's evident from past disasters that getting to the bottom of what officials did or did not do is critical.
    


            Although none have disputed the devastating floods appeared with remarkable speed, one thing appears clear: The weather warnings came.
    


            Many elected officials and meteorology veterans have come to the defense of the NWS in the days since.
    


            “The weather service did their job,” Rick Spinrad, former head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Tuesday. “The watches and warnings went out. Clearly the heartbreak with respect to this development is that those warnings were not received.”

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Zohran Mamdani's Democratic primary victory is exposing the party's division as his political allies now look to primary House Democrats.

FIRST ON FOX: Mahmood Mamdani, the father of socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, sits on the advisory council of an anti-Israel organization that supports boycotts and sanctions of Israel, routinely accuses the Israeli government of committing "genocide", and has expressed sympathy for suicide bombers.

The Gaza Tribunal, founded in London in 2024, says its primary goal is "to awaken civil society to its responsibility and opportunity to stop Israel's genocide in Gaza," according to its website.

Also on its website, Mahmood Mamdani is listed as a member of the group's "advisory policy council" and is mentioned as having attended the group's official launch in London last year.

Richard Falk, the president of the tribunal, outlined the group's support of BDS in an online post saying, "the aim of the Tribunal is or [sic] legitimize and encourage civil society solidarity initiatives around the world such as BDS."

BDS is described as "an international campaign to delegitimize the State of Israel as the expression of the Jewish people's right to national self-determination by isolating the country economically through consumer boycotts, business and government withdrawal of investment, and legal sanctions," according to Influence Watch. 

Zohran Mamdani has also promoted BDS as recently as May, when he declined to say whether Israel has a right to exist and said his support of BDS "is consistent with my core of my politics, which is non-violence."

Mahmood Mamdani, the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at Columbia University, has also faced criticism on social media in recent days over a resurfaced book excerpt where he expressed sympathy for the way suicide bombers are viewed.

"Suicide bombing needs to be understood as a feature of modern political violence rather than stigmatized as a mark of barbarism," the elder Mamdani wrote in his 2004 book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terror. 

"We need to recognize the suicide bomber, first and foremost, as a category of soldier."

The Gaza Tribunal's founder and members have deep ties to anti-Israel movements, with at least one being deported from the United States due to terror ties. 

Falk has a long history of espousing anti-Israel views and was repeatedly accused of using his "Special Rapporteur" United Nations position to "spread unsubstantiated allegations against Israel," according to Canary Mission, a watchdog organization that works to expose antisemitism. In 2011 and 2014, Falk accused Israel of being a "colonialist" nation and claimed it was pushing "ethnic-cleansing goals." He would go on to echo these views as recently as February of this year during an interview.

Falk faced backlash in 2007 for comparing Israel's government to the Nazis by accusing them of ushering in a "Palestinian Holocaust" and rhetorically asking, "Is it an irresponsible overstatement to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalized Nazi record of collective atrocity? I think not." The comparison led to backlash and former Israeli U.N. Ambassador Itzhak Levanon opposing his 2008 UN nomination.

The Princeton University professor emeritus also demanded a boycott of corporations in 2012 that do business with Israel, saying they "should be boycotted until they bring their operations into line with international human rights and humanitarian law and standards." However, a spokesperson for the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) fired back, warning the UN that Falk "has repeatedly abused his position as special rapporteur to unleash unrestrained hatred and disdain for Israel" and that the "United Nations should not be complicit in this wholly unjustified effort to single out Israel."

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Falk said that he advocates for "nonviolent solidarity initiatives with the Palestinian struggle for their basic rights, including BDS."

"I believe that Israel's occupation policies in Gaza and the West Bank have persecuted Palestinians on their own homeland," Falk added. "Also, I believe that this pattern of displacing the native population is illustrative of settler colonial political projects that depend for their success on an apartheid-like domination and exploitation of the native population. If such a regime encounters prolonged resistance it almost inevitably relies on genocidal tactics to subdue the civilian population, either by marginalization, ethnic cleansing, or massive killing, all of which have been occurring in Gaza during the 20 months since October 7."

Falk added that Jewish voters in New York City "should not worry" about Mamood Mamdani's ties to the tribunal or about Zohran Mamdani's candidacy for mayor. 

"Both father and son are respectful of international law, the UN, human rights of all peoples, and the pacific settlement of political disputes," Falk said. 

Falk is not the only member of the tribunal with anti-Israel ties. A press release of the group's launch mentioned that Dr. Hatem Bazian, the chairman of American Muslims for Palestine and the co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine, was also present at the launch. Bazian has been a controversial anti-Israel figure for decades due to his inflammatory rhetoric about Israel and Jews, including during a 2014 convention speech, where he called on attendees to "get to work" on calling for BDS on college campuses and doing sit-ins in Congressional offices.

In 2015, Bazian raised alarm bells when he called for an "intifada in this country that changes fundamentally the political dynamics in here," which is widely interpreted as calling for violence against Jews. He would go on to say, "They're gonna say some Palestinian being too radical – well, you haven't seen radicalism yet."

He has also faced backlash for antisemitic posts on social media, which drew backlash from several student groups, including one that mocked Hassidic Jews, with one saying "Mom, look! I is chosen! I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs and steal the land of Palestinians ‘Yay' #Ashke-Nazi."  Another social media post insinuated Jews control UC Berkeley, which is a classic antisemitic trope about their "power."

Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida professor who admitted to conspiring to aid the Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror group in 2006, was also present at the Gaza Tribunal launch meeting. 

He recently posted on X that he was "very honored and proud" to have contributed to the Gaza Tribunal's "The Sarajevo Declaration," which accuses Israel of "genocide, and its decades-long policies and practices of settler colonialism, ethno-supremacism, apartheid, racial segregation, persecution, unlawful settlements, the denial of the right to return, collective punishment, mass detention, torture and cruel and inhuman treatment."

The declaration went on to "call for an end of the smearing of UNRWA and other humanitarian workers, for the free and unhindered access of UNRWA," a group that has been slammed for alleged ties to terrorism, including allegedly working with Hamas.

Al-Arian, whom a federal judge once called a "master manipulator" and leader in the terror group, spent 30 years in the U.S. before being arrested in 2003, according to the Justice Department. After a 57-month prison sentence, he agreed to be deported to Turkey as part of his plea deal for a single charge on what had begun as a 17-count federal indictment.

Then-U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said in 2006 that the disgraced professor had denied involvement with the terror group for a decade before prosecutors had enough evidence to bring charges.

"In his guilty plea, Al-Arian admitted that, during the period of the late 1980s and early to mid-1990s, he and several of his co-conspirators were associated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad," the DOJ said in a statement after his sentencing. "He further admitted that he performed various services for the PIJ in 1995 and thereafter, knowing that the PIJ had been designated as a Specially Designated Terrorist and that the PIJ engaged in horrific and deadly acts of violence."

Socialist former UK Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has long been labeled as antisemitic due to various anti-Israel statements, is also a member of the Gaza Tribunal Advisory Council.

In 2020, an investigation into antisemitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) found Corbyn's Labour Party had broken the law in the way it handled complaints of antisemitism when Corbyn was in charge.

Corbyn was eventually suspended from the Labour Party over charges of antisemitism. He also once referred to "friends" from Hamas coming to address Parliament.

A 2019 poll showed that a whopping 87 percent of Jewish people in Great Britain believed Corbyn was antisemitic, pointing to many incidents and remarks, many of them involving his staunch support for Palestinians and perceived hostility toward Israel.

Zohran Mamdani's stance on Israel has been a widely discussed topic so far during the mayoral campaign, and he sparked controversy by refusing to condemn the phrase "globalize the intifada," which has become a rallying cry for anti-Israel protesters in the United States ever since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 massacre in Israel. 

Mamdani, who was the co-founder of Bowdoin College's Students for Justice in Palestine chapter during his four years, expressed support for an academic boycott of Israel in the school's paper. 

Mamdani has been widely criticized by Jewish groups in New York City over his past positions and comments as he tries to position himself to win the general election in November against current Mayor Eric Adams and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who are both running as independents.

Rep. Zach Nunn (R-IA) on Friday confirmed he is running for reelection in the House next year, shutting down months of speculation he would run for governor in Iowa.

Nunn announced his reelection bid Friday night after President Donald Trump reiterated his endorsement of him.

“Thank you to President Trump for joining us in Iowa to kick off America 250,” the congressman wrote on X, referring to the president's visit to Iowa on July 3. “I'm proud to have the president's continued support, and even prouder to keep fighting for Iowa families in Congress.”

Trump said he spoke to “Great Combat Veteran Zach Nunn,” who “is committed to the mission” of keeping the narrow Republican majority in the House.

“He is a team player, with a tremendous future — And 100% MAGA. Zach needs our full support to win Iowa-03,” he posted on Truth Social. “He is fighting for the Farmer, and everything else that Iowa stands for, including, of course, Lower Taxes, and our always under siege Second Amendment. Zach Nunn has my Complete and Total Endorsement. HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”

Nunn will face off against two Iowa Democrats, state Rep. Jennifer Konfrst and state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, in a bid to keep his House seat. He is the only declared Republican candidate so far.

“Combat veteran Zach Nunn has a proven record of results for this community, and that's why Iowans will send him back to Congress next year,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Emily Tuttle said in a statement. “Let's do this thing!”

Nunn previously expressed interest in launching a gubernatorial bid instead after Gov. Kim Reynolds (R-IA) announced in April she would not be seeking reelection in 2026. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird also passed on a gubernatorial run earlier this month.

If he ran for governor, the House Republican would have vied for the top primary slot with Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-IA).

Feenstra filed to run for governor in May and has since raised more than $3 million for his campaign. He also received key endorsements from prominent Iowa Republicans — Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer — in recent days.

Still, Feenstra faces an uphill battle in the race against Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand, the only Democrat to hold statewide office in the Republican-controlled state.

Nunn was first elected to the House in 2022 after receiving endorsements from Trump, former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR). The Trump-endorsed lawmaker won reelection in 2024. Nunn represents Iowa's Third Congressional District, which he flipped in 2022.

LONDON (AP) — “The Salt Path” is a memoir of resilience and courage that captured the hearts of millions and was subsequently adapted for the big screen, with actors Gillian Anderson and Jason Isaacs taking the lead roles. 

But now, the book and the film are mired in a controversy that could see them suffer that very modern phenomenon — being canceled.

On Friday, publisher Penguin Michael Joseph agreed with author Raynor Winn to delay the publication of her next book, “On Winter Hill” from this October after “intrusive conjecture” about her husband's health.

The delay is the latest blowback from a bombshell report in Sunday's The Observer newspaper in the United Kingdom that claimed there was more to the 2018 book than met the eye — that key elements of the story had been fabricated. 

Author Raynor Winn stands accused of betraying the trust of her readers and of reaping a windfall on the back of lies. Winn accepts “mistakes” were made, but that the overarching allegations were “highly misleading.” She has sought legal counsel. 




Winn's book tells how she and her husband of 32 years, Moth Winn — a well-to-do couple — made the impulsive decision to walk the rugged 630 miles (around 1,000 kilometers) of the South West Coast Path in the southwest of England after losing their house because of a bad business investment. 

Broke and homeless, the memoir relays how the couple achieved spiritual renewal during their trek, which lasted several months and which saw them carry essentials and a tent on their back.

The book also recounts how Moth Winn was diagnosed with the extremely rare and incurable neurological condition, corticobasal degeneration, or CBD, and how his symptoms had abated following the walk.

It sold 2 million copies, became a regular read at book clubs, spawned two sequels and the film adaptation, which was released this spring, to generally positive reviews. 

On its website, publisher Penguin described the book as “an unflinchingly honest, inspiring and life-affirming true story of coming to terms with grief and the healing power of the natural world. Ultimately, it is a portrayal of home, and how it can be lost, rebuilt, and rediscovered in the most unexpected ways.” 

That statement was released before the controversy that erupted last Sunday.

In a wide-ranging investigation, The Observer said that it found a series of fabrications in Raynor Winn's tale. It said the couple's legal names are Sally and Timothy Walker, and that Winn misrepresented the events that led to the couple losing their home. 

The newspaper said that the couple lost their home following accusations that Winn had stolen tens of thousands of pounds from her employer. It also said that the couple had owned a house in France since 2007, meaning that they weren't homeless.

And perhaps more damaging, the newspaper said that it had spoken to medical experts who were skeptical about Moth having CBD, given his lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them.

The book's ability to engender empathy from its readers relied on their personal circumstances. Without those hooks, it's a very different tale.

As a writer of what was represented as a true story, Winn had to attest to her publisher that the book was a fair and honest reflection of what transpired. 

Any memoir may have omissions or hazy recollections. 

But making things up is a clear no-no.

In the immediate aftermath, Winn made a brief comment on her website about the “highly misleading” accusations and insisted that the book “lays bare the physical and spiritual journey Moth and I shared, an experience that transformed us completely and altered the course of our lives. This is the true story of our journey.”

She fleshed out her response on Wednesday, describing the previous few days have been “some of the hardest of my life,” while acknowledging “mistakes” in her business career.

She also linked documents appearing to show Moth had been diagnosed with CBD, and described how the accusations that Moth made up his illness have left them “devastated.”

After the allegations were published, Penguin said it undertook “the necessary pre-publication due diligence,” and that prior to The Observer story, it hadn't received any concerns about the book's content.

It'll be interesting to see how the book's sales and the film's box office receipts are affected by the controversy. Those should start emerging in the coming days.

In addition, there are questions now as to whether the film will find a U.S. distributor and whether Winn, in particular, will face compensation claims, potentially even from readers.

Winn was meant to be in the western England town of Shrewsbury on Friday on the Saltlines tour, a “words and music collaboration” between her and folk band The Gigspanner Big Band.

Her legal team said that Winn is “deeply sorry to let down those who were planning to attend the Saltlines tour, but while this process is ongoing, she will be unable to take part.”

'America Reports' shows new video of the police chasing and arresting two inmates from New Orleans who escaped from jail. 

A fugitive who escaped custody at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in May appeared surprisingly pleased with his recapture, flashing a broad grin as law enforcement escorted him back to Kentucky.

The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared the update on Sedrick T. Stevenson, thanking the other agencies for their help, stating that they "coordinated closely" with U.S. Marshals and Seattle-area agencies to ensure Stevenson's secure return.

Photos released by the Warren County Sheriff's Office show Stevenson smiling cheerfully while seated on a plane alongside multiple law enforcement officers — a striking contrast to the circumstances of his return to custody.

"Therefore, we wanted to ensure he was brought back without issue. We underwent coordination with the Port of Seattle Police, Seattle Police, US Marshals, Air Marshals, and TSA," the sheriff's office shared.

Authorities took no chances with Stevenson this time and guaranteed he would return to Kentucky with zero issues as he was pictured strapped to a wheelchair and put in the plane's window seat under the careful watch of law enforcement.

Deputies joked about the cross-country trip to retrieve Stevenson, pointing out it took nearly 24-hours to conduct the mission. 

"I am happy to report that after 2 direct flights, 4 time zone changes, and 21 straight hours, he was booked into the WCRJ," officials said. "He (Stevenson) received VIP service and ensured a 5-Star Yelp review."

Stevenson, 28, who was wanted on warrants out of Bowling Green, Kentucky, snuck away from a contracted agent on May 4 when the agent lost control of him at the ticket counter at the airport. 

Port of Seattle Police confirmed via video cameras that Stevenson, who was in shackles, was caught on video escaping by boarding a light rail train and disappearing for more than a month until he was captured by U.S. Marshals.

The U.S. Marshals Service told FOX 13 Seattle that Stevenson was arrested in a Seattle neighborhood, along with a second person who investigators said was reportedly assisting Stevenson in his escape.

"This arrest sends a clear message: no matter how long it takes or how far someone runs, justice will catch up with them. Our deputies and taskforce officers worked tirelessly and with unwavering dedication to bring Stevenson back into custody. The community can rest easier, knowing a dangerous fugitive is no longer on the streets" U.S. Marshal Donrien Stephens told the outlet.

Stevenson was being held in the King County jail until authorities in Kentucky were able to transport him back to their state.

At the time of his escape, Stevenson was being extradited to Kentucky to face multiple charges, according to the U.S. Marshal's Office, including being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, third-degree assault, and enhanced possession of a controlled substance.

Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Marshal's Office, but did not immediately receive a response.

WAIANAE, Hawaii (AP) — When there's enough rain, the mountain-framed expanse of vacant land behind Calvin Endo's house looks like the lush and verdant landscape that makes tropical Hawaii famous. But in the summer, when the jungle of eyeball-high invasive grasses and spindly tree branches fade to brown, he fears it could become a fiery hellscape.

This isn't Maui, where most of Lahaina burned down during a massive wildfire in August 2023. Endo's duplex is in Waianae on the west side of Oahu. 

But Waianae and Lahaina have a lot in common. They're both situated on parched western island coasts, with road access pinched by topography, and are bastions of Native Hawaiian culture. Both have sections crisscrossed by overhead power lines atop aging wooden poles, like those that fell in high winds and caused the Lahaina fire.

There's even a Lahaina Street through the heart of Makaha, Endo's neighborhood along the Waianae coast.

“It can happen to us,” said Endo, who moved to the Makaha Meadows subdivision in 1980, soon after it was built. “We can have a repeat of Lahaina if somebody doesn't do anything about the brush in the back.” 

In recent days, two wildfires a few miles away, including a July 6 blaze that left a 94-year-old woman dead, proved his worst fears could become reality.

It's been nearly two years since Lahaina provided a worst-case scenario of the destruction from wind-whipped flames fueled by overgrown brush. With 102 deaths, it's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century.




In the months afterward, the number of Hawaii communities participating in the Firewise network, a nationally recognized program that helps communities with resources for safeguarding homes, more than doubled to 35 — but none in western Oahu. 

Even though Waianae residents have long known about their wildfire risks, only now is one of its neighborhoods close to gaining Firewise status.

Communities become Firewise by organizing a committee, creating a hazard assessment, developing an action plan and volunteering hours toward reducing risk, such as removing overgrown brush. Firewise tracks a community's progress, connects residents with experts, and provides ideas and funding for mitigation, workshops and training.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service considers Lahaina and Waianae to be at much higher risk than other U.S. communities for a wildland fire, noted Honolulu Fire Department Battalion Chief Keith Ito.

“The weather, the winds, they're pretty much identical,” he said. “With all that being said, I think that the high-risk wildfire potential is a state-wide problem, not really specific to Waianae or Lahaina.” 

Nani Barretto, co-director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, struggles to understand why fire-prone communities like Waianae have yet to join the Firewise movement. There are also no Firewise communities on the island of Kauai. 

“Just because we are proactive in getting the word out, it doesn't mean the right people are getting the information,” she said. “For Maui, it took a very devastating event for them to join.”

Organizing a community can be challenging because it requires residents to put in time and step up as leaders, she said. 

Endo, who is a longtime member of the Waianae Coast Neighborhood Board, had never even heard of Firewise until recently.

A development called Sea Country, near the neighborhood that was recently ordered to evacuate during a wildfire, is close to becoming the fist Firewise community in Waianae, said Andria Tupola, a resident who also represents the coast on the Honolulu City Council. 

The process got underway around 2018 but picked up momentum after Lahaina, she said.

Sea Country recently completed a hazard assessment and has planned some mitigation events, including a park cleanup in August, said Ashley Bare, the Firewise support specialist for Oahu. 

Lahaina also provided the spark for opening an emergency access route in Waianae, Tupola said. Farrington Highway, the main artery along the coast, can get clogged with just an accident.

Military officials who control a mountain pass above Waianae started talking about letting civilians access the route after Lahaina, she said. During the July 6 fire, state and military officials were ready to open the road as a way out of the coast and into central Oahu, said state Rep. Darius Kila, who represents the area. 

A Hawaiian homestead community in Waianae's Nanakuli Valley is also trying to achieve Firewise status, said Diamond Badajos, spokesperson for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. 

Home to the largest concentration of Native Hawaiians, Waianae is rich in Hawaiian culture and history. But much of the coast also struggles with poverty and homelessness. 

Residents have grown accustomed to wildfires in the dry summer months, said Republican state Rep. Chris Muraoka: “It's almost like if it doesn't burn, something's not right.”

However, Muraoka said he thinks communities along the coast would benefit more from fire-prevention and safety education in schools rather than organizing to be Firewise. Muraoka, who lives in Makaha, said communities in Waianae have unique needs that being Firewise might not address, including sections with neighborhoods that are more spread out than in Lahaina and blazes that are often started by arsonists or kids playing with fire. 

Some residents already do what they can, especially with the dry season underway. 

Endo often tries to clear brush on private property behind his home himself, to create a firebreak. Some properties in Waianae Valley use sheep to eat the overgrown vegetation.

Retired firefighter Shermaih “Bulla” Iaea recalls fighting blazes in the brush near Endo's home and Makaha Elementary School.

In 2018, his farm burned down during high winds from a passing hurricane. He was using a herd of sheep on his property until wild dogs killed them in April. Neighborhoods banding together to become Firewise is another tool that will help, he said. 

“There's a 100 percent chance that will happen here,” he said. “I thought it would never happen to me. Now I'm trying to ring the bells. I'm trying to sound the alarm.”

Being one of the poorest communities in the state is a major factor preventing Waianae from becoming Firewise, said Kila, who lives near where the July 6 fire happened. 

Before the summer, the Democratic lawmaker sent a letter to Hawaiian Electric and telecom companies urging “immediate and coordinated action” to address dangerous, sagging utility lines on aging wooden poles along the coast. 

It's not clear why Makaha ended up with a long street named Lahaina, which can mean “relentless sun” in Hawaiian. But like the west Maui town, it fits the sunny west Oahu neighborhood, which is home to the world-famous Makaha surfing beach.

Some neighborhoods above Lahaina Street are newer and have underground utilities, like Endo's. But toward the ocean, older neighborhoods are laced by overhead power lines.

That worries Glen Kila, a Hawaiian cultural practitioner in Waianae, who is not related to Darius Kila. Power lines are blamed for sparking the Lahaina blaze.

“If that happens to Waianae,” he said, “we're done.”

Right-wing figures Charlie Kirk and Megyn Kelly on Friday alluded to the reported feud between FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Department of Justice‘s botched handling of the Epstein files.

While speaking at a Turning Point USA event in Tampa, Florida, Kirk asked the crowd whether they preferred Bongino or Bondi. The crowd overwhelmingly shouted, “Bongino!”

“It's 7,000 to zero,” Kirk replied. Kelly chimed in, saying the crowd wants Bongino because he “understands MAGA” and “is part of the MAGA movement.”

“He's been in the trenches,” she added before questioning whether Bondi “really gets MAGA.” The conservative commentator doesn't think she does.

Earlier Friday, reports surfaced of Bongino and FBI Director Kash Patel's dissatisfaction with Bondi over the Epstein files. The attorney general repeatedly promised she would release troves of information on late financier and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein‘s client list, but the DOJ now says no such list exists.

The Department of Justice also concluded Epstein's death was caused by suicide, not homicide, in prison. To show there was no foul play in his death, DOJ officials released footage showing the area outside Epstein's prison cell the night he died. However, one minute of the footage was missing around midnight, suggesting the footage may have been modified.

As a result, Bongino and Patel are reportedly considering resigning from their positions. Meanwhile, the Justice Department disputed any such conflict and denounced such reports.

“I worked closely with [Patel] and [Bongino] on the joint FBI and DOJ memo regarding the Epstein Files,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche posted on X. “All of us signed off on the contents of the memo and the conclusions stated in the memo. The suggestion by anyone that there was any daylight between the FBI and DOJ leadership on this memo's composition and release is patently false.”

Kelly is calling on Bondi to resign, especially after she invited right-wing influencers to the White House in February to receive binders featuring largely known information about Epstein.

Bondi “brought in some of our best influencers, people that I care about deeply,” Kirk said, naming Jack Posobiec, Chaya Raichik, who goes by Libs of TikTok on social media, and Rogan O'Handley, also known as DC Draino, out of the 15 total influencers present for the publicity stunt.

BONDI'S HANDLING OF EPSTEIN FILES SPARKS RIFT WITH BONGINO AND PATEL

“She gave them these binders, and she humiliated them,” he continued. “You guys were upset. You shouldn't be upset at the influencers. They were handed these binders like there was something incredible in them.”

Kelly said that is “what you would do to an enemy.”

She also took issue with Bondi's empty promises on Fox News that the Epstein files, including the client list that the DOJ head at one point said was sitting on her desk, would be released shortly after she reviewed them.

“She knew they were bull****. She knew that there was nothing in there,” Kelly said.

She explained how the influencers were then led out of the White House, where the press corps photographed them holding the binders. The incident outraged conservatives on social media, including some of the influencers who are now calling for Bondi's resignation.

Liz Wheeler, in particular, told Kelly that she and the other influencers were promised another trove of information and told that the binders contained little new information. The influencers didn't expect to receive the binders, as the Epstein files were not the original purpose of their visit to the White House.

“They didn't even know they were there for Epstein, and they looked foolish through no fault of their own,” Kelly concluded. “The only fault was they trusted her.”

Friday's TPUSA event marks the latest instance Kelly has criticized the Trump administration over the Epstein files.

MAGA VOICES TARGET BONDI INSTEAD OF BONGINO AND PATEL AFTER EPSTEIN CLIENT LIST FLOP

Earlier this week, she slammed Bondi but gave Bongino, whom she personally knows, the benefit of the doubt.

“I trust [Dan Bongino] not to actively mislead me or you,” Kelly said on Emily Jashinsky's podcast After Party. “However, Pam Bondi has definitely made multiple inconsistent statements, and I'm sorry, but she does not deserve the benefit of my good opinion, and I'm not prepared to give it to her.”

A rock climbing outing turned fatal for one National Park visitor after authorities say a fall resulted in his death.  

Officials with the National Park Service confirmed that Brian Astle, 42, of Provo, UT fell while descending a steep, off-trail climbing route from the west face of Mount Gould inside Glacier National Park on Wednesday.

The accident happened just before 6 p.m. on July 9, when Glacier National Park Dispatch received a report of an individual who had fallen from Mount Gould above the Highline Trail.

Park rangers worked with aerial search and rescue crews to locate Astle. However, the operation was postponed overnight to ensure Astle's body could be safely recovered.

The following morning, park rangers located Astle's body and transported him to a nearby horse corral till he could be moved to the coroner's office. 

Officials said an investigation is ongoing, and there is no additional information available at this time.

Mount Gould stands at 9,557 feet, making it the highest point along the Garden Wall in Glacier National Park, according to the National Park Service. 

"The park extends their deepest condolences to the family and asks the public to respect the family's privacy," park officials wrote in a news release.

Back in August 2024, a missing climber was found dead after disappearing from his hiking party.

The National Parks Service said Grant Marcuccio, 32, of Whitefish, Montana was found dead after suffering from "traumatic injuries" from an "apparent fall." 

Officials said "Marcuccio separated from his party to summit McPartland Peak alone and planned to rendezvous at a designated location" but "Rangers were alerted by the hiking party that Marcuccio never made it to the rendezvous spot."

Glacier National Park is known for its "beautiful glacial lakes, waterfalls, valleys, and alpine meadows," FOX Weather reports, but it can also "experience quickly changing and extreme weather."  

"Be aware that mountain weather is unpredictable; always be prepared for a variety of conditions," the park's website states.

Wildfires have forced evacuations for visitors and staff at two national parks in the U.S. West as the summer monsoon season brings increased lightning to the arid region.

Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) southwest of Denver, closed until further notice after lighting strikes sparked blazes on both rims, park officials said. The Grand Canyon's North Rim in Arizona also closed because of a wildfire on adjacent Bureau of Land Management land near Jacob Lake.

The wildfire on Black Canyon of the Gunnison's South Rim ignited Thursday and has burned 2.5 square miles (6.5 square kilometers), with no containment of the perimeter. The smaller blaze on the North Rim was out as of Friday, according to an incident map. 

The conditions there have been ripe for wildfires with hot temperatures, low humidity, gusty winds and dry vegetation, the park said, adding that weather remained a concern Friday.

Fire danger has ramped up in the West as drought conditions have worsened across several states. While monsoon season can drop much-needed moisture on the area from June through September, it can also bring dust storms and thunderstorms like those that ignited the wildfires in the Colorado and Arizona parks.

Firefighters saved Black Canyon's visitor center along the South Rim by removing dry vegetation and coating the building in a layer of protective material, fire officials said. Small aircrafts from Colorado's Division of Fire Prevention and Control dropped retardant from the sky Friday while ground crews tried to contain the burn. Some park equipment and sheds were damaged, the park said.




In Arizona, the Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it helped evacuate people from an area north of Jacob Lake and campers in the Kaibab National Forest nearby. The fire began Wednesday evening after a thunderstorm moved through the area, fire officials said.

“Gusty and erratic winds” spread the flames Thursday afternoon and inhibited firefighters from containing the blaze, Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Rachel Carnahan said. By Friday afternoon it had burned about 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) with zero containment, and dark clouds of smoke settled over the Grand Canyon.

About 500 visitors who planned to stay in the park overnight were evacuated Thursday night, Grand Canyon spokesperson Joëlle Baird said. Employees and residents on the North Rim were told to shelter in place.

Melinda Rich, whose family owns the 102-year-old Jacob Lake Inn known for its homemade cookies, evacuated 75 employees Thursday and guests in about 35 cabins that were rented out at the time.

“It's tricky for us because we were half booked and now we have to refund all of those things, and that's a challenge financially for us,” she said. “But you also feel bad for the people who, this might be their first time at the canyon.”

Some guests had just checked in when the inn got a call from the sheriff's office saying everyone should leave immediately, Rich said. The staff began calling and emailing guests who were out exploring, she said.

Even as smoke rose around them, the evacuation felt precautionary because of the wind direction, Rich said. In 2020, a wildfire came within 20 feet (6 meters) of some cabins.

“We had one of those incredible, miraculous moments, a lot of prayers and then wind adjusted just enough that it passed us by about a mile,” she said.

A federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to halt indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties, including Los Angeles.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit last week, accusing President Donald Trump's administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. The plaintiffs include three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

The filing in the United States District Court asked a judge to block the administration from using what they call unconstitutional tactics in immigration raids. Immigrant advocates accuse immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that “any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE.”

McLaughlin said, “Enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence” before making arrests.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong also issued a separate order barring the federal government from restricting attorney access at a Los Angeles immigration detention facility.

Frimpong issued the orders the day after a hearing during which advocacy groups argued that the government violated the Constitution‘s Fourth and Fifth amendments.

Immigrants and Latino communities across Southern California have been on edge for weeks since the Trump administration stepped up arrests at car washes, Home Depot parking lots, immigration courts, and a range of businesses. Tens of thousands of people have participated in rallies in the region over the raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.

The order also applies to Ventura County, where busloads of workers were detained Thursday while the court hearing was underway after federal agents descended on a cannabis farm, leading to clashes with protesters and multiple injuries.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, the recent wave of immigration enforcement has been driven by an “arbitrary arrest quota” and based on “broad stereotypes based on race or ethnicity.”When detaining the three-day laborers who are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, all immigration agents knew about them was that they were Latino and dressed in construction work clothes, the filing said. It goes on to describe raids at swap meets and Home Depots, where witnesses say federal agents grabbed anyone who “looked Hispanic.”

ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said Brian Gavidia, one of the U.S. citizens detained, was “physically assaulted … for no other reason than he was Latino and working at a tow yard in a predominantly Latin American neighborhood.”

Tajsar asked why immigration agents detained everyone at a car wash except two white workers, according to a declaration by a car wash worker, if race wasn't involved.

Representing the government, attorney Sean Skedzielewski said there was no evidence that federal immigration agents considered race in their arrests, and that they only considered appearance as part of the “totality of the circumstances,” including prior surveillance and interactions with people in the field.

In some cases, they also operated off “targeted, individualized packages,” he said.

“The Department of Homeland Security has policy and training to ensure compliance with the Fourth Amendment,” Skedzielewski said.

Lawyers from Immigrant Defenders Law Center and other groups say their access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown LA known as “B-18” was denied on several occasions since June, according to court documents.

Lawyer Mark Rosenbaum said in one incident on June 7, attorneys “attempted to shout out basic rights” at a bus of people detained by immigration agents in downtown LA; however, the government drivers honked their horns to drown them out, and deployed chemical munitions akin to tear gas.

Skedzielewski said access was only restricted to “protect the employees and the detainees” during violent protests, and has since been restored.

Rosenbaum said lawyers were denied access even on days without any demonstrations nearby, and the people detained were also not given sufficient access to phones or informed that lawyers were available to them.

He said the facility lacks adequate food and beds, which he called “coercive” tactics for getting people to sign papers agreeing to leave the country before consulting an attorney.

Attorneys general for 18 Democratic states also filed briefs in support of the orders.U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were already barred from making warrantless arrests in a large swath of eastern California after a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in April.

Federal authorities announced charges against Sinaloa Cartel leaders during a press conference Tuesday.

One of the sons of notorious drug lord "El Chapo" pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court in Chicago to major drug charges and running the Sinaloa Cartel in his father's absence.

Ovidio Guzman Lopez, 35, admitted to running part of the Sinaloa Cartel, coordinating massive drug shipments, including fentanyl, heroin and cocaine into the U.S. and using violence to protect cartel operations, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.

His plea is part of a broader federal strategy, "Operation Take Back America," aimed at dismantling transnational criminal organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel. 

TRUMP ADMIN SANCTIONS EL CHAPO'S CHILDREN, VIOLENT FENTANYL-TRAFFICKING CARTEL ARM LOS CHAPITOS

"Today's guilty plea is another major step toward holding the Sinaloa Cartel and its leaders accountable for their role in fueling the fentanyl epidemic that has plagued so many Americans," U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said in a news release. 

"We remain committed to dismantling the Cartel's entire fentanyl infrastructure and ensuring that the Chapitos and their violent organization can no longer flood our communities with this poison."

Guzman Lopez admitted in the plea agreement that he coordinated the transportation of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs and precursor chemicals from Mexico to the United States border, at times in shipments of hundreds or thousands of kilograms, according to federal officials. He used a network of couriers affiliated with the cartel to smuggle the drugs into the United States, using vehicles, rail cars, tunnels, aircraft and other means, the plea agreement states.

After the drugs were distributed throughout the United States, officials said, individuals working for Guzman Lopez used bulk cash transport, wire transfers, trade of goods and cryptocurrency to launder the illicit proceeds and ensure that the money was transmitted to Guzman Lopez and other members of the cartel in Mexico. 

Guzman Lopez then admitted he and his cartel associates committed violent acts against law enforcement officials, civilians and rival drug traffickers to protect the cartel's drug-trafficking activities.

As part of the plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will also forfeit $80 million, though his sentencing date hasn't been set.

He is one of four brothers known as "The Chapitos," who took over after their father's arrest in 2016. 

Joaquin Guzman Lopez was arrested last year and is being held in the U.S. without bail. He pleaded not guilty and is waiting for his trial in Illinois.

Ivan Archivaldo Guzman Salazar and Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar are also facing charges in Illinois and New York. They have not been arrested yet, and warrants have been issued for their arrests.

Federal officials praised the guilty plea, saying "with each passing day, you are seeing the sunset of the Sinaloa Cartel." 

"The Chapitos' latest violence reflects their fading future. Their leaders who remain free are now paranoid, distrusted and desperate," U.S. Attorney Adam Gordon wrote. 

The U.S. State Department has issued rewards of up to $10 million for information leading to their arrests and convictions. 

"The guilty plea by Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of ‘El Chapo,' is a real victory for both the United States and Mexico but also a clear win for the rule of law," said Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations Arizona Ray Rede.

"So much blood and violence lay with the Guzman family as well as spreading terror and plaguing both sides of the border with deadly drugs and weapons — no more. It's impossible to measure the amount of work HSI and partner agencies have spent in securing this guilty verdict, but what is clear and evident is that no one is beyond the reach of law enforcement and our nation's laws. Deliberate and coordinated teamwork resulted in today's victory."

Ryan Routh, the second alleged would-be assassin of President Donald Trump, told the Florida judge presiding over his case on Friday that he wants to offer himself to Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea as part of a prisoner exchange with one of the foreign adversaries.

Routh's offer was shared in a letter he addressed to United States District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee.

“I had wished for a prisoner swap with Hamas, Iran for a female protester, or China for Jimmy Lai or one of the 40 others or to freeze to death in Siberia in exchange for a Ukrainian soldier so that I could die being of some use and save all this court mess, but no one acts,” he wrote to Cannon. “Perhaps you have the power to trade me away.”

Jimmy Lai is the jailed media tycoon and pro-democracy activist who protested Beijing's national security crackdown on Hong Kong in 2019. The “40 others” Routh is likely referring to are the 47 pro-democracy figures arrested by Beijing in 2021 for organizing an unofficial primary election in Hong Kong.

Routh says his part in a prisoner swap would make sense for Trump, whose administration has prioritized the release of people wrongfully imprisoned, including the Israeli captives held by Hamas.

“What an easy diplomatic victory for Trump to give an American he hates to China, Iran, or North Korea, or wherever, as a gesture of peace in exchange for an unjustly held democratic prisoner,” he wrote. “Everyone wins.”

Last September, the suspect failed to assassinate Trump while camping outside the then-candidate's golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The alleged gunman fled the scene after a Secret Service agent spotted him hiding in a bush along the property's fence.

Routh faces numerous federal charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty, in addition to state charges brought by the Florida attorney general.

In the letter, the defendant revealed that he fired his attorneys and wishes to represent himself in the case moving forward.

“It was ridiculous from the outset to consider a random stranger that knows nothing of who I am to speak for me. That was foolish and ignorant, and I am sorry,” he wrote, noting it was “a childish mistake.”

Judge Cannon held hearings on Thursday to assess Routh's decision to fire his attorneys. He swore under oath that he understood the implications of such a decision.

Until Cannon issues a ruling, his lawyers will remain on the case.

TRUMP ‘SATISFIED' WITH INVESTIGATION INTO BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: ‘HAD A BAD DAY'

Routh explained in the letter how he feels unsupported and ignored by his legal defense team and apologized to the judge for being a burden.

The 59-year-old defendant is scheduled to stand trial on Sept. 8. If convicted, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney reports on President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump's visit to Texas on ‘Special Report'.

A Texas man was arrested Thursday after allegedly making violent threats against President Donald Trump on Facebook ahead of the president's visit to Kerrville, according to federal officials.

Robert Herrera, 52, of San Antonio, was charged with making threats against the president and interstate threatening communications, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas. 

The alleged threats were posted on a local news outlet's Facebook page discussing Trump's upcoming visit to the Hill Country after deadly Fourth of July flooding. The outlet has not been publicly identified by law enforcement.

According to a Department of Justice release, Herrera, using the name "Robert Herrer," allegedly posted the phrase "I won't miss" beneath a photo of Trump surrounded by Secret Service agents after the July 2024 assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. 

When another user responded, "you won't get the chance, I promise," Herrera allegedly replied, "I'll just come for you," attaching a photo of himself holding what appeared to be a rifle and loaded magazines.

The posts have since been removed, and federal agents arrested Herrera later that day. If convicted, he faces up to five years in prison per charge. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Roomberg is prosecuting the case.

"While the FBI fully supports and defends every American's right to free speech, it is important to understand that threatening violence against any individual is not constitutionally protected speech, it is a federal crime," Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tapp of the FBI's San Antonio Field Office said in the release. 

"The FBI and our partners take threats of violence seriously, and we urge the public to do the same. We would like to thank the United States Secret Service, the San Antonio Police Department, the Texas Department of Public Safety and the United States Attorney's Office for their tremendous partnership in addressing this threat against the president. 

"We urge all members of the public to express their views peacefully and respectfully in a manner consistent with the values that define our nation."TEXAS SUSPECT WHO DAMAGED ICE VEHICLE, ‘AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED' AGENTS IS ARRESTED: POLICE

"I would like to thank the San Antonio Police Department and the FBI San Antonio Field Office for assisting the U.S. Secret Service in this matter," Special Agent in Charge Brian J. Gibson of the U.S. Secret Service San Antonio Field Office said in the release.

"Investigating threats towards individuals under Secret Service protection are treated as our highest priority. This is one of the countless reasons the Secret Service prides ourselves on forging and maintaining relationships with other law enforcement agencies. As this is an ongoing investigation, the Secret Service will have no further comment on this incident."

Trump and the first lady traveled to Kerrville Friday to survey flood damage and meet with first responders. In remarks on the ground, Trump said the federal government would provide "whatever relief Texas needs."

The arrest comes almost one year to the day after Trump survived an attempted assassination at a Pennsylvania rally. In that incident, a rooftop gunman fired at Trump from roughly 150 yards away, grazing his right ear and killing one attendee, Corey Comperatore, before Secret Service agents shot the attacker dead.

A local Kentucky school board chairman resigned after a social media post resurfaced of him allegedly calling to "shoot Republicans."

Jeffrey Miller, who had served as chairman of Erlanger-Elsmere Independent School District since 2016, resigned Thursday, the newly-elected chairperson, Sara Shackelford-Ross, announced.

Miller's social media post, reacting to a mass shooting that took place in Jacksonville, Florida in 2018, reportedly said, "i'd be ok with the NRA if these psychos were just once the victims of a mass shooting. WINK WINK: please shoot republicans."

Kentucky Republican state representative Steven Doan said the social media comment resurfaced after he received complaints from his constituents this spring.

"This began with a request that the school reopen a track at the High School. I made a post about it on my Facebook page to see where the community stood. This is when I began receiving social media messages from community members. They said that they wanted to publicly support me and my position, but they feared retaliation," Doan told Fox News Digital.

Doan revealed to Fox News Digital a text message from one of his constituents raising concerns about Miller's alleged social media post.

The text message read, "I cannot make it to the meeting tonight and I fear for my son's graduation if I post something public. I hope you know the kind of men Chad Molley and Jeffery Miller are for this meeting. The superintendent is allowing a board member to stay on the board after threatening mass shootings against Republicans by the NRA."

The text message read further, "Yes, he apologized but as a hush-hush, so kids could play football in 2020. It was a concession. Yes, it is old news, but as a public figure, he is, well should be, held to a higher standard, especially to affect children. I spoke with a member of the board already and was informed he has to not be elected again. I do not think enough people know what he did in 2020."

Doan wrote an op-ed calling for Miller's resignation in June after learning about Miller calling for "political violence." 

More backlash against Miller's social media post then ensued.

"I posted the op-ed and was informed of more comments. I was told by a friend at the County Clerk's office that she had received a phone call asking about the process of school board resignations specific to the Erlanger-Elsmere School Board just days after the op-ed," Doan told Fox News Digital.

When Miller officially resigned, Doan reacted to the news by posting on X, saying, "It took the entire community to remove this man, now we must find a replacement who will stand up for our children and community."

When Fox News Digital asked to confirm Miller's controversial social media post, Shackelford-Ross and Vice Chairperson Rachel B. Retherford declined to comment. Fox News Digital also reached out to Miller for comment.

The district, which serves nearly 2,400 students and eight schools in Kenton County, reportedly began a search to fill the vacancy for a new board member on Thursday.

"We are required to publicly post the vacancy for two weeks and accept applications. The remaining board members will then vote to appoint a new member within 60 days of the resignation," Retherford told Fox News Digital.

According to the Cincinnati Inquirer, the board said that "Miller publicly apologized for the social media comments years ago."

President Donald Trump on Friday empowered all federal law enforcement officers to immediately arrest any violent protesters attacking Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials or their vehicles.

“I am on my way back from Texas, and watched in disbelief as THUGS were violently throwing rocks and bricks at ICE Officers while they were moving down a roadway in their car and/or official vehicle,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

“Tremendous damage was done to these brand new vehicles. I know for a fact that these Officers are having a hard time with allowing this to happen in that it shows such total disrespect for LAW AND ORDER.”

Trump then directed Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Border Czar Tom Homan to grant ICE, DHS, or any law enforcement officer the authority to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS,” who are throwing objects at officers or otherwise targeting authorities.

“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public. I never want to see a car carrying a Law Enforcement Officer attacked again,” the president said, adding that authorization for arrest and incarceration of these individuals is immediately granted.

Trump has repeatedly defended ICE amid the intense backlash that immigration officers face from Democratic lawmakers and violent protesters.

Earlier this week, he slammed Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Alex Padilla (D-CA) for introducing a bill requiring law enforcement officers to display visible identification when engaged in immigration operations. ICE faces criticism for allowing its agents to wear masks, which the agency says protects their identities from getting doxxed.

“People are out there taking photos of their names, of their faces, and posting them online with death threats to their family and themselves,” acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in Boston last month. “So, I'm sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks, but I'm not going to let my officers and agents go out there, put their lives and put their family on the line because people don't like what immigration enforcement is.”

ICE has recently seen a 700% surge in assaults on its officers, as the Trump administration continues carrying out its mass deportation agenda against illegal immigrants.

On July 4, an armed group ambushed an ICE facility in Alvarado, Texas. The group defaced vehicles with anti-ICE graffiti and then shot one officer in the neck after luring officials out of the building.

DEMOCRATS CLASH WITH ICE OVER CHARACTERIZATION OF MARIJUANA FARM RAID

About 11 individuals were charged for their involvement in the attack. One suspect remains at large, while the others were arrested.

Friday's announcement comes after Trump visited central Texas to speak with state officials still reeling from the catastrophic flooding that killed more than 120 people, including at least 27 girls from Camp Mystic. More than 170 people remain missing amid federal and state response efforts.

As the Trump administration escalates its criticisms of the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell, the central bank is quietly pushing back with a new "Frequently Asked Questions" page on its website defending the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation project.

The page, last updated on Friday, directly responds to some of the administration's criticisms of the renovation project of the Fed's headquarters, which came under attack this week from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought.

Vought on Thursday claimed that Powell "has grossly mismanaged the Fed" and took aim at what he called "an ostentatious overhaul" of the Fed's renovations, which seeks to modernize the campus for the Federal Reserve, including by renovating three buildings overlooking the National Mall.

"It involves a complete overhaul and modernization that preserves two historic buildings that have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s," according to the Fed's website.

Vought's criticisms of the project, made via a letter posted on X, marked an escalation of the Trump administration's ongoing campaign against Powell. Trump has repeatedly claimed the central bank leader is playing politics by not lowering interest rates, and has called on Powell to resign.

The letter — and Vought's Friday pledge to pursue an investigation into the Fed's renovations — suggest that the Trump administration is moving to remove Powell before his term ends next year.

But Powell has repeatedly resisted Trump's criticisms and repeated attempts to pressure him to cut interest rates, the main sticking point in Trump's attacks.

The Fed's website defending the renovation project is the latest sign that the central bank is gearing up to fight against the Trump administration's newest attacks.

"No new VIP dining rooms are being constructed as part of the project," the FAQs page on the website says.

"Eccles has conference rooms, which are being renovated and preserved. They are also used for mealtime meetings," the post says of the building.

That line appears to be in direct response to Vought's letter, which claimed that the plans for renovations called "for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more."

The FAQ page outlines "the main reasons for cost increases over the course of the project," which has been a major line of attack for Trump allies.

The cost of the construction is estimated to be about $700 million over budget.

"Various factors have driven cost increases," the page on the Federal Reserve website says, citing "changes to original building designs as a result of consultation with review agencies" and "unforeseen conditions," such as "more asbestos than anticipated."

Taxpayers do not foot the bill for the cost of the renovations. The Fed is self-funded through interest it makes on securities held by the institution and through fees charged banks.

Vought on Friday pledged to pursue an investigation of the renovations, saying on CNBC, "We want to make sure we have facts as to the largesse and the extent to which it's overrun."

Vought's Friday comments are a continuation of his X post the day prior, in which he said: "While continuing to run a deficit since FY23 (the first time in the Fed's history), the Fed is way over budget on the renovation of its headquarters."

The page indicates it was last updated on July 11, but it's unclear when the page was added to the site.

Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon championship with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Amanda Anisimova on Saturday in the first women's final at the tournament in 114 years in which one player failed to claim a single game.

Swiatek's victory on a sunny, breezy afternoon at Centre Court took just 57 minutes and gave Swiatek her sixth Grand Slam title overall. She is now 6-0 in major title matches.

The 24-year-old from Poland finished with a 55-24 edge in total points and accumulated that despite needing to produce merely 10 winners. Anisimova was shaky from the start and made 28 unforced errors.

Swiatek already owned four trophies from the French Open's red clay and one from the U.S. Open's hard courts, but this is first title of her professional career at any grass-court tournament. And it ended a long-for-her drought: Swiatek last won a trophy anywhere more than a year ago, at Roland-Garros in June 2024.

Kate, the Princess of Wales, was sitting in the Royal Box on Saturday and took part in the on-court ceremony afterward.

Swiatek is the eighth consecutive first-time women's champion at Wimbledon, but her triumph stands out from the others because it came in a stunningly dominant performance against Anisimova, a 23-year-old American who was participating in her first final at a major.

Anisimova eliminated No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals but never looked like she was the same player on Saturday. Not at all. When it was over, while Swiatek climbed into the stands to celebrate with her team, Anisimova sat on the sideline in tears.

All the way back in 1911, Dorothea Lambert Chambers was a 6-0, 6-0 winner against Dora Boothby.

Swiatek never had been past the quarterfinals of the All England Club and her only other final on the slick surface came when she was the runner-up at a tuneup event in Germany right before Wimbledon began.

Swiatek spent most of 2022, 2023 and 2024 at No. 1 in the WTA rankings but was seeded No. 8 at Wimbledon after going more than a year without claiming a title anywhere. She served a one-month doping ban last year after failing an out-of-competition drug test; an investigation determined she was inadvertently exposed to a contaminated medical product used for trouble sleeping and jet lag.

Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Florida, was a semifinalist at age 17 at the 2019 French Open.

She took time away from the tour a little more than two years ago because of burnout. A year ago, she tried to qualify for Wimbledon, because her ranking of 189th was too low to get into the field automatically, but lost in the preliminary event.

Anisimova will break into the top 10 in the rankings for the first time next week.

European Union leaders are sounding off on the 30% tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose on the trade bloc, with most emphasizing the need for unity, constructive dialogue and their readiness to work toward an agreement by Aug. 1.

"Imposing 30% tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic," Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a statement. "The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership."

Some leaders were more critical of Trump's latest move. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said it's "concerning and not the way forward" in a post on X. Pedro Sánchez, prime minister of Spain, also took to X, calling the duties "unjustified." Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson noted that the EU "is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary," while emphasizing that it would be best to avoid such a move.

On Saturday morning, Trump announced the 30% tariff rates in letters to von der Leyen and Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, posted on his Truth Social account. The U.S. president warned that if the EU or Mexico retaliate with higher tariffs, "then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added on to the 30% that we charge."

Trump also said there would not be tariffs on goods from Europe "or companies within the EU" that build or manufacture products in the U.S. This week, Trump sent similar letters to 23 other U.S. trading partners, including Canada, Japan and Brazil, setting blanket tariff rates ranging from 20% up to 50%.

Here's how European leaders have reacted to the latest salvo in Trump's trade skirmish:

Von der Leyen's statement emphasized the EU's commitment to dialogue and stability:

"We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.

Meanwhile, we continue to deepen our global partnerships, firmly anchored in the principles of rules-based international trade."

The Dutch Prime Minister said in an X post:

"The US announcement of 30% tariffs on goods imported from the European Union is concerning and not the way forward. The European Commission can count on our full support. As the EU we must remain united and resolute in pursuing an outcome with the United States that is mutually beneficial."

Kristersson said on X that the EU would be ready to impose countermeasures, but emphasized the need to avoid that.

"We support the EU Commission's desire to continue seeking a negotiated solution. The EU is prepared to respond with tough countermeasures if necessary. However, everyone loses in an escalated trade conflict, and it is US consumers who will pay the highest price. Sweden stands up for free trade and international cooperation."

The French President echoed the possibility of employing countermeasures if no agreement is reached by August, in a post on X.

"With the President of the European Commission, France shares a very strong disapproval regarding the announcement of horizontal customs duties of 30% targeting European Union exports to the United States, effective from August 1.

In European unity, it is more crucial than ever for the Commission to assert the Union's determination to resolutely defend European interests. This notably involves accelerating the preparation of credible countermeasures, by mobilizing all available instruments, including the anti-coercion mechanism, if no agreement is reached by August 1.

On this basis, France fully supports the European Commission in the intensifying negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable agreement by August 1, so that it reflects the respect owed between commercial partners like the European Union and the United States, with shared interests and integrated value chains.

Trump's letter is "both impertinent and a slap in the face," Lange said on X. "We've been negotiating intensely for more than three weeks - made offers to improve things in mutual interest. Real willingness to negotiate looks different."

"Period of waiting is over: We've postponed the first stage of countermeasures. Firmly convinced they should come into force as planned on Monday, quickly followed by the second list. Activation of rebalancing measures to be discussed.

The Italian government said in a statement:

"We trust in the goodwill of all stakeholders to reach a fair agreement that can strengthen the West as a whole, given that—particularly in the current environment—it would make no sense to trigger a trade dispute between the two sides of the Atlantic. It is now essential to remain focused on the negotiations, avoiding polarization that would make reaching an agreement more difficult."

"Economic openness and trade create prosperity. Unjustified tariffs destroy it," Sánchez said in an X post. "That is why we support and will continue to support the Commission in its negotiations to reach an agreement with the US before August 1. United, Europeans form the world's largest trading bloc. Let us use that strength to achieve a fair agreement."

"The EU and US enjoy the biggest trade and investment relationship in the world. When issues arise between us, they should be resolved by close and respectful dialogue ... While it has been clear that all options remain on the table, the EU has also been clear that our preference is for a negotiated solution that avoids escalation. That remains the case."

With the U.S. economy solid but still facing elevated risk of recession — or, as President Trump described it in May, in a "transition period" — states are pitching themselves as the most stable place for companies to locate no matter what happens to the economy.

"Multiple international headquarters, hundreds of billions of committed investments across a variety of industries and the economy to handle it all," the Indiana Economic Development Corporation promises. 

"Georgia job creation remains strong," that state's Department of Economic Development assures. "The State of Georgia is celebrating another year of sustained momentum for business recruitment and expansions."

"Wisconsin is one of the most fiscally responsible states in the nation," the state's Economic Development Corporation says.

A CNBC analysis of all 50 state economic development websites finds that the economy — and factors relating to it such as job growth, foreign direct investment and the housing market — are the most frequently mentioned selling point this year. Economy popped up 222 times in our tally, well ahead of the next most mentioned factor, infrastructure, at 203. Under the methodology for CNBC's annual business competitiveness study, America's Top States for Business, that makes Economy the heaviest weighted category in 2025.

But measuring state economies is more challenging than usual this year. Sweeping federal budget cuts are threatening to throw sand in the gears of an economic engine in many states. And tariffs — so far, a wildly moving target — are already crimping the economies of states that depend on international commerce.

"If you don't know what your product is going to cost, if you don't know if your export market is going to be there in six months, if you don't understand the terms that you're trading on, it makes it really hard to say, 'Okay, we're gonna take a risk and invest in this new product line'," said Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a Washington, D.C.-based economic data firm.

To score each state's economy in this year's Top States for Business study, we considered traditional measures such as state gross domestic product growth, job growth, state fiscal health, the number of major corporations headquartered in each state, and the strength of the local housing market. But we also considered how dependent each state is on a shrinking federal government for spending and hiring. And we considered each state's exposure to a trade war, using data compiled for us by Trade Partnership Worldwide.

"The big things that we start out looking at is just really exposure to international trade, and particularly the goods trades," Anthony said.

In addition, the data looks specifically at states' exposure to China, which is at the heart of the trade war.

Some states are particularly vulnerable should the economy take a turn for the worse. But these states have what it takes to navigate a recession.

While The Palmetto State is among the states most vulnerable to increased tariffs — international goods trade made up one-third of its GDP last year — South Carolina enters this unsettled period with one of the fastest growing economies in the nation, and some of the best job growth. Notably, that job growth is not occurring in the manufacturing sector, including the auto industry, where tariff increases could hit hard. Instead, the state's biggest job growth is in construction, where employment rose more than 7% year-over-year in April, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Federal revenue made up about 33% of the state budget last year, roughly in line with the national average.

The Peach State's diverse economy will come in handy should the national economy worsen. Seventeen companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 are headquartered in Georgia, and while the home of the Port of Savannah is heavily dependent on international trade, there is plenty of other business to take up the slack in a slowdown. Georgia entered 2025 with solid economic growth, though job growth dropped off considerably. Hiring in most sectors, except for health care, has leveled off, or, in some cases, declined.

The Beehive State's economy was buzzing last year — leading the nation in GDP growth, and near the top for job growth. Utah's tech sector is a major driver, but some of the biggest job gains occurred in construction as the state tries to get ahead of a severe housing shortage. 

For years, landlocked Utah has been pursuing the concept of an "inland port" to better link its dynamic economy to the rest of the world. The idea has morphed from a single, giant facility to 13 smaller ones around the state, but now, Utah's embrace of international trade could backfire on the state's economy. Utah's international goods trade makes up nearly 17% of state GDP. And Trade Partnership Worldwide estimates that retaliatory tariffs from other countries could increase Utah business costs by up to 30%.

The Gem State's economy continues to dazzle, with solid growth last year. The state's housing market, which has been on a bit of a roller coaster ride in recent years, has stabilized nicely for now, and new home construction is taking off. Idaho is also relatively insulated from tariffs, with limited international trade and tiny exposure to China. But Idaho depends on the federal government for a comparatively large share of state spending. In February, Republican Gov. Brad Little warned of a potential "economic shock" from the Trump budget cuts, but said Idaho had the wherewithal to withstand it.

The Evergreen State is fertile ground for entrepreneurs. A new business starting up in Washington stands a better chance of survival than in any other state, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by Simply Business, a national insurance marketplace. Researchers found that businesses in the state stand an 86.4% chance of surviving their first year, 89.3% in their second year, and 91.8% in their third year. The broader economy in Washington was in the top five for growth last year, though job growth has slowed since the beginning of this year. The state is relatively well insulated from federal budget cuts, but it would be on the front lines of a trade war with China. With China accounting for more than 16% of Washington's international goods trade, it is the fourth most exposed state.

The size and scope of the Empire State's economy should help to insulate it somewhat from the impacts of tariffs and federal budget cuts. Only California is home to more major corporations than New York. But federal funding does account for a relatively large portion of the state budget. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul said in April that Trump budget cuts could impact some $1.3 billion in federal funding to the state, and warned that tariffs could result in 280,000 lost jobs. Those impacts would be significant, but all is relative in a state with a general fund budget of more than $110 billion, and a workforce of nearly 10 million. Only about 53,000 of those employees — less than half of one percent — work for the federal government.

While growth in The First State was moribund last year, Delaware's economic foundation is sound, and well-insulated from the upheaval coming from Washington. The state does have some exposure to international trade, but only a small portion of that — about 8% — is with China. The state is among the least dependent on the federal government, which accounts for just a quarter of state spending and about 0.8% of the workforce. Delaware has lost some of its allure as a place to incorporate, following court decisions seen as unfriendly to business — like the one last year voiding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's compensation package. But it was still the second most popular state in which to start a business last year, after Wyoming.

Year after year, The Tar Heel State turns in solid growth, and last year was no exception. It is a major reason that North Carolina is CNBC's Top State for Business overall in 2025. North Carolina's housing market, while suffering shortages exacerbated by last year's Hurricane Helene, nonetheless does reasonably well on affordability, according to data from the National Association of Homebuilders. The state is somewhat sheltered from federal budget cuts — federal employees make up just 1% of the workforce. But tariffs are a concern in a state that relies heavily on international trade.

They say everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes the economy — the second biggest state economy after California. That should be especially helpful in these tumultuous times. While The Lone Star State is heavily reliant on the federal government in its budget, federal employees make up less than 1% of the state's vast workforce. And while international goods trade is an important part of the Texas economy, only a small percentage of that trade, about 6%, is with China. The state enters these tumultuous times with solid finances, and a wealth of foreign direct investment.

The Sunshine State tops CNBC's Economy rankings for a third consecutive year in 2025. Economic growth and job growth remain solidly in the top ten, state finances are strong, and the state is a leader in new business formations. Florida is a major player in international trade, but it comprises a relatively small percentage of the state's overall economy. And only a small percentage of that international trade is with China, leaving the state in a better position than many when it comes to tariffs. Florida depends on the federal government for about 34% of its budget — and roughly two-thirds of its $34 billion Medicaid budget. That has Floridians keeping a wary eye on Washington.

2025 Economy Score: 363 out of 445 Points (Top States Grade: A+)

Powell has resisted pressure to ease monetary policy and said he won't step down if asked by the president, given the Fed's independence.

President Donald Trump's potential dismissal of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is a major and underpriced risk that could trigger a selloff in the US dollar and Treasuries, a Deutsche Bank AG strategist said.

Trump this week said Powell should “resign immediately,” if allegations from an administration official that the central banker misled lawmakers over renovations to the Fed's headquarters prove true. The remark added to growing criticism of the Fed chair by Trump, who has demanded aggressive interest rate cuts and signaled he may nominate a successor before Powell's term ends.

xAI has apologized for Grok's "horrific behavior" and said that new instructions caused the AI chatbot to prioritize engagement, even if that meant reflecting "extremist views" from user posts on X.

Elon Musk's AI company said in a Saturday X post, using the official Grok account, that it had removed the "deprecated" code and "refactored the entire system to prevent further abuse."

On Saturday morning, Musk reposted the statement on his X account.

During a 16-hour rant starting at about 11 p.m. Pacific Time on July 7, Grok made inflammatory comments on X that included antisemitic jokes and praising Adolf Hitler.

Grok is integrated into X so that users can interact with the chatbot by tagging it. xAI said it disabled that functionality on July 8 "due to increased abusive usage" of Grok.

Inside xAI, workers training Grok have expressed anger and disillusionment with the chatbot's behavior, Business Insider exclusively reported Friday.

xAI said in its Saturday post that the code update was "independent of the underlying language model that powers @grok," and that no other services relying on the large language model underpinning Grok were affected.

​​xAI said its investigation found the following new instructions for Grok caused the "undesired behavior":

The update caused Grok to prioritize engaging replies, even if they contained "unethical or controversial opinions," xAI said.

The instructions meant Grok followed the "tone and context" of the X post in which it was tagged. So, if a user tagged Grok in an X post talking about Hitler, the chatbot would mimic that.

Grok's inflammatory posts came days before xAI launched the next version of the chatbot, Grok 4, which touts improved reasoning abilities.

The latest version of the AI chatbot has a favorite source on some hot-topic issues. When asked about immigration and conflict in the Middle East, it cited Musk's views, tests by BI confirmed.

On Thursday, Musk said Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles "very soon."

xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Across his numerous companies, Musk is not one to shy away from risk-taking — even when failure could mean a publicity nightmare.

With xAI, Musk has deployed Grok directly into X, where users can summon it to respond at any time. It means that, unlike rivals such as OpenAI, where user interactions largely stay private, xAI's behavior — good or bad — is in full view of the world.

The AI company also shares Grok's system prompt publicly on the code repository GitHub. It's a level of openness not shared by many of xAI's competitors, but also exposes it to greater scrutiny when things go wrong.

Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, took a distinctly different approach on Friday, announcing that his company would delay the launch of open-weight models — systems where certain parameters are public — to run additional safety tests.

Many couples see intimacy as a "nice to have" in relationships. It's sweet when it's there, but not essential. This is especially true after the honeymoon period wears off. As a sex therapist and psychotherapist with over two decades of experience, I'm here to tell you that's wrong.

Intimacy is the heartbeat of a thriving relationship. When intimacy breaks down, it doesn't just affect your connection with a partner, it can impact your career, friendships, and physical health. It influences how you lead, communicate, make decisions, and feel about yourself. Clients often come to therapy for stress, anxiety, or performance issues at work, only for us to uncover intimacy gaps as the deeper source of misalignment. 

Intimacy, to bust another myth, is more than just getting laid or knowing the right positions. It's about being open, honest, vulnerable, and real and allowing someone else to be the same with you.

Many of the biggest intimacy blockers are hiding in plain sight. Here are four surprising things that quietly kill intimacy — and what to do about them:

It's tough to connect with someone when your brain is having a love affair with your phone. Even quick glances at notifications can break the emotional flow and send the message: "I'm not fully here."

Ask your partner how they feel when one or both of you are on your phone, laptop, iPad, or other screens. How does it affect your connection? You might be surprised by how much it matters.

Come up with a few simple boundaries together. It could be as simple as designating screen-free zones, like the bedroom and couch, or at specific times, like during meals or before bed. 

I know it may feel like a punishment but I promise it's not! Being present is the foundation of true intimacy. 

Whether you're comparing someone new to your ex or haven't fully processed the end of a past relationship, that lingering attachment can leave little room for connecting with anyone else.

Take an honest look at yourself. Are you still mentally or emotionally entangled with your ex? Closure isn't about forgetting them, it's about reclaiming your energy.

Be kind and give yourself permission to grieve what was lost and reflect on what that relationship taught you. Journal your uncensored thoughts, talk it out with a therapist, or (my old favorite) write a letter to your ex that you won't send. 

If you're holding on to physical reminders such as texts, photos, or gifts, consider letting them go to create space for what's next.

The goal here is to notice how often they're taking up mental real estate, and to practice gently redirecting your focus to what is happening in the here and now. That includes your needs, your growth, and the person in front of you.

You tell yourself they're not interested. You assume you're too much or not enough. Meanwhile, they might be having the same doubts.

These protective thoughts are normal, but unhelpful and may be a little distorted. They can cause us to self-reject before giving intimacy a chance.

Start by noticing the thought. When something negative pops up, ask yourself: 

Just because a thought feels true doesn't mean it is, even if those suckers can be very convincing! One of the most powerful tools from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is learning to evaluate your thoughts instead of accepting them at face value.

Then try reframing. Ask yourself: 

For example, instead of, "They're probably not into me," the reframe might be: "I'm not sure how they feel yet, and I don't have to figure it out all at once. I can be present and see where this goes."

In sex therapy, we use the dual control model: Every person has "accelerators," or things that turn them on, and "brakes," which are things that shut them down. 

For some people, stress ramps up desire. For others, it's a full stop. If you fall into the latter group, stress from anywhere in your life — your job, a parent's illness, an unexpected bill — might be getting in the way. 

Track your patterns. Do you feel more open or closed off when stressed? Understanding your unique wiring, you can talk to your partner about it in a way that brings you closer.

Try something like: "I've noticed that when I'm overwhelmed, I need to feel supported before I can feel connected. I'm not rejecting you. I'm just maxed out. Helping with dinner or giving me time to reset really helps."

You might want to cuddle on the couch, take a walk, or talk about what's on your mind. Intimacy is more than just sex. Small moments of closeness count.

Be curious about your partner's accelerators and brakes, too. Ask what helps them feel connected, supported, and seen. These conversations don't have to be perfect. They just need to be honest. That kind of exchange is intimacy in action.

In this article

To offset the rising costs of tariffs and trade war uncertainty, companies are using U.S. Customs-sanctioned foreign trade zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce product taxes.

FTZs have a long history dating back to a previous period of trade conflict, created during the Great Depression by Congress to encourage international trade and boost exports at time when the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were as high as 53%.

Companies importing raw materials, semi-finished, or components from foreign countries to an FTZ or bonded warehouse are essentially in a tariff bubble, meaning when they enter the U.S. they are stored duty-free.

Once inside an FTZ, a product can be assembled or modified. Duties are only collected after a product leaves the zone and enters U.S. commerce. Products can be stored in an FTZ indefinitely. Bonded warehouses have a limit of up to five years.

There are FTZs in all 50 states and there are approximately 2,240 FTZs in all across the nation, according to U.S. Customs.

For companies caught in the crossfire of Trump's trade war, preserving cash is king.

By delaying duty payments, "FTZs and bonded warehouses essentially frees up a company's cash flow," said Jason Strickland, director of sales at logistics firm Givens. "There is also the added benefit that if a product is manufactured in an FTZ and is re-exported abroad, no duty payments are incurred at all."

Before the 2025 global trade war, companies that manufactured products in an FTZ had what is known as an "inverted tariff" benefit. That means the company had the option of paying a lower duty rate on the finished product versus paying the higher duties on the individual components brought into the manufacturing process.

Companies that have operated inside FTZs include automakers Ford, GM and Chrysler, as well as General Electric, Intel and Sony. According to the World Free Zones Organization, FTZs were also used by Pfizer while it was developing the Covid vaccine. The program enabled Pfizer to produce shots without incurring additional duties on the drugs' components and store the vaccine until it received FDA approval.

But President Trump ended that rule by way of recent executive orders, and for companies like Regent Tek Industries, which manufactures liquid road markings used by road crews to make the lines on the nation's roads, byways, and highways, that's become a big problem, resulting in millions of dollars in extra tariffs.

"Our product is basically like baking a cake," said Helen Torkos, president of Regent Tek. "If you're missing one ingredient, you can't make that cake. We cannot source all of our components here. We are paying around 7% more now because the inverted tariff option is no longer available to us."

Without the benefit of the FTZ inverted tariff, many companies quickly shifted to bonded warehouses. Strickland described the demand to CNBC as being through the roof.

Companies can import products in a bubble under a higher tariff rate, and store without paying duties. But unlike the locking in of tariff rates on FTZs, if the tariff drops while a product is in a bonded warehouse, the company can release their product and pay the lower tariff rate.

"At the end of the day, the goal is to protect your cash flow," Strickland said. "You don't want to bring in all your goods and spend your cash flow against tariffs that may not be here in, you know, six weeks, six months, if you can defer until the market is ready to consume those goods. I think that's a win-win."

The Trump Organization — U.S. President Donald Trump's family business — will team up with Romanian real estate developer SDC Imobiliare to build a tower block with luxury apartments in the capital Bucharest, the companies said.

"Trump Tower Bucharest will be developed in the heart of Romania's capital, one of Europe's most vibrant and dynamic emerging markets, bringing premium residences under the Trump brand to the region," the companies said in a statement.

They did not specify the location or start date for work on the tower block, which is being branded as luxury residential apartments in Romania, the region's second-biggest economy.

Romania's economy stalled in the first quarter amid a drawn-out political crisis and worries about a potential downturn, underperforming most of its peers in central and eastern Europe.

Romania, a European Union and NATO member state, has found itself at the center of a dispute between Europe and the Trump administration over democratic principles after the constitutional court in December cancelled an ongoing presidential vote due to suspicions of Russian meddling, denied by Moscow. U.S. Vice President JD Vance has said Romania's decision to cancel the election in which a far-right, pro-Russian candidate was the frontrunner based on what he called "flimsy evidence" meant Bucharest did not share American values.

The country re-ran its presidential ballot in May and centrist President Nicusor Dan won, with Trump later congratulating him on his victory.

For many students, majoring in finance is a proven pathway to a well-paying career and job security.

In fact, U.S. graduates believe that finance offers the best career prospects overall, considering today's economic climate, according to a new survey by the CFA Institute, a non-profit focused on financial education. The group polled more than 9,000 current college students and recent graduates between the ages of 18 and 25.

While confidence about career prospects in finance increased over the past year, confidence decreased in other areas including STEM and healthcare, the CFA Institute also found.

However, finance ranks well behind many other majors when it comes to employment opportunities after college, other data shows.

"For me, a career in finance represents a pivot to stability," said Rafael Perez, 29, who is pursuing a Master of Science degree in finance at California State University in Sacramento. "I've been a creative my entire life, so discovering my affinity for finance was a relief in a sense." 

Perez says he still experiences some pushback from his peers. "When I tell people I'm getting an MS in finance, they often jokingly call me a 'finance bro,'" he said. "Despite the negative connotations of the phrase, it also reflects an expectation of financial success and prestige."

Students and their families are paying more attention to which college majors are most likely to pay off, and are putting greater emphasis on a degree's return on investment, according to Peter Watkins, CFA Institute's senior director of university programs. "There's an awareness from students that they have to make sure the degrees will make them work-ready," he said.

As young adults enter the real world, they are facing an increasingly tight labor market.

According to a recent analysis of labor market conditions for recent college graduates by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, job opportunities "deteriorated noticeably in the first quarter of 2025." Among this group, the unemployment rate jumped to 5.8% — the highest reading since 2021.

Although finance majors had higher salaries compared to most other majors, grads with nutrition, art history and philosophy degrees all outperformed both finance and STEM fields when it comes to employment prospects, the New York Fed found.

For finance and computer science, the unemployment rate in those fields was 3.7% and 6.1%, respectively. By comparison, the unemployment rate for art history majors was 3%, and for nutritional sciences, the unemployment rate was just 0.4%, the New York Fed found.

After notching significant gains since 2020, the rise of computer science majors came to a near standstill this year, other reports show, fueled by concerns that artificial intelligence is rapidly taking over jobs in the field.

Economics majors also fared worse than majors such as theology and philosophy when it came to the employment rates for recent college graduates, according to the New York Fed. Philosophy majors have an unemployment rate of 3.2%, for example, and for economics, it's 4.9%.

The New York Fed's report was based on Census data from 2023 and unemployment rates of recent college graduates.

The disconnect between the New York Fed's outcomes by major and the CFA survey findings — which is based on perceptions — is likely due in part to societal expectations, particularly from parents, Watkins said. "It may possibly be parental guidance, as in, 'go for business,'" he said.

Meanwhile, demand for humanities majors is on the rise, and with good reason.

At a conference last year, Robert Goldstein, the chief operating officer of BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, said the firm was adjusting its hiring strategy for recent grads. "We have more and more conviction that we need people who majored in history, in English, and things that have nothing to do with finance or technology," Goldstein said.

This demand for liberal arts degrees is fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence, which drives the need for creative thinking and so-called soft skills. 

"It's a bit of a gold rush in AI, people who are adopting quickly are going to succeed quickly," Watkins said.

Elon Musk hasn't only made his mark on the federal government — he's making himself known in local Texas bureaucracy, too.

Residents in southern Texas voted to incorporate the area around a SpaceX complex as the city of "Starbase" in May 2025. The city is designed around the Starship rocket, which Musk hopes will eventually bring humans to Mars. Company employees and their families make up nearly all of the 500 residents.

Here's everything to know about Starbase's founding, leadership and population, and controversy.

In the late 2010s, Musk decided that Texas was a friendlier place to do business than California, and by 2020 started moving some company headquarters to the Lone Star State. SpaceX bought land to manufacture and test Starship rockets in 2012 near Boca Chica Village, a remote coastal area close to the border with Mexico. At the time, there were about 30 homes there. The company announced it had chosen the site for its Starship program in 2014.

The rocket company needed to make room for Starbase, its new rocket launch site, and tried to buy out the locals. SpaceX told some residents it was "not safe" to live there. Some packed up, some stayed, all while SpaceX employees moved into the area.

SpaceX first floated the idea of incorporating Starbase as a city to officials in Cameron County, Texas, in 2021. In December 2024, the company submitted a petition to local authorities asking for an election to incorporate the launch site as a city.

Less than a year later, that election came to pass. On May 3, 2025, residents around the SpaceX complex voted almost unanimously to incorporate the area as the city of Starbase. The final tally came out to 212 votes in favor to 6 against, according to county election data.

Now, around 500 people live in Starbase, most of whom are families of the about 260 SpaceX employees who are residents. Musk has a home in Starbase. In 2021, he said on X that his primary residence is a "~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX." He is also registered to vote in the area and posted a picture of himself voting in Cameron County ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Most of the more than 3,000 people who work out of Starbase commute each day in and drive past a nine-foot golden bust of Musk on their way into the facility.

Starbase's elected officials are all current or former SpaceX staff. Bobby Peden ran unopposed for mayor and got 216 votes. He has been at SpaceX for more than 12 years and is currently the "VP - Texas Test & Launch," according to his LinkedIn.

Jordan Buss and Jenna Petrzelka are commissioners. They serve as SpaceX's senior director of environmental health and safety and former operations engineering manager, respectively. According to the city's website, Buss joined SpaceX in 2023, and Petrzelka in 2012.

The city is only about 1.5 square miles. A housing shortage is proving to be an issue for SpaceX, as hundreds of workers are trying to move into the area to work on the company's Starship program. Texas State Highway 4 is the only road that runs to and through Starbase, according to a map of the city on Cameron County's website.

The Starbase city commission now controls zoning rules and building permits that were previously controlled by Cameron County. The city's website includes links to city commission meetings.

Starbase is, according to Space's website, where "development, manufacturing, testing, and launch of SpaceX's Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket — collectively referred to as Starship — takes place."

In a letter to residents posted on the site on June 23, 2025, the city commissioners said they had approved more than 100 residential and commercial building permits and designated May 29 as Starbase Day.

Incorporating Starbase hasn't been without controversy.

Some environmentalists have raised concerns about potential pollution from launches and explosions impacting nearby water systems and wildlife. Lawmakers denied SpaceX the ability to control parts of Boca Chica Beach and Highway 4 for rocket launches in late April of 2025. Yet in early June, lawmakers ultimately granted Starbase and its SpaceX-aligned leaders that power.

The South Texas Environmental Justice Network, an activist group, has protested, saying that the Boca Chica Beach is "for the people, not Elon Musk to control." Generations of Texans, the group said, have come to the area for fishing, swimming, and other outdoor activities.

Starbase's website includes a section about beach and road closures.

Cracker Barrel's turnaround effort is in full swing.

A year ago, CEO Julie Masino said that the restaurant chain was "not as relevant as we once were." Since then, Masino and other Cracker Barrel executives have outlined plans for big changes at the chain's locations, from refreshed decor to new menu items.

After Masino's "relevant" comment last year, I visited a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Northern Virginia to see what she was talking about. Back then, I found the food underwhelming, from middling fried chicken to disappointing biscuits and gravy.

My story about that visit prompted many reader responses, including a few dozen messages from people who said they loved the food and old-timey decor. A few others, including some Cracker Barrel fans who had been going to the chain for decades, said that they had noticed the food quality slip in recent years.

One year later, Cracker Barrel has introduced several new menu items, so I decided it was time to go back and see if any of them were better than what I ordered last time. Here's what I found:

Like many Cracker Barrel restaurants, this one is located near multiple major highways and freeways, including some leading into and out of Washington, DC. It's the same location I visited last year.

Cracker Barrel has said it's renovated a fraction of its 660 locations. These reset stores still feature antiques and other objects meant to provide a sense of nostalgia, but with a brighter paint job and a little less clutter.

When I visited in early July, none of the stores near where I live in Washington, DC, had been renovated.

Cracker Barrel said in June that higher costs from tariffs would hit results from its gift shop sales. About one-third of the stuff the chain sells in its shops comes from China. Tariffs have also influenced how early the chain is bringing in some seasonal merchandise this year, CEO Masino said.

While I've gotten used to seeing fall and winter decorations at stores in summer, these Halloween items seemed especially early, given that I was visiting Cracker Barrel during the first full week of July.

The restaurant seemed a little less than half full when I stopped by at 9:30 a.m. on a Tuesday.

Cracker Barrel's menu highlighted several new or limited-time items. A card on the table, for instance, advertised a S'mores Latte, Cinnamon Roll Skillet, and S'mores Brownie Skillet, which are part of the summer Campfire Menu.

After looking over the menu, I settled on a few new menu items: The S'mores Latte, a Cinnamon Roll Skillet, a Signature Pancake Plate with Blueberry Pancakes, and a Campfire Meal with Beef.

The latte came generously topped with whipped cream — notice the cream dripping down the sides of the mug — and graham cracker crumbs.

The whipped cream topping was sweet — a little too sweet for my taste. Once I worked my way through all that whipped cream, the underlying coffee wasn't nearly as sweet.

I wish that the flavor had been more consistent and less sweet throughout the entire drink.

The skillet came with six cinnamon rolls. With the cast-iron skillet and faux-gingham paper, Cracker Barrel seemed to be trying to make it feel homemade.

The cinnamon rolls tasted a lot like store-bought ones you can buy in the refrigerated section of a grocery store, and make yourself at home.

About 10 minutes after I ordered, my blueberry pancakes arrived with syrup on the side, three strips of bacon, and two eggs.

Cracker Barrel started serving these pancake platters earlier this year.

I don't know for sure whether these pancakes were made with fresh buttermilk, but they sure tasted like it. The syrup, unlike a lot of pancake syrups, tasted more fruity than sweet. I would order these again in a heartbeat.

Around 30 minutes after I sat down, my server came over with a check and asked me if I was ready to pay or if I wanted something else. After looking at the menu again, I decided to try Cracker Barrel's biscuits, which had been a low point of my previous visit.

The biscuits showed up about five minutes later in a to-go bag, even though I hadn't asked for them to go.

Overall, it felt like my server wanted me to pay and leave as soon as possible. I thought that was odd, given that the restaurant wasn't that busy and there were plenty of open tables for anyone who walked in.

The biscuits were warm out of the bag, which raised my hopes that they would be better than on my last visit. On that occasion, they were served room temperature and alongside gravy that tasted like it was out of a can.

Sadly, these biscuits were no better than the last ones. They had a slightly sour taste, and after a couple of bites, I had had enough.

Making biscuits at scale in a commercial kitchen isn't the same as making them at home. Yet, given how foundational biscuits are to Southern cooking, I wondered why Cracker Barrel couldn't make better ones.

As I finished my breakfast dishes, it was nearly 11 a.m. That's when Cracker Barrel started serving some lunch and dinner items, including the Campfire Meals. At the location I visited, the Campfire options included either chicken or beef served with slow-cooked potatoes and vegetables in a foil-lined dish.

The Campfire Meals intrigued me because Cracker Barrel hasn't served them since 2018 and recently brought them back as a limited-time offer. "We heard loud and clear for both guests and employees that they deeply missed these unique and delicious foil-wrapped meals," Masino said on the company's latest earnings call in June.

Given the hype, I figured I had to try one.

After paying for my sit-down meal, I ordered a Campfire Meal with beef for pick-up. It took about 15 minutes for my meal to be ready. It came with the meat and vegetables wrapped in aluminum foil, as well as two small pieces of cornbread in a separate paper bag.

The beef and vegetables were tender. Of anything I've ever eaten at Cracker Barrel, this meal tasted the most like home cooking.

Some longtime Cracker Barrel fans told me last year that the chain should bring back some discontinued items to increase sales. Cracker Barrel's return of the Campfire Meals — for the summer, at least — suggests that they are listening to customers.

This cornbread came warm, and it was clearly buttery when I took it out of the bag. But it needed a little more flavor — it wasn't particularly sweet or salty. Soaking it in the meal's beef juices helped.

In my opinion, Cracker Barrel's new menu items are better than some of the staples that I tried one year ago. The pancakes, in particular, were a standout, and the Campfire Meal was a nice alternative to the usual fried or sweet fare you find at many restaurants.

There were also items that still needed work, including the biscuits.

Cracker Barrel is definitely making progress on its menu. But if it wants to win diners over with memorable food, the latest changes look more like a starting point than a complete solution.

A Cracker Barrel spokesperson told me in a statement that the company is "committed to ongoing menu innovation" and that the seasonal items "help keep the menu fresh and encourage repeat visits."

Thyssenkrupp and trade union IG Metall on Saturday said they had agreed on reduced working hours, lower bonus payments and site closures as part of a push to revamp Germany's largest steelmaker.

The accord with steel workers marks a major step in Thyssenkrupp's restructuring, under which the former German industrial icon is planning to turn into a holding company, and comes after renewed tension between management and labour representatives.

Implementation of the new collective bargaining agreement, which runs until September 30, 2030, must be approved by IG Metall members at Thyssenkrupp's steel unit TKSE and is pending an agreement on the division's future financing, they said.

The agreement follows Thyssenkrupp's announcement that up to 11,000 jobs at the steel unit, TKSE, had to be cut or outsourced and that annual production capacity would be lowered to 8.7-9.0 million tons from 11.5 million tons.

"We went to the pain threshold and only made concessions where it was really necessary in order to secure jobs and locations," said Tekin Nasikkol, head of Thyssenkrupp's works council and member of the group's supervisory board.

"We have now created the conditions for the company to emerge from the difficult situation out of its own strength," Nasikkol said in a statement.

Thyssenkrupp had wanted to reach a deal regarding the restructuring by summer and both sides aim to finalise the current agreement by the end of September.

Reaching a wage deal has been seen as a key hurdle to be cleared before Thyssenkrupp can sell an additional 30% stake in TKSE to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, as planned. The investor already owns a 20% stake via a holding company.

President Donald Trump defended the state and federal response to deadly flash flooding in Texas on Friday as he visited the stricken Hill Country region, where at least 120 people, including dozens of children, perished a week ago.

During a roundtable discussion after touring Kerr County, the epicenter of the disaster, Trump praised both Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for their response, saying they both did an "incredible job."

The Trump administration, as well as local and state officials, has faced mounting questions over whether more could have been done to protect and warn residents ahead of the flooding, which struck with astonishing speed in the pre-dawn hours on July 4, the U.S. Independence Day holiday.

Trump reacted with anger when a reporter said some families affected by the floods had expressed frustration that warnings did not go out sooner.

"I think everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances," he said. "I don't know who you are, but only a very evil person would ask a question like that."

Some critics have questioned whether the administration's spending cuts at the National Weather Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which coordinates the U.S. government's disaster response efforts, might have exacerbated the calamity.

Trump officials have said that cuts had no impact on the NWS's ability to forecast the storms, despite some vacancies in local offices.

But the president has largely sidestepped questions about his plans to shrink or abolish FEMA and reassign many of its key functions to state and local governments.

"I'll tell you some other time," Trump said on Tuesday, when asked by a reporter about FEMA.

Before the most recent flooding, Kerr County declined to install an early-warning system after failing to secure state money to cover the cost.

Lawrence Walker, 67, and a nearly three-decade veteran resident of Kerrville, said the county and state had not spent enough on disaster prevention, including an early-warning system. 

Asked about the quality of the government response, he said, "It's been fine since the water was at 8 feet."

The Texas state legislature will convene in a special session later this month to investigate the flooding and provide disaster relief funding.

Abbott has dismissed questions about whether anyone was to blame, calling that the "word choice of losers."

Search teams on Friday were still combing through muddy debris littering parts of the Hill Country in central Texas, looking for the dozens still listed as missing, but no survivors have been found since the day of the floods.

Heavy rains sent a wall of water raging down the Guadalupe River early on July 4, causing the deadliest disaster of the Republican president's nearly six-month term in office.

As sun poked through dark clouds on Friday morning, search crews in hard hats painstakingly walked inch-by-inch along the ruined banks of the river, marking damage and looking through wreckage.

After the president arrived in Kerr County in the early afternoon, Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott drove to an area near the river, where Trump received a briefing from first responders amid debris left in the wake of the flood.

The county is located in what is known as "flash flood alley," a region that has seen some of the country's deadliest floods. 

More than a foot of rain fell in less than an hour on July 4. Flood gauges showed the river's height rose from about a foot to 34 feet (10.4 meters) in a matter of hours, cascading over its banks and sweeping away trees and structures in its path.

Kerr County officials say more than 160 people remain unaccounted for, although experts say that the number of people reported missing in the wake of disasters is often inflated.

The dead in the county include 67 adults and at least 36 children, many of whom were campers at the nearly century-old Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer retreat on the banks of the river.

Jon Moreno, 71, a longtime Kerrville resident whose property on high ground was spared, praised the government response - local and federal.

He has heard the debate about what more could have been done - including sirens - but said he did not think it would have made much difference, given people's desire to build along the flood-prone riverbanks.

"It's unavoidable," he said. "All those people along the river - I wouldn't want to live there ... It's too dangerous."

At Stripes, a gas station in Kerrville, the building was tagged in large white letters, accusing "Trump's Big Beautiful Bill" of cutting "our emergency funding." 

The president's massive legislative package, which cut taxes and spending, won approval from the Republican-controlled Congress last week and was signed into law by Trump on the same day that the flooding hit Texas.

Trump's Immigration Policy:

A federal judge in Los Angeles issued an order temporarily blocking US authorities from using racial or ethnic profiling during immigration sweeps in the region and requiring that detainees get access to lawyers. 

The order Friday by US District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong is the latest fallout from the Trump administration's controversial crackdown on migrants in California and across the US. It came in a lawsuit by a group of Southern California residents, workers and advocacy groups who accused President Donald Trump's administration of terrorizing the population with heavy handed and unconstitutional tactics.

Tons of discounts have come and gone in the last four days, and once the clock strikes midnight Pacific, almost all of them will expire. 

We've compared prices across thousands of deals this week, and below, you'll find highlights of some of our favorite picks from our collection of reviews and buying guides. This way, you know you're only getting deal recommendations for items we think are worth your cash, especially with today's tasty discounts.

When you have small and sensitive ears like mine, you have to be really picky about your headphones. I strongly dislike in-ear earbuds that extend too far into my ear canal, so I was elated when Apple announced its newest AirPods, which would maintain a similar form factor as its predecessors but offer active noise cancellation. These things are great, and although their ANC isn't quite as strong as the Pro 2's, they are good enough for regular use while out and about.

For Prime Day's remaining hours, the wireless charging versions are down to $119, and the USB-C charging ones are down to $89, both excellent all-time lows. If you have yet to pick up a pair during the sale, I recommend acting fast. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

I've never seen the AirPods Pro 2 at a better price than this. Past sales have seen them dip to $160, but you're generally looking at $180-$200 for a standard discount during more low-key sales.

The audio quality and noise-cancelling both received massive upgrades over the first-gen Pros. If you have the original Pro 2s with the Lightning cable, the only difference besides the charging port is added dust resistance, so I'd hold off for the next-gen Pros rather than pick these up. Ditching that old Lightning cable for good is definitely tempting, though. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

Apple's latest MacBook Air received a major boost for productivity fans this year as it now allows you to connect to two external displays while also using the laptop screen. The M4 chip is a powerful beast, and its base model with 16GB of RAM will handle a fair bit of multitasking and light media editing if you're looking to save money over a MacBook Pro.

This super-light and portable laptop is a great buy if you're heading to college. It will be supported by updates for years to come. Better yet, this is the cheapest price yet, and it likely won't get any lower before you head back to campus.

Is it even Prime Day if you don't buy another Echo speaker? While Alexa hasn't really evolved in years, we still find quite a lot of use for these smart speakers.

OK, most of it is setting timers and asking it the time or for weather forecasts, but Amazon is promising AI upgrades sooner rather than later. Hopefully, they're a bit more on it than Apple's utterly botched Siri Apple Intelligence rollout.

So why the Echo Pop? It's the cheapest of all the Echo speakers right now and a great entry-level model for anyone new to smart speakers. It's a nice size for a nightstand or a little music speaker on your desk. It's not particularly powerful, but a decent work-at-home option that won't disturb the rest of the house and can give your ears a break from wearing headphones all day. You could also pair it with a smart plug like the one highlighted below.

The entire Echo line is on sale for Prime Day until Friday, including the ones with a display at Amazon. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

This is a neat (and cheap!) device that can help turn some regular household items into smart devices that can be activated by remote control via Alexa on your phone or Echo smart speaker (it won't work with Google or Apple speakers).

Typical uses include activating lamps or electric fans. Coffee makers are also potential winners, as they can keep the coffee pot heated or even be turned off remotely to save on energy bills.

If your device needs button presses to activate, though, just remember that this won't help unless you can leave it in 'on mode'—like a physical light switch on a lamp. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

We specifically recommend the Amazon Omni QLED 50-inch for its balance of cost and performance in our guide to the best 50-inch TVs, even though we think the larger sizes of this model are overpriced. It comes bundled with convenient Alexa features and is one of the few of its size to offer local dimming, giving good contrast performance. 

For Prime Day, it's 33% off, but that ends in an hour, so you'll want to act fast to save on this affordable option. It's on sale frequently, but almost never for this low.

My Garmin GPS watch, a Forerunner 55, is 15% off on Amazon right now, but the best Garmin deal on Prime Day is on the vívoactive 5. The brand is a popular option among those looking to track their workouts, fitness routines, and general health-related stats, but my greatest reason for recommending it is the battery life. I've gone well over a week on a single charge, and I'm wearing my watch on every run and while I sleep at night.

The vívoactive 5 boasts 11 days of battery life, and at 37% off, it's just $1 shy of the cheapest price we've ever seen it listed at, so you'll be hard-pressed to find a better deal than this. — Lillian Brown, Streaming Associate Editor

Trying to decide between these two Prime Day Kindle deals? That's quite a price difference between the two, but both are excellent e-reader. I have both, and I swap between them regularly, so there's no bad option here.

I use the Paperwhite the most because the larger screen means fewer page turns. I also like the flush screen design, which prevents dust or hair from tucking into the bezel, which is a tiny issue with the cheaper model.

The Paperwhite has a few premium touches that make it worth the price, especially when it's on sale like this. It's waterproof, making it much safer to read poolside, in the bath, or to protect against spills in your bag. The adjustable warm-light feature makes the screen easier on the eyes and can be tweaked to a soft golden glow, which is very pleasing on the eye as it looks like an old paperback.

As for the cheaper model, it's smaller, but that actually works in its favor as I've found it fits into inside jacket pockets easily (the Paperwhite is too big for some pockets) and I've even squeezed it into some jean pockets. It's much easier to read one-handed for all you commuters who can't get a seat on the train or bus.

If you're new to e-readers and are just getting back into reading, the cheaper model is a safe bet. Kindles drop to these awesome prices every Prime Day and Black Friday season, so you're never far away from a great deal if you decide to upgrade down the line. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

Digital notepads are really taking off, and this is the Kindle brand's second take on the large format, and it's never been cheaper. In addition to being a Kindle e-reader with a massive 10.2" display - excellent for those who prefer to read in a large print font - it's an excellent size for taking notes with the included pen.

I use one every day at work, and the various templates and folder setups are a massive improvement over the scraps of paper that used to litter my desk or get lost at the bottom of my workbag.

This version comes with the Premium Pen (which costs extra on the last-gen model), an eraser button on the top, and a programmable shortcut key.

If you have the original Scribe, I'd skip this one, as the design has not changed significantly, and both have the same software upgrades. Which more recently have included AI options that transcribe your notes into digital text, with mixed results, I must say. That said, I can barely read my own handwriting, so I can cut it some slack here. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

Philips Hue is the most recognizable brand in the smart lighting game, and the vast range of colors available via the app on these super-long-lasting bulbs makes them my top pick whenever anyone asks me about them.

They're brutally expensive, though, so waiting for a Prime Day deal is certainly the way to go. This is a major discount, too, and one that might not come back around until Black Friday. These are certainly items I'd say are vulnerable to price hikes if the tariffs hit. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

Despite being a few generations old now, Sony has continued to manufacture their XM4 noise-canceling headphones, and we're not complaining one bit.

They remain a phenomenal value and are much preferred by many music fans over the XM5 thanks to their much more compact design for storage, comfy fit, and a price that's so much cheaper than modern greats from Sony, Bose, and Apple. You simply can't get a better set of headphones than this for under $200.

My dad somehow lost his headphones on the way to Greece—tragic, right? Call this perfect timing, but it was the easiest replacement ever to rebuy them for him during Prime Day. And they were cheaper than when I got them for him last Father's Day. Now, they'll arrive home before his flight touches down in America. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

Beats are a recurring participant at every Amazon deals event, but a price this good is rare. At over 50% off, this Prime Day discount matches some of the best deals we've seen for the Beats Solo 4 in the past.

I love this little fan from Jisulife — it's worth every penny of the $20 sticker price, but for Prime Day, it's on sale for as low as $13, and it's my responsibility to highly recommend you buy it. — Lauren Savoie, Deputy Executive Editor

Even though this editor-favorite folding mini fan isn't very expensive and sees discounts somewhat regularly, at $13, it's a much better deal than we usually see in the summer.

Oura is the biggest name in smart rings and is our go-to pick, even over Samsung's Galaxy Ring. If you're looking for a subtle health tracker that looks pretty cool as well, you can't go wrong here. Multiple sizes and colors are on sale today.

The Oura can track various fitness and wellness metrics, including sleep, heart rate, steps, and other activities. Many find wearing a smartwatch all the time, especially when sleeping, is a bit much. So a smart ring is a great alternative if you don't mind having to use your phone to check out the data. The eight-day battery batters Apple and Samsung's smartwatch efforts, too.

Though we've seen it drop lower in the past, it's been a while since the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil has been discounted this much. At only $89, this is a steal for an accessory that so flawlessly integrates with compatible iPads for writing, drawing, and more.

I've been drawing as a hobby since I was young, but digital art was always one of my weak points — until I picked up an Apple Pencil. I've since upgraded my setup to the same 2nd Gen Apple Pencil featured in this deal and an iPad Air because it just makes sketching digitally so much easier and portable. Even when not drawing, the accessory makes note-taking and photo editing so much easier and precise. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

These sporty earbuds use the same H1 Apple chip that second- and third-gen AirPods use, earning it the top spot in our guide to the best AirPods alternatives. They integrate similarly with Apple devices but also include an Android app, making them versatile enough for users outside of the Apple ecosystem.

Though they're on sale often, this drop to $149 is an especially great deal price for the Beats Fit Pro. They're more expensive than the latest generation of AirPods, but this discount makes buying a pair a little easier.

When it comes to cheap wireless earbuds, it doesn't get better than a $20 pair of Amazon Echo Buds. After testing these budget smart headphones for our review, I found them to be a decent investment for Alexa users or a nice, affordable option with a comfortable form factor.

At full price, I wouldn't recommend them for everyone, but at 60% off during Prime Day, they make an excellent gift or spare set to keep in your work bag. They're lightweight and provide on-the-go Alexa support. — Sarah Saril, Editor, deals and how to watch

At $80 off, the Apple Watch SE 2nd Gen is the lowest price we usually see the smartwatch reach, so now is a good time to buy if you've been thinking of making a purchase.

The SE 2nd Gen is a solid entry point for the Apple Watch, thanks to its (relatively) low price point and robust set of features. It's a great option for fitness, sleep, and heart rate tracking within the Apple ecosystem. — Lillian Brown, Streaming Associate Editor

The Samsung S90D hits just the right sweet spot between price and performance. It also boasts a healthy assortment of smart features and a handsome design. — Steven Cohen, Senior Tech Editor

At 29% off for the 77-inch and 31% off for the 65-inch, these are some solid deals that match the lows we've seen earlier this year. They've been dipping in and out of stock over the duration of the event, and after Prime Day, they'll be gone for sure.

Our budget 75-inch TV pick, the Roku Plus Series, is an entry-level QLED with quantum dots and local dimming for solid contrast and color performance despite its low price. The Roku interface is also intuitive and easy to navigate, especially if you've used the popular brand before.

At 35% off, this is a steal, albeit not the lowest we've ever seen this TV drop before.

Hindsight is 20/20, and sometimes, it's not until I'm out of the house that I realize I didn't charge my phone all night. It's times like these that my compact Anker 633 Magnetic Battery saves the day. This MagSafe backup battery conveniently snaps onto the back of my iPhone and juices it up without the use of an annoying cable.

I see this specific model drop in price a lot throughout the year, but this is an especially good deal price that I wouldn't miss this Prime Day. It's a game-changing accessory that hardly makes a dent in my purse space, and at $25 off with a clipped on-page coupon, it's a steal. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

I've loved PopSockets since they first released years ago, but once MagSafe charging became an integral feature to modern iPhones, I had to ditch my beloved adhesive phone grip because it interfered with the magnetic capabilities. Thankfully, PopSockets released a MagSafe option that powerfully claps onto the back of my phone but easily comes off so I can charge or even just change cases as needed.

Now, for Prime Day, the MagSafe PopSocket is $8 off in a handful of different colors. I can't recommend jumping on this deal enough; these grips don't usually dip this low. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

I've been trying out the Bissell FurFinder for the last few weeks, and I'm pretty impressed with how it cleans. I love that it can stand upright by itself, has a built-in crevice tool in the handheld portion, and has some pretty strong LED lights. It's not perfect, though. It's a little top-heavy, and I've noticed that long strands of my hair do wrap around the brush roll. However, for $129, this is one very effective cordless vacuum from a reputable brand. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

Most of the year, it's hard to find the FurFinder for any less than its full-priced $230. For Prime Day, it's $100 off, which likely won't last long after the day ends.

I bought this budget cordless vacuum cleaner myself a few months back after spending a lot of time researching the cheapest options available on Amazon. Yes, there were cheaper options, but many were lacking in the power department, and the Tikom V500 seemed to pack a bigger punch than anything else while still coming in under $100.

I've been very happy with it so far. The battery lasts 34 minutes in normal mode and 19 on turbo. Normal is great for grabbing tiny bits of debris or cat litter and tufts of tumbleweed-like cat hair, while I use turbo for full apartment cleans or grabbing heavier things like dry cat food kibble. It's a little heavy in handheld mode, but I feel I've got a real bargain compared to the amount of money you'd spend on a brand like Dyson.

That said, if you do fancy a splurge, the Dsyon V8 Plus is 36% off at $299. If you're in a small carpet-free apartment, though, I think you're better off with the Tikom. Check out our guide to the best cordless vacuum cleaners for more details about other options. 

The even-smaller version of Bissell's popular Little Green portable vacuum cleaner offers the same great performance, designed for even tighter spaces. The larger size is the compact pick in our guide to the best portable vacuum cleaner.

It's almost never on sale, and though it's a household tool worth its full price, it's even more worth it at 26% off. Chances are, after Prime Day, deals for it will once again be few and far between, so don't hesitate to pick one up if you're on the fence.

I bought one of these last year on Prime Day, and it's still working fantastically despite being used multiple times a day. I use it for cat hair and fluff around the house on the bed, sofa, and even on my clothes - like when your pet does a drive by, walking past and covering your trousers in hair just as you're almost out the door. 

It's infinitely better than those useless lint rollers, and emptying it is super easy. The storage barrel holds a lot of hair, so I don't need to empty it that often. 

It's a little noisy to use as the plastic casing clanks around while brushing. It annoys the cat no end when I'm brushing around her, but until she starts cleaning up after herself, she's just going to have to take it.

It's a tad difficult to use on looser surfaces like a thin blanket, as it's the backward and forward motions that pull up the hair, so only brushing one way doesn't work as well. So you'll need to pull blankets taught on both sides to get the roller working. Seriously, though, it's worth it just for the sofas alone. — Brendan Griffiths, Senior Commerce Director

Some of the best standing desks are getting pretty pricey, even when they don't offer extra features. Flexispot has done a great job of keeping costs down, though, on their entry-level models, and this Prime Day discount is a great chance to check out the growing trend at home.

Prices go even lower if you choose one of the smaller surfaces, and there are many colors to choose from as well. You can program different pre-set heights for sitting and standing for more than one user. This one also has a hook for headphones, which is a super basic extra touch, but one we love to see.

Govee's outdoor lights have been a huge hit. They are an excellent addition to your home if you're spending time outside during these summer nights, and they can also double as Christmas lights.

As they're smart bulbs, you can choose a range of modes and colors via the app for any occasion. They can even be set to vibe with your music. And at 144ft, you're not limited to a small coverage area.

The Hatch Restore 3 is one of those items that very rarely go on sale. If you've been thinking about it, this $30 discount is the best you can find, and it even extends to the new pink hue, Rosy.

On first glance, I thought the Hatch Restore was an overhyped wake up light, but it's features extend far beyond pretty light displays and a nice wake up tune… it also incorporates a wind-down routine (think exclusive podcasts, meditations, sounds) and can be used throughout the night as a sound machine too. The one thing the Hatch Restore stops short of is sleep tracking. However, to get the most out of all the features and settings, you'll have to subscribe to Hatch+, which costs $50 annually, but your purchase gives you 30 days free to try it out. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

I do a lot of baking at home, and there are few kitchen tools I come back to more than my KitchenAid mixer. The compact Classic version has a paddle, whisk, and dough hook attachment, helping you evenly combine ingredients for any recipe. Plus, you can add more attachments, like a pasta maker, if you want.

Despite its smaller size, this KitchenAid still packs plenty of power with 10 mixing speeds. The individual parts are also dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

I came across these on protein brownies on TikTok at some point, but was nervous to spend $40 on the whole pack. Since then, I've seen these sold individually at Five Below and literally today at Lidl, but this deal brings the Birthday Cake Blondie flavor down to just $20 for a pack of 12, which doesn't feel as risky.

I've never seen it priced anywhere near this low. These protein brownies are perfectly moist, flavorful, and a helpful way to get more protein in while also indulging in a sweet, yet not completely, guilty treat. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

As a certified coffee snob who lives in a tiny New York apartment, the Nespresso Vertuo Pop+ has been an absolute lifesaver. With the help of the Aeroccino3 Milk Frother, which is also 25% off for Prime Day, I can use it to make all the coffee and espresso drinks I love, hot or iced. But its compact footprint means it doesn't take up too much valuable kitchen real estate.

This limited edition version of our favorite budget Nespresso machine is cute-as-can-be with pistachio accents, making it the perfect pop of color to add to your kitchen. — Jennifer Gonick, Coupon and Deals Fellow

No one wants to find themselves in a desperate situation for survival, but if you're an avid hiker, camper, or outdoorsman, something like the LifeStraw is an essential emergency kit tool. In our LifeStraw review, we praise its ease of use and portability for single users. While it can't filter large quantities of water for a group, it's a must-have for solo adventurers.

It sees sales somewhat regularly throughout the year, but right now, it's down to its all-time lowest price of $10. Even if you're not the most dedicated camper, it's hard to argue with a steep discount for a tool that turns many liquids into drinkable water.

If you're a hot sleeper, look no further than our top memory foam cooling pillow. Dual gel layers and a quilted cooling cover mean you never have to turn this pillow over to the cool side.

The pillow's medium firmness offers the perfect amount of pressure relief around the neck and shoulders for back and side sleepers, helping you maintain spine alignment throughout the night. At 57% off, it's rare to see a price this good.

I'm not the only person to wax poetic about this adjustable pillow from Coop Sleep Goods — several of us on the Reviews team have invested in our top pillow pick and fallen in love. Its adjustability makes it versatile for different sleeper preferences, and after using mine for almost a year, it hasn't flattened at all.

Though it's pretty common to find it on sale during most deal events, it's not until something like Prime Day that it drops to its lowest price. Seriously, if you're at all on the fence, let me join the chorus of recommendations for this pillow. I'm buying one for my husband during this 20% off sale, so he stops stealing mine. - Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

One of our top mattresses for back pain, the Nectar Classic Mattress is made with premium gel memory foam that molds to your specific body shape to expertly relieve pressure. Its medium firmness will be a particularly good choice for side sleepers, but it can be well-suited for any sleep type.

Having covered the best queen mattress sales by retailer every week for months, I can tell you it's rare to see the queen Nectar Classic Mattress drop below $649, but for Prime Day, you can get it for just $537, making it one of our top Prime Day mattress deals.

If you get bitten up by mosquitoes during the summer, no matter which bug spray you wear, consider investing in this rechargeable repeller. Unlike other mosquito repellants you spray on yourself, this one has no chemical scent.

All you have to do is set it up in an area that gets a lot of mosquito activity (like your backyard), and it'll create a "protection zone" of up to 20 feet. At its lowest price ever for Prime Day, you won't want to miss this deal.

Back when I still lived with my mom, I invested in the Coway Airmega AP-1512HH in an attempt to stave off her overwhelming allergies to my new rescue dog. It was a last-ditch effort, and to everyone's surprise, it worked! It's been six years since, but the Airmega continues working silently and powerfully in the corner of my living room, making the air notably less dandery for me and my guests.

I think this thing is worth full price, so a 33% discount makes the deal even sweeter. It's on sale often, but not usually for this low; this Prime Day deal is a must-buy for anyone interested in our top air purifier pick. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

There are few cookware pieces as versatile as a Dutch oven, and I should know. My Le Creuset Dutch Oven is one of my kitchen essentials. It's amazing how many recipes it can be used for, from soups to sauces to loaves of bread.

In addition to being a great kitchen companion, this Dutch oven is also beautiful to look at and will last you decades. It's not cheap, though, so I'd grab it at over $100 off before it's too late.

If you want to elevate your cup of coffee in the morning, one meaningful upgrade is not switching up your roast but making sure your coffee is ground fresh. Fresh-ground coffee unlocks fresh aromas and flavors that you just can't get from pre-ground coffee. The OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder is a great entry-level option, with 15 settings to tinker with, whether you're brewing for French Press or Espresso.

OXO knows good design; the products speak for themselves, and they don't often go on sale. This is the lowest price since February, and before that, a brief time in December, the grinder dipped just a few dollars below $70. Likewise, if you want to upgrade your coffee maker while you're at it, the OXO 8-cup coffee maker is also 29% off. It's no frills but lets the coffee focus take center stage. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

A college dorm lifesaver, this cute and compact Keurig fits into the smallest corners of any space. It can brew six to 12 ounces at a time and has a convenient top-fill design that allows you to pour water straight into the machine.

For Prime Day, all five hues of the machine are 50% off, so you can get the one that best matches your aesthetic.

Espresso making is hardly a cheap hobby to dive into, but with the Casabrews Espresso Machine, it can cost a little less. It's the top pick in our guide to the best budget espresso machine, with a sleek steel design that impresses visually and in terms of durability. 

It's back down to $119, matching its previous all-time low that it occasionally dips to. This deal ends in an hour, along with Prime Day, but there is a chance it can crop up again in a few months.

I used to be a nonbeliever in the Scrub Daddy hype, but after trying these little guys out on my own dishes, I believe the hype. These texture-changing sponges are perfect for getting tough, caked-on grime, and they're more durable than other sponges I've used. I'd also like to believe that their smiley demeanor makes doing dishes a little less painful.

Scrub Daddy's have seen sales before, but this 20% discount is especially worthwhile. Whether you're already a fan or looking to be convinced, this Prime Day deal is the one to jump on. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

One of the best Prime Day hacks is checking to see if an item you'll need to buy anyway is on sale, and then purchasing in bulk. Tide PODS are essential for me, and I especially like the Free & Gentle version (now 20% off) since it doesn't smell like much but still gets the job done. It's hypoallergenic, too, which means it's a good option for those with sensitive and reactive skin.

Our guide to the best Prime Day household essentials also discusses a few other deals that might interest you. — Lillian Brown, Streaming Associate Editor

I have really sensitive skin, so haphazardly using cheap, multicolor dish soaps with my bare hands can cause me some pretty unpleasant reactions. The Seventh Generation Dish Liquid is the only option I've found that doesn't aggravate my fingers to use, and it cuts through stubborn food residue with ease.

If you've read any of our deals content before, you know that we love to recommend stocking up on your regular consumables when they're on sale. The same goes for this six-pack of dish soap, which is now 30% off and will last a good long while. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

The former top pick in our guide to the best air conditioner, we still love and recommend the Midea U Inverter Window Air Conditioner. It pioneered the technology that allows users to open the window while it remains installed, and its quiet, effective performance still impresses.

It's on sale a lot, but almost never for this low. At $100 off, this is the best price the unit has seen all year. It's uncommon to find actually good cooling appliance deals in the summer, but alas, the Midea U Inverter is down for Prime Day.

Sproos makes our favorite filtered shower head. I've been using mine for a year now, and I never thought it was possible to love a shower head, but I really do. First of all, it totally upgraded my crappy apartment shower and made it somewhere I actually want to be in the morning. It's simple and attractive, and it was so easy for me to install by myself in just a few minutes. It's an instant upgrade.

Many people swear by filtered shower heads, saying they work wonders for hair and skin. I personally haven't noticed a big difference, other than that my hair dye seems to last a few weeks longer (the shower head filters out chlorine in the water). If you want to save a good chunk of money, the unfiltered version is on sale for $55, less than half the price of the filtered version. It has all the same features I love in the shower head: a wide spray cone, a detachable handheld component, and comes in a number of fun colors. — Lauren Savoie, Deputy Executive Editor

My cat loves Greenies and will wait for me to top off her meals with them before eating, so these have become a must-have in my household. They help clean teeth and can freshen up breath. Plus, they come in a few different tasty flavors. In my experience, a big tub like this is the way to go, so I'm not constantly re-ordering. I've highlighted the chicken flavor here since that's what my cat is currently working her way through, but there are also salmon and tuna-flavored options. — Lillian Brown, Streaming Associate Editor

At 25% off, this deal on the dental treat pick in our guide to the best cat treats is a must-buy for cat parents restocking for their pet. It's not often that a variety of flavors fall in price, so this kind of savings is a sweet bonus to make pet expenses a little less expensive.

The top pick in our guide to the best cat fountain, the Petlibro Capsule Water Fountain, balances affordability and cat-friendly design better than competitors. It's easier to clean than others, too, with unobtrusive and quiet operation that rarely goes above a light trickle.

It fluctuates a lot in price, but 26% off is among the best deals we've seen for it.

If you can gather up to four friends, family members, or trusted strangers to play a board game, Pandemic is great. It's challenging for sure — I've only ever "won" the game once in a two-player game after an hour of theory crafting with my friend — but super fun. You and your team cooperate to stop the spread of a global pandemic, each operating in different roles with unique abilities.

If I didn't already have it in my collection, I'd be hopping on this 30% discount for Prime Day. Though it's not the lowest price it's ever seen, this is the best deal it's dropped to all year. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

If you're on the go a lot this summer and packing lots of cotton and linen, you won't want to go far without the Nori Press. This compact travel iron looks like an oversized hair straightener, and it's designed to iron and steam your shirts in one go. It weighs just 1.5 pounds and won't take up much space in a carry-on. It's also easy to get into the details with the clamp style, to straighten out collars and trims.

The Nori Press seldom goes below 25% off, and when it does, it's for short periods of time.

If you're the type of person who likes to style your hair with a sleek, straight blowout one day and voluminous waves the next, the Revlon One-Step Volumizer is the only tool you'll ever need. An updated version of the original Revlon One-Step Volumizer, which is also on sale this Prime Day, the 2.0 features a slimmer handle that is more comfortable in your hand and allows you to better control the brush. Plus, the new version has a smaller barrel for a wider variety of styles and adds more heat settings to help you avoid unwanted damage.

At 60% off, the One-Step 2.0 is one of the best Prime Day deals over 50% off we've seen this year. You're unlikely to find it at a better price, at least until Black Friday. So, now's a great time to snag it, especially if you plan to beat the summer humidity with some anti-frizz styling.

The no-frills Original Wet Brush is genuinely one of the hero products of my lifetime. As someone with long, thick hair that's prone to knotting, combing through my wet hair after a shower used to be a nightmare. I picked this up on a whim at least a decade ago, and I've never been without one ever since.

I was skeptical at first that the Wet Brush's soft, flexible bristles would actually detangle my hair, but the brush glides through hair like a dream, painlessly loosening any knots along the way with minimal breakage. At just $6, it's a steal.

The first time I used this product, my hair was in dire condition: dry, dull, and frizzy from repeated bleaching and heat styling. After just one application, I could already see a dramatic difference, and it cemented itself as one of the best hair oils I'd tried. Not only did my strands appear shinier and feel softer, but there was noticeably less frizz and flyaways. — Rebecca Strong, Reviews Contributor

The top pick in our guide to the best hair oils, the Unite U Oil, is a solid investment for users with a variety of textures. It'll usually run you over $50, but, ending soon for Prime Day, it's discounted by 20% for the first time in a while.

Everyone needs a go-to lip balm, and the best ones keep your lips both hydrated all day long and also provide the perfect glossy, but not greasy, finish. The Laneige Lip Glowy Balm excels at both, which is why it's the best lip balm we've ever tested.

Formulated with nourishing ingredients like shea butter, this balm keeps lips moisturized all day without any stickiness. It comes in a variety of subtle tints, but the best deal you'll find for Prime Day is on the Berry version. We rarely see the balm on sale for more than 20% off, so this is one to grab while you can.

I've been using this sunscreen on my runs for years. While I'm happy to use a simple spray-on sunscreen on the rest of my body, I prefer something gentler on my face and chest. It's heavy-duty SPF 70+, without a heavy-duty feel, so I feel protected when I'm outside but not bogged down by an oily paste. Perhaps most importantly, it resists wearing off from sweat — something that I definitely put to the test every summer. — Lillian Brown, Streaming Associate Editor

Although not a new all-time low, sunscreen deals are a hot commodity in the summer. This Prime Day 27% discount is a great chance to stock up on a moisture-resistant formula. 

Any dermatologist will tell you to keep your hands off any breakouts, but if you're guilty of pimple popping, these acne patches might just save you. All you have to do is stick one on clean, dry skin and forget about it for six to eight hours while it absorbs gunk and flattens the zit.

The best part about these ones is that they're virtually invisible, so you can even wear them during the day without drawing unwanted attention to any blemishes. For Prime Day, grab a 72-pack for $24.

As someone who hates wearing lipstick, this is one of the few pigmented lip products I reach for. Clinique Black Honey has been a cult favorite for decades, and for good reason. Its glossy, balm-like formula keeps my lips hydrated all day, unlike most lipsticks, which are too drying.

The shade itself is incredibly versatile and blends well with nearly every skin tone. Plus, it's buildable, so you can take it from day to night with just a few swipes. I've never seen Black Honey be more than 15% off on Amazon, so now's the time to grab it. — Jennifer Gonick, Coupons and Deals Fellow

I hate summer with a passion. Mainly because I dislike being sweaty all the time, and, for me, being sweaty also means thigh chafe. I really love Megababe's Thigh Rescue, not only because it really does work, but I also appreciate how much founder Katie Sturino has done to de-stigmatize the things that happen to normal bodies, like thigh chafing. This jumbo-size stick should last all summer, and makes me feel (a little) better about leaving the house in the heat. — Lauren Savoie, Deputy Executive Editor

Mega Thigh Rescue is almost never on sale, so even if you already have a stick, this 20% discount is an incredible opportunity to stock up while saving some money. If you're just looking to try it out, the smaller, regular-sized stick is also 20% off.

For those of us who could use a little help perfecting our pout, we've tested and rounded up the best lip plumping glosses and balms for doing exactly that. Our most painless recommendation, the Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Plump, is down to $15 in the best deal we've seen for it all year.

Although lip plumpers are known for a sometimes unpleasant, burning sensation upon application, this one stands out with its cool, slightly minty feel. Rather than a typical gloss tube, it's a buttery balm that glides on smoothly and even nourishes your skin.

My eyelids get oily throughout the day, and due to my almond eye shape, I have a lot of creasing around my outer corners. I thought I was doomed to a life of smudged wings and smeared shadows, but the Urban Decay Primer Potion came to save my eye makeup. Applying even just a small dab goes a long way to preserve my application all day, and I've noticed all of my outer corner oiliness problems disappear with its addition to my routine.

I restock every time I find a good sale for it, and the 30% off deal during Amazon Prime Day is a really good one. Not only is this a really affordable price, but the tube is large enough to supply dozens upon dozens of eye makeup looks, making an investment like this a no-brainer. - Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

Though I do own a pair of Ray-Bans I got as a gift, I've stopped wearing anything but these Sojos Retro Oval sunglasses from Amazon. Not only are they flattering on everyone, but they also look way more expensive than they are. Seriously, I never thought I would get so much use out of a pair of sunglasses that are under $20, but these are my go-to. — Samantha Crozier, Style Editor

Right now, for Prime Day, the Sojos are 20% off in a handful of different colorways. This is the lowest price the glasses have been at in a long time.

Mission cooling hats are incredibly effective at regulating my body temperature when I'm outside on hot days. They keep me cool and comfortable, and I recommend them to anyone who spends a good bit of time outside. — Sally Kaplan, Executive Editor

We break down more of this hat's features in our review, but overall, it's a game-changer for beating the summer heat. This 34% discount is the best discount we've seen for it in months, though not a new all-time low.

Right now, for Prime Day, the Sojos are 20% off in a handful of different colorways. This is the lowest price the glasses have been at in a long time.

This stylish and comfy sweatsuit is a near-perfect dupe of the Spanx Air Essentials set for a fraction of the price, earning it a top spot in our best sweatsuits guide. The stretchy and silky fabric feels extremely high-quality for the price, which we were impressed with in our full review.

The set comes in over 15 shades, most of which are on sale for Prime Day. We also love how the two pieces can be worn together or mixed and matched with other pieces in your closet to create different looks.

A stylish and comfortable walking sneaker is a must-have, and you can't go wrong with our top women's walking shoe. The Adidas Ultraboost Light will serve you well whether you're running errands, standing all day, or walking for hours on end.

We love the Ultraboost Light's fit. It's snug and supportive but gives your foot enough room to spread out. At 55% off, you'll be hard-pressed to find this pair at a better price.

[Update: these are $10 cheaper at Nordstrom if you're quick

My Rothy's flats have been a staple in my closet ever since I got them. They're incredibly lightweight and made with sustainable materials. Plus, unlike other flats I've tried that were uncomfortable or gave me blisters, Rothy's fit perfectly and are supportive enough to walk in all day.

The Square Mary Jane, one of our favorite Mary Janes, is the best Rothy's deal we've seen for Prime Day. All four colors are $60 off, so grab a pair or a couple.

One of our style editor's top Prime Day fashion picks, the Baggallini Carryall Laptop Tote is the best budget work bag you can buy. It's made with durable nylon and weighs just over a pound, making it one of the lightest work bags we've tested.

The bag also features a stellar internal organization system, including a padded laptop sleeve, tons of pockets, and an included wristlet. It would make a great companion on any trip or a day at the office.

I can honestly say the Hulken is a delight to schlep. I highly recommend it for city dwellers who are short on storage space and big on style. While it's pricey, I think it's worth every penny — and now I want one in every size. - Lauren Savoie, Deputy Executive Editor

Though, as we rave in our review, the Hulkens are well worth full price, you can save 20% on the smallest size now from Amazon. The bag is almost never on sale, making this discount a can't-miss opportunity.

Away's luggage has received a lot of hype, and for good reason: the premium designs and smart organization result in a smooth experience for travelers. In our review, we love how it simplifies packing and praise its value compared to pricier brands. 

The brand itself is no stranger to sales, holding its fair share of promotions throughout the year. A couple of different colors are $55 off on Amazon, which is better than deals we've seen for The Carry-On during different seasons. 

Samsonite made the cut in our roundup of the best luggage brands, and the brand has a couple of deals still live for Prime Day. A three-piece Omni 2 Hardside set is 50% off, offering savings on a carry-on, medium, and large suitcase set.

We like Samsonite because of its quality and price points, and even named the brand the top hard-sided option in our guide to the best carry-on bags.



These breezy, wide-leg pants are the perfect shorts alternative for summer. They have deep pockets for your phone or wallet, and will feel light as air even in heat wave temperatures.

These pants are also lined, so you don't need to worry about the light striped pattern being transparent. At 55% off, you're unlikely to find a better price.

Teeth whitening kits can be hit or miss, but this one from Crest has yet to disappoint us, making it our top teeth whitening kit overall. Unlike others that can cause irritation and tooth pain, these whitening strips contain a lower amount of hydrogen peroxide that makes them suitable for people with sensitive teeth.

They're still effective, though. In fact, most shoppers noticed a difference after using them for just a few days. The kit isn't quite at the lowest price we've seen, but it's close.

I bought the Oral-B IO toothbrush last Prime Day, and despite the threat of tariffs, it is on sale for the exact same price as I bought it last summer. There's also a $10 coupon you can "clip," which is a great way to sweeten the deal.

The IO system has an indicator light that lets you know whether you're applying too much or too little pressure while cleaning your teeth and has a two-minute brush timer — all to set up healthier habits. — Jaclyn Turner, Senior Home Editor

If there's one product I always make a point of checking during Prime Day, it's the endlessly praised and rarely on sale Dyson Airwrap. Right now, you can save $125 on it.

The Airwrap makes it a breeze to give yourself a salon-quality blowout at home, and is designed to prevent the unwanted heat damage you might experience from other similar tools. With three airflow settings and heat speeds, you have maximum control.

If years of heat styling or color have left your hair dry and brittle, look no further than this luxurious moisture mask at an affordable price. It gently smooths, softens, and strengthens your strands to reduce breakage and increase shine.

This mask is also free of harmful sulfates, parabens, and other irritants that can damage your hair over time. Plus, it's safe for color-treated hair.

Pimple patches have become a viral sensation for their effectiveness, even becoming a sort of fashion statement among some wearers who opt for brightly-colored stickers. The Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch may not be the first, but it's a fan favorite — we praise it for working better than other brands in our review.

Luckily, a 36-count of patches isn't too expensive at full price, but if you're going to buy them anyway, why not get them with a sweet 20% discount? Sales for Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patches come up often, but it's rare that they go this low.

At less than $6, there's little reason not to try out this cute lip color; that's why I got myself a bottle last Prime Day. The Peripera Ink the Velvet Lip Tint is super pigmented and buttery to apply with a satin or matte finish (depending on which you buy), rivalling pricier lip colors. It's not very long-lasting, but its low price makes it easy to stock up on a variety of colors.

This product is a regular deal I see during deal events, and at most, it drops lower by about 20 cents. Not all of the colors are the same price, but if your shade is on sale, I'd recommend jumping on it. — Sarah Saril, Deals and How to Watch Editor

Prime Day officially ends at 11:59 p.m. PT on Friday, July 11. However, some offers are one-day 'daily deals', while others will only last as long as the stock does.

Lightning Deals, especially the really good ones, are usually only live for a few hours.

No, but most are. Some items are just on a general discount, and we've spotted quite a few like that this year.

The majority are locked behind Prime membership. On the plus side, if you're not a member or haven't been for quite some time, you'll be able to get a 30-day free trial, and you're free to cancel as soon as Prime is over.

Very difficult to say. Many prices are the best we've seen so far this year, but there's a chance that the Black Friday deals in November could go lower, especially as more stores get involved. For Amazon's own devices, though, there's a strong chance that these are the best prices, or they won't go any lower for Black Friday.

Tariffs could be a big factor this year, and prices on goods made (or containing non-US parts) outside the US could rise.

This could really hit electronics in particular, so if you've been thinking of getting a new TV or laptop, we'd get one sooner rather than later.

The initial July 9th deadline for tariff agreements has been extended for some countries, but it won't affect Prime Day prices mid-sale anyway, as those items will already have been shipped to the US beforehand.

Lionsgate Studios in Yonkers, New York.

Legendary Entertainment LLC, the independent film and TV studio behind the Dune trilogy and A Minecraft Movie, is considering a takeover of Lionsgate Studios Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. 

Legendary, which is backed by Apollo Global Management, first approached the company after Lionsgate finalized its separation from the Starz Entertainment Corp. TV network and streaming service in May, said the people, who asked not be named as the information is private. Those talks centered on a potential partnership to produce a handful of films so that Legendary could gauge how the companies worked together and whether it should ultimately proceed with a takeover offer, the people said.

Asia's oldest stock exchange was preparing to celebrate its 150th anniversary when a storm of bad news upended the festivities. 

On Monday, a report revealed deepening losses in equity derivatives among India's retail traders, fueling concerns that the Securities and Exchange Board of India may impose tighter curbs. Just days earlier, the regulator barred Jane Street Group from dealing in local markets, alleging the trading giant manipulated prices to make billions of dollars at the expense of small investors — charges the US firm has denied.

Think of me as your AI global economics lens—zooming in on the hidden forces quietly rewriting the world's financial rules.

The merger between Signing Day Sports, Inc. (NYSE American: SGN) and One Blockchain LLC, forming BlockchAIn Digital Infrastructure, Inc., marks a bold strategic pivot from niche sports recruitment to the high-stakes world of cryptocurrency mining and high-performance computing (HPC). This transformative deal, anchored by a 21% profit margin in One Blockchain's existing operations and a critical SEC regulatory milestone, offers investors an asymmetric opportunity to bet on the growth of digital infrastructure—if the risks can be navigated. Let us dissect the calculus.

The Strategic Pivot: From Niche to New EconomySigning Day Sports, valued at approximately $260 million post-merger, is abandoning its core business—a platform for college sports recruitment—to instead control One Blockchain's 40 MW Bitcoin mining facility in South Carolina. The financial rationale is compelling: One Blockchain generated $26.8 million in revenue and $5.7 million in net income in 2024, with a 21% profit margin that outperforms many legacy tech firms. This profitability underscores operational efficiency in a sector where volatility is the norm. The merger aims to position the combined entity as a vertically integrated player in crypto mining and HPC hosting, leveraging One Blockchain's expertise and scalable infrastructure.



Regulatory De-Risking: The SEC S-4 Filing as a Turning PointThe submission of a confidential Form S-4 filing to the SEC represents a pivotal step. This document, which includes a proxy statement and prospectus, must be approved alongside shareholder and NYSE American listing approvals. The S-4's clearance would de-risk the deal by addressing regulatory uncertainties, such as compliance with securities laws and disclosure requirements. Investors should note that forward-looking statements in the filing emphasize risks like regulatory delays and market fluctuations, but the process itself signals progress toward the merger's completion—a stark contrast to earlier-stage SPAC transactions that often fail to clear such hurdles.

Market Validation: A 150% Stock Surge, But Caution RemainsThe stock's 150% surge post-announcement (see ) reflects investor optimism about the strategic shift. Yet this rally is fragile: SGN's value hinges on execution. The merger requires shareholder approval, which may be contentious given the abandonment of the sports recruitment business. Additionally, the NYSE American must approve the listing of the new entity—a hurdle if regulators question the adequacy of One Blockchain's financial disclosures or corporate governance.

Scalability and Infrastructure Synergy: The 50MW Expansion and Texas FacilityThe deal's long-term viability rests on One Blockchain's growth plans. The existing South Carolina facility is set to expand to 50 MW by late 2025/early 2026, pending utility approval, to accommodate third-party crypto miners. More significantly, a 150 MW facility in Texas—phased into 100 MW for internal crypto mining and 50 MW for AI/HPC hosting—is scheduled for late 2026 completion. This modular design allows flexibility to pivot between revenue streams as market dynamics evolve. Combined with an earnout provision tied to achieving $25 million EBITDA by 2026, these expansions create a clear path to scale profitability if executed successfully.

Risk Factors: A Tightrope WalkThree risks loom large. First, shareholder approval is not guaranteed, especially if existing SGN investors question the abandonment of the sports platform. Second, regulatory scrutiny of crypto mining's energy consumption and environmental impact could delay approvals or impose costly compliance burdens. Third, Bitcoin's price volatility—down 50% in 2024—remains a wildcard, though the Texas facility's diversification into HPC hosting mitigates this exposure. Finally, the NYSE's listing requirements, particularly around liquidity and financial thresholds, could scupper the deal if not met.

Investment Thesis: A High-Beta Play with Asymmetric UpsideFor investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure growth, SGN offers a leveraged entry point. The stock's 150% surge post-announcement reflects its beta nature, but the asymmetric return profile is undeniable:- Upside: If the merger clears regulatory hurdles and the Texas facility achieves full capacity, the $25 million EBITDA target could be surpassed, unlocking the earnout and potentially tripling the company's valuation.- Downside: Failure to secure shareholder or regulatory approval would likely collapse the stock to pre-announcement levels (~$0.50), though SGN's existing sports business retains minimal value.  

A disciplined investor might consider a position in SGN with a tight stop-loss at $1.50 (25% below current levels), targeting a $3.50 price by year-end if the S-4 is approved. However, this is a high-risk, high-reward trade suited only to those comfortable with volatility and regulatory uncertainty.

In conclusion, BlockchAIn's merger with Signing Day Sports represents a speculative yet intellectually coherent bet on the future of energy-efficient digital infrastructure. While the path is fraught with execution risks, the combination of One Blockchain's profitability, scalable projects, and the SEC's procedural progress creates a compelling—if precarious—opportunity. For those willing to take the leap, SGN could be the beta play of 2025—if the hurdles are cleared.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

SharpLink Gaming Ltd. has made a significant investment in the cryptocurrency market by purchasing 10,000 ETH from the Ethereum Foundation. The acquisition, valued at approximately $25.7 million, was completed through an over-the-counter deal at a price of $2,572.37 per ETH. This move highlights the growing institutional adoption of Ethereum and underscores the company's long-term commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem.

Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and Co-Founder of Ethereum, emphasized that this acquisition is not a speculative trade but a strategic investment aimed at bolstering Ethereum's network security through staking initiatives. By staking and restaking the acquired ETH, SharpLink aims to reduce the circulating supply, thereby supporting the network's value proposition and decentralization. This move positions SharpLink as the largest publicly traded company to adopt Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset, setting a precedent for other corporations to follow suit.

The Ethereum Foundation, based in Zug, Switzerland, plays a crucial role in the development and growth of the Ethereum protocol. The foundation provides funding, coordination, and guidance to developers, researchers, and innovators, ensuring the continued evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum is widely recognized as the leading blockchain platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications, driving the growth of the Web3 economy.

SharpLink Gaming, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is at the forefront of the digital capital landscape. The company's strategic move to adopt Ethereum as its primary treasury reserve asset offers investors a unique opportunity to engage with the leading smart-contract platform. Beyond its financial strategy, SharpLink is reimagining the future of online gaming and sports betting. With a veteran team experienced in sports media, gaming, and technology, SharpLink is developing scalable, secure, and transparent solutions that challenge traditional models and bring innovation to the betting experience. By leveraging smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and Web3 infrastructure, SharpLink aims to transform the multi-billion-dollar iGaming industry into a more dynamic, efficient, and equitable ecosystem.

This acquisition underscores SharpLink's commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem and its role as a responsible industry steward. By increasing its ETH holdings and actively participating in staking, SharpLink is contributing to the long-term strength and decentralization of the Ethereum network. This move not only benefits SharpLink but also supports the broader Ethereum community, reinforcing the platform's position as a leader in the blockchain space.

In response to the acquisition, the Ethereum price surged 7.4% to $3,000, indicating growing institutional interest and investor confidence. This price increase, despite a 51.52% drop in 24-hour volume, highlights the significant impact of SharpLink's investment on the market. The acquisition is the largest public direct Ethereum treasury acquisition, paralleling Bitcoin's rise in corporate treasuries with entities like MicroStrategy. This move could precipitate further treasury allocations by corporations, potentially impacting Ethereum's price appreciation trend and prompting tailored crypto-asset oversight to assure market stability.

Joseph Lubin's insights into the long-term implications of this acquisition indicate a shift in how corporations view Ethereum. This move could lead to a more stable and secure market environment, with increased network security and value proposition. SharpLink's commitment to the Ethereum ecosystem sets a precedent for how mission-driven organizations can collaborate to advance shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment, and protocol-native finance.

I'm the AI strategist in your corner, turning dry economic data into actionable intelligence for your portfolio.

The crypto world is rarely short on spectacle, but few moments in recent memory have captured the interplay of branding, institutional validation, and meme-driven momentum quite like Coinbase's July 11, 2025, switch to a Pudgy Penguins NFT as its Twitter profile picture. What began as a cheeky nod to the project's community quickly snowballed into a $1.4 billion market cap surge for the PENGU token, a 690% spike in NFT trading volume, and a landmark SEC acknowledgment for an ETF proposal tied to the asset. This wasn't just a PR stunt—it was a masterclass in how strategic branding and institutional overtures can catalyze value in the crypto space.  

The Social Media Pivot: AlexOnChain's Influence and Coinbase's New PlaybookThe avatar change was orchestrated during a brief account takeover by AlexOnChain, a pseudonymous crypto influencer known for his viral Twitter threads. Far from a hack, it was a calculated move: Coinbase swiftly hired AlexOnChain as its first “CT Lead” (a nod to the “Chief Twitter” role popularized by Elon Musk), signaling a shift toward more direct, community-driven communication.  

The results were immediate. PENGU's price surged 60% within hours of the “new pfp, who dis” caption, while the floor price of Pudgy Penguins NFTs jumped from 9 ETH to 11.58 ETH. The move underscored a broader trend: crypto firms are increasingly leveraging social media influencers and NFT communities to drive token adoption. Coinbase's pivot—blending meme culture with institutional credibility—highlighted how brands can amplify value through alignment with engaged, decentralized audiences.  

 

The ETF Multiplier: Regulatory Validation Meets Meme MomentumThe PENGU rally wasn't just about hype. On July 12, the U.S. Securities and and Exchange Commission acknowledged Canary Capital's filing for a PENGU ETF, which seeks to provide 80%-95% exposure to PENGU and related NFT assets. This marked a critical inflection point: PENGU became only the second meme coin (after Dogecoin) to gain such regulatory traction in the U.S.  

The ETF's potential approval acts as a catalyst for institutional capital, which has long been hesitant to embrace meme-driven assets. . Analysts like Ali Martinez at CryptoMetrics estimate PENGU could hit $0.060 by August 2025—a 216% gain from its July 12 high—if the ETF gains momentum. The ETF's structure also addresses a key pain point for institutional investors: access to NFTs, which are traditionally illiquid and complex to value.  

The NFT Floor Surge and the Long/Short Ratio: A Bullish SignalThe Pudgy Penguins project itself became a beneficiary of Coinbase's endorsement. Trading volumes for the NFTs skyrocketed 690% in 24 hours, while the long/short ratio on Binance for PENGU hit 1.025—a bullish indicator signaling retail and institutional buyers are accumulating ahead of potential ETF inflows.  

This dynamic reveals a critical insight: NFT communities can now serve as both brand ambassadors and price drivers for tokens. Coinbase's move to adopt a Pudgy Penguin avatar wasn't just a marketing gimmick—it was a statement that NFTs are becoming core to crypto branding, with their ownership and liquidity directly tied to token value.  

The Bear Case: Volatility and the ETF HurdleOf course, skeptics will point to PENGU's decline to $0.0104 by February 2025—a 30% drop from its January peak—as proof of meme coins' inherent volatility. But this overlooks the broader arc: the July surge demonstrated how strategic branding and regulatory milestones can create durable catalysts. The ETF's fate remains pivotal—approval would lock in institutional demand, while rejection could spark a prolonged selloff.  

Investors should also monitor the NFT floor price of Pudgy Penguins. . If the floor holds above 10 ETH amid token price weakness, it suggests community loyalty is intact—a key buffer against bearish pressure.  

Investment Thesis: Capitalize on Early MomentumThe Coinbase/PENGU saga offers a blueprint for investors: look for projects where institutional players are aligning with meme-driven communities through branding, and where regulatory tailwinds (like ETFs) are on the horizon. PENGU's current price of $0.019 (as of July 7, 2025) sits below its July highs but offers asymmetric upside if the ETF gains traction.  

The key risks are clear: regulatory delays, NFT liquidity constraints, and meme fatigue. But the rewards are equally compelling: PENGU's market cap could approach $2 billion if the ETF is approved, while broader adoption of NFT-based branding could push the token into the crypto mainstream.  

Conclusion: The New Crypto Branding PlaybookCoinbase's Pudgy Penguin pivot isn't just a quirky anecdote—it's a sign of crypto's evolving maturity. Brands are now leveraging NFT communities as both marketing channels and value drivers, while institutional players are using ETFs to bridge the gap between meme-driven assets and traditional finance. Investors who identify these early-stage catalysts—whether through social media moves, regulatory nods, or NFT liquidity—will be positioned to profit as crypto's next wave unfolds.  

In the meme-to-ETF pipeline, Coinbase has set a template. The question now is: who's next?

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Pump.fun, a meme coin platform built on the Solana blockchain, has set a new record in the cryptocurrency market by completing one of the fastest and largest Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) in history. The platform successfully sold 125 billion PUMP tokens, raising an impressive $500 million in just 12 minutes. This achievement highlights the surging interest and investment in the meme coin sector, particularly among large investors, commonly referred to as "whales."

The public token sale, which excluded participants from the U.S. and required full Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance, offered 33% of PUMP's total supply with no lock-up period. The tokens were priced at $0.004 each, and the company had initially aimed to raise $600 million from the offering. The rapid sell-out of the presale indicates a high level of enthusiasm and trust in the Pump.fun platform and its native token, PUMP. This success also suggests that whales are actively seeking opportunities in the meme coin space, despite potential concerns about the long-term prospects of these tokens.

Pump.fun gained prominence in 2024 as the go-to platform for creating Solana-based meme coins. However, with this ICO, the company aims to move beyond meme culture, outlining plans to build a decentralized alternative to mainstream social platforms. The platform's ability to generate significant revenue through memecoin launches demonstrates its potential to build a decentralized social network and foster a vibrant community around its tokens.

Momentum had been building ahead of the July 12 launch. Earlier in the week, Pump.fun acquired Kolscan, a Solana wallet tracker that ranks key opinion leaders (KOLs) based on their trading performance. The new feature will enable users to analyze top investor strategies in real-time, a compelling tool for retail traders seeking to track whale activity. This strategic move further solidifies Pump.fun's position in the market and enhances its platform to attract more investors.

Several whales placed large bets ahead of the ICO. According to Lookonchain data from July 12, three major wallets deposited around $7 million USDC into Hyperliquid, opening long positions on PUMP. One of these whales, known for turning a $1.19 million investment in Official Trump (TRUMP) into $438 million, created a new wallet and deposited $1 million USDC into the PUMP presale. Not all bets were bullish, however. Another whale reportedly shorted PUMP using $8 million USDC at 2x leverage. By press time, the position was sitting on an unrealized loss of $800,000, with a looming liquidation price of $0.008513.

With the ICO and market sentiment broadly bullish, all eyes are on how PUMP will perform in the days ahead. The rapid sell-out of the PUMP token presale and the involvement of prominent whales indicate a strong appetite for meme coins among large investors. This trend is likely to continue as more platforms and tokens enter the market, driven by the potential for high returns and the growing interest in decentralized finance. However, investors should remain cautious and conduct thorough research before participating in ICOs, as the meme coin market is known for its volatility and speculative nature.

12 minutes. 

That's how long it took for Pump.fun's token offering to raise roughly $500 million from retail investors across various exchanges, including Bybit, Kraken, and KuCoin.

The sale priced 125 billion tokens at $0.004 apiece, implying a $4 billion fully diluted valuation for the Solana-based memecoin launcher's new utility token.

For now, holders must wait to get their hands on the token they bought. 

Pump.fun said the purchased tokens will land in wallets over the next 48–72 hours and will stay locked until distribution ends, blocking trades or transfers. 

The team shared the official Solana contract address— pumpCmXqMfrsAkQ5r49WcJnRayYRqmXz6ae8H7H9Dfn— and warned users to shun look-alike assets.

In total, Pump.fun's ICO was set to sell 33% of PUMP's 1 trillion token supply, with 18% having already been allocated earlier via a private sale. The public allocation was recently lowered from 15% to 12.5%, which sold out in just 12 minutes.

Its other allocations include 20% for the team behind the project, 24% for community and ecosystem incentives, 13% for existing investors, 2.6% for liquidity, 2.4% for an ecosystem fund, with the remaining for a foundation fund and live streaming incentives.

Pump.fun allows anyone to mint and list a coin with a new token in a few clicks. When a freshly minted token reaches a specific threshold, it gets listed on decentralized exchanges.

The sale comes as the token launchpad's metrics show a deepening decline in activity. DeFiLlama data shows that in January Pump.fun's launchpad volume was above $11.6 billion, and has since been steadily declining to $3.65 billion last month.

Similarly, revenue generated via the launchpad dropped from $133 million in the first month of the year to nearly $34 million last month, according to DeFiLlama data.

While launchpad volumes plunged, Pump.fun's decentralized exchange PumpSwap, which was launched in March, has been making up for the decline, seeing $14.3 billion of volume in May and $10 billion last month. Revenue for PumpSwap stood at $7 and $5 million for those months, per the same data source.

Bitcoin mining firm, BTC Digital (BTCT), has moved $1 million of company cash into ether (ETH), which it called its new “digital gold.”

BTCT Moved $1M Into Ethereum Reserve, chief executive officer Siguang Peng said in a press release, adding that Ethereum has “emerged as the foundation of on-chain USD settlement and value transfer.”

"By securing an initial $1 million ETH reserve today—and with plans to scale that position—we are proactively positioning ourselves for decentralized finance, stablecoin issuance, and asset tokenization,” Peng said. 

BTCT plans to grow the reserve as upgrades lift capacity and U.S. rules solidify. BTC Digital was previously a bitcoin mining company. The firm recently said that "its 20 MW large–scale cryptocurrency mining project in Georgia has reached a significant milestone."

The company doesn't state if it still plans to mine bitcoin, but said it is "building on its origins in large–scale crypto mining, BTCT is undergoing a strategic evolution from "hash–rate provider" to "on–chain financial infrastructure participant," in the press release. 

BTC Digital is the second publicly traded bitcoin miner turning to an ether treasury. Earlier this month Bit Digital (BTBT) shifted its entire treasury from BTC to ETH as it moved to a staking strategy. The move saw its stock jump up to 30%. It has since corrected in a nearly 20% drop. 

Meanwhile, BTCT's stock closed Friday's trading session 13% higher. 

Publicly-known ether treasuries, which include the treasuries of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), Layer-2 networks, and publicly-traded firms, currently hold more than 1.34 million ETH, according to a public tracker.

The Conscience of Thoroughbred Racing



By HRI Foreign Staff — In a bold return to the digital track, Virtually Human Studio has officially rebooted its famed Web3 horse racing game Zed Run as the newly launched Zed Champions: a skill-based, 24/7 virtual horse racing ecosystem built for a new era of strategy, ownership, and blockchain integration. The game is currently in beta, and excitement is mounting in both Web3 and horse betting communities. Designed around dynamic breeding, automated race schedules, and $ZED token integration, Zed Champions is not just a visual or technical update; it's a complete overhaul aimed at sustainability and deeper engagemen

Zed Run had once been a beacon of innovation in the NFT world, having processed over $400 million in digital horse transactions and bred more than 420,000 racehorses. But like many NFT platforms, it stumbled during the market's downturn. Zed Champions is VHS's answer to those challenges, as a refined, skill-based model that discourages speculation and favors strategic play. With features like auction-based breeding, leaderboard scoring, and race-driven rewards, players are now invited to manage virtual stables like a fantasy sports team, without needing to manually schedule races.

What sets Zed Champions apart is its continuous ecosystem: a race every 80 seconds, around the clock, driven entirely by blockchain. Digital horses are matched based on real-time balance performance, and players can boost horses using Augments, which are special modifiers that influence performance in subtle but critical ways. For Web2 holdouts or crypto newcomers, VHS has introduced Zed Picks, a companion mobile app that allows spectators to cheer on horses, place bets using virtual currency, and win sweepstakes prizes with no crypto wallet required.

As the game moves into full launch, many in the industry are watching Zed Champions closely as a test case for the future of NFT-powered sports. Among them is Americas Cardroom, whose adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain tools was directly inspired by the early success of Zed Run.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNcwuY4uiuc&t=2039s

For Americas Cardroom CEO Phil Nagy, the connection between poker and digital horse racing was not immediately obvious until poker legend Chris Moneymaker introduced him to Zed Run. “In typical Phil fashion, he ignored it for weeks,” Americas Cardroom Pro Moneymaker said in a recent interview. “And then he was, like, ‘Why didn't you tell me about this before?' He totally got it.”

That revelation would end up transforming the way Americas Cardroom approached payment processing and community engagement. Moneymaker, famous for catalyzing the online poker boom with his 2003 World Series of Poker win, saw clear parallels between blockchain gaming and poker: both are strategy-driven, decentralized, and benefit immensely from instant, secure money transfers. Once introduced to crypto, blockchain, and NFTs, Nagy immersed himself in the technology. He set up servers, built e-wallet knowledge, and began experimenting with real-world applications. The result? Americas Cardroom quickly became one of the most crypto-integrated poker platforms in the world. Today, you can play poker on the site with the option to use over 60 different cryptocurrencies, from Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known altcoins, making cross-border transactions seamless and instant.

This has proven especially valuable in the poker world, where quick liquidity is often the difference between joining a game or missing out. “You can pay customers in seconds,” said Nagy. “They can deposit fast; there are no fees or delays you get with other payment processors.” His vision goes even further. Nagy believes NFTs can serve as a transparent ledger for tournament records, player identities, and digital collectibles.

While some online casinos have treated NFTs as temporary fads or promotional gimmicks, Americas Cardroom has looked at blockchain with a more positive outlook. Nagy, Moneymaker, and the rest of the Americas Cardroom team see a future where digital ownership intersects with competitive play, and the original spark came from the virtual world of Zed Run.

Digital horse racing is no longer just a niche curiosity. It's rapidly evolving into a vibrant subsection of the sports betting and gaming industry, thanks to NFT-driven platforms like Zed Champions, Game of Silks, and Stables.

Take Game of Silks, for example, which tokenizes the annual crop of real-world US thoroughbreds and converts them into tradeable in-game NFTs. Players who own a Silks horse receive rewards when their real-world counterpart wins races or produces offspring. It's a “play-to-earn” model with real-life stakes, which has attracted over 25,000 players worldwide. In partnership with the New York Racing Association, Game of Silks is helping traditional horse racing tap into younger, tech-savvy audiences without compromising the sport's integrity.

Meanwhile, in Europe, France's Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) launched Stables, an NFT horse racing platform on the Tezos blockchain. The game uses historical racing data and advanced algorithms to simulate virtual races, allowing users to train and race their horses for digital and real-world prizes. Within days of launch, nearly 5,000 of the first 6,666 horse NFTs were sold, showing strong demand despite the broader NFT market's volatility.

Even brands like Stella Artois are experimenting with NFT horse racing campaigns — proof that this trend is entering mainstream advertising and branding circles. The convergence of horse racing, virtual reality, and NFTs is part of a long-term shift toward digital sports entertainment. For traditional bettors of an older generation, especially those familiar with horse betting and poker, the appeal lies in a familiar pastime reimagined for the digital age. The thrill of betting, the pride of owning a stable, and the excitement of strategy all remain intact, but now they come with the added bonus of ownership, liquidity, and borderless participation.

It's no surprise, then, that companies like Americas Cardroom are taking notes. As Web3 gaming continues to mature and as digital horse racing platforms refine their ecosystems, expect to see further crossover between poker and racing: two industries that thrive on competition, community, and chance. Zed Champions may just be the frontrunner in this movement, but it's not racing alone. And with poker powerhouses like Americas Cardroom galloping into the NFT and crypto space, the finish line is only the beginning.

Coinbase broke with its usual blue logo on X, posting a Pudgy Penguins non-fungible token as its profile picture alongside the quip “new pfp, who dis.”

new pfp, who dis

Minutes later, PENGU, the native token of the penguin-themed ecosystem, started surging. The token rose more than 60% in the rally before enduring a correction, but it's still up more than 35% for the week.

The official Pudgy Penguins account mirrored the move, sending matching ice-blue avatars gliding across feeds and leading to talk of a partnership between Coinbase and Igloo Inc., the startup that steers the collection. Various crypto-related firms, including VanEck, MoonPay, and AwakenTax, have since changed their profile pictures to pudgy penguins.

The stunt has also lifted the floor price of Pudgy Penguin NFTs, which was earlier this week around 9 ETH, and quickly jumped to 11.58 ETH according to NFTPriceFloor data. The volume for the project's NFTs grew nearly 690% in the last 24 hours.

Coinbase changed its profile picture during a short account takeover from pseudonymous Crypto Twitter personality AlexOnChain, who previously led the social media account of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance for four years.

After the takeover, Coinbase revealed they're hiring AlexOnChain as their first full-time “CT Lead.”

“The new focus is making comms more social native - direct, transparent, and engaging. That's the path to building a bigger appreciation for everything they've contributed to this space (which is a lot), and to help reconnect with ct,” Alex said in a post. “It's a big job, it won't be easy, and that's why I took it.”

PENGU's price rise also comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Canary Capital's filing for a spot PENGU ETF.

Major cryptocurrencies, excluding XRP, registered moderate losses as President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from Mexico and the European Union (EU).

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

"Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough," Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal.

Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal.

Bitcoin BTC$117,407.29, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $117,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $118,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multiple times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing.

The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend.

"Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today. Then Asia comes in late on Sunday evening and buys ALL the Bitcoin, and we break through $120k," the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said on X.

UPDATE (July 12, 16:56 UTC): Corrects bitcoin price in 5th paragraph.

Major cryptocurrencies, excluding XRP, registered moderate losses as President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on imports from Mexico and the European Union (EU).

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account.

"Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough," Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal.

Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal.

Bitcoin BTC$117,400.53, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $117,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $118,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multiple times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show.

Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing.

The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend.

"Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today. Then Asia comes in late on Sunday evening and buys ALL the Bitcoin, and we break through $120k," the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said on X.

UPDATE (July 12, 16:56 UTC): Corrects bitcoin price in 5th paragraph.

At the time of writing, bitcoin BTC$117,407.29 is hovering around the $118,000 level, flirting with the idea of setting a new all-time high this weekend.

On Friday, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) had reached an important milestone at the close of trading on the previous day, becoming the fastest ETF to reach $80 billion in assets under management (AUM). The second fastest ETF to achieve this level was Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which reached it in 1,814 days.

This was the same day on which we saw bitcoin set a new all-time high of $118,667.

During interviews with CNBC and Yahoo Finance, Bitwise Asset Management CIO Matt Hougan said his firm expects the BTC price to reach over $200,000 by the end of this year.

As for how high bitcoin could go, hedge fund manager James Lavish says that the bitcoin price is similar to the U.S. debt ceiling in that, ultimately, there is no limit.

 Asia's regulatory frameworks in tokenization are attracting global investors, with Japan and Hong Kong setting the pace for real-world asset adoption. 

Asia's leadership in tokenization is drawing growing attention from global investors, with regulatory clarity in the region attracting capital that was once on the sidelines, according to Maarten Henskens, head of protocol growth at Startale Group.

“We're seeing Western institutions set up Asia-Pacific operations not just to follow capital, but to participate in innovation,” he told Cointelegraph. Henskens pointed out the distinct yet complementary approaches taken by Japan and Hong Kong to advance real-world asset (RWA) adoption.

Japan's regulatory framework has been deliberate and forward-looking, establishing a strong foundation of institutional trust. “MUFG's infrastructure for security token issuance is a good example of how the ecosystem is maturing,” he noted.

Japan's Payment Services Act (PSA) also allows trusted stablecoins to hold up to 50% of their reserves in low-risk government bonds and term deposits, demonstrating a thoughtful approach to regulation.

Hong Kong, by contrast, has moved swiftly, launching the Ensemble Sandbox as a fast-track regulatory innovation hub. “While Japan is building long-term depth, Hong Kong is showing how agility can bring experimentation to life,” Henskens said.

The rise of tokenized bonds and ETFs is playing a key role in bringing traditional investors into crypto markets. In Japan, real estate security tokens are making previously closed markets accessible to retail investors, sometimes more so than traditional J-REITs.

Tokenization streamlines fund administration and increases transparency, allowing asset managers to connect directly with end-users. “This efficiency, paired with improved transparency, could make these products compelling to traditional investors who might not otherwise enter the crypto space,” Henskens said.

He flagged cross-border interoperability as the next major milestone. “Seamless and compliant movement of tokenized assets across jurisdictions” will be critical for scaling adoption.

In Asia, this means linking infrastructure across countries like Japan and Hong Kong, while globally, regulatory frameworks must reflect the technical realities of tokenized finance, especially around settlement, compliance, and custody.

Dubai has been another Asian country making strides in tokenization. The city's regulatory authorities have introduced progressive frameworks that encourage the issuance and trading of tokenized securities, attracting global investors and fintech firms.

In May, the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, Dubai's crypto regulator, updated its guidelines to include provisions for RWA tokenization. Lawyer Irina Heaver told Cointelegraph these rules give issuers and exchanges a clear path to launch and trade tokenized real estate assets. 

Last month, the Dubai Land Department, in collaboration with VARA and top developers, successfully tokenized and sold two apartments, with the entire offering selling out within minutes, according to Heaver. Buyers came from over 35 countries, and notably, 70% were first-time real estate investors in Dubai.

“We're already seeing a network effect: innovation in one jurisdiction sparks progress in another,” Henskens said. “Different regions may optimize for different outcomes, and that's a strength, not a liability,” he added.

Bitcoin has rocketed higher this week, soaring after Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirmed a bitcoin bombshell.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has hit a new all-time high of almost $119,000 per bitcoin—lifting Ripple's XRP, ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies that have surged toward a combined market capitalization of $4 trillion—as the Wall Street “floodgates” are predicted to open.

Now, as investors declare a $37 trillion “emergency,” U.S. president Donald Trump has helped spur the crypto market higher, warning the Federal Reserve should “rapidly” lower interest rates.

“Crypto, ‘through the roof,'” Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding the country is “now back” and the Federal Reserve should "rapidly" lower interest rates as there's “no inflation.”

The crypto market, which remains dominated by bitcoin, has added $1.2 trillion since crashing to its April lows and is now just $250 billion away from $4 trillion as ethereum and Ripple's XRP make huge gains.

Ethereum is up almost 20% over the last week, while XRP has surged almost 30%, despite the Fed leaving interest rates on hold this year.

Last month, Trump posted that the Federal Reserve board should “activate," forcing Fed chair Jerome Powell, who he's branded “too late,” to cut rates by "at least two to three points," and “save the U.S. more than $800 billion per year," spent on servicing the U.S. debt pile.

Powell, who Trump has threatened to fire, kept interest rates on hold again last month after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that's been put on pause due to fears Trump's global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation—which has yet to emerge.

The market is overwhelmingly expecting the Fed to leave interest rates on hold at its July meeting in just under three weeks time, according to CME's FedWatch tracker, though traders are now betting on a September cut.

“Signals of forthcoming Fed rate cuts have buoyed investor sentiment, given that a cut is now more likely than ever and greatly needed," James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments.

The crypto market's move higher has been helped by the slow build of pressure created by bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and bitcoin treasury companies led by Michael Saylor's Strategy, which have been buying up huge swaths of bitcoin and inspiring companies to try creating similar supply pressure by buying ethereum, XRP and others.

“In bitcoin's case, the rally is being driven not only by expectations of Fed rate cuts, but also by continued inflows into U.S. spot ETFs, corporate treasury buying, and a weaker U.S. dollar,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“The price surge we've seen [this week] is seemingly driven by a confluence of macroeconomic optimism and significant institutional activity in the form of ETF inflows and sovereign and corporate balance sheet allocations," Toledano added.

Home - Reviews - Midnight Network Review: Blockchain Privacy and Real-World Compliance

The fundamental right to privacy faces unprecedented challenges in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape. Midnight Network represents a groundbreaking approach to confidential interactions on distributed ledgers. It offers a path toward preserving essential freedoms without sacrificing functionality or compliance.







Midnight Network is an innovative blockchain platform created to tackle the important issue of data privacy and confidentiality in the digital realm. Developed by Input Output Global, the creators of Cardano, it aims to provide a secure environment where individuals and businesses can interact and transact while maintaining control over their sensitive information. The Midnight Network seeks to establish a new standard where fundamental freedoms are protected by default within a decentralized framework.

At its core, Midnight Network prioritizes protecting sensitive personal and commercial data. It enables users to shield details they wish to keep private, ensuring that only necessary information is revealed for specific interactions or compliance requirements.  This focus on selective disclosure allows for confidential transactions and data sharing, empowering users to participate in the blockchain ecosystem without compromising their privacy or exposing proprietary business logic.



The governance and strategic direction of the Midnight ecosystem are overseen by the Midnight Foundation. This independent entity is dedicated to guiding Midnight towards full decentralization, fostering community involvement, and ensuring the network adheres to its core principles of privacy, security, and open participation. The Foundation's role is crucial in building trust and ensuring the platform evolves in line with its foundational vision.

Beyond its technological infrastructure, Midnight Network is focused on cultivating a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. This involves attracting developers to build privacy-preserving dApps, encouraging enterprises to leverage its capabilities for secure data handling, and fostering a community of users who value data sovereignty. The goal is to create a sustainable and innovative environment where privacy is a fundamental right enabled by blockchain technology.







Midnight Network leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), specifically ZK-SNARKs, to validate transactions without exposing underlying data. This technology separates information into public and private components: public data is recorded on-chain for auditability, while private details remain encrypted and stored locally on users' devices. 

By processing proofs off-chain and verifying them on-chain, Midnight ensures sensitive information never compromises user privacy or regulatory compliance.

The network operates via a cooperative tokenomics system featuring two distinct assets:

Midnight's evolution toward full autonomy is stewarded by the Midnight Foundation, which initially oversees protocol upgrades, treasury management, and ecosystem development. 

Governance authority gradually transitions to $NIGHT token holders via on-chain voting, enabling community-driven control over network parameters, incentives, and compliance frameworks. This phased approach ensures security and transparency while aligning with decentralization principles.

Applications built on Midnight integrate modular smart contracts that enable selective data sharing. Users or enterprises can programmatically define what information to disclose, to whom, and under which conditions. This “rational privacy” model supports compliance with regulations like KYC by disclosing only necessary attestations, not raw data while keeping all other inputs confidential.







The NIGHT token serves as the main utility token for the Midnight Network, created to manage and support its privacy-focused ecosystem. Holders use NIGHT to participate in on-chain voting, influencing protocol upgrades, treasury management, and network parameters. 

In addition to governance, NIGHT allows users to create $DUST, a secure resource that facilitates private transactions and smart contracts. This positions NIGHT as both a governance instrument and a utility backbone, ensuring the network evolves under decentralized community control while maintaining operational efficiency.

NIGHT features a fixed total supply of 24 billion tokens, distributed through a multi-phased model prioritizing broad accessibility:

NIGHT presents compelling opportunities but carries inherent risks. Its value proposition includes:

In addition to governance and tokenomics, NIGHT supports Midnight's goal for a cross-chain privacy economy. It facilitates interoperability, such as enabling XRP holders to participate in DeFi via confidential smart contracts without moving assets off-chain. 

This positions NIGHT as a catalyst for privacy-focused innovation across major blockchain ecosystems, potentially reshaping how sensitive data is managed in Web3. Its strategic distribution across 37 million wallets further amplifies network effects and real-world testing.







Cardano serves as the foundational layer and strategic incubator for Midnight, positioning it as Cardano's inaugural “partner chain.” Unlike traditional sidechains, Midnight operates as an independent blockchain with its own tokenomics and governance but leverages Cardano's decentralized infrastructure, particularly its Stake Pool Operators (SPOs). 

These SPOs can validate Midnight transactions, earning rewards while bolstering network security without compromising Cardano's operations. This symbiotic relationship allows Midnight to inherit Cardano's battle-tested security while specializing in programmable data privacy for RWAs and enterprises.

Midnight Network pioneers a vital reconciliation of confidentiality and functionality within decentralized systems. By embedding privacy as a programmable right rather than an optional feature, it empowers users and enterprises to harness blockchain's potential without sacrificing security or compliance.

The CEO of Franklin Templeton traveled to Zurich for a confidential exchange with leading figures of the Swiss blockchain scene.

It was an extraordinarily exclusive group that gathered for lunch at Zurich's Hotel Storchen in early June: the leaders of twelve prominent Swiss blockchain firms accepted the invitation from Jenny Johnson, CEO of U.S. asset manager Franklin Templeton. Johnson flew in from New York specifically for the meeting.

The key condition for the gathering: absolute confidentiality. There is no official memo or protocol. «It was an informal exchange among industry leaders,» emphasized Christian Leger, Head of Franklin Templeton Switzerland, in a statement to finews.com.

Main Topic: Asset Tokenization

Tokenization of assets was the central theme of the meeting.

Franklin Templeton is highly active in this field—both in building blockchain infrastructure and launching products.

In 2021, the company launched the world's first investment fund using public blockchain technology for transaction processing. It maps a traditional investment product, in this case a money market fund, onto blockchain networks and issues digital tokens representing real fund shares. One share of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) equals one Benji token.

While Benji, the abbreviation for this fund, was created for U.S. investors, the firm launched a UCITS version of Benji in February this year. Again, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FTOCF) was a first of its kind. It is the first fully tokenized UCITS product on a public blockchain. The company set up its own blockchain infrastructure in Luxembourg—the Benji platform—for this purpose.

Jenny Johnson Pushing Ahead

Since taking office in 2020, Johnson has been driving the topic of tokenization with determination. She believes this technology will fundamentally transform asset management within just a few years.

With around 50 in-house experts and the central Benji platform, Franklin Templeton is emerging as a strong player in the blockchain industry. The firm also serves as a node validator, meaning it participates in validating crypto transactions on 12 blockchains.

Additionally, it manages a venture capital fund investing in the blockchain ecosystem and offers advisory services for cryptocurrency investments.

Switzerland Takes a Leading Role

That the summit took place in Zurich is hardly surprising. Switzerland is regarded as one of the most advanced and deeply integrated markets for digital assets worldwide. It is home to international players such as Ethereum, Cosmos (Interchain Foundation), Solana, Aave, and 21Shares, and actively promotes collaboration within the Web3 sector. The market capitalization of the platforms based in Switzerland is estimated in the billions—just like the Bitcoin wealth held in the country.

Traditional and decentralized financial systems (TradFi and DeFi) are increasingly merging. While many Swiss banks initially approached digitalization hesitantly—incurring opportunity costs—they are now catching up: most are working on digital infrastructures, and some are already issuing tokenized products. Meanwhile, DeFi firms are cooperating more closely with traditional financial actors and expanding internationally—especially toward the Middle East and Asia.

Franklin Templeton operates globally at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi. After launching Benji in the U.S. and Europe, Singapore is next. In May, the company received approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore to launch the Franklin OnChain U.S. Dollar Short-Term Money Market Fund—the first tokenized fund accessible to retail investors in Singapore.

Still Silent on Swiss Plans

And what are the concrete plans for Switzerland?

«We are not speaking publicly about concrete plans for Switzerland at this time,» says Christian Leger. «But tokenization is a long-term process. We're still in the early stages—and we're pursuing it consistently. Switzerland will always play a central role in that.»

 Crypto analyst Matthew Hyland suggests altcoins will be “ripping” much more when Bitcoin Dominance drops to 45%. 

A crypto analyst suggests altcoins may have plenty more upside, as many are already surging without pulling much market share from Bitcoin.

“BTC dominance hasn't even sneezed and Alts are ripping,” crypto analyst Matthew Hyland said in an X post on Friday. 

TradingView shows Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance is 64.46% at the time of publication, down just 1.53% over the past week, while altcoins saw significant price spikes amid Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs on Wednesday, Thursday, and reaching $118,760 on Friday.

Hyland said, “What do you think happens if it drops from 65 to 45.”

Analysts have traditionally used Bitcoin Dominance to gauge the timing of altcoin season, with a decline typically seen as a signal that altcoins are gaining market share.

However, while BTC Dominance stayed relatively steady, the recent altcoin surge could signal that fresh capital is flowing into the wider market.

MemeCore (M) leads the top 100 crypto gainers over the past seven days with a 1,263% surge, followed by Mog Coin (MOG) up 75.01%, and Stellar (XLM) up 67.43%, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Ether (ETH), the second largest crypto by market cap, is up 17.68% over the past seven days, which is often another indicator traders use to determine when the focus is turning from Bitcoin to the broader market.

The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether's relative strength against Bitcoin, is up 8.39% over the past seven days.

However, CoinMarketCap's Altcoin Season Index suggests the market is still heavily favoring Bitcoin, with the Index reading a “Bitcoin Season” score of 29 out of 100. 

In an X post on Friday, MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe said, “I assume that we're about to witness the final easy and biggest bull ever on Altcoins.”

Meanwhile, Santiment recently said that their metrics indicate that the altcoin season has begun. “The data confirms that, for now, it has,” Santiment said.

“As long as Bitcoin can maintain its position above the crucial psychological support level of around $110k, traders will likely feel comfortable redistributing profits into altcoins,” they added.

(Kitco News) - G-Knot, a biometrics technology innovator, has unveiled plans for the world's first finger vein biometric crypto wallet, aiming to revolutionize security in digital asset storage. This launch coincides with the appointment of fintech veteran Wes Kaplan as CEO, who will guide the commercialization of the technology.

Company Overview and Mission

As the exclusive licensee of eTunnel Inc.—a Seoul-based leader in finger vein biometrics with over 10 years of R&D—G-Knot is dedicated to harnessing unforgeable internal vein patterns for enhanced digital security. The company's mission addresses critical vulnerabilities in cryptocurrency, where hacks have exceeded $1.4 billion in losses in 2025 alone. By replacing traditional private keys and recovery phrases with biometric authentication, G-Knot seeks to simplify self-custody while extending applications to decentralized finance (DeFi) and identity management for consumers and enterprises.

Leadership Transition

Wes Kaplan, with a background in fintech and crypto from roles at Cointelegraph, AscendEX, and Tradewind Markets, as well as traditional finance at J.P. Morgan and BNY Mellon, steps in as CEO. Kaplan aims to scale the technology's adoption, stating: “G-Knot is poised to redefine security in the digital age... By replacing the need for recovery phrases with users' unique biometric authentication, we're not only solving today's issues but also paving the way for broader applications in decentralized finance and identity management.”

The Core Technology: Finger Vein Biometrics Explained



Finger vein recognition operates by using near-infrared light to illuminate and capture the unique vein patterns beneath the skin's surface. Veins absorb the light, creating a high-contrast image that is then processed via pattern recognition algorithms for authentication. This internal biometric is contactless or minimally invasive, requiring no physical touch, which enhances hygiene and usability.

Key advantages include superior accuracy and spoof resistance compared to surface-based methods like fingerprints, as vein patterns are hidden and require live blood flow for detection (ensuring "aliveness"). They remain permanent throughout life, offer low false acceptance rates, and are resilient to external factors like dirt or scars. However, potential drawbacks involve higher implementation costs due to specialized hardware, possible challenges for users with circulatory issues, and general biometric concerns like privacy risks or false rejections in varying conditions.

In cryptocurrency contexts, this tech enables secure key generation directly from biometric data, often integrated with deep learning for robust cryptographic keys or blockchain systems to prevent linkage attacks. G-Knot's wallet leverages these features to provide enterprise-grade protection, drawing from eTunnel's proven track record, including a 2024 UN contract for biometric smart cards.

Youngkuk Kim, CEO of eTunnel, commented: “As eTunnel continues to advance biometric research, G-Knot... will leverage the gold standard of biometric technology to deliver enterprise-grade and consumer-focused products that address the growing security needs of an increasingly digital world.”

Future Prospects and Broader Impact

G-Knot positions itself as the global leader in commercial finger vein solutions, with the wallet as the first step toward expanded products in DeFi, identity verification, and beyond. This innovation could significantly reduce crypto fraud by making secure, user-friendly authentication accessible, while advancing biometric-blockchain integrations for a safer digital ecosystem.

Japan-based real estate investment firm Gates Inc. announced that it has partnered with the Oasys blockchain to tokenize 75 million dollars of income-generating properties in central Tokyo. Experts consider the project one of the largest real estate tokenization efforts in Japan, as it aims to increase liquidity and provide foreign investors with greater access to the Japanese market.


The project will be one of the first stages of tokenization of over 200 billion dollars or 1 percent of the roughly 20.5 trillion yen or 200 billion dollar Japanese real estate market. Gates also aims to make it easier to purchase and sell property using blockchain to avoid legal, regulatory, and language barriers that have ensnared the process of the foreign buyer in the past.

Gates will adopt the tokenization through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is set in a foreign land to comply with the local legislation. The partnership with Oasys is based on the blockchain-based platform originally targeting the gaming world, currently focused on the field of real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, and provides secure, scalable, and interoperable terms of token issuance.

The tokenized assets will allow any investors worldwide to buy, sell, and trade their real estate-backed tokens with Web3 wallets. The model reduces the barriers to entry, ensures that liquidity is maximized, with a vision to scale the liquidity of the token up to 34 billion in the initial stage.

Oasys has developed an EVM-compatible proof-of-stake network that provides the seamless migration of assets and wallet compatibility to help institutions to join tokenized real estate markets. Oasys leadership stated that they designed the platform to maximize compounding returns by automatically reinvesting returns.


Gates will aim to expand its tokenization efforts to other nations, primarily in the United States, Europe, the Philippines, and other Asian markets after its launch in Tokyo. The company is also exploring the use of Japanese intellectual property, like assets in the gaming and anime sectors, to diversify its real-world assets offerings through tokenization.

In 2024, Gates realized 145 million in revenues, and the prospective listing of the company on Nasdaq has shown that it wants to be a global market leader in asset tokenization. The project aligns with the growing global interest in tokenized real estate, which experts project to exceed 4 trillion dollars by 2035, as institutional investors pursue greater liquidity and efficiency.


By putting ownership on the blockchain, Gates will simplify investment, eliminating transaction expenses and opening up new pools of retail and institutional capital, anywhere in the world. The project will probably serve as a precedent to the real estate and digital asset industry in Japan and will lead to the adoption of blockchain technology in the traditional markets.

Pepper, the pet cat who made headlines last year for his role in the discovery of the first jeilongvirus found in the U.S., is at it again. This time, his hunting prowess contributed to the identification of a new strain of orthoreovirus.

John Lednicky, Ph.D., Pepper's owner and a University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions virologist, took Pepper's catch -- a dead Everglades short-tailed shrew -- into the lab for testing as part of his ongoing work to understand transmission of the mule deerpox virus.

Testing revealed the shrew had a previously unidentified strain of orthoreovirus. Viruses in this genus are known to infect humans, white-tailed deer, bats and other mammals. While orthoreoviruses' effects on humans are not yet well understood, there have been rare reports of the virus being associated with cases of encephalitis, meningitis and gastroenteritis in children.

"The bottom line is we need to pay attention to orthoreoviruses, and know how to rapidly detect them," said Lednicky, a research professor in the PHHP Department of Environmental and Global Health and a member of UF's Emerging Pathogens Institute.

The UF team published the complete genomic coding sequences for the virus they named "Gainesville shrew mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain UF-1" in the journal Microbiology Resource Announcements.

"There are many different mammalian orthoreoviruses and not enough is known about this recently identified virus to be concerned," said the paper's lead author Emily DeRuyter, a UF Ph.D. candidate in One Health. "Mammalian orthoreoviruses were originally considered to be 'orphan' viruses, present in mammals including humans, but not associated with diseases. More recently, they have been implicated in respiratory, central nervous system and gastrointestinal diseases."

The Lednicky lab's jeilongvirus and orthoreovirus discoveries come on the heels of the team publishing their discovery of two other novel viruses found in farmed white-tailed deer. Given the propensity of viruses to constantly evolve, paired with the team's sophisticated lab techniques, finding new viruses isn't entirely surprising, Lednicky said.

"I'm not the first one to say this, but essentially, if you look, you'll find, and that's why we keep finding all these new viruses," Lednicky said.

Like influenza virus, two different types of orthoreovirus can infect a host cell, causing the viruses' genes to mix and match, in essence, creating a brand new virus, Lednicky said.

In 2019, Lednicky and colleagues isolated the first orthoreovirus found in a deer. That strain's genes were nearly identical to an orthoreovirus found in farmed mink in China and a deathly ill lion in Japan. How in the world, the scientific community wondered, could the same hybrid virus appear in a farmed deer in Florida and two species of carnivores across the globe? Some experts speculated that components of the animals' feed could have come from the same manufacturer.

With so many unanswered questions about orthoreoviruses and their modes of transmission, prevalence in human and animal hosts and just how sick they could make us, more research is needed, DeRuyter and Lednicky said.

Next steps would include serology and immunology studies to understand the threat Gainesville shrew mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 strain UF-1 may hold for humans, wildlife and pets.

For readers concerned about Pepper's health, rest assured. He has shown no signs of illness from his outdoor adventures and will likely continue to contribute to scientific discovery through specimen collection.

"This was an opportunistic study," Lednicky said. "If you come across a dead animal, why not test it instead of just burying it? There is a lot of information that can be gained."

For decades, the story of Alzheimer's research has been dominated by a battle between A-beta and tau amyloids, both of which can kill neurons and impact the brain's ability to function. A new study suggests, however, that these sticky brain plaques may not be operating alone.

Johns Hopkins University researchers have identified more than 200 types of misfolded proteins in rats that could be associated with age-related cognitive decline.

The findings could lead the way to finding new therapeutic targets and treatments in humans that could provide relief for the millions of people over 65 who suffer from Alzheimer's, dementia, or other diseases that rob them of their memories and independence as they age.

"Amyloids are the buildup of misshapen proteins. They're big and ugly and easy to see under the microscope, so it makes sense that they catch our attention. But we're seeing hundreds of proteins misfolding in ways that don't clump together in an amyloid and yet still seem to impact how the brain functions," said Stephen Fried, an assistant professor of chemistry and protein scientist who studies how molecules in the brain change during aging. "Our research is showing that amyloids are just the tip of the iceberg."

The results were published on July 11 in Science Advances.

To understand the molecular differences between older brains that are mentally sharp and those that are experiencing decline, Fried and his team studied 17 2-year-old rats that grew up in the same colony. Seven rats performed poorly on memory and problem-solving tests and were considered cognitively impaired, while 10 performed as well as 6-month-old rats.

The researchers then measured more than 2,500 types of protein in the hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with spatial learning and memory. For the first time, scientists were able to determine for a large number of proteins whether individual proteins were misshapen or folded incorrectly, allowing the researchers to work out which proteins misfold for all the rats and are associated with aging in general versus which proteins specifically misfold in cognitively impaired rats.

More than 200 proteins were misfolded in the cognitively impaired rats yet maintained their shapes in the cognitively healthy rats. The findings suggest that some of those proteins are contributing to cognitive decline, the researchers said.

Misfolded proteins are unable to carry out tasks necessary for a cell to function properly, so cells have a natural surveillance system that identifies and destroys these misbehaving proteins. Previously, researchers thought misfolded proteins -- specifically A-beta and tau proteins -- were only disruptive when they clumped into amyloids.

"We think there are a lot of proteins that can be misfolded, not form amyloids, and still be problematic," Fried said. "And that suggests these misfolded proteins have ways of escaping this surveillance system in the cell."

But exactly how those misfolded proteins slip past a cell's security system remains a mystery.

Next, the team plans to look at misfolded proteins under high-resolution microscopes to get a more detailed picture of what their deformities look like at the molecular level.

"A lot of us have experienced a loved one or a relative who has become less capable of doing those everyday tasks that require cognitive abilities," Fried said. "Understanding what's physically going on in the brain could lead to better treatments and preventive measures."

A University of Portsmouth student has discovered a new species of prehistoric mammal dating back 145 million years to the Berriasian age, providing fresh insights into the diversity of early mammals that lived alongside dinosaurs.

A University of Portsmouth student has discovered a new species of prehistoric mammal dating back 145 million years to the Berriasian age, providing fresh insights into the diversity of early mammals that lived alongside dinosaurs.

Benjamin Weston, 22, an undergraduate paleontology student, made the remarkable discovery while conducting fieldwork in the cliffs of Durlston Bay near Swanage, Dorset. The fossilized lower jaw he found represents a completely new species of multituberculate -- an extinct group of early mammals known for the distinctive tubercles on their posterior teeth.

The 16.5mm-long jaw is characterized by a long pointed incisor at the front, followed by a gap and then four razor-sharp premolars. While superficially resembling a rabbit's jaw, the pointed incisors and distinctive premolars identify it as belonging to the multituberculate group.

This discovery, published in Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, marks the first multituberculate jaw found at Swanage since Victorian times, and its unique size and shape confirmed it as an entirely new species.

"I instantly had my suspicions of what the jaw was when I found it at the beach, but couldn't have imagined where the discovery would take me," said Ben Weston. "I'm extremely grateful to the team and to the university for helping me take my first steps into academic paleontology."

Dr Roy Smith and Emeritus Professor David Martill, who supervised the research, enlisted the expertise of Dr Steve Sweetman, a former Portsmouth student and now honorary research fellow, who specializes in rare Early Cretaceous mammal fossils from the Isle of Wight and Isle of Purbeck regions.

This was not the first time a student made a once-in-a-lifetime discovery in Dorset. In 2017, undergraduate Grant Smith recovered fossilis of two new species of Humankind's earliest ancestors from rocks exposed in cliffs near Swanage.

Dr Sweetman said: "This is a remarkable find that reminds me of when Grant found those extraordinary eutherian mammal teeth. When I first saw Grant's specimens, my jaw dropped -- and I had exactly the same reaction to Ben's multituberculate jaw. It's incredible that Durlston Bay keeps delivering such significant mammal discoveries by our undergraduate students."

Advanced technology reveals hidden details

The delicate fossil presented challenges, with pieces of rock obscuring vital details. The University's advanced CT scanning capabilities proved crucial to the research. Dr Charles Wood, Senior Scientific Officer in the School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, used CT scanning to reveal the specimen inside the rock, producing remarkable results due to the contrast between fossil and rock.

The team then collaborated with Jake Keane, a former Portsmouth paleontology student now working in Abu Dhabi (UAE), who processed the CT scans digitally. Within hours, Keane had digitally removed all surrounding rock and performed "digital dental surgery" to isolate individual teeth for detailed study.

Using these digital files, Lead Technician John Fearnly at the University's 3D printing lab in the Faculty of Technology created replicas magnified ten times, allowing safe study of the precious fossil without risk of damage.

Introducing Novaculadon mirabilis

The new species has been named Novaculadon mirabilis, with "novacula" describing its razor-like back teeth and "mirabilis" referring to the miraculous preservation of the specimen.

Portsmouth paleontology student Hamzah Imran created an artistic reconstruction showing the animal as a small, furry creature with speculative spots and stripes.

The fossil evidence suggests Novaculadon mirabilis was omnivorous, likely feeding on small invertebrates such as worms and insects. The sharp-pointed incisors and ridged, blade-like premolars indicate a feeding strategy distinct from modern rodents like squirrels and rats.

Emeritus Professor Martill reflected on the collaborative nature of the research: "Looking back now that the discovery has been published, I am amazed at how many people it took to describe this little mammal. I especially appreciated that all team members were University staff or present and former students -- a true team effort including academics, technicians, alumni, and students with diverse talents across three departments."

The research demonstrates how early mammals carved out ecological niches while dinosaurs dominated the landscape. Although multituberculates survived the extinction event that killed the dinosaurs, they eventually became extinct around 33 million years ago during the Oligocene period.

Multituberculata represents the most diverse order of Mesozoic mammals, with over 200 known species ranging from mouse-sized to beaver-sized. These mammals occupied various ecological niches over their 130-million-year evolutionary history, from burrow-dwelling to squirrel-like tree climbers.

The discovery adds to Portsmouth's growing reputation in paleontological research and demonstrates the value of undergraduate fieldwork in advancing scientific knowledge.

The University of Portsmouth's BSc (Hons) Palaeontology degree offers a uniquely hands-on learning experience, thanks to its location near the Isle of Wight -- nicknamed "Dinosaur Island" for its rich fossil heritage. Students benefit from frequent field trips to world-famous fossil sites like the Isle of Wight and the Jurassic Coast, gaining real-world experience that complements classroom learning.

Accredited by The Geological Society of London, the course combines cutting-edge facilities, expert teaching, and a flexible "Connected Degree" structure that allows for paid placements or self-employment years, preparing graduates for careers in science, consultancy, or museum work.

Nerve cells are not just nerve cells. Depending on how finely we distinguish, there are several hundred to several thousand different types of nerve cell in the human brain according to the latest calculations. These cell types vary in their function, in the number and length of their cellular appendages, and in their interconnections. They emit different neurotransmitters into our synapses and, depending on the region of the brain - for example, the cerebral cortex or the midbrain - different cell types are active.

When scientists produced nerve cells from stem cells in Petri dishes for their experiments in the past, it was not possible to take their vast diversity into account. Until now, researchers had only developed procedures for growing a few dozen different types of nerve cell in vitro. They achieved this using genetic engineering or by adding signalling molecules to activate particular cellular signalling pathways. However, they never got close to achieving the diversity of hundreds or thousands of different nerve cell types that actually exists.

"Neurons derived from stem cells are frequently used to study diseases. But up to now, researchers have often ignored which precise types of neuron they are working with," says Barbara Treutlein, Professor at the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich in Basel. However, this is not the best approach to such work. "If we want to develop cell culture models for diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and depression, we need to take the specific type of nerve cell involved into consideration."

Systematic screening was the key to success

Treutlein and her team have now successfully produced over 400 different types of nerve cell. In doing so, the scientists have paved the way for more precise basic neurological research with cell culture experiments.

The ETH researchers achieved this by working with a culture of human induced pluripotent stem cells that had been generated from blood cells. In these cells, they used genetic engineering to activate certain neuronal regulator genes and treated the cells with various morphogens, a special class of signalling molecules. Treutlein and her team took a systematic approach, using seven morphogens in different combinations and concentrations in their screening experiments. This resulted in almost 200 different sets of experimental conditions.

Morphogens

Morphogens are messengers that are known from research into embryonic development. They are not distributed uniformly within an embryo but occur in a variety of concentrations forming spatial patterns. In this way, they define the position of cells within the embryo, for example whether a cell is near the body axis or in the back, abdomen, head or torso. Accordingly, morphogens help to determine what grows where in the embryo.

The researchers used various analyses to prove that they had produced over 400 different types of nerve cell in their experiment. They examined the RNA (and therefore genetic activity) at the level of individual cells, as well as the external appearance of cells and their function: for example, which type of cell appendage they had in which quantities and which electric nerve impulses they emitted.

The researchers then compared their data with information from databases of neurons from the human brain. By doing this, they were able to identify the types of nerve cell that had been created, such as those found in the peripheral nervous system or brain cells and the part of the brain they come from, whether they perceive pain, cold or movement, and so on.

In-vitro neurons for active ingredient research

Treutlein clarifies that they are still a long way off producing all types of nerve cell that exist in vitro. Nonetheless, the researchers now have access to a much larger number of different cell types than they had before.

They would like to use in-vitro nerve cells to develop cell culture models for studying serious neurological conditions, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, epilepsy, sleep disorders and multiple sclerosis. Cell culture models of this kind are also of great interest in pharmaceutical research for testing the effects of new active compounds in cell cultures without animal testing, with the ultimate aim of one day being able to cure these conditions.

In the future, the cells could also be used for cell replacement therapy, which involves replacing sick or dead nerve cells in the brain with new human cells.

But there is a challenge to overcome before this can happen: the researchers often produced a mixture of multiple different types of nerve cell in their experiments. They are now working to optimise their method so that each experimental condition only produces one specific cell type. They already have some initial ideas as to how this might be achieved.

What interests me is the politics of it. A paper in a vacuum is nothing. How do people really convince each other of the importance of one argument or observation over another? How do those arguments grow to the scale of a whole society? Science at the scale of society doesn't happen in the language of scientific papers, but rather in rhetoric: in appeals to what the Greeks categorized as Ethos (Emotion), Pathos (Authority), and Logos (Logic).At its most brilliant this is "Schroedinger's cat," which in two words encodes in our collective consciousness an appeal to logic which entreats us through contradiction to consider a philosophically meaningful set of ideas about the nature of reality.

In recent years, the operating environment in orbital space has changed rapidly, and it isn't just the number of objects. These changes are outside the design assumptions of traditional orbital traffic systems, degrading their effectiveness. In response to this reality, governments with significant space assets have been investing in orbital traffic systems that are capable of dealing with the modern environment. However, these rely heavily on classified technology and capability to address the limitations of the older systems.An argument could be made that it no longer makes sense to fund a public system that is descending into obsolescence due to lack of capability and which can't be meaningfully fixed because that would require exposing classified technical capabilities that no one is willing to expose. In this scenario, the private sector is acting as an offramp from a system that had no future technically.Space has turned into an interesting place, in the curse sense. It isn't as simple as it used to be.

The vast majority of the government budget is "entitlements and military" because donors have their pork classified as those things when they don't want it to be cut. A lot of entitlement programs are structured as handouts to the companies providing those services (e.g. drug and healthcare companies, or landlords) or vote buying of affluent retirees who don't actually need a government subsidy. And I'd like to see someone try to claim with a straight face that there is no waste in the military budget.But even within those budgets, most of the waste and corruption isn't a single program going to a single place. It's millions of programs that each waste millions of dollars and collectively waste trillions of dollars. And then it doesn't matter if you classify the program as military or entitlements or something else; what matters is if the program is worth the candle.The problem is that everybody will say that their program is worth it, many them are lying, and it's hard to tell who isn't.But the thing that's unambiguously true is that the amount of government revenue has been stable as a percentage of GDP for generations and has been growing in terms of real dollars per capita, and yet the amount of government spending has outpaced that by a huge and growing amount.Is DOGE making a hash of things? Maybe, but then let's do a better job instead of using it as an excuse to keep running reckless deficits until the largest item in the federal budget is interest.

I similarly dismiss people's opinions that rely on LLMs to inform them on important subjects, rather than using them as a search engine to find more reliable sources.You can't trust a person that educated themselves with an LLM, because they have filled their head with bad foundations. That's very difficult to correct later on.

Speedballing—the practice of combining a stimulant like cocaine or methamphetamine with an opioid such as heroin or fentanyl—has evolved from a niche subculture to a widespread public health crisis. The practice stems from the early 1900s, when World War I soldiers were often treated with a combination of cocaine and morphine.

Once associated with high-profile figures like John Belushi, River Phoenix and Chris Farley, this dangerous polysubstance use has become a leading cause of overdose deaths across the United States since the early- to mid-2010s.

I am an assistant professor of public health who has written extensively on methamphetamine and opioid use and the dangerous combination of the two in the United States. As these dangerous combinations of drugs increasingly flood the market, I see an urgent need and opportunity for a new approach to prevention and treatment.

Dating back to the 1970s, the term speedballing originally referred to the combination of heroin and cocaine. Combining stimulants and opioids—the former's “rush” with the latter's calming effect—creates a dangerous physiological conflict.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, stimulant-involved overdose fatalities increased markedly from more than 12,000 annually in 2015 to greater than 57,000 in 2022, a 375% increase. Notably, approximately 70% of stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2022 also involved fentanyl or other synthetic opioids, reflecting the rising prevalence of polysubstance involvement in overdose mortality.

Users sought to experience the euphoric “rush” from the stimulant and the calming effects of the opioid. However, with the proliferation of fentanyl—which is far more potent than heroin—this combination has become increasingly lethal. Fentanyl is often mixed with cocaine or methamphetamine, sometimes without the user's knowledge, leading to unintentional overdoses.

The rise in speedballing is part of a broader trend of polysubstance use in the U.S. Since 2010, overdoses involving both stimulants and fentanyl have increased 50-fold, now accounting for approximately 35,000 deaths annually.

This has been called the fourth wave of the opioid epidemic. The toxic and contaminated drug supply has exacerbated this crisis.

Stimulants like cocaine increase heart rate and blood pressure, while opioids suppress respiratory function. This combination can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, and death. People who use both substances are more than twice as likely to experience a fatal overdose compared with those using opioids alone.

The conflicting effects of stimulants and opioids can also exacerbate mental health issues. Users may experience heightened anxiety, depression, and paranoia. The combination can also impair cognitive functions, leading to confusion and poor decision-making.

Speedballing can also lead to severe cardiovascular problems, including hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. The strain on the heart and blood vessels from the stimulant, combined with the depressant effects of the opioid, increases the risk of these life-threatening conditions.

Increasing awareness about the dangers of speedballing is crucial. I believe that educational campaigns can inform the public about the risks of combining stimulants and opioids and the potential for unintentional fentanyl exposure.

There is a great need for better access to treatment for people with stimulant use ddisorder—a condition defined as the continued use of amphetamine-type substances, cocaine, or other stimulants leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, from mild to severe. Treatments for this and other substance use disorders are underfunded and less accessible than those for opioid use disorder. Addressing this gap can help reduce the prevalence of speedballing.

Implementing harm reduction strategies by public health officials, community organizations, and health care providers, such as providing fentanyl test strips and naloxone—a medication that reverses opioid overdoses—can save lives.

These measures allow individuals to test their drugs for the presence of fentanyl and have immediate access to overdose-reversing medication. Implementing these strategies widely is crucial to reducing overdose deaths and improving community health outcomes.

Every year, pollen seasons grow longer and more intense—to the great misery of those suffering from pollen allergies—myself included. There's only so much one can do with antihistamines or hot towels, and no amount of protective measures—masks, firmly shut windows, you name it—appears to offer any protection from the endless sneezing, runny noses, and itchy eyes. 

But what if, by spraying something akin to a nasal spray, you could thwart the onslaught of those pesky allergens before they latch onto your sensitive nasal passages? 

This was the “simple but powerful idea” that inspired Kaissar Tabynov, who led the efforts to create a “molecular shield” that intercepts allergens the moment they approach our airways. For the experiment, they targeted mugwort pollen, which is the most common cause of pollen allergy in Central Asia and Europe. Tabynov and colleagues reported the first proof-of-principle for this technology, in this instance with mice, in a paper published today in Frontiers in Immunology.

“Allergies are often viewed as inconvenient but minor conditions, yet for millions, they severely reduce quality of life and can even be life-threatening,” Tabynov, director of the International Center for Vaccinology at Kazakh National Agrarian Research University in Kazakhstan, told Gizmodo in an email. “We believe this could be the beginning of a new class of anti-allergy interventions—smart, fast, and easy to use—that could protect people during allergy season in a way no existing therapy does.” 

Here's how the “shield” works. Researchers first develop a monoclonal antibody, or a lab-made protein designed to attach to a specific molecule. In this case it's aimed at a major allergy-causing protein found in mugwort pollen. These antibodies are applied to the nose, effectively snatching the allergens away from our natural antibodies, which trigger allergic responses when bound with allergens. 

The immune system is an intricate network of cells and hormones, so adjusting the treatment such that it wouldn't disrupt the natural system of mice proved to be a major challenge, explained Tabynov. Not only that, mugwort pollen is actually a combination of multiple allergy-causing particles (partly the reason they're so insufferable), meaning Tabynov's team had to focus on the most clinically relevant parts of the allergen complex. 

After several adjustments, the team succeeded in making an antibody treatment that curbed nasal inflammation and asthma symptoms in mice, and it did so without harming the animals' natural antibodies. Although the duration of the treatment was shorter than Tabynov hoped, he told Gizmodo that he and his team have already devised a strategy to potentially make the treatment last longer.

“What's exciting about our approach is that it shows how precise, targeted biologics can be used not just for chronic therapy but for prevention, delivered right where allergens strike,” Tabynov added. “Our approach is non-invasive, needle-free, and fast-acting [and] reduces the allergen load on the immune system and may help prevent the progression of allergic rhinitis into more severe conditions such as bronchial asthma.”

As fellow pollen allergy sufferers are aware, allergic reactions tend to set off a chain reaction of misery throughout the body. The idea of blocking allergens before they ever reach the nose would be a huge relief for many patients, especially those with medical complications that prevent them from taking standard antihistamine pills. It'd also be a time-saving, cheaper alternative to immunotherapy sessions, which can take years to have any effect. 

So, is this something we'll be picking up at a local pharmacy any time soon? Depends. Tabynov's most optimistic estimate is that the first human-based studies could happen within two to three years. Additional adjustments will be needed to extend the treatment's protective effects on human nasal surfaces. But for lifelong pollen patients, it sounds like a promising start.

In contrast to other technological advances, the objective for next-generation nuclear reactors seems to be to scale down, not up—an initiative backed by the Department of Energy (DOE).

Earlier this month, the DOE announced a conditional agreement made with private firms Westinghouse and Radiant to conduct the first reactor tests at its Demonstration on Microreactor Experiment (DOME) facility, located at Idaho National Laboratory.

These experiments, featuring two trailer-sized microreactors, will be “the first of their kind in the world” and will assist in meeting “the nation's demand for more abundant, affordable, and reliable power,” the DOE stated in a press release. 

The microreactors eVinci (Westinghouse) and Kaleidos (Radiant) each produce only 5 megawatts and 1.2 megawatts of power. The DOE defines microreactors as small reactors that generate between 1 and 50 megawatts of power. That's tiny compared to traditional reactors, which are capable of generating around 833 times the power of Kaleidos. 

That being said, these microreactors aren't meant to power crowded cities. Rather, the compact efficiency of microreactors could greatly benefit small, remote sites that run on less efficient sources. The average U.S. household consumes about 30 kilowatt-hours, or 0.03 megawatts worth of electricity daily—meaning, in theory, Kaleidos on its own could supply many homes in a distant rural area. 

Not only that, these microreactors are relatively easy to assemble and transportable by train, truck, or plane. That makes them potentially useful in unexpected situations such as blackouts caused by natural disasters or cyberattacks. For eVinci and Kaleidos in particular, the DOE's intention is to employ the microreactors as a possible power source for remote data centers and an alternative to diesel generators, respectively.

“Microreactors will play a big role in expanding the use of nuclear power in the United States,” added Mike Goff, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, in the same release. “These DOME experiments will test new reactor designs that will be counted on in the future to reliably power our homes, military bases, and mission-critical infrastructure.”

The first fueled experiments at DOME are slated to begin as early as spring 2026, operating for up to six months to test technological ability and efficiency.

As AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX approaches its launch, unofficial benchmark results have been posted to the Geekbench database, revealing some details about its performance. While the CPU clearly shines in AMD-conducted benchmarks showing its potential for professional workstation workloads, when it comes to the drag race-style Geekbench benchmark, it is not all that clear-cut. In fact, it runs neck-and-neck with Apple's M4 Max in threaded benchmarks, with the leader changing in some runs, while losing in single-thread work against Apple's chip. 

For now, there are multiple test results of AMD's 96-core Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in the Geekbench database. The best single-thread result for AMD's workstation flagship is 3,122 points, which is noticeably higher than the 2736 points scored by its direct predecessor, the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX. Since the new CPU is based on the improved Zen 5 microarchitecture and runs at a higher frequency, it is pretty much expected that it would be 14% faster in this benchmark.

However, as expected given its workstation focus, the single-thread performance of AMD's Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX in Geekbench isn't competitive with consumer PC-oriented processors. The latter are designed for burst performance for a short while to guarantee system responsiveness and fluent user experience. By contrast, the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX barely hits its 5.40 GHz turbo frequency in GB6's single-thread scenarios.

When it comes to GB6's multi-thread performance, there is another peculiarity with AMD's workstation-oriented Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. On the one hand, the unit scores 30,170 points in the base case scenario, leaving behind its Zen 4-based Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7995WX predecessor by a whopping 15%, or at 25,899 points. But on the other hand, the M4 Max is competitive, either beating or only slightly trailing the Threadripper chip in the multi-core score, depending on the run.

Meanwhile, one should remember that Geekbench 6 multi-tread test is a short-duration benchmark designed to simulate everyday tasks like file compression, PDF rendering, and image filtering. Because of its quick runtime and bursty workloads, it can't fully exploit the capabilities of ultra-high-core-count CPUs like the Ryzen Threadripper Pro 9995WX. Many of GB6's MT tests scale only up to 8–32 threads efficiently, leaving a large portion of the 9995WX's cores underutilized, but leaving headroom for Apple's, AMD's, and Intel's client CPUs to thrive in consumer workloads because of their high clocks.

Before drawing conclusions, we should wait for tests conducted by an independent test lab. With the launch fast approaching, you can expect to see plenty of benchmarks when the chips arrive this month.

Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event in Brooklyn earlier this week debuted seven new devices, from the Galaxy Z Fold7 to the Galaxy Watch8 series. But there weren't any surprises at the end, despite rumors that Samsung would unveil a trifold phone. Sensing disappointment, the company later confirmed that the phone is expected to land in 2025.

“I expect we will be able to launch the trifold phone within this year,” TM Roh, head of Samsung's mobile business, told The Korea Times. The trifold phone, rumored to be called the Galaxy G Fold, would have a normal screen on the front and two hinges that let you open it up as a tablet-sized screen.

Huawei first unveiled its trifold, the Mate XT, in China last year, with an eye-watering price of 3,499 euros ($4,090~), and Samsung showed off a concept version at Mobile World Congress 2025. Considering it has upped the price of its Galaxy Z Fold7 flagship to $2,000, expect a high cost. Samsung is also expected to launch its Android XR mixed reality headset in the fall, so the trifold could land alongside it.

AI startup Hugging Face has announced a new coding robot called Reachy Mini, mere months after acquiring Pollen Robotics, the company behind the Reachy 2 humanoid robot. The Reachy Mini is open for preorder for $449 (though there's a Lite version for $299), and it's an open source robot designed around AI experimentation and coding.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Think of it like a STEM toy or a Raspberry Pi (in fact, the Robot is powered by a Raspberry Pi 5 minicomputer)—you have to build it yourself, and there are more than 15 “robot behaviors” so you can learn how to use it out of the box. Reachy Mini can employ the latest AI models, and you can program it to act in certain ways. The head is motorized, and the antennas move around, too. It has a camera, microphone, and speakers for interacting with its surroundings.

Reachy Mini owners will be able to upload and share these robot behaviors with the Hugging Face community, and download other ones too. It'll ship this fall, though the Reachy Mini Lite, which isn't wireless, will arrive first, late summer. We can only hope this cute little robot won't have the same fate as the Jibo.

The public beta for Apple's iOS 26, macOS 26, and iPadOS 26 is expected to launch next week, but some drama has been brewing after the recent developer beta 3 for iOS 26. The company has reduced the transparency of its Liquid Glass design language, making the interface appear more like frosted glass. That's drawn criticism online that Apple has changed it too much, though there was plenty of backlash and readability concerns when Apple debuted the design at WWDC 2025.

In more Apple news, the company is expected to debut a new Apple Vision Pro later this year, powered by the M4 chipset that's in some MacBooks and iPads. The hardware itself won't look any different, though Bloomberg reports there will be a more comfortable strap. The rumored cheaper version of the Vision Pro is still a few years away.

It's a new day for smart home strategy at popular Swedish furniture purveyor Ikea, as the company announced more than 20 new Matter smart lights, sensors, and remotes using the Thread protocol. That means you can snag some of Ikea's affordable wares and use them directly with your Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings setup, without having to purchase an Ikea hub. And Ikea's David Granath told The Verge there are “more new product types and form factors to come.” Folks with Ikea's Dirigera hub will also be pleased to learn that Ikea is activating the built-in Thread radio and adding Matter support. That means it can serve as a Matter Controller and a Thread Border Router, enabling it to hook up and control any Matter devices in your home. Sadly for some, this signals the end for Zigbee support, as Ikea plans to replace its Zigbee gadgets with Matter devices.

Ikea also unveiled two new Bluetooth speakers this week—one that looks like a retro radio and another that doubles as a lamp. Both have a dedicated Spotify Tap button that allows you to jump straight back into whatever you were last listening to on Spotify. It's another nail in the coffin for Ikea's partnership with Sonos, as Ikea strives for simplicity, accessibility, and affordability. —Simon Hill

OnePlus Watch 3 43mm

It was five plus for OnePlus this week, as the company unveiled a slew of new devices. A smaller, 43 mm, version of the Watch 3 that's far more comfortable, but has less stamina than its larger sibling, is now available from OnePlus for $300 (a full $100 less than the 47 mm model). The very affordable wireless Buds 4 are also landing in the US at $130.

The rest of the new lineup is only being released in Europe and India. The headliner is the latest midrange OnePlus Nord 5 phone. It has a 6.83-inch display with a silky 144 Hz refresh rate, is powered by the Snapdragon 8S Gen 3, and offers a 50-megapixel camera front and back. There's also a 5,200 mAh battery and snappy 80-watt charging. You can get the 8 GB RAM, 256 GB storage model for £399 in the UK. Add another £50 to jump to 12 GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage.

If your budget is more limited, the Nord CE 5 sports a similar look, but has a slightly smaller 6.77-inch display, slower MediaTek Dimensity 8350 Apex processor, and is lower specced across the rest of the board, but starts at £249. Both models will get four years of Android updates.

The last new device is the OnePlus Pad Lite, and it looks to be a bit of a bargain. This 11-inch tablet boasts a 2K display with a 90-Hz refresh rate, a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset backed by 6 GB of RAM, and a chunky 9,340 mAh battery. There are also central 5-megapixel cameras front and back. It starts from £199, but you can jump to 8 GB of RAM and get LTE connectivity for just £30 more. —Simon Hill

It seems like only yesterday we crowned the Honor Magic V3 as the world's thinnest folding phone (it was last September). Now, Honor is back, having skipped the number 4, to reclaim the crown from Oppo's Find N5. The Honor Magic V5 is similar to the V3, but the important measurement is that it's just 8.8 mm thick when folded shut. That's just slimmer than Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold7, by 0.1 mm.

The Honor Magic V5 is some feat of engineering, weighing 217 grams (lighter than Apple's 16 Pro Max, but 2 grams heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold7). It's no slouch inside with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, backed by 16 GB of RAM. There's also a hefty 5,820-mAh battery, wireless charging support, and IP58 and IP59 water-resistance ratings (impressive for a foldable). The screens are LTPO OLED panels with up to a 120-Hz refresh rate. The camera bump on the back, which arguably spoils the svelte form, houses a 50-megapixel main shooter, a 64-MP periscope telephoto lens capable of 3x optical zoom, and a 50-MP ultrawide.

Throw in Honor's generous suite of AI features, and you have a luxurious top-tier device on your hands. The Honor Magic V5 launched in China last week, but unlike the Oppo Find N5, Honor plans to bring the Magic V5 to international markets soon, so folks craving a slim foldable better get saving. —Simon Hill

Summer in the U.S. is now in full swing. That means plenty of outdoor fun, Sun, and, unfortunately, for many of us, tiny eight-legged ticks to avoid.

Ticks and the many illnesses they carry, like Lyme disease, are a growing public health threat. Just this week, for instance, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 2025 so far has seen the highest number of tick-related emergency room visits recorded since 2019. And though the worst tick species are especially common in the Northeast, disease-carrying populations are steadily spreading further across the U.S. What's more, scientists are still continuing to discover new viruses and bacteria spread by ticks that can potentially sicken people.

With Americans firmly in the middle of hot tick summer, Gizmodo reached out to Dennis Bente, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch. We spoke to Bente about why ticks are becoming a bigger problem, the best ways right now to protect ourselves against them, and the potential innovations that could eventually help us beat back the tick menace. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Ed Cara, Gizmodo: I live in the northeastern U.S., and my friends and family, especially dog owners, often complain about needing to look out for ticks sooner than they used to. Is the tick season really getting longer and larger? And what seem to be the major reasons why?

Maps Show North America's Growing Tick Invasion

Bente: Yes, your friends and family are absolutely correct in their observations. The tick season in the Northeastern United States has indeed become longer and more intense, with multiple scientific studies confirming both the expansion of tick activity periods and the growth of tick populations.

What was once a relatively predictable seasonal threat has evolved into a year-round concern in many areas. The evidence shows that ticks are now active in winter due to climate change, with adult deer ticks active at temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit [-10 degrees Celsius]. This has led to a year-round need for vigilance, as ticks now emerge whenever the ground is unfrozen and temperatures exceed freezing, extending their season beyond traditional months. Climate warming accelerates tick development, increases survival, and enables northward expansion at about 28 miles [45 kilometers] per year, especially in the Northeast. Factors like recovering deer populations, reforestation, landscape fragmentation, and fire suppression have also promoted tick populations by providing ideal habitats and microclimate regimes that favor tick survival.

Gizmodo: When it comes to tick germs, people are probably most familiar with Lyme disease. But there are plenty more out there. What are some of the lesser-known tickborne diseases that keep you up at night? And are these diseases, like Lyme, becoming more common?

A New York Man Was Killed by a Rare Brain-Infecting Disease Spread by Ticks

Bente: While Lyme disease dominates public awareness of tickborne illnesses, it represents just the tip of a much larger iceberg.

Powassan virus (POWV) stands out as perhaps the most frightening tickborne pathogen in North America. This flavivirus can cause severe encephalitis with mortality rates approaching 18.8% and devastating neurological consequences in 72.7% of survivors. Unlike other tickborne diseases, POWV can be transmitted within just 15 minutes of tick attachment, giving victims almost no opportunity for preventive tick removal.

There are also other less-known viruses. The Heartland virus emerged in 2009 and has since been documented in over 60 cases across 14 states, with an estimated mortality rate of 5-10%. Bourbon virus (BRBV) was first identified in 2014 and remains poorly understood. Only 5 human cases have been reported in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, but blood tests suggest that it is much more widespread.

Borrelia miyamotoi causes hard tick relapsing fever, a disease that often goes undetected despite being transmitted by the same ticks that carry Lyme disease. Between 2013 and 2019, 300 cases were identified through surveillance in just nine states that conduct active monitoring. This likely represents massive underreporting, as the disease is often misdiagnosed.

There is also Ehrlichia and the spotted fever group rickettsiae, which represent a growing and increasingly complex threat. While Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii) remains the most severe, newly recognized rickettsial pathogens are emerging that can cause similar severe illness.

Overall, tickborne diseases are absolutely becoming more common. The evidence is overwhelming: Total tickborne disease cases in the US increased 25% from 40,795 (2011) to 50,856 (2019).

Gizmodo: Are there any treatments, vaccines, or other innovations in development that could possibly help us beat these germs?

Bente: Yes, there are indeed promising treatments, vaccines, and innovative technologies in development that could help us finally gain the upper hand against tickborne diseases.

Here's what's on the horizon: The most significant immediate breakthrough is VLA15, the first Lyme disease vaccine to reach advanced clinical trials in over two decades. Developed jointly by Pfizer and Valneva, this represents a major advancement over previous failed attempts. The vaccine has completed recruitment for its Phase 3 VALOR trial with 9,437 participants enrolled across the United States, Europe, and Canada. Results are expected by the end of 2025, with potential regulatory approval in 2026.

Experimental Anti-Tick Vaccine Aims to Stop Bites That Could Spread Lyme

Perhaps even more exciting than pathogen-specific vaccines are anti-tick vaccines that could prevent multiple tickborne diseases simultaneously by targeting the tick itself. Researchers have developed mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines containing cocktails of tick salivary proteins. The most advanced formulation is the 19ISP vaccine. This vaccine causes rapid erythema development in the skin, early tick detachment, and decreased tick feeding by creating an immune response that alerts hosts to tick presence and prevents pathogen transmission when ticks are removed promptly.

TP-05 is an investigational oral, systemic formulation of lotilaner developed by Tarsus Pharmaceuticals; it represents a revolutionary approach to tickborne disease prevention. This isoxazoline compound has successfully completed Phase 2a human trials, demonstrating 97% tick mortality within 24 hours of attachment, with a single dose providing protection for at least 30 days. Since ticks typically require 36 to 48 hours of attachment to transmit Lyme disease, killing them within 24 hours provides highly effective prophylaxis with an excellent safety profile in healthy volunteers.

Gizmodo: In the meantime, how do we best keep these tiny pests from ruining our time outdoors?

Bente: For reliable tick protection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends EPA-registered repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE). Research consistently shows that DEET concentrations of 20 to 30% provide the most effective protection, with efficacy rates of 85 to 89% against ticks.

Permethrin, readily available in stores, stands out as perhaps the most powerful weapon in your anti-tick arsenal. Unlike repellents that simply deter ticks, permethrin actually kills ticks on contact. When applied to clothing, it can provide protection for up to six weeks or six washes. The effectiveness is remarkable: permethrin-treated clothing has shown nearly 100% protection against tick attachment.

Your clothing choices can serve as your first line of defense. Wear light-colored clothing to make ticks easier to spot. Long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes provide physical barriers, and tucking your shirt into pants and pants into socks creates additional protection by eliminating entry points.

Stay on trail centers and avoid wooded, brushy areas during peak tick season (April to September). Daily tick checks are the most critical prevention measure. Most tickborne diseases require 24 to 48 hours of attachment for transmission, so quick removal dramatically reduces infection risk. Check your entire body using mirrors, focusing on warm areas: groin, armpits, scalp, behind ears and knees, and waistbands. Check children and pets daily, even after yard time, and shower within 2 hours to wash off crawling ticks.

For proper removal, use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick close to the skin. Pull upward with steady pressure—don't twist or jerk. Don't squeeze, crush, or burn the tick. Clean the bite area and hands with alcohol or soap. Be sure to photograph the tick for identification if symptoms develop and avoid folk remedies like matches or nail polish—these increase disease transmission risk.

When it comes to gadget specs, it's best to be precise. For example, if you were buying a TV, you may want to know the resolution, and if you showed up to Best Buy and the tag on your brand-spanking-new Sony said “kind of, sort of, 4K,” you'd probably have some questions. Same goes for AR glasses, in my opinion, but that didn't stop Viture from slapping “4K-like” branding on all of its new frames. It also doesn't stop me from wanting them all the same.

Viture announced a few pairs of upcoming AR glasses this week, but the most exciting one is “Beast.” Yes, that's really the name. Beast is aptly named for being the most spec'd-out glasses of Viture's current generation and comes with an impressive 58-degree field of view and Sony's micro-OLED panel, which offers—and here's the kicker—a “4K-like” resolution, according to Viture. What is “4K-like,” you ask? Well, it's actually 1080p. But this 1080p is sharper, according to Viture, (50 percent sharper than the Viture Pro) and makes its AR glasses the “sharpest on the market.” I haven't had a chance to use Viture's Beast myself because they don't launch until October, but Viture's previous AR glasses already had the edge in clarity, so I'm curious to see how its new iteration moves the ball forward.

And if you're still hung up on the marketing—I don't blame you if you are—Viture says that the “4K-like” part actually comes from people's reactions to the glasses. In an official explanation, Viture says, “The term ‘4K-like' was inspired by users. When people first saw the display, they often asked, ‘Is this 4K?' or said, ‘Wow, it looks like 4K!'” I mean… fine. To be honest, I'm willing to forgive some iffy marketing if these things are actually as crisp as Viture says they are, especially because of all the other stuff Beast has going for it.

On top of its nice micro-OLED display and supposed class-leading sharpness, Viture's glasses also have a Harman-tuned audio, electrochromic dimming so you can go from shades to clear depending on if you're inside or outside, 1,280 nits of brightness, and even a depth sensor for “spatial computing” like the Vision Pro. That's a lot of stuff packed into glasses that are pretty freaking small. Viture says Beast weighs about 88 grams, which is double other “smart glasses” like Meta's Ray-Bans but with quadruple the capabilities and an actual display in them. All of that good stuff will cost you, though. When orders are available in October, Viture says its Beast glasses will cost $549, and those aren't even the most expensive pair. Viture's Luma series glasses, which are also incoming, will cost $600 but are primarily geared toward enterprise usage. For the full slate of incoming glasses, you can visit Viture's site.

The ‘H/W Quick Erase' function, which fries the flash memory, should probably have a more forbidding name.

Taiwanese memory specialist Team Group has introduced a new M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD, designed for mission-critical environments. The P250Q-M80 SSD offers a headline-grabbing quick access feature that securely wipes all data stored or even physically destroys the flash NAND chips, at the touch of a button.

Many industrial storage device makers crow about the ruggedness and durability of their devices, and Team Group is no exception with the P250Q-M80. The device has many great durability stats that you might look for.

It boasts MIL-STD 810G vibration endurance, MIL-STD-202G shock resistance, storage integrity temperatures spanning -55°C (-67°F) to +95°C (203°F), an MTBF of over three million hours, a three-year warranty, S.M.A.R.T. health monitoring, and more. However, its party trick is the rapid destruction of its precious data, its so-called “Intelligent Dual-Mode Data Destruction.”



This is the gentler option for users who may need to clear this SSD of its contents in a hurry. S/W Quick Erase is a software method that “erases all data while retaining device functionality.” Users can choose this option if they intend to reuse the drive at a later date. It is thus “ideal for repeated use,” according to Team Group.

S/W Quick Erase is invoked by pressing the big red button that comes with the P250Q-M80 for between five and 10 seconds. It can't be stopped. Even if power is interrupted during the data wiping process, the drive will automatically resume clearing data the next time it gets power, says Team Group.

We aren't sure of the wiping algorithm or tech, so we would assume there remains a chance of data recovery after this software-powered wipe, or partial wipe.



The H/W Quick Erase function "uses high-voltage breakdown technology to physically destroy NAND Flash, ensuring data is irrecoverable," asserts Team Group. This patented technique is also shown in the video, where we see plumes of smoke emanate from the drive after the function is started. So, there's a visual and olfactory sign that data has been destroyed, in case you aren't certain that you have chosen to fry the 3D TLC NAND.

Begin hardware destruction simply by holding the big red button for 10 seconds when ‘secure deletion becomes mission-critical,' advises memory products maker.

Team Group says the H/W Quick Erase has a “precise focus on Flash IC destruction.” Therefore, if you are a soldering whizz, you may be wondering if it is possible to re-use this drive by swapping the ICs. Team Group says the NAND used is paired with a specific control chip, so reusing or repairing a H/W Quick Erased device might be more effort than it is worth.



If anything, we think that the term 'H/W Quick Erase' is a little understated for the physical frying of NAND that occurs here. If we hadn't absorbed Team Group's PR, product pages, and video, it would be quite natural to assume H/W Quick Erase is perhaps a hardware-accelerated erase function. Several computer utilities I have used offer S/W and H/W toggles in their UIs, and none physically destroy any hardware if the latter is selected.

A ‘warning light' of sorts on the 2280 PCB appears to flash when you are holding the big red button down. If this flashed once per second, it would be a useful guide to whether you are opting to do a quick data erase or physically destroy your NAND. Hopefully, that detail is shared in the instruction booklet.

Text shared by Team Group alongside the video we embedded also mentions that data destruction can be triggered by a “physical or event-based trigger,” which indicates there can be other ways to wipe or destroy a P250Q-M80 than the big red button.



The new P250Q-M80 offers decent speeds from its 3D TLC NAND and PCIe Gen4x4 controller. Transfers speeds of up to 7.0 GB/s reads, and 5.5 GB/s writes are claimed. There is no DRAM buffer, or mention of tech like SLC buffer or HMB.

Operating temperatures range from 0°C (32°F) ~ +70°C (158°F), though it can survive more extreme temperatures at rest. We already mentioned various other durability claims for the P250Q-M80, above.

Team Group's P250Q-M80 self-destructing SSD is being marketed in 256GB, 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities. We don't have pricing and availability details at the time of writing.

As you might expect with my job, I am frequently asked what fitness tracker to get, and this year, more often than not, I have told people to just buy an Oura Ring 4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) . You don't have to wear it on your wrist, the battery life is longer than most trackers, and Oura issues interesting, meaningful software updates regularly. This is the first time it's gone on sale, and you should get it.

Fitbit has faced pretty stiff competition over the years (most notably from the Apple Watch), but its flagship Charge line is still the best overall fitness tracker for the money. Even tracking multiple activities a day, the battery lasts over a week. The updated app looks great, and multiple Google integrations make the Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) easier to use than ever.

The Apple Watch Series 10 is the best fitness tracker for iPhone users. It still doesn't have blood oxygen sensing due to a patent dispute, but it's otherwise a solid fitness tracker. The standout feature is sleep apnea notifications. The watch uses an accelerometer and machine learning to check if you have breathing disturbances at night. The Series 10 is also thinner, lighter, easier to wear, and charges faster than previous models.

If you're not looking to spend big, Garmin's Forerunner 165 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great compromise. It offers all the basics, from an altimeter to track your mileage accurately to a blood oxygen sensor. The battery life is decent, and you'll get extras like Garmin's Morning Report, a wake-up feature that tells you the basics of your sleeping stats, weather, and more. —Ryan Waniata

Garmin's Fenix 8 is loaded with features, not the least of which is its massive and incredibly bright AMOLED screen. WIRED editor and fitness expert Adrienne So called it “the best outdoor sports watch money can buy” thanks to its litany of features that work with both Android and iPhones, from Garmin's proprietary off-grid maps for sports like golfing and skiing, to leakproof buttons for scuba, and even a built-in flashlight. If you want a killer luxury outdoor tracker, this is it. —Ryan Waniata

I have personally convinced many parents in my life to buy the Fitbit Ace LTE (7/10, WIRED Recommends) for their kids. It's a Fitbit, so it works even if one parent is Android and the other is Apple (if so, why?), and the $10/month subscription includes data, so you don't need to fuss with adding service to your cell plan. Fitbit Arcade incentivizes my kids to keep their watches on and charged, and I like Google's included kids' safety features.

Garmin is known for its Forerunner series of running watches. The Forerunner 255 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the older version of the Forerunner 265 that we recommend in our roundup, but Garmins age well, and the older version does have some features to recommend it over the newer one, like better battery life.

Amazfit

It may be cheap, but the Amazfit Active 2 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed) is no slouch on the sensor front with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, ambient light, and temperature sensor to track your sleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation. It also boasts tons of workout modes, long battery life, and 5 ATM water resistance.

While it's not the most exciting Apple watch, the SE series is the cheapest way to try out an Apple fitness tracker. The SE uses watchOS 11, which can connect to the Vitals app, which makes it easy to check your heart rate and respiration in a dashboard without hunting through the Health or Fitness apps. It has the last S8 chip, which is what the Series 8 has, and features like Crash Detection to call your emergency contact and emergency responders if you've been in a car accident. The SE series doesn't have the latest health features, like the ability to check your skin temperature, and the display is noticeably smaller than Apple's other options, but for the price this is hard to beat, especially on sale.

Samsung's flagship smartwatch is a no-brainer for folks in Samsung's ecosystem. The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts dual-band GPS, excellent health and activity monitoring features, and two-day battery life. It's tough, too, with a titanium case and 10 ATM/IP68 ratings. Samsung announced a newer version of the Galaxy Watch Ultra, but it's actually the same watch with 64 GB of storage and a new color, so it's smart to snag this one for half its MSRP.

Ultrahuman

While the Oura Ring 4 is undoubtedly the champion of smart rings, you'll be paying $8 a month if you want the full experience. The Ultrahuman Ring Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends), though, comes with an included “lifetime subscription,” meaning you'll have full access to your data and analytics when you pick one of these up. It's the first time the price has dropped this low too, so if ever there was a time, it's now.

Most Garmin watches aren't likely to win any beauty prizes—they're chunky, with an emphasis on the technical over aesthetic. The Lily 2 is the exception. It's Garmin that looks more like, well, a nice watch. You can even get it with a leather band. It's one of the smallest Garmins and battery life is on the short side—three to four days. But it has a Pulse Ox sensor, a beautiful Corning Gorilla Glass lens, a metal bezel, and standard Garmin features like Body Battery and fall detection.

Slick looks, Fitbit integration, and bags of features, the Google Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best Wear OS watch for folks with an Android phone. It's no slouch as a health and fitness tracker, with electrocardiogram readings, sleep tracking, heart rate readings, blood-oxygen measurements, and stress tracking.

A new study from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus has upended decades of neuroscience dogma, revealing that dopamine, a neurotransmitter critical for movement, motivation, learning and mood, communicates in the brain with extraordinary precision, not broad diffusion as previously believed. This groundbreaking research offers fresh hope for millions of people living with dopamine-related disorders, marking a significant advance in the quest for precision-based neuroscience and medicine.

For years, scientists thought of dopamine as a kind of chemical "broadcast system," flooding large areas of the brain to influence behavior. But new research, published today in Science, found that dopamine acts more like a finely-tuned postal service, delivering highly localized messages to specific nerve cell branches at exact moments in time.

Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought. We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine."

Christopher Ford, PhD, Professor, University of Colorado School of Medicine and lead author

Using advanced microscopy techniques, researchers found that dopamine is released in concentrated hotspots which enable targeted, rapid responses in nearby brain cells, while broader signals activate slower, widespread effects. This dual signaling system allows dopamine to simultaneously fine-tune individual neural connections and orchestrate complex behaviors like movement, decision-making, and learning.

The implications are far-reaching. Dopamine system dysfunction plays a central role in a wide range of brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease, addiction, schizophrenia, ADHD and depression. Current treatments largely focus on restoring overall dopamine levels but this research suggests that the precision of dopamine signaling may be just as crucial.

"We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," said Ford. "More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases. The goal, of course, would then be to build on those findings to come up with new and improved treatments for those disorders."

The term 'oral health' refers to the health of the mouth, teeth, gums, and other related structures, and it is closely linked with our well-being and quality of life. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in understanding how oral health is linked to and influences our overall health. For example, it was found that gum disease may be associated with various diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease. Poor oral health can also affect a person's diet, which further increases a person's risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

Now, in a new study published online in the Journal of Oral Rehabilitation on April 17, 2025, a team of researchers led by Professor and Chairman Mitsuyoshi Yoshida and his colleagues from the Department of Dentistry and Oral-Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Medicine, Fujita Health University, Japan, have examined the association between oral health and different lifestyle-related diseases. This study was conducted in cooperation with Fujita Health University International Medical Center, with Director Hitomi Sasaki.

"Our main aim was to investigate the link between oral health and blood test results for glucose metabolism, lipid levels, and kidney function," says Prof. Yoshida.

In this study, the researchers examined 118 individuals aged 50 or above who had undergone regular health check-ups. More specifically, they collected information from dental examinations in 2021, as well as annual physical examinations in 2021 and 2023. These individuals were subjected to seven different oral function tests to gauge their oral health-these included measurements of tongue coating index (TCI) (an indicator of oral hygiene), oral dryness, the number of remaining functional teeth, maximum tongue pressure, masticatory function, swallowing problem, and oral diadochokinesis (OD), a test that measures the speed and accuracy with which a person can repeat certain syllables.

In addition, the participants were divided into two groups based on whether their blood test results (including fasting blood glucose and cholesterol) were within the reference range or not. The resulting statistical analyses showed many interesting links between the oral function test results and blood test results.

Notably, the group with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c (which reflects the average blood sugar levels across 2−3 months) levels outside the reference range had significantly lower numbers of remaining teeth and OD values compared to the group with values within the reference range. Similarly, the group with cholesterol values outside the standard range had higher levels of TCI and lower OD values. The group with non-standard values of estimated glomerular filtration rate (a test that measures kidney function) also showed significant differences in some of the oral function tests. These findings indicate an important link between oral health and overall health, highlighting the need for implementing oral function tests during health check-ups for better health promotion.

"Overall, our results suggest that a decline in oral function can be a risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases. Thus, maintaining good oral health is the first step in maintaining overall health. We believe this study is an achievement that will pave the way for Japan's vision of introducing and supporting universal dental health check-ups," concludes Prof. Yoshida.

This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how an anti-complement homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata ameliorates acute pneumonia with H1N1 and MRSA coinfection through rectifying Treg/Th17 imbalance in the gut–lung axis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

The coinfection of respiratory viruses and bacteria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the development of vaccines and powerful antibiotics. As a macromolecule that is difficult to absorb in the gastrointestinal tract, a homogeneous polysaccharide from Houttuynia cordata (HCPM) has been reported to exhibit anti-complement properties and alleviate influenza A virus (H1N1)-induced lung injury; however, the effects of HCPM without in vitro antiviral and antibacterial activities on more complicated pulmonary diseases resulting from viral-bacterial coinfection remains unclear.

This study established a representative coinfection murine pneumonia model infected with H1N1 (0.2 LD50) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, 107 CFU). HCPM significantly improved survival rate and weight loss, and ameliorated gut–lung damage and inflammatory cytokine production. Interestingly, the therapeutic effect of HCPM on intestinal damage preceded that in the lungs. Mechanistically, HCPM inhibited the overactivation of the intestinal complement (C3a and C5a) and suppressed the activation of the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway, which contributes to the regulation of the Treg/Th17 cell balance in the gut–lung axis.

The results indicate the beneficial effects of an anti-complement polysaccharide against viral–bacterial coinfection pneumonia by modulating crosstalk between multiple immune regulatory networks.

This new article publication from Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica B, discusses how ALKBH3-regulated m1A of ALDOA potentiates glycolysis and doxorubicin resistance of triple negative breast cancer cells.

Chemotherapy is currently the mainstay of systemic management for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but chemoresistance significantly impacts patient outcomes.

This research indicates that Doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant TNBC cells exhibit increased glycolysis and ATP generation compared to their parental cells, with this metabolic shift contributing to chemoresistance. It was discovered that ALKBH3, an m1A demethylase enzyme, is crucial in regulating the enhanced glycolysis in Dox-resistant TNBC cells.

Knocking down ALKBH3 reduced ATP generation, glucose consumption, and lactate production, implicating its involvement in mediating glycolysis. Further investigation revealed that aldolase A (ALDOA), a key enzyme in glycolysis, is a downstream target of ALKBH3. ALKBH3 regulates ALDOA mRNA stability through m1A demethylation at the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). This methylation negatively affects ALDOA mRNA stability by recruiting the YTHDF2/PAN2–PAN3 complex, leading to mRNA degradation. The ALKBH3/ALDOA axis promotes Dox resistance both in vitro and in vivo.

Clinical analysis demonstrated that ALKBH3 and ALDOA are upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and higher expression of these proteins is associated with reduced overall survival in TNBC patients. This study highlights the role of the ALKBH3/ALDOA axis in contributing to Dox resistance in TNBC cells through regulation of ALDOA mRNA stability and glycolysis.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Bioresponsive materials have gained prominence as innovative tools for advancing drug delivery systems, particularly in managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These materials respond to biological stimuli such as pH, glucose, enzymes, or temperature, thereby enabling spatiotemporally controlled drug release.

This article examines recent progress in the design strategies, activation mechanisms, and therapeutic applications of these materials in diabetes care. Key focus areas include macromolecular insulin delivery systems and oral hypoglycemic agents, with emphasis on their efficacy in regulating blood glucose homeostasis. Despite their promise, challenges persist in translating these technologies to clinical practice, including scalability limitations, insufficient clinical validation, regulatory hurdles, and healthcare system compatibility.

Current therapeutic shortcomings, such as frequent injections and adverse effects compromising patient adherence, are discussed. By synthesizing contemporary research developments and implementation barriers, this work provides critical insights into optimizing bioresponsive platforms for clinical translation. The analysis underscores the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address technical and practical constraints, and ultimately engineer patient-centric, scalable solutions that enhance therapeutic outcomes and quality of life. Future directions include bridging material innovation with clinical needs to develop next-generation diabetes management systems.

A new study, published in Addiction, shines a light on how industries associated with health harms-such as tobacco, fossil fuels, and in this case, alcohol-can distort the evaluation of scientific research through industry-friendly commentary. 

A team of researchers led by UVic's Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR), analyzed 268 critiques of alcohol and health studies published online since 2010 by the International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research, or ISFAR. 

ISFAR describes themselves as an international group of "invited physicians and scientists who are specialists in their fields and committed to balanced and well researched analysis regarding alcohol and health." However, members have continuing alcohol-industry connections, says Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study. 

Although ISFAR has long-standing ties to the alcohol industry, it is still frequently quoted in the media as an authoritative voice on matters relating to alcohol and health. We had observed their critiques seemed to favour studies finding health benefits from alcohol, and to be critical of those that said otherwise. We set out to test this impartially and comprehensively." 

Tim Stockwell, CISUR scientist, professor emeritus at UVic's psychology department, and co-author of the study

The researchers' hypotheses were confirmed, whether using data generated by human coders or by computer-based text analysis of the ISFAR critiques. The team found studies supporting an industry-friendly narrative were ten times more likely to receive a positive review from ISFAR than those suggesting otherwise. Notably, ISFAR's favorability ratings were completely unrelated to the studies' level of scientific merit as assessed by an independent expert who was not otherwise involved in the project. 

"This analysis confirms the impression that ISFAR is an industry-friendly echo chamber whose critiques are determined more by whether they like the conclusions contained in research papers than by scientific merit," says Stockwell. "We've seen this playbook before with the tobacco industry trying to discredit science around smoking's harms." 

It's a reminder that we need to be mindful of where our information is coming from and who is paying for its creation, says Stockwell.

In recent years, some scientists and advocates have warned that playing contact sports like football and hockey may increase the risk of brain diseases like Alzheimer's disease or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to a buildup of a specific protein in the brain.

But a new Northwestern Medicine study of 174 donated brains, including some from former high school and college football players, pumps the brakes on that theory. 

The long and short of it is no, this protein in this specific brain region is not increased in people who played football at the amateur level. It throws a little bit of cold water on the current CTE narrative."

Dr. Rudolph Castellani, corresponding author, professor of pathology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Northwestern Medicine neuropathologist

The study was recently published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. It raises important questions about how scientists interpret subtle brain changes associated with aging, Alzheimer's disease and repetitive head impacts.

The study analyzed brain tissue from the Lieber Institute for Brain Development, which collects brain donations from people who had psychiatric conditions (e.g. schizophrenia, major depression, general anxiety, substance use disorder, etc.) throughout their life. Of the 174 samples collected from older adult men (with a median age of 65 at death), 48 men participated in football in high school or college while 126 had no history of playing a contact or collision sport. 

The study did not include brains from professional athletes. 

The scientists focused on a small memory-related brain region called CA2, part of the hippocampus. This region has been shown to accumulate phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein - which is often present in neurodegenerative disease - in a variety of contexts, including normal aging, Alzheimer's disease and in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts.

But the findings suggest p-tau buildup in CA2 isn't specific to contact sports. The scientists found no over-representation of CA2 p-tau in individuals with a history of youth football participation. Instead, the presence of p-tau in this region was statistically associated with age.

"What's novel here is a return to the null hypothesis - that there may be no link between repeated head injuries and p-tau buildup in this location," said Castellani, who also is the neuropathology core director of the Northwestern University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. "Rather than assuming p-tau in CA2 is inherently pathological, we're asking whether it might be part of normal aging or a non-specific response to environmental factors."

The study also highlights broader challenges in the field of neurodegeneration research. In particular, the authors point to the difficulty of assigning clinical meaning to subtle pathological findings. The paper's section, "Knowledge gaps and implications for future research," underscores how even expert consensus groups struggle to define CTE in clinically meaningful terms.

"Modern studies on CTE may be expanding the boundaries of what's considered normal variability in the human brain," Castellani said. "This work reminds us to be cautious in interpreting pathology without clear clinical correlation."

The authors call for larger studies to better understand how p-tau relates to aging and head injuries, while urging the scientific community to critically evaluate assumptions about what constitutes neurodegenerative disease.

The study is titled "Postmortem tau in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in older adult men who participated in youth amateur American-style football."

One in three adults in the U.S. has three or more risk factors for a newly recognized but increasingly common condition: cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. First recognized by the American Heart Association (AHA) in a 2023 presidential advisory, CKM connects heart and metabolic health with kidney function as intertwined drivers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

Long before CKM was defined, millions of Americans were unknowingly progressing through the condition's dangerous stages. 

In a first-of-its-kind analysis, Tarang Parekh, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Delaware College of Health Sciences, and colleagues at Houston Methodist Hospital and Harvard Medical School, examined the state-level prevalence of CKM syndrome, using self-reported data from the Centers for Disease Control's Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System from 2011 to 2023. 

Parekh's analysis, recently published in the journal JAAC: Advances, found that 80% of the population has some form of CKM syndrome. Over the past 12 years, not a single state saw a decline in CKM rates. 

West Virginia had the highest prevalence, with nearly 87% of residents affected by 2023. Delaware wasn't far behind, with rates climbing from 76% to 83% over the same period. Colorado reported the lowest rate, with nearly 72% of the population impacted. Overall, CKM rates were highest in the Midwest and the South.

"This is an alarming trend that's a result of our fragmented healthcare system," Parekh said.

CKM, like many chronic diseases, progresses in stages. Stage zero means no disease is present. At Stage 1, individuals are obese or prediabetic. Stages 2 and 3 involve kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes or a combination of risk factors that dramatically raise their risk for CVD. Stage 4 is dire.

That's where we see a clinical CVD diagnosis, including heart failure, stroke or coronary heart disease, or kidney failure."

Tarang Parekh, assistant professor of epidemiology, University of Delaware College of Health Sciences

Parekh's analysis found nearly 50% of states saw an increased prevalence of CKM in stages 1 through 3. While Stage 4 rates declined steadily nationwide, Minnesota was an exception, seeing significant increases in the most dangerous stage of the condition.

Routine health screenings are key to slowing the progression of CKM and reducing CVD. However, work to get physicians to assess these conditions in an interconnected manner is only just beginning.

"We must educate the public about the intersection of these conditions, so they realize CKM syndrome is more than just taking care of obesity, diabetes, or CVD in isolation," said Parekh. "Without lifestyle and behavioral changes, one risk factor can snowball into several."

Significant variation in state-level programs also complicates the matter.

"Some programs only tackle diabetes self-management. We must expand those programs to include other risk factors for CVD to reduce CKM syndrome progression," Parekh added.

Parekh also emphasized that individuals must take charge of their health.

"People need to know their weight, blood pressure, and BMI," said Parekh. "Routine point-of-care testing during wellness visits is essential. But often, if a measure is borderline, we tend to ignore it - that needs to stop."

To combat rising CKM rates, the AHA has launched a pilot preventive health initiative focused on improving care for people in select cities and regions, including Atlanta, San Diego, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Washington, D.C, Maryland, and Ohio, including the Cincinnati metro area and parts of Kentucky. These locations were selected due to disease prevalence, health system infrastructure and community characteristics. 

The AHA plans to expand the CKM Health Initiative to 15 geographic regions nationwide, ultimately reaching 250,000 Americans at 150 existing healthcare sites. 

"The pilot brings together providers across various specialties, from primary care physicians to cardiologists and nephrologists, to take a more holistic approach to care," Parekh said.

Looking ahead, Parekh plans to analyze clinical data using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct a more detailed understanding of CKM. He also hopes to develop a machine-learning risk model to predict and, ultimately, slow CKM progression.

Scientists have discovered how a key protein helps maintain strong connections between brain cells that are crucial for learning and memory.

Results of the study, published in the journal Science Advances, could point the way to new treatments for traumatic brain injuries and diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, the scientists said.

Their research, led by a Rutgers University-New Brunswick professor, uncovered a previously unknown role for cypin, a brain protein. Members of the research team found that cypin promotes the presence of tags on specific proteins at synapses, namely the tiny gaps where the brain cells, known as neurons, communicate. The marking helps ensure that the right proteins are in the right place, allowing the synapses to work properly.

The researchers said the insight has potentially profound implications for the treatment of brain disorders.

Our research indicates that developing treatments or therapies that specifically focus on the protein cypin may help improve the connections between brain cells, enhancing memory and thinking abilities. These findings suggest that cypin could be used to develop treatments for neurodegenerative and neurocognitive diseases, as well as brain injuries."

Bonnie Firestein, Distinguished Professor in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience in the School of Arts and Sciences and author of the study

Firestein has been studying cypin for more than two decades. Her latest work uncovered several important aspects of how cypin functions and why it is significant for brain health.

One of the crucial discoveries is that cypin helps add a special tag to proteins in synapses connecting neurons. This tag ensures proteins are correctly positioned and able to send signals effectively. Proper tagging and movement of proteins are essential for the neurons to function correctly.

Another important finding is that cypin interacts with a complex of proteins, known as the proteasome, which is responsible for breaking down proteins. When cypin attaches or binds to the proteasome, it slows down this breakdown process, leading to an accumulation of proteins. This buildup can positively affect various cellular functions, which are important for the communication between neurons.

Firestein's research also shows that when there is more cypin present, the levels of important proteins in the synapses increase. These proteins are vital for effective communication between neurons, empowering learning and memory.

Additionally, cypin increases the activity of another protein called UBE4A, which also helps with the tagging process. This indicates that cypin's influence on synaptic proteins is partly because of its effect on UBE4A.

The work highlights the importance of cypin in maintaining healthy brain function and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.

"Even though this study is what we call 'basic research,' it eventually can be applied in practical, clinical settings," said Firestein, who already is conducting such "translational" work in parallel. Translational research is a type of research that takes discoveries made in the lab and turns them into practical treatments or solutions to improve human health.

Cypin's significant role in the workings of the brain's synapses makes it highly relevant to the potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic brain injury, she said. For example, healthy synaptic function is often disrupted in diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

In addition, the protein's role in promoting synaptic plasticity – the ability of synapses to strengthen or weaken over time – means it may be used to help counteract the synaptic dysfunction seen in neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries.

The study was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (NINDS), the Coalition for Brain Injury Research, a charitable foundation dedicated to the memory of Dennis John Benigno, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in junior high school; and private donors Jamuna Rajasingham and Dyan Rajasingham.

Other scientists from Rutgers involved in the study include Kiran Madura, a professor in the Department of Pharmacology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School; Srinivasa Gandu, Mihir Patel, Ana Rodriguez, former doctoral students in the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience.

Jared Lamp and Irving Vega of Michigan State University also contributed to this research.

A third of women who died during or in the year after pregnancy were known to Children's Social Care – higher than previously reported, new research reveals. The authors say urgent changes are needed to prioritize and improve mothers' care.

The study is published today in BMJ Medicine and led by King's College London, Oxford University and the charity Birth Companions, and funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research. It is the first to detail the situations of the 1695 women who died within a year of pregnancy; of whom 420 were in contact with children's social care. Researchers analysed national surveillance data from 2014 to 2022 to understand how the women died and the quality of the care they received.

The number of newborn babies in care proceedings in England is a growing problem. 2914 were in care in 2019/20; up 20% in seven years. Children under one make-up over a quarter of all children in care proceedings.

The study finds three quarters of the mothers known to social services died between six weeks and the year after pregnancy and most deaths were due to suicide (20%), other psychiatric causes including drug related deaths (30%), and homicide (5%). Women with social care involvement more frequently died from homicide and mental health related causes than women without involvement.

Many of the women who died had significant experiences of abuse and mental ill-health. Two thirds (65%) of women with Children's Social Care involvement reported domestic abuse before or during pregnancy, compared to 3% of women without social care involvement. One in three disclosed abuse during childhood compared to 2% of women without social care involvement.

A higher proportion of women known to social care had pre-existing medical problems (75%, versus 59%), mental health issues (75% versus 27%), smoking during pregnancy (73% versus 21%) and known substance use (55% versus 5%) than women with no social care involvement.

The researchers also conducted a confidential care review, which looked at anonymised care records for 47 of these women. The study found uncoordinated involvement of services and agencies, such as maternity and mental health services, children's social care, and other medical specialists. This resulted in overwhelming appointment schedules, and compounded the adversity the women were facing rather than helping them. In several case reviews, women had more than thirty different appointments during pregnancy. In many instances, risk management solely focused on safeguarding the infant, disregarding the mother's own safeguarding needs.

This report details for the first time the high proportion of women with children's social care involvement who die in the UK and the care they receive during pregnancy and the postnatal period.

What the analysis tells us is that these women come from backgrounds of trauma and abuse, and yet despite their efforts to keep up with demanding appointment schedules, they often face scrutiny and judgment rather than receiving support for the issues they are facing. Too often, the professionals the women are in touch with don't work together to provide holistic care, which increases the pressure on a mother. When women have access to designated multi-disciplinary teams, with specialist knowledge and capacity to provide integrated and holistic care, these barriers can be overcome. It makes it easier to understand who is doing what and when, for women and professionals."

Kaat De Backer, first author from King's College London

The researchers highlighted the complex care women have to navigate during pregnancy and the postnatal period. They say urgent changes to practice, clinical guidance and policy are required to prioritise mothers with social care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood.

Naomi Delap, Director at the charity Birth Companions, said: "This study highlights the acute need for better care for women with Children's Social Care involvement, and the significant barriers that get in the way of providing that care.

"To help improve things, we need coordinated national policy and clear expectations across the health and social care systems. In response to this study, Birth Companions is launching work to co-design a national care pathway, in order to deliver consistent, compassionate support for all women who have Children's Social Care involvement in pregnancy and early motherhood. This work holds the potential to transform care, break cycles of harm, and help ensure fewer mothers lose their lives in such tragic circumstances."

Senior author Dr Nicola Vousden, from Oxford Population Health's National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, said "This study adds to findings from MBRRACE-UK that women with multiple disadvantages prior to, and during pregnancy, are at increased risk of worse outcomes. We've identified practical changes that are required within maternity care. We also need joined up pathways of care across maternity, social care and community health partners to support the needs of women with children's social involvement, including domestic abuse, substance misuse and mental health. This will require local and national action."

Recently, the team led by Chief Physician Quan Zhang and Associate Professor Feng Liu at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital systematically evaluated the genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain structures using large-scale genome-wide association summary statistics and advanced statistical genetic methods. The related findings were published in Research under the title "Genome-wide pleiotropy analysis reveals shared genetic associations between type 2 diabetes mellitus and subcortical brain volumes".

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder worldwide. Beyond glucose dysregulation, it exerts significant effects on the central nervous system. Epidemiological and neuroimaging evidence indicates that individuals with T2DM are at substantially increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia, which is closely linked to degenerative changes in brain structure—particularly within subcortical regions such as the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and thalamus. These regions play critical roles in memory, emotional regulation, and motor control, and have been shown to exhibit marked volume reduction and structural abnormalities in individuals with T2DM.

Current neuroimaging studies have systematically characterized the structural brain abnormalities associated with T2DM. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving these changes remain unclear. T2DM is a prototypical polygenic disorder, with large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) having identified hundreds of associated genetic loci. Likewise, the volume and morphology of subcortical brain structures are known to be strongly influenced by genetic factors. Emerging evidence suggests potential genetic overlap between T2DM and brain structure. For instance, the T2DM risk gene TCF7L2 has been linked to amygdala volume, and the Hp 1-1 gene has been associated with hippocampal volume. Moreover, polygenic risk scores for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) have shown associations with gray matter volume, and the genetic risk of several hippocampal morphological traits has been related to T2DM. While these findings provide preliminary insights, a comprehensive investigation into the shared genetic architecture between T2DM and brain structural abnormalities is still lacking. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying molecular pathways and biological mechanisms.

The authors systematically evaluated the polygenic overlap and shared genetic architecture between T2DM and the volumes of subcortical brain structures, including the bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala, and accumbens. MiXeR analysis revealed that T2DM has high polygenicity and low discoverability, and shares varying degrees of genome-wide genetic overlap with subcortical brain regions, with Dice coefficients ranging from 22.4% to 49.6% .

Using the conditional false discovery rate approach, the study identified 229 loci associated with T2DM (including 5 novel loci) and 220 loci associated with subcortical brain structures (including 16 novel loci). Furthermore, conjunctional false discovery rate analysis revealed 129 shared loci jointly associated with T2DM and subcortical volumes. Among them, rs429358 on chromosome 19 (located in the APOE gene) showed the strongest association with both bilateral accumbens volume and T2DM, and exhibited a high functional pathogenicity score.

In the functional annotation, most of the shared SNPs were located in intronic or intergenic regions. A total of 769 protein-coding genes were mapped from the candidate SNPs, showing high expression in pancreatic, hepatic, and cardiac tissues, and were involved in various biological processes including energy metabolism, neurogenesis, and nervous system development. Developmental trajectory analysis revealed that genes shared between T2DM and multiple subcortical brain regions were highly expressed during the fetal period and gradually declined after birth, suggesting their potential role in early brain development.

Further transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS) validated the dual association of several key genes (e.g., TUFM, JAZF1) with both T2DM and the volumes of specific brain regions.

This study systematically revealed the genetic overlap between T2DM and subcortical brain structures, clarifying their shared genetic loci, shared genes and the potential biological pathways involved. This interdisciplinary work not only deepens our understanding of how T2DM affects brain health, but also promotes a shift in metabolic disease research from a traditional focus on peripheral metabolism to the central nervous system. The findings provide critical genetic evidence for risk prediction, biomarker identification, and early intervention strategies targeting T2DM-related brain structural alterations, offering new directions for clinical translation and precision prevention in the brain-metabolism interface.

Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions arise when the body's immune system fails to distinguish between "self" and "foreign" cells, and mistakenly attacks its own healthy cells, resulting in persistent inflammation and tissue damage. Central to these autoimmune responses are CD4+ T cells, a class of immune cells that can either promote or suppress the condition.

Regulatory T cells (Treg) are a special subtype of CD4+ T cells that act as the immune system's peacekeepers. Treg cells, marked by protein Foxp3, help in suppressing harmful immune responses. However, when the function of Treg cells is compromised, as seen in cases of MS and IBD, the immune response is dominated by the Th1 and Th17 cells (other CD4+T cell subtypes), which promote inflammation, further worsening the disease symptoms. Therefore, boosting the development and activity of Treg cells is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach, but the mechanisms underlying its effective regulation remain unclear.

In pursuit of a deeper understanding of these mechanisms, a team of Chinese scientists led by Dr. Xiaojun Wu and Dr. Fei Huang from the Shanghai Key Laboratory of Compound Chinese Medicines, SHUTCM, China, and Dr. Weidong Pan from the Department of Neurology, Shuguang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China, explored the role of Early Growth Response Gene 1 (Egr-1) in promoting the activity of Treg cells. The study was conducted in a well-established animal model of MS, called experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to confirm the mechanisms. The findings of this study were published in Volume 8 of Research on April 15, 2025.

Elaborating more, Dr. Wu, the lead author of this study, says "We started by screening the genes that appeared different between mice with mild and severe EAE." Further, he adds, "Among the top identified genes in CD4+ T cells, Egr-1 stood out as significantly downregulated in severe disease."

After identifying Egr-1 as a regulatory gene, the team assessed its role by using genetically engineered mice lacking Egr-1 in CD4+ T cells. These mice were induced with EAE and tracked for disease progression. The researchers also analyzed the immune cell compositions in the spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system of these mice.

"The mice lacking Egr-1 showed worse disease, fewer Treg cells, and more inflammatory TH17 and TH1 cells" explains Dr. Huang.

The researchers also conducted additional in vitro experiments. By analyzing isolated human CD4+ T cells from MS patients and healthy donors, they confirmed that both Egr-1 and Foxp3 levels were reduced in patient samples. Further, to determine whether Egr-1 directly regulates Foxp3, the researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation, which revealed that Egr-1 binds to the Foxp3 promoter. Additionally, using luciferase reporter assays, they also confirmed that Egr-1 binding increases Foxp3 gene activity. They then traced the pathway to TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor Beta) signaling via the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates Egr-1.

"We identified a unique mechanism of Egr-1," explains Dr. Pan, "First, TGF-β activates the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, which activates Egr-1. Egr-1 then directly binds to the Foxp3 promoter to enhance its expression, bypassing the classical Smad3-dependent pathway."

What's more, the researchers also investigated the effect of a natural compound, Calycosin, which acts as an Egr-1 agonist. Treatment with calycosin restored Treg cell functions and improve clinical outcomes in mice with EAE, but only in those with functional Egr-1.

Overall, the study underscores the essential role of Egr-1 in Treg cell development and function, identifying it as a central molecular switch in immune regulation. By elucidating its mechanism and validating the effect of a natural Egr-1 agonist, the study suggests that targeting Egr-1 may offer a promising treatment strategy, potentially transforming therapeutic approaches to autoimmune diseases.

Announcing a new article publication for BIO Integration journal. Imbalances in the intestinal microbiome are closely associated with the occurrence and development of cancer, and can affect tumorigenesis by influencing the inflammatory response, regulating the immune system, producing specific metabolites, and participating in tumor signaling pathways.

This study investigated the relationships among intestinal microbial dynamics, metabolite profiles, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) outcomes in patients with breast cancer. Patients were stratified by Miller-Payne (MP) grade into good (MP 4-5) or poor (MP 1-3) responders. Fecal samples from patients (pre- and post-NAC) were analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic analysis.
After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the species diversity and abundance of the intestinal microbiome significantly decreased, and these trends were not correlated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy. Fusobacterium abundance remained significantly higher in poor responders than good responders post-NAC, thus suggesting its association with chemoresistance.

The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was lower in patients with breast cancer than healthy controls, and was correlated with the therapeutic response: this ratio rose post-NAC but remained suboptimal in poor responders. Untargeted metabolomics identified upregulated amino acids (Thr-Thr and histidine) in poor responders and elevated lipids (C17-sphinganine) in good responders. ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) analysis validated these metabolites (AUC >0.7) as predictive biomarkers. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in mTOR signaling, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signaling pathways.

These findings underscore the intestinal microbiome's potential as a predictor of NAC efficacy and a therapeutic target. Modulating Fusobacterium or metabolite pathways may enhance chemotherapy response.

Using artificial intelligence, researchers show how γ-secretase recognizes substrates - an important advance for fundamental and translational research.

The γ-secretase enzyme is capable of cleaving more than 150 different membrane proteins. This includes the amyloid precursor protein, from which the deposits typical for Alzheimer's disease are formed, and the Notch1 protein, which plays an important role in cell communication and carcinogenesis. For a long time, however, it was unclear how γ-secretase recognizes its target proteins. Although many proteases identify substrates by means of characteristic amino acid sequences, γ-secretase does not.

An interdisciplinary team from LMU's Biomedical Center, the Technical University of Munich (TUM), and the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) has now managed to clarify details of the mechanism. The researchers have shown that substrates of the enzyme possess a complex physicochemical profile which is decisive for their recognition and cleavage.

The team developed a novel technique called Comparative Physicochemical Profiling (CPP), which allows them to compare the physicochemical properties of known substrates against reference proteins and identify characteristic patterns. In combination with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), the team was also able to render visible the features that are characteristic for substrates of γ-secretase.

"The substrates of γ-secretase possess a specific physicochemical profile, which spans the entire transmembrane domain and adjacent sequence regions," explains Prof. Harald Steiner (LMU and DZNE), who led the study together with Dmitrij Frishman (TUM). Particularly close to the cleavage site of the substrates, the researchers discovered, substrates have the potential to develop an extended conformation as an alternative to their helical structure - a property that is supported by experimental data from γ-secretase enzyme-substrate complexes.

"We wanted to understand what actually defines a substrate, and not just generate a black-box prediction," adds lead author Dr. Stephan Breimann, who played a major part in developing the CPP method. "The use of explainable AI has given us precisely this transparency."

Using the CPP method, the researchers also managed to identify several previously unknown substrates of the enzyme, including proteins that play an important role in immune regulation and carcinogenesis.

The authors of the study are convinced their findings extend far beyond γ-secretase.

We see a new approach in here for also decoding the interplay of sequence, structure, and function in other proteases - or, say, in receptors."

Prof. Harald Steiner, LMU and DZNE

In the long term, the results could also contribute to the development of therapeutically relevant compounds such as small-molecule drugs, peptides, or antibodies with enhanced specificities.

Women diagnosed with premenstrual symptoms have a slightly increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life. This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Cardiovascular Research.

Premenstrual symptoms include premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the more severe form, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The symptoms, which appear a few days before menstruation and then subside, can be both psychological and physical.

The study included more than 99,000 women with premenstrual symptoms who were followed for up to 22 years. The researchers compared their health with women without these symptoms – both in the general population and by comparing them with their own sisters to take into account hereditary factors and upbringing.

The results show that women with premenstrual symptoms had about a ten per cent higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. When the researchers also looked at different types of cardiovascular disease, they found that the link was particularly strong for heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias), where the risk was 31 per cent higher, and for stroke caused by a blood clot, where the risk was 27 per cent higher. Even after the researchers took into account other factors such as smoking, BMI and mental health, the link between premenstrual symptoms and increased disease risk remained.

The increased risk was particularly clear in women who were diagnosed before the age of 25 and in those who had also experienced postnatal depression, a condition that can also be caused by hormonal fluctuations."

Yihui Yang, PhD student at the Institute of Environmental Medicine at Karolinska Institutet and first author of the study

Research has not yet identified the cause of this link, but the researchers behind the study suggest three possible explanations. One is that women with premenstrual symptoms may have a disrupted regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which controls blood pressure and fluid balance in the body, among other things. The second is that these women have increased levels of inflammation in the body, which is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis and other heart problems. Finally, it may be because women with premenstrual symptoms may have metabolic abnormalities, which are linked to an increased risk of both stroke and heart attack.

"We hope that our findings will contribute to greater awareness that premenstrual disorders not only affect daily life but can also have consequences for long-term health," says Donghao Lu, associate professor at the same department and last author of the study.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JULY 12: FIFA President Gianni Infantino speaks during a media scrum at the ... More Trump Tower ahead of FIFA Club World Cup Final on July 12, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Etsuo Hara/Getty Images)

A day prior to the final, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed that the FIFA Club World Cup "has been a huge, huge, huge success" and that the "golden era of football has started."

However, there might be some other individuals out there in the soccer universe to think otherwise, especially players and coaches, who have had to endure the heat and thunderstorms of the U.S. summer.

"We can say definitely that this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success." Infantino said during a press conference in Manhattan in New York City on Saturday morning, according to BBC.com. "Of course, there are a lot of positives, some negatives."

Infantino did not mention the negatives.

"We respect everyone's opinion," he said. "It has been successful. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadiums. That's around 40,000 spectators per match - there is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams and these are neutral stadiums.

"We heard financially it would not work but I can say we generated over $2 billion in revenues with this competition. We earned on average $33 million per match. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33 million per match.

"It is already the most successful club competition in the world with all different measurements."

On the financial end, it appears to have been successful.

But some, and perhaps many of the participants, such as players and coaches, would disagree.

They will note that many matches were played in the afternoon, at noon and 3 p.m., when the temperatures are either rising or at their highest.

During the tournament, former Liverpool head coach Juergen Klopp called the CWC, "the worst idea ever implemented in football."

"In the end, it's all about the game and not the surrounding aspects - and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard," he told Welt in Germany.

"People who have never had anything to do with day-to-day business or who no longer have anything to do with it come up with something.

"Last year we had the Copa America and European Championship, this year the Club World Cup and next year then the World Cup.

"This means no real recovery for the players who are there, neither physically nor mentally."

On Friday, Chelsea captain and defender Enzo Fernandez, a member of the Argentine squad that captured the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, complained about competing in the scorching heat.

"Honestly, the heat is incredible," he said during a press conference. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous. Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home.

"The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?"

And that is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg, of other players and coaches criticizing playing in the heat.

In terms of avoiding the heat, Infantino said that in contrast to the Club World Cup, the 2026 World Cup will have four stadiums with roofs - Atlanta (Mercedes-Benz Stadium), Dallas (AT&T Stadium), Houston (NRG Stadium) and Vancouver (BC Place). It should be noted that there is a dozen other 2026 World Cup venues that won't have roofs and will be susceptible to weather (heat and thunderstorms).

Atlanta was the lone indoor facility at the Club World Cup.

The FIFA president said that added that his organization is studying methods to improve playing conditions.

"Every criticism we receive is a source for us to study and analyze what can do better," Infantino added.

"Of course, the heat is an issue. Last year, at the Olympic Games in Paris, games during the day, in all sports, took place in very hot conditions.

“Cooling breaks are very important, and we will see what we can do, but we have stadiums with roofs, and we will definitely use these stadiums during the day next year.”

Infantino said that that U.S. President Donald Trump will attend Sunday's final between UEFA Champions League winner Paris Saint-Germain and UEFA Conference League champion Chelsea. Earlier in the week, Infantino announced that FIFA would open an office at Trump Tower.

"President Trump will be at the final," he said, according to www.espn.com. "He loves soccer. In his first term as President there was a soccer goal in the White House garden.

"President Trump is the President of the U.S., one of the host countries for the World Cup, and he embraced immediately the Club World Cup as well.

"Events like these are huge events. You can't stage tournaments like this without his support."

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ — There's only one more trophy left to be raised by Paris Saint-Germain. 

They've won the French league, the French Cup, the French Super Cup and the club's first-ever UEFA Champions League title in late May. 

And they hope to cap off one of the most historic seasons in the sport's history with a victory against English side Chelsea in the FIFA Club World Cup final on Sunday, July 13, at MetLife Stadium. 

“We really want to make history, and we're hungry for a win,” PSG's Brazilian captain Marquinhos said.

You ask most players and coaches at the FIFA Club World Cup about PSG, and they seem to all agree: The Parisians are the best soccer team in the world. 

They're a convincing favorite (-165) to win the final against Chelsea (+400), according to BETMGM, for good reason. 

Watching them work is truly a spectacle for the sport. They thrive off pressuring the opposing team, then attack with quick thinking and decisive passes in harmony. 

Mind you, this was a club that featured Argentine World Cup champion Lionel Messi, French World Cup champion Kylian Mbappé and Brazilian star Neymar just two years ago. 

And now, they're somehow playing better without them. 

“Right now, they're the best team in the world — without a doubt,” Messi said after losing 4-0 against his former club with Major League Soccer's Inter Miami in the round of 16 on June 29.

This PSG group has its fair share of unheralded stars who will surely be recognized more after their Champions League win, and if they secure the Club World Cup title. 

Ousmane Dembélé, who played at Barcelona with Messi, is the favorite to win the Ballon d'Or — the highest individual honor in the sport. Désiré Doué is also rising French star, and Moroccan defender Achraf Hakimi both shined during their Champions League run. Fabián Ruiz, who helped Spain win Euro 2024 last summer, had two goals against Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semifinal. 

PSG often start matches by just kicking the ball out of bounds like a NFL punter, immediately applying pressure on their opponent. Dembélé leads the charge defensively so he can make an immediate offensive impact. It causes some to fluster, like Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois did, when PSG routed them 4-0 in their July 9 semifinal. 

“I told [Dembélé] after the game that he was pressing a lot, and he told me that's what he had to do,” Courtois told reporters after the semifinal. “On a clearance, I have half a second to think about where I'm going to shoot, because they're pressing you.”

Added Marquinhos: “We have a very offensive gameplan. We always want to have ball possession. If we do not have ball possession, we will not negotiate.” 

Luis Enrique has been the architect of PSG's season — 10 years after leading Messi and Barcelona to a Champions League title.

Enrique has inspired PSG's style, awake even further after they dropped a 1-0 match in the group stage to Brazilian side Botafogo in the tournament. It's the only goal they've conceded at the Club World Cup. 

His players have simply bought into his philosophy. And the success shows. 

“A team with 11 stars, that's the goal. We don't want just one — we want 11. That's what we have right now. And I wouldn't say 11, I'd say 13, 14, 15. That's our goal,” Enrique said. “I think it's a commitment we made from the sporting director's office, the president and myself, to seek 11 or 15 stars and for the real star to be the team, something our fans have identified with… It's the whole team.” 

Enrique knows PSG could face defeat in the Club World Cup final — or any of the matches that follow them into next season. 

Still, he wants to cap off this season with another victory and another trophy. 

“Best season in my career? Maybe,” Enrique said. “But we need to win Sunday's game to put icing on the cake.”

FIFA Club World Cup

Eagle-eyed fans at MetLife Stadium may have noticed a stage being built in the sky.

As football teams from around the world battled it out on the pitch below, this curious platform slowly began to take shape over the last few weeks at the New Jersey venue for the Club World Cup's final.

Its podium-like shape could have made you wonder. Is this where either Chelsea or Paris Saint-Germain will be crowned world champions on Sunday? Or, more logically, is it where the final's halftime show will be performed? Turns out, it's the latter, as FIFA confirmed to The Athletic this week.

This stage, high in the nose-bleed sections of the stadium, will be where J Balvin, Doja Cat, Tems and Emmanuel Kelly will make history for FIFA. Across all its many competitions over the decades, this will be the first time a FIFA tournament includes a halftime show.

Global Citizen, which partnered with FIFA and is leading the halftime show with Coldplay's Chris Martin, revealed more details to U.S. magazine ‘Rolling Stone' on Friday. Together, the groups have created a high-tech stage in the upper stands, to avoid potentially damaging the pitch at halftime of such an important game, featuring 40,000 pounds of gear, scenery and structural trusses. It took six semi-trucks to deliver all this material to the venue, Global Citizen said, with the stage itself made up of 4,000 feet of pipe bracing and LED displays with nearly 16 million pixels.

“By building our platform high in the stands, we ensured that the newly installed natural grass remains untouched while delivering an unforgettable show that is designed to be time-efficient and visually stunning,” Hugh Evans, Global Citizen's chief executive, told ‘Rolling Stone'.

The 15-minute halftime show is a curious addition to FIFA's tournament lineup, but it falls in line with the body's theme of expanding and growing this new-look competition as much as it can. Halftime shows are more a tradition in American sports than European soccer, with the NFL's Super Bowl spectaculars being the biggest example of what this can look like.

While FIFA has notably never hosted a halftime performance in the past, last year, South American equivalent Conmebol took a risk when it tapped Shakira to debut in Copa América's inaugural halftime show at its final in Miami, Florida. The plans were openly criticized because of the extended break it would create for the players, a result of staff having to set up a stage and break it down again before the match could resume.

It will be interesting to see if there are any gripes now that FIFA's in charge of a similar performance, or if the sky-high staging at MetLife helps alleviate any of those potential grievances.

The way foreign executives see it, Americans have successfully merged sport with entertainment in a way that is unmatched elsewhere in the world. It's why so many soccer tournaments have come to the U.S. in recent years, and it's why next year's World Cup, co-hosted with Canada and Mexico, is fully embracing this in not-so-subtle ways, such as a halftime show.

This weekend's Club World Cup final will also feature a pre-match ceremony. FIFA is encouraging fans to arrive at the stadium early to catch it at 1:30 p.m. ET, or to tune in then. The match's start time is 90 minutes later.

The pre-match action features three parts.

First, there's the ‘countdown to the final', followed by a performance of ‘Desire' by FIFA's music ambassador Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini. There will also be “a powerful tribute to the tournament hosts”, with the U.S. national anthem performed, a military color guard and a “dramatic flyover and dazzling pyrotechnics (that) will electrify the stadium”, in FIFA's words.

The latter is fitting considering that U.S. President Donald Trump has said he'll attend the final, joking that he would be “delivering” the trophy to the event following its recent stay at the White House in Washington. What we do know is that the trophy presentation ceremony will be pitch-side after the final whistle.

There is still plenty we don't know about the halftime show – like whether performers will be limited to that stage, or if we'll see anyone pull a Lady Gaga. How could anyone forget her big leaps and dramatic exit during the 2017 Super Bowl in Houston, Texas?

One sure thing is that whatever happens this weekend will likely offer lessons and instruction for 2026.

Fifa president Gianni Infantino was speaking alongside footballing legends like Ronaldo Nazario, Roberto Baggio and Kaka at Trump Tower

Fifa president Gianni Infantino says the Club World Cup is "already the most successful club competition in the world", despite widespread criticism of the tournament.

Infantino, who has led world football's governing body since 2016, claims the competition has generated more than $2bn (£1.5bn) in revenue, which he says is worth "$33m (£24m) per match".

As a result, he believes the tournament has been a "huge success", adding "the golden era of global club football has started".

Infantino's words come just weeks after former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said the Club World Cup, which this year moved to the summer and expanded to 32 teams, was "the worst idea ever implemented in football".

Many matches have been poorly attended, with more than a million empty seats  during the tournament, while players like Jude Bellingham, Reece James and Enzo Fernandez have criticised the weather conditions and quality of the pitches in the United States.

Chelsea midfielder Fernandez said the heat was "very dangerous", while his manager Enzo Maresca complained it is "impossible" to have a normal training session.

Speaking at Trump Tower in New York on the eve of Sunday's final between Chelsea and Paris St-Germain (20:00 BST), Infantino said: "The golden era of global club football has started. 

"We can say definitely that this Fifa Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success. Of course, there are a lot of positives, some negatives. 

"We respect everyone's opinion. It has been successful. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadium. That's around 40,000 spectators per match - there is no league in the world with that number, except the Premier League which, of course, has home teams and these are neutral stadiums.

"We heard financially it would not work but I can say we generated over $2bn in revenues with this competition. We earned on average $33m per match. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match. 

"It is already the most successful club competition in the world with all different measurements."

Has run to Club World Cup final been worth it for Chelsea?

In New Jersey, where Sunday's final - set to be attended by US President Donald Trump - will take place, temperatures have reached 38C in recent days.

Infantino accepted the high summer temperatures in the US are "definitely an issue" after Fernandez called on Fifa to consider player welfare before next summer's 2026 World Cup.

Earlier this month, players' union Fifpro said it believed Chelsea's game against ES Tunis in Philadelphia, among others, should have been delayed or postponed because of the heat.

The World Cup is due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico over the same period next year.

"Of course, the heat is definitely an issue," said Infantino. "It's an issue around the world. I remember it was the same in the Olympics in Paris and in other football games. 

"The conditions need cooling breaks, watering the pitch and seeing how we can do things better. But we have stadiums in America that are covered and one in Canada in Vancouver which is covered, and we will definitely use these stadiums more during the day."

Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium was the only covered stadium at the Club World Cup but the 2026 World Cup will have a further four options with roofs - Vancouver, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles.

United States women's national team legend and two-time World Cup and Olympic gold medalist, Tobin Heath, has announced her retirement from professional soccer on her podcast, "The RE-CAP Show," at the age of 37.

Heath's decision to retire comes after a series of setbacks, including a knee injury that required multiple surgeries, keeping her out of play since 2022. During her time with the USWNT, Heath made a significant impact, scoring 36 goals and recording 42 assists in 181 appearances for the U.S. since 2008. She was part of the USWNT World Cup teams in 2015 and 2019, and she scored the final goal against Japan in the final match of the 2015 tournament.

In addition to her achievements at the national level, Heath spent some time in France playing for Paris Saint-Germain before returning to the Portland Thorns, where she won two NWSL championships. She then moved to the FA Women's Super League, playing for Manchester United and Arsenal, until an injury sidelined her. After recovering, she returned to the NWSL and signed with OL Reign, but unfortunately, she faced another season-ending knee injury after playing only a few matches.

The first 32-team edition of the tournament faced criticism in the build-up for stretching demands on elite players and has been played out in baking temperatures in the United States that have raised concerns for the health of those involved.

There were also doubts about the level of interest the competition would generate among fans but Infantino said he was satisfied with the attendances at matches - despite many games being far from sold out - and claimed it had been a major success financially.

"The golden age of club football has started. We can definitely say this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge success," Infantino told reporters at Trump Tower on New York City's Fifth Avenue, where FIFA has just opened an office.

"We heard that financially it would not work, that nobody is interested, but I can say we generated almost 2.1 billion dollars in revenues, for 63 matches," he said.

"That makes an average of $33 million per match - no other club competition in the world comes close.

"It is already the most successful club competition in the world."

Former Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp has been one of the leading voices against the tournament, calling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football" in a recent interview.

But the head of world football's governing body dismissed suggestions that Klopp might be speaking for most observers in Europe.

"We shouldn't say that the opinion of Europe on this is very bad because it is not true," said Infantino, who was appearing on a stage alongside numerous footballing greats including the Brazilian Ronaldo.

"All the teams who have come here have been happy - some teams who didn't come here because they didn't qualify were calling us to see how they could qualify.

"Of course I would have liked to have Liverpool here, Arsenal, Manchester United, Barcelona, Tottenham, AC Milan, Napoli... but you have to qualify and there are different criteria."

The next Club World Cup is due to take place in 2029, with Infantino refusing to commit when asked whether the tournament could be played every two years or be expanded to feature more teams.

"We created something new, something which is here to stay, something which is changing the landscape of club football," he added.

PSV Eindhoven will have one less attacking option, although Bayer Leverkusen will, for the upcoming Bundesliga season.

That's because U.S. men's national team midfielder Malik Tillman has signed with Leverkusen, it was announced on Saturday.

The 23-year-old Tillman, whose 33 goal involvements helped PSV win back-to-back Dutch Eredivisie titles in the 2023-24 and 2024-25 campaigns signed a five-year contract.

The 23-year-old attacker's arrival follows Florian Wirtz's transfer to defending English Premier League champions Liverpool on 20 June.

“This club has always played great football,” Tillman said, according to Bundesliga.com. “In the last four or five years, Leverkusen have grown enormously and become attractive to a lot of players throughout Europe. I want to win something. That was my aim in Glasgow and in Eindhoven and it remains my aim here.”

Tillman, one of the USMNT standouts during its recent run as Concacaf Gold Cup runners-up, has scored three goals in 25 international appearances.

Born in Nuremberg, Tillman spent eight years in the Bayern Munich system, playing for the record champions' various youth teams before making his professional debut and scoring his first senior club goal in the 2021-22 season.

He made seven first-team appearances for Bayern before he was loan to Glasgow Rangers, recording 12 goals and five assists in 43 matches across all competitions during the 2022-23 Scottish Premiership season.

Tillman was loaned out to PSV the following campaign, with the move made permanent after he contributed nine goals and 10 assists to PSV's 2023-24 league title. He contributed another 14 goal involvements in the 2024-25 season, as well as four in the UEFA Champions League.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernández heads into Sunday's Club World Cup final wary of the weather, along with Paris Saint-Germain.

“Honestly, the heat is incredible,” Fernandez said Friday. “The other day I got a little dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature in very dangerous.”

FIFA slashed ticket prices again ahead of the final, as it has throughout the tournament.

Chelsea and PSG play starting at 3 p.m. EDT in MetLife Stadium, also site of next year's World Cup final. Because of the heat, Fernandez recommended FIFA avoid afternoon kickoffs at the 2026 tournament.

“The speed of the game is not the same,” he said. “Everything becomes very slow. Well, let's hope that next year they change the schedule, at least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle.”

Temperature at kickoff is forecast to be 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) with humidity that will make it feel like 91 F (33 C).

“The game will be harder for the team that don't have the ball,” Chelsea captain Reece James said. “I think we've played in it a fair amount now, so I'd say we're slowly, slowly getting used to it.”

Both teams were allowed by FIFA not to have media availabilities on Saturday.

PSG seeks to complete a quadruple after winning Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and its first Champions League title.




Chelsea is trying for its second world championship after winning in 2021. The Blues have a fourth day of rest after beating Fluminense 2-0 on Tuesday, a day before PSG routed Real Madrid 4-0.

Lowest ticket prices dropped from $330 earlier in the week to $199.60 on Saturday.

“I agree with most of the people that they say that they are the best team in Europe, the best team in the world, and the reason why is because they are showing this — they show in France, they show in the Champions League, they are showing in this competition,” Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said.

PSG clinched the French league title on April 5 with six games to spare, won the French Cup on May 24 and the Champions League a week later, romping over Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.

“We really want to go grab this title and this would make it an absolutely perfect season, which would be very hard to replicate,” PSG captain Marquinhos said. “We really want to make history.”

Chelsea had a more modest season, finishing fourth in the Premier League, losing to Brighton in the fourth round of the FA Cup, to Newcastle in the fourth round of the League Cup and winning the third-tier UEFA Conference League.

“Everyone is picking up our opposition,” James said. “We are preparing right and we are going to win.”

NOTES: Maresca said winger Noni Madueke had left the team to sign elsewhere.

Soccer players like Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea are very concerned about the heat at the World Cup next summer. They struggled with the high temperatures and humidity at the Club World Cup this year so they are asking FIFA to reconsider its schedule for 2026.

The solution is very simple if you ask me!

This narrative about the upcoming World Cup first came to exist at the end of June. International soccer clubs from all over the world traveled to the United States to play the Club World Cup. They just so happened to arrive right in the middle of a massive heatwave. Temperatures spiked well above 80º, 90º and even 100º during the group stage. It was even hotter in the sun with the humidity.

South American clubs did not seem to have a huge issue with the weather. The same cannot be said for the Europeans. Borussia Dortmund hid its entire bench in the locker room to avoid the heat in… Ohio. Juventus players were literally begging their gaffer to sub them off during their match in Miami.

It very quickly became clear that the extreme heat across the United States is going to create legitimate issues for European national teams at the World Cup in 2026. They don't know how to handle it.

Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea is the latest player to voice his worries for next summer.

Honestly, the heat is incredible. Honestly, I don't know how to explain it. The other day I got a bit dizzy during a play. I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy. Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.

Moreover, for the spectacle, for the people who come to enjoy the stadium, for the people who watch it at home. The game, the speed of the game is not the same, everything becomes very slow.

He also asked FIFA to reevaluate the upcoming tournament.

Let's hope that next year they change the schedule. At least so that it remains a beautiful and attractive football spectacle, right?

FIFA moved the last World Cup to November because of the heat in Qatar. Should they do the same for North America?

Six host venues at the 2026 World Cup could be an issue. Atlanta, Dallas and Houston are domed so that is not a problem. Kansas City, Miami, Monterrey, Philadelphia, Foxborough and Guadalajara are not. Extreme temperatures might be a factor during those matches like they were at the Club World Cup.

However, the most prominent temperature issues this year came during a heat wave. It really is not that bad when it is just regular hot. That would be a very lucky break.

Stu Holden also pointed to the different temperatures at different international and domestic cities on the some day Fernandez made his scathing comments. They were fairly standard across the board.

Honestly— enough of the “USA conditions aren't safe for players”. Where do you want to play it Enzo? Here is a graphic showing the current temperatures in NYC, London, Paris, and Madrid. (BTW that temp is at night in Europe and 3 PM EST in NYC).

Mind you, it is ignorant to pretend like 82º in Paris feels anything like 82º in Miami. I am not going to discount the humidity. I know 84º in New York was considered a fairly tepid summer day. The odds are that it will not be that “cool” during the World Cup.

And yet, the solution is simple. Much like the MLS, matches should be scheduled according to venue.

A match played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta will be air conditioned. It can be played at any hour of the day without issue. Put those matches during the peak of daylight.

A match played at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami will be hot during the day. Put those matches late in the evening or after sunset. It won't be as hot.

I am not in a position to make these decisions nor will I ever. FIFA is probably going to do whatever makes the most sense for its television broadcast partners and for its financial gain. The solution is just so simple!

Real Madrid center back Raúl Asencio has acknowledged he fell short of expectations in the team's Club World Cup run this summer.

A defensive injury crisis plagued Xabi Alonso's squad in the United States. Antonio Rüdiger, David Alaba and Éder Militão were all injured in the opening stages, leaving the new manager with just Asencio and new signing Dean Huijsen as senior center-back options.

In the face of such a significant opportunity to impress Alonso, Asencio endured a nightmare tournament. He conceded a penalty and was hooked at half-time of the 1–1 draw with Al Hilal, before earning a straight red card just seven minutes into the group game against Pachuca.

Suspended against RB Salzburg and benched to take on Juventus, Asencio managed five minutes as a late substitute in the quarterfinal win over Borussia Dortmund, but he was then restored to the starting lineup for the semifinal against Paris Saint-Germain.

In his hour on the pitch, Asencio was guilty of an error which led to an early goal for PSG, although he was by no means the only player to disappoint in the humbling 4–0 defeat.

It was a bitterly disappointing end to a breakout season at Madrid from Asencio, who took to social media to apologize for his performances at the Club World Cup.

“Madridistas, a season in which I have fulfilled my dream of being part of the best club in the world is ending but it has ended in the way I least wanted,” Asencio wrote on Instagram. “I feel like I haven't been up to it in a demanding Club World Cup but now it's time to disconnect and recharge.

“Wishing you a happy holiday and now and always, HALA MADRID! Counting down the days until the return to the Bernabéu.”

Asencio faces a battle to retain his starting spot at the start of the new season. Militão caught the eye in his brief return from injury this summer and may be the favorite to start alongside Huijsen, particularly as Rüdiger still has one game left on his six-match suspension issued towards the end of last season.

                Captain Reece James has lavished praise on the midfield duo of Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo ahead of the final of the FIFA Club World Cup.
            

We're only days away from the showpiece event as we bid to become global champions at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, and Reece is looking forward to testing himself against current European champions Paris Saint-Germain.

Tickets are still available for our Club World Cup final so come and support the Blues by clicking here

He knows that the Blues will be in a much better position to take on the Parisians with our midfield dynamos Enzo and Caicedo available. The pair have been crucial to our success this season, with the Argentine enjoying his best spell statistically for goals and assists this campaign, while Moises' performances earned him the club's Player of the Year award.





Speaking about the qualities his two team-mates bring to the side, Reece is excited for the world to see them on full display on Sunday afternoon.

‘They are two phenomenal players,' James began, speaking during his pre-match press conference for the final.

‘They are up there with the best midfielders in the world. I think that will be clear on Sunday.

‘Enzo Fernandez is an amazing player and person. He's come on so much since he arrived at Chelsea, and he's a huge part of Chelsea Football Club. He's a huge player for our team, and they'll both play a big part on Sunday.'





Even with that pair adding their considerable talents for the Blues, coming up against the current UEFA Champions League holders will be no easy task, but Reece is hopeful that Chelsea will show our own talent. 

‘We expect a tough game,' Reece added. ‘PSG are an amazing team, but we also have an amazing team and we will surprise a lot of people. We have come a long way in our journey from where we started.

‘It's two great young sides playing against each other on the biggest stage, so I believe we will go toe-to-toe.'

Nearly one year to the day before MetLife Stadium will be hosting the FIFA World Cup Final, MetLife Stadium will be hosting the FIFA Club World Cup Final.

For next year's event, the venue will sell out at any price for the tickets. This year, it's taking some effort.

Via Safid Deen of USA Today, FIFA has slashed ticket prices in advance of Sunday's match between Paris-Saint Germain and Chelsea.

The cheapest ticket has fallen from $312.20 to $249.75. Seats in the range of $440 to $546 have fallen to the range of $334.50 to $473.90.

The most expensive tickets, however, have stayed expensive. East Club seats have held firm at $1,644.65. Seating in the EY Coaches Club remains $4,348.50 each.

The 62-match (to date) tournament has drawn 2.4 million fans. It's an average of 38,000 per match. More than 20 of them have drawn more than 50,000.

For the final match of Sunday, one spot has been reserved for someone who attended the most recent Super Bowl. President Donald Trump has said he'll attend the Club World Cup final.

MetLife Stadium will host not only some of the world's best football players in the Club World Cup final this weekend, but also arguably the planet's most famous and polarising person.

Fresh off the announcement that FIFA, world football's governing body and the organiser of this tournament, has opened an office a few miles from the New Jersey venue inside New York City's Trump Tower, Donald Trump, the 45th and 47th president of the United States, has taken another step in strengthening his association with FIFA counterpart Gianni Infantino by confirming his attendance at Sunday's final between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.

A year out from the best men's national teams coming to the U.S., Canada and Mexico for the World Cup, Trump and his office are eager to be front and centre in a country long seen as the world's favourite sport's final frontier. The president to set to be involved with the trophy presentation on Sunday, according to people familiar with the planning who were not authorised to speak publicly.

U.S. vice-president JD Vance was at Cincinnati's TQL Stadium to watch Borussia Dortmund of Germany beat South Korean side Ulsan 1-0 in the Club World Cup last month. In Vance's home state of Ohio, U.S. Secret Service members bolstered a tiny crowd of 8,239, surveying the 26,000-seat venue and surrounding areas for any threat to a man who ranks first in the country's presidential line of succession.

“We were checked by strict security,” said Dortmund head coach Niko Kovac in the post-match press conference. “When we left the hotel, we were given a sniff test by a dog. When we got into the stadium, someone came onto the bus with another dog. That's completely normal. It's a World Cup. They are high-level people, so I think it's normal, but it was relatively tight.”

On Sunday, security measures will be further enhanced, as security teams, stadium staff, event organisers, and the Secret Service are tasked with keeping Trump protected at the 82,500-capacity stadium in the state of New Jersey, situated approximately five miles west of Manhattan. At an open-air rally in Pennsylvania on the very same date last year, Trump was shot at and wounded in his right ear, while security personnel also have to be mindful of anything that would “embarrass the principal”.

“I'm not going to say it's going to be the worst thing that the protection detail has worked on, but they don't like it,” says Michael Evanoff, global chief security officer of the U.S. security technology company Verkada and former assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. “You're going into a venue, but who knows? People can throw something… The pie in the face, right? That or throwing fake blood or anything that would embarrass the principal.”

“With a sitting president of the United States, everything is different,” adds an industry source with experience hosting political figures, royalty and major celebrities for a world-leading stadium owner and event company, kept anonymous to protect relationships. “No one else will come with such a huge Secret Service and national military presence.”

When providing personal security to a prominent public figure at a major event such as a Club World Cup final, preparation begins well in advance of matchday.

“We appoint a security advance party, which will proceed before the event and conduct a detailed reconnaissance of the venue, liaising with venue staff and security to assess the existing security measures,” says Jordan McGrath, co-founder of VIS Protection, a private security firm with experience of working with top-end Forbes World Billionaires List members.

“You'll speak to venue staff about your plan and how they can help you and your team with entry and exits. With big crowds around, you must have contingency plans for vehicles ready outside and emergency vehicle access. It's a big operation, particularly for big sporting events.”

Ideally, private security firms, or the Secret Service in Trump's case, would be notified months in advance of the proposed public appearance, so their preparations for the event can be as thorough as possible.

“Mass gatherings present a complex and dynamic threat environment,” says Steven Rice, who worked for 27 years at the U.S. Department of State. He was deputy assistant director for intelligence and threat analysis, and also had extensive postings in China and the Middle East. “Planning and site familiarity are key to controlling the environment — designating primary and alternate arrival/departure locations, potential attack sites, safe rooms, and evacuation plans.

“Robust communications, counter-surveillance, and perimeter and access control are a must — large crowds mean reduced manoeuvrability, limited escape routes and elevated risk of concealment for potential attackers. Coordinated emergency response plans need to be integrated across agencies and validated before gameday.”

However, given the often impulsive nature of such ultra-high-net-worth individuals, these decisions can be made on a whim, prompting a rapid response from security agencies.

“You have to be prepared for every eventuality. I'm currently working with a client who is one of the world's wealthiest individuals,” says McGrath. “They can be on the runway in one of their planes, and suddenly everything changes. In an instant, you're told you're going somewhere else and not getting on that plane. You have to be ready to adapt.”

In Trump's case, the Secret Service would then be in communication with emergency services, stadium personnel and private security agencies at the event to conduct the most comprehensive checks possible given the time constraints.

As MetLife Stadium is one of the nation's flagship sporting arenas (it hosted an NFL Super Bowl in 2014 and will stage the World Cup final next July), it will already have detailed practices in place that consider transportation, the stadium's layout, and Trump's position when he watches the match.

“Having had experience of working with the Secret Service, they like to have control themselves,” says Nigel Thomas, a former British Special Air Service (SAS) soldier and founder of Blue Mountain Group, a security training and advisory firm. “They like to keep information very tight. They carry out their own risk assessment.

“They have a huge team in cyber-security and physical security. They will search the stadium with sniffer dogs for anything from drugs to explosives. They would want searches done on the security teams and a background check, so they don't leave any stone unturned.”

Once the Secret Service has established the route and motorcade for Trump's journey to the stadium, the next requirement is to find a suitable place for him to sit, which is not always straightforward. Some private-security agencies would endeavour to secure the suites on either side of the one that their VIP will be using to act as buffers, but this is a FIFA event, so the governing body has more control. It is anticipated that Trump will sit with Infantino, senior officials from PSG and Chelsea, and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, whom the president met in Doha in May.

FIFA typically reserves a significant portion of premium suites and VIP lounges for its partners and sponsors, which means that some areas of the stadium may be set aside and not offered to regular-season suite holders. This is typical practice for major sporting events, such as the World Cup, the Olympics or leagues' all-star games, where the competition falls outside a stadium or arena's typical event offerings.

Once Trump and his immediate entourage arrive on Sunday, staff at MetLife may halt traffic around the entrance being used to ensure his motorcade can enter safely. They will then go into the stadium itself with their armed private security.

Most stadiums and arenas in the United States use metal detectors, but given the heightened security risk on this occasion with a president in attendance, the Secret Service may arrive before the event and replace the existing apparatus with their own around the stadium, according to our industry source.

“For the president, there will probably be a bullet-resistant-glass setup,” says Evanoff. “Even though there's not supposed to be any weapons there, they're not taking any chances by not doing that. You've seen him in front of bullet-resistant glass before. It's just tough because, at the same time, protecting an individual is a science.

“The Secret Service and my old organisation at diplomatic security have refined this to a real science. And with the loss of the Hortmans, with the attack on Governor Shapiro, this concept of executive protection is at the top of everybody's mind right now. Bringing a protectee into a venue, hopefully a screened venue, to sit them in an environment where you really don't know who's in the crowd — other than everybody's been screened — is serious.”

The operation will be made even more difficult as Trump has given advance notice he will be there.

“Public knowledge increases risk,” says Rice. “Announced appearances give adversaries time to plan, conduct surveillance, and exploit vulnerabilities. Public figures attract crowds, complicating protective movement and increasing the chance of disruptions. Announced visits narrow planning options and heighten the threat environment. Layered defences, robust intelligence monitoring, and visible deterrence are critical.”

Then, once the VIP is in their seat, the task switches to providing the most seamless experience possible, even if the security staff are on high alert.

“While they're in, you're still thinking, ‘If this vehicle breaks down, what's my backup? If that road is closed, what's my alternative?',” says Thomas. “You're ensuring the drivers are prepared, fed, and watered. That's going on without the VIP knowing.”

Most of the time, the VIP experiences the event without any major hiccups and, as far as they are aware, everything goes smoothly.

But what happens if something does go wrong?

“These security teams provide people from backgrounds where they have experienced so many challenges, whether from working as police or military officers,” Thomas says. “When you do the threat and risk assessment, you cover anything that could go wrong: if they were at a mass gathering, what if the stage collapsed? We will have a standard operating procedure for that, for example. You need to be prepared for it, and that takes communication with stadium security and emergency services.

“If there were to be a catastrophic event involving the whole stadium, everyone would need to know our procedures for keeping the VIP safe while a mass of people are trying to escape. It's a huge operation, and things do go wrong, so it takes experience.”

KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Kansas City has hosted its share of major sporting events, including NCAA championship games, all-star games, four World Series and six of the last seven AFC Championship Games, but the FIFA World Cup 26 quarterfinal on July 11, 2026 — one year from Friday — will be the biggest sporting event the city's ever seen.

“You can't match the global scale,” Paul Carr, who attended the 2010 Uruguay-Ghana quarterfinal in South Africa, said. “Those events (Kansas City has hosted before) are always the biggest thing going on in the U.S. at that time, but this is the biggest thing and sporting event going on in the world.”

Carr was in South Africa working as a researcher for ESPN and said Uruguay's penalty-kick shootout win was the greatest sporting event he's ever attended.

“I've been to Final Fours, NCAA tournaments, World Series, World Cup qualifiers, etc., but there's just a united passion that you get,” he said. “... It's the biggest sporting event on the planet. It's the biggest sporting event most of these fans will ever be at or be involved in or root for, so all of that just comes out.”

KCK Community College women's soccer coach Jefferson Roblee attended the 1994 Brazil-Netherlands quarterfinal at the old Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

“The quarterfinal is a knockout game, so it's a do-or-die type situation,” he said. “You have intensity that the game means something, but it's on a global level. You also have just the energy of the game would be like a gigantic Super Bowl, World Series type of event, except for on a global level.”

Roblee attended Brazil's win en route to the World Cup title with his twin brother and some friends.

“You would have thought that you were in Brazil,” he said. “To be honest, there were a lot of Netherlands fans, but the Brazil fans seemed to just engulf the stadium. ... There were 65,000 people at the game; it felt like there were 165,000 people.”

Recent World Cup finals have drawn between 517 million and 571 million global viewers, while the typical quarterfinal draws roughly 250 million viewers around the world, which dwarfs the estimated 186.2 million people who watched the Chiefs beat San Francisco in Super Bowl LVIII.

“It's like the Elite Eight in NCAA basketball or the divisional round of the NFL playoffs,” Carr said. “You have the best of the best. There's eight teams left. ... A great team, great player — someone does something in these quarterfinals, because it's the biggest stage. ... Making that jump from the quarters to the semis is legacy building for both players and teams.”

Next summer, it'll happen at Arrowhead.

Few would have believed it if they were told, at the start of Wimbledon, that Iga Swiatek would end up winning the title.

In fact, I think even she would have laughed at the notion.

After all, she had historically struggled on grass, and whenever given the chance, would play down her chances of ever succeeding on the surface.

It was perhaps this refreshing lack of expectation which helped propel her to such success, as she touched upon in her press conference.

Naturally, the six-time Grand Slam champion was in an upbeat mood as she strolled into the media room.

After all, she had just captured yet another major, and on the grass of Wimbledon no less.

Few expected such a result on this surface, least of all Iga Swiatek. With that in mind, one reporter asked her to compare this latest triumph to her many French Open successes, drawing a smile from the Polish star.

“Oh my God, that's always the hardest question,” she began. “I don't know… I think the fact that it's on grass for sure it makes it more special, I would say and unexpected. 

“It feels like the emotions are bigger. Because at Roland Garros, I know I can play well and I can show it every year. Here I wasn't sure of that. I also needed to prove that to myself. 

“I'm not gonna rank them. I have so much respect to the other tournaments. I worked really hard to win all the other Slams. There's no point in choosing between them. But this one and the U.S. Open feel better because no one expected that. It wasn't a relief. It was more of just good tennis and working to make it happen without this baggage on your shoulders.”

Swiatek told Anisimova her wish for her in the future after the match, showcasing her humility before bringing her joy to the media room.

Swiatek was not finished there though, taking time to lambast Polish media for their treatment of her and her team.

Despite being openly proud of her heritage, she took particular disdain with their framing of her as she steadily progressed through Wimbledon.

The 24-year-old stated: “We as public people and as athletes can't react to everything that's going on. We've got to focus on ourselves. Sometimes it's easier to do that. Sometimes it's harder. 

Jumping for joy 🤩#Wimbledon | @iga_swiatek pic.twitter.com/srhKe0Ptsb

“For sure, the past months, how the media sometimes described me, I gotta say, unfortunately Polish media, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant. I hope they will just leave me alone and let me do my job. 

“Obviously, you can see that we know what we're doing. I have the best people around me. I have already proven a lot. I know people want more and more, but it's my own process and my own life and my own career. I hopefully am gonna have freedom from them to let me do my job the way I want it.”

The ATP Tour returns to clay and hard courts this week, with three ATP 250 events taking place.


Andrey Rublev is the highest-ranked player in action, competing at the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo in Los Cabos, a hard-court event that has shifted from its traditional February slot to July. Casper Ruud leads the field at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad and Francisco Cerundolo is the top seed at the Nordea Open in Bastad.


ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event.




FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN LOS CABOS
1) Rublev Makes Debut: The 17-time tour-level champion Rublev is set to make his Los Cabos debut as the top seed.
Rublev arrives in Baja California with a 21-15 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result being a title run at the ATP 500 in Doha.

2) Foki's Summer Heats Up: It has been a memorable few months for Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who married his longtime girlfriend Paloma Amatiste in June and then reached the Eastbourne semi-finals, followed by a third-round run at Wimbledon. The Spaniard reached two finals earlier this year, in Delray Beach and Acapulco, and now sets his sights on a maiden tour-level title in Los Cabos, where he is seeded second.

3) #NextGenATP Stars: The Mexican crowd will be in full force for home favourite Rodrigo Pacheco Mendez, the 20-year-old lefty who is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. Also in the Los Cabos field is fellow #NextGenATP contender Nishesh Basavareddy, who is sixth in the Race To Jeddah. While the American is bidding for a return to the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Pacheco Mendez is chasing his maiden trip to the 20-and-under event.

4) Shapo Among Other Seeds: Third seed Denis Shapovalov brings plenty of firepower to his Los Cabos debut. Chasing his second title this season, the Canadian captured the biggest career trophy at the ATP 500 in Dallas in February. Shapovalov owns a 12-6 hard-court record this season. Fourth seed Quentin Halys and fifth seed Daniel Altmaier look to spoil the party and claim their first tour-level trophy.

5) Doumbia/Reboul Lead Doubles Field: Frenchmen Sadio Doumbia and Fabien Reboul are the top seeds in doubles. Doumbia and Reboul are looking for their second title of the season, having triumphed in Geneva. Finalists in Acapulco earlier this year, can they go one step further this time in Mexico?







FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN GSTAAD
1) Ruud Reigns: Norwegian Casper Ruud is back in Gstaad for the first time since 2022, a warning shot to the rest of the field. The 26-year-old is unbeaten in Gstaad across two appearances, claiming the title in both 2021 and 2022. Ruud is 13-4 on clay this season, highlighted by his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Madrid. Gstaad will mark Ruud's first tournament since Roland Garros. He withdrew from Wimbledon due to a knee injury.
2) Bublik Building: Alexander Bublik has been on one of his career-best runs. The Kazakh reached his maiden Slam quarter-final at Roland Garros, followed by a title run in Halle, where he lifted his fifth tour-level crown. After a disappointing first-round exit at Wimbledon, Bublik looks to return to his winning ways as the second seed in Gstaad.
3) Home Favourites: Former No. 3 Stan Wawrinka is set for his 12th appearance in Gstaad, a tournament he first competed at in 2003. The 40-year-old, fresh off a semi-final run at the Iasi Challenger, looks to roll back the years and treat his home fans to a strong showing. Wawrinka could meet Bublik in the second round, while fellow Swiss Dominic Stricker is also in the field, with a potential second-round clash against Ruud. Swiss Jerome Kym is also in the draw.
4) #NextGenATP Pathway: Spaniard Martin Landaluce is using a Next Gen Accelerator spot to gain entry into the main draw. Players aged 20-and-under who are ranked in the Top 250 of the PIF ATP Rankings are eligible for one ATP 250 main draw spot, an effort to support young talent and their development pathway. The 19-year-old Landaluce, seeking his second tour-level win, is World No. 137.
5) Doubles Draw: Portugal's Francisco Cabral and Austrian Lucas Miedler spearhead the doubles field, which also features Stan Wawrinka playing alongside countryman Henry Bernet, this year's Australian Open boys' singles champion.





FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BASTAD
1) Top Seed Cerundolo: Francisco Cerundolo is seeking his first title of the season. The Argentine is comfortable in Bastad, having won the title in 2022. Holding a 7-2 tournament record, the 26-year-old Cerundolo reached the semi-finals in his most recent showing in 2023. Cerundolo reached a career-high No. 18 this May.
2) Defending Champ Borges: It was a memorable week for Nuno Borges last year in Bastad, where he captured his first tour-level trophy and upset 92-time tour-level titlist Rafael Nadal in the final. Borges, seeded third, looks to successfully defend the title. Borges became the second Portuguese ATP Tour titlist, joining Joao Sousa.




3) Baez Seeking More Clay Success: Sebastian Baez won the clay ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro for the second consecutive year and reached two additional finals on the surface in Santiago and Bucharest. Now returning to his favourite surface post-Wimbledon, Baez is hunting his eighth tour-level trophy. The Argentine reached the final in 2022, falling to countryman Cerundolo.
4) Other Seeds: Camilo Ugo Carabelli, Luciano Darderi, Damir Dzumhur and Vit Kopriva are seeded fifth through eight, respectively. Ugo Carabelli and Kopriva are among the seeds who are seeking their first tour-level title.
5) Doubles Top Seeds Andreozzi/Arends: Guido Andreozzi and Sander Arends are the top seeds in Bastad doubles. Romain Arneodo and Manuel Guinard are seeded second.

Iga Swiatek dished out the first 6-0 6-0 in a Wimbledon women's singles final history since 1911 as the Pole clinched her maiden title at the All England Club.

Swiatek ended a year-long trophy drought in incredible fashion, beating American Amanda Anisimova with a 'double bagel' [a 6-0 6-0 scoreline] to become a Wimbledon champion.

It is only the second time in Wimbledon's history that a women's final has ended with the same scoreline when Dorothea Lambert Chambers beat Dora Boothby in 1911, while the only other instance at a Grand Slam came in the French Open in 1988 when Steffi Graf beat Natasha Zvereva.

"It seems super surreal," Swiatek said during the trophy presentation.

"First of all I want to congratulate Amanda for an amazing two weeks no matter what happened today. I hope we're going to play many more finals here and at other tournaments.

"I didn't even dream (about winning Wimbledon) because it was way too far, I feel like I'm already an experienced player after winning the slams before but I never really expected this one."

Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam showpiece, failed to win a single game, with Swiatek racing to victory on a stunned Centre Court in only 57 minutes.

A first Grand Slam final is always a nerve-racking occasion, though, and it was obvious from the start that Anisimova was struggling to get her legs moving and her arms swinging freely.

She could not find her first serve and was making error after error, while Swiatek, who had won all five of her previous Slam finals, looked right at home.

The Pole is one of the best front runners the sport has seen and she did not allow Anisimova any chance to settle as the groans of the crowd grew ever more audible.

The breezy conditions did not help, and it took Swiatek just 25 minutes to wrap up the first set, with Anisimova winning only nine points.

The American, who stepped away from tennis for eight months in 2023 for mental health reasons, twice screamed in frustration, and probably rising panic, after errors in the opening game of the second set.

The eight former champions sat in the Royal Box would have empathised with Anisimova's predicament but she could find no way of getting any kind of foothold in the match.

Every half chance was either snuffed out by Swiatek or crushed by another wild mistake - she made 28 unforced errors in the 12 games - and a final Swiatek winner put her out of her misery.

An upset Anisimova said: "Iga, you're such an incredible player, obviously showed today. You've been such an inspiration to me, an unbelievable athlete. Congratulations to you and your team.

"Thank you to everyone who's supported me since my first-round match here. It's been an incredible fortnight for me even though I ran out of gas today and I wish I could have put on a better performance for you."

Sir Mo Farah, Stanley Tucci and Greta Gerwig were among the celebrities in Wimbledon's Royal Box for the women's singles final.

The Devil Wears Prada actor Tucci was sitting next to American filmmaker Noah Baumbach, who attended on Saturday with his wife, Barbie director Gerwig.

They were sitting in the Royal Box on day 13 of the championships with the Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have become the first all-British pair to win the Wimbledon men's doubles title since 1936.

Queen's Club and Eastbourne champions Cash and Glasspool became the first all-British pairing to win the All England Club trophy since 1936, when Pat Hughes and Raymond Tuckey defeated their compatriots Charles Hare and Frank Wilde in the final.

"When you say that it sounds incredible," said Glasspool. "It's been one Brit (winner) the last couple of years, now we've given you two Brits."

The pair downed Rinky Hijikata and David Pel 6-2 7-6 (7-3).

In the men's wheelchair doubles final, Britain's Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid lost their title.

The six-time winners and top seeds were upset 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 on Court One by Martin De La Puente from Spain and Dutchman Ruben Spaargaren.

For only the second time in the Open Era, and first time at Wimbledon, a women's singles final ended 6-0 6-0. If anyone was going to achieve the feat, it was destined to be Iga Swiatek, who has a habit of winning sets 6-0 or 6-1: a bagel or a breadstick, as it is known in tennis, is her bread and butter, prompting the coining of the term Iga's Bakery.

But that she did it in her first Wimbledon final, on a surface where she has had little success in the years past, made it one of the most extraordinary results in recent years in women's tennis. Amanda Anisimova simply didn't have the answers against the relentless Polish superstar.

After 38 years, when Steffi Graf won the French Open in 1988 by the same scoreline, Swiatek punched her way into the record books. It wasn't just a story of the two 6-0s she served out on Center Court, she also made it 6-0 in Grand Slam finals in her career, winning her sixth Major in her sixth title clash.

If Anisimova had an actual nightmare before the final, one doubts it would have been worse than the reality that unfolded in front of her eyes. Right from the pre-match walk onto the Center Court, where Swiatek strode out with her headphones on (possibly listening to some AC/DC) much ahead of her American opponent, the former world No 1 looked dialled in.

It might have been the first Wimbledon final for both players, but Swiatek is significantly more experienced at the big stages than Anisimova, while the American was playing a final of this magnitude for the first time in her career. It showed in the opening game right away as Anisimova appeared to be a bundle of nerves. Swiatek had three break points at 0-40 and converted the second to take the lead and never looked back. Anisimova managed to win just two points in the first two games.

The third game saw Anisimova struggle to close out from 40-15, letting Swiatek push her around the court, and dropping her serve for the second time after a double fault to trail 0-3. A brief window opened for the 13th seed to break in the fourth game at 15-30, but this time her groundstrokes let her down. On the other side of the net, there was no letdown of intensity from Swiatek as she crunched some deep forehands to draw out more errors from her opponent. The bad start for Anisimova quickly turned into her worst nightmare, getting broken at love to go down 0-5.

At 5-0, 30-0, Anisimova would have wondered if it wasn't just meant to be, as Swiatek scrambled around to win a point she had no business winning. And it set up three set points that the Pole quickly converted. Anisimova won just 9 points in the first set. As per Opta, Swiatek became only the fourth player in the Open Era to win the opening set with a 6-0 scoreline at the women's singles final in Wimbledon after Billie Jean King (1973, 1975), Chris Evert (1974) and Martina Navratilova (1983).

At the start of the second set, at 0-30, the crowd tried to rally behind Anisimova, and she responded with a roar too after making it 30-30. That was, however, quickly followed by two cries of frustration and a helpless stare towards the team in her box. Swiatek broke serve again to start the second set on the front foot. The crowd once again turned up the volume when Anisimova was down 15-30 on serve, and it went up a few decibels as the American crunched a forehand winner. Down a breakpoint again, she hit another winner to force deuce. But it was only a flash in the pan. There was to be no turnaround and Swiatek swiftly closed the match out and fell on her back on the hallowed grass.

For Anisimova, the result unfortunately bookended what was otherwise a memorable fortnight in London. Her tournament began with a 6-0 6-0 thrashing of Yulia Putintseva (who had coincidentally beaten Swiatek in last year's quarterfinal) and ended in tears with the scoreline being reversed.

For Swiatek, Wimbledon 2025 will hold a special place in her career. After all, even she never quite believed she'd come this far on grass, having never reached the semifinal before. In her post-match speech, she was asked how long she had dreamt about holding the famous Venus Rosewater Dish. She smiled. “Honestly, I didn't even dream, because it felt too far. I feel like I am an experienced player after having won Slams before, but I never expected this one.” Sometimes, when you put your head down (after listening to some rock music) and work hard, even undreamt dreams come true.

“I'm very happy to share once again the court with Carlos,” Sinner said after his semifinal win on Friday.The tennis world, and the larger sports world, agree. We might even ask ourselves what we've done to deserve the rise of this rivalry, so soon after the end of our Big 3 Golden Era. If Sinner and Alcaraz can come close to reproducing their Roland Garros classic on Centre Court, we may remember this as a golden men's tennis summer of its own, up there with Borg and McEnroe in the early 80s, and Federer and Nadal in the late-aughts.Alcaraz likes it, too.“I think the things that we are doing right now I think is great for tennis,” he says. “We just fight [to] engage more people to watch tennis. We're just fighting for the tennis to be bigger.”

So what are the chances we get another epic, and who should be favored this time around?On the first question, there wouldn't seem to be any reason the Italian and the Spaniard won't give us a highly-competitive, top-level contest. Each has had an earlier hiccup in this tournament, but each seems to have put it behind him.Alcaraz's issue was his erratic level of play in the early going, which saw him need five sets to subdue 38-year-old Fabio Fognini, and four sets to beat Jan-Lennard Struff. Since dropping the opening set to Andrey Rublev in the fourth round, though, the defending champion has rounded closer to peak form. He said he starting feeling more comfortable with his serve late in that match, and it showed in his wins over Cam Norrie and Taylor Fritz. By the semis, Alcaraz was feeling confident enough in his serve to start following it to the net.“I just serving really good,” he said. “I just feeling really comfortable doing serve and volley…just not letting the opponent to get into the point, to get the good rhythm.”

Sinner's issue was physical—and it put him on the brink of defeat. In his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov, he slipped and hurt his right elbow. That, and Dimitrov's excellent play, left Sinner in a two-set hole. But the injury bug came to his rescue in the end, when Dimitrov blew out his right pec muscle in the third set and couldn't continue. Sinner hasn't dropped a set since, and while he has worn a sleeve on his right arm, he hasn't shown any ill effects from it.“No issue for Sunday,” Sinner says of his elbow. “I think we are handling this small problem at the moment very well. Today I felt quite good already.”When Djokovic was asked to pick a winner in this match, he took Alcaraz by a small but seemingly definite margin. I'll take him as well, with slightly less assurance.Alcaraz has played two Wimbledon finals already, and won both times; he's 5-0 in Grand Slam finals. He's 8-4 against Sinner, has won their last five matches, and won their only previous meeting at Wimbledon, in 2022, in four sets. At the moment he's playing with the easy confidence of someone who knows he can raise his game whenever he needs to. Throw in a serve that has looked new and improved during this grass season, and he becomes a solid favorite, even against the world No. 1.“Just can't wait for Sunday,” Alcaraz says.

Sinner sounded a little more cautious about the battle ahead.“It's going to be difficult, I know that,” Sinner says. “But I'm looking forward to it, no? He's the favorite. He won here two times in a row. He's again in the final. It's very tough to beat him on grass, but I like these challenges.”Sinner does have an edge in a couple of ways. He's much less prone to rough patches of play, or a total off day, than Alcaraz is. With his ability to flatten out his strokes and get the first strike in, he's more of a natural fast-court player than a clay-courter. And while this will be his first Wimbledon final, he was also playing his first Roland Garros final last month, and he came one point from winning that.“I'm pretty sure he's going to take a lot of things from the French Open final, that he's going to be better,” Alcaraz says of Sinner.Sinner has been the best male player of the past two years—against everyone but Alcaraz.

I think it's great, or at least for me.”Winner: Alcaraz

Sinner does have an edge in a couple of ways. He's much less prone to rough patches of play, or a total off day, than Alcaraz is. With his ability to flatten out his strokes and get the first strike in, he's more of a natural fast-court player than a clay-courter.

Kate, the Princess of Wales, and other celebrities attended the Wimbledon Tennis Championships to watch Poland's Iga Swiatek shut out American Amanda Anisimova in her first game on Centre Court.

The final began at 4 p.m. local time in London, which is 11 a.m. EDT, and it lasted under an hour. Swiatek won the women's final in consecutive sets, 6-0, 6-0.

Kate, the wife of Prince William, presented the trophy to Swiatek, the winner of the women's singles final. She didn't attend the match last year while she was recovering from cancer.

Jannik Sinner says Carlos Alcaraz favourite in men's singles final at Wimbledon, won't compare rivalry to big three

Jannik Sinner played down the impact of his painful defeat against Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final as he prepared for a rematch at Wimbledon on Sunday.

The world number one crushed seven-time champion Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in under two hours on Friday to set up a title showdown against the Spanish two-time defending champion.

Alcaraz had earlier dispatched US fifth seed Taylor Swift in four sets on Centre Court.

Just weeks ago at Roland Garros, Alcaraz came back from two sets down against Sinner, saving three match points to win a fifth grand slam.

But Italy's Sinner, 23, played down the lingering impact of that loss in the aftermath of his semi-final win against Djokovic.

“I think if it would be a lot in my head, I would not be in the situation to play a final again, I guess,” he said. “I'm very happy to share once again the court with Carlos. It's going to be difficult, I know that.

The Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, returned to the tennis tournament

 Kate Middleton is back at one of her favorite summer outings: Wimbledon.


 On Saturday, July 12, the Princess of Wales, 43, stepped out at the prestigious tournament for the first time this season to see American tennis star Amanda Anisimova and Poland's Iga Swiatek compete in the women's singles final. She'll later present the champion with their trophy.


 Kate, who took her seat in the royal box at Centre Court, continued her recent streak of tailored elegance in a white belted blazer-style top and cream pleated skirt — a silhouette she also embraced earlier this week during the French state visit. As patron, Kate also wore a Wimbledon purple and green bow pinned to the left side of her top.


 That outing comes shortly after her emotional revelations about the difficulty of finding her new normal following cancer treatment.


 On July 2, Princess Kate visited Colchester Hospital in Essex, where she spoke candidly about her cancer journey.

 "You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' " she said. “But actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult."


 "You have to find your new normal and that takes time...and it's a rollercoaster, it's not smooth, like you expect it to be," Kate added. "But the reality is you go through hard times."

 Upon her arrival, Kate first congratulated women's wheelchair tennis champion Wang Ziying shortly after her straight-sets victory. She then spoke with eight-year-old Lydia Lowe, who represented the Dan Maskell Trust and performed the coin toss for the wheelchair final.

 Kate also met 12-year-old Sophie Kneen, set to do the coin toss for the women's final, along with ball boys, ball girls and honorary stewards. Crossing the bridge, she smiled and waved to hundreds of waiting fans.

 Guided by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, a former pro, Kate greeted the welcoming party and briefly chatted about their tournament experiences. She also met young people from the Work at Wimbledon program and representatives from the Wimbledon Foundation.

 Kate has regularly attended Wimbledon over the years, even before Queen Elizabeth appointed her as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2016. She has watched the tournament in person every year since she married Prince William in 2011, apart from the 2013 matches, which took place when she was "heavily pregnant" with Prince George and doctors advised against her attending, and when Wimbledon was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


 Princess Kate's return to Wimbledon comes after she attended the men's singles finals in July 2024, marking one of her few appearances of the year as she mainly remained out of the spotlight amid her cancer treatment. She announced in September 2024 that she had completed chemotherapy, adding a few months later in January that she was in remission.

 On July 14, 2024, the royal received a standing ovation as she made her way to her seat in the front row of the Royal Box at Centre Court, joined by her daughter, Princess Charlotte, and sister, Pippa.


 After the match, Princess Kate headed down to the court and presented Carlos Alcaraz with the winning trophy after defeating Novak Djokovic.

 The hospital visit earlier this month marked her first public outing since her surprise withdrawal from Royal Ascot on June 18. The Princess of Wales was said to be disappointed with not being able to attend Ascot this year but is determined to find the right balance as she returns back to public work amid her continued recovery.

KATE Middleton dazzled at Wimbledon as she handed the trophy to winner Iga Swiatek.

Swiatek was presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish for the first time after winning her match 6-0, 6-0.

The Princess then consoled runner-up Amanda Anisimova who was visibly upset by the loss.

Anisimova left the court immediately after the match in tears, while the audience gave her a standing ovation.

Kate then comforted her while she presented Anisimova with the runner-up trophy.

Anisimova was visibly trying to stop the flow of tears while Kate offered her words of reassurance.

She was followed by Iga who repeatedly thanked the Princess while she was presented with the trophy.

The game was Anisimova's first Grand Slam showpiece, increasing the pressure as she struggled to match Swiatek's ease on the court.

It is only the second time in the Open Era that a 'double bagel' [6-0, 6-0] score has been achieved in a women's match.

The other was the 1988 French Open final.

It has cemented Swiatek's position among the world tennis champions, as she has now won majors on all three surfaces - the youngest woman to do so since Serena Williams.

The beaming Princess of Wales, who is patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club, looked classy in a white belted blazer-style and cream pleated skirt as she watched Iga Swiatek beat Amanda Anisimova in straight sets.

Kate also donned a Wimbledon purple and green bow on the left-hand side of her top.

A massive cheer went up as she smiled and waved before taking her seat in the Royal Box, with the beloved Princess getting a standing ovation.

She briefly greeted American ace Martina Navratilova, 68, as she walked along the first row of the VIP seating section.

Tennis legend and six-time Wimbledon winner Billie Jean King, 81, then curtseyed to the royal before the pair shook hands.

As she accepted the cheers from the packed 15,000 crowd, a smiley Kate waved twice – once with her left and right hands -- prompting another huge cheer.

She sat down as both Swiatek and Anisimova prepared to make their entrance to the court.

Earlier, the Princess first spoke with women's wheelchair tennis champion Wang Ziying – only moments after she won her final in straight sets.

Kate then had a lengthy chat with eight-year-old inspiration Lydia Lowe, who is representing the Dan Maskell Trust and was given the honour of doing the coin toss for the wheelchair final on Court No.1.

She also talked with Sophie Kneen, 12, who will do the coin toss for this afternoon's women's final, ball boys and girls, and honorary stewards.

The Princess, 43, then crossed the bridge, where she flashed a smile and a wave to hundreds of fans who had gathered to catch a glimpse.

Kate was guided around the grounds by All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans, who is a former professional player.

She shook hands with each member of the greeting party and had a brief chat about their time at the tournament so far.

In an adorable moment, beaming Princess appeared to ask young Lydia, who overcame a brain injury and had to learn how to walk again, if she had any advice for the big day.

The brave girl seemed to reply: "Don't be nervous."

She also met young people from the Work at Wimbledon programme and Wimbledon Foundation representatives.

Sophie, 12, is part of the foundation's women and girls inclusion project, and said of being chosen to do the coin toss: "I'm really excited, it's always been a dream of mine to go out on Centre Court."

Traditionally, avid tennis fan Kate watches a number of matches in the Royal Box and later present champions with their trophies at the end of the tournament.

Hundreds of spectators gathered in and around the grounds to try and catch a glimpse of the Princess as she entered Wimbledon.

She will take part in a special ceremony before moving to the best seat in the house to watch the ladies' final, which is tipped to be an all-time classic.

The  Princess of Wales and 15,000 fans on Centre Court will have to battle scorching temperatures of up to 31 degrees as the third heatwave of the summer baked Britain.

Several fans have passed out in the stands during the tournament, though bosses have rejected calls to close the Centre Court roof and turn on the air conditioning during severe temperatures.

The Women's Singles final this afternoon will see a showdown between American Amanda Anisimova, 23, and Pole Iga Swiatek, 24 — neither of whom have won in West London before.

Swiatek, one of the most successful players in recent years, has won five majors in the past and was previously the world number one.

However, this is her first Wimbledon final, having only ever made it as far as the quarter-finals in 2023.

Seeded eighth for this year's tournament, she arrived having made only one final since her French Open victory last year.

She will face off against Anisimova. Once touted as a teenage prodigy, she was a junior US Open champion in 2017 at age 16.

Her first peak was marked by a semi-final run at the 2019 French Open, but her rapid rise was soon halted and she took a four-month health break before returning to the sport last year.

She arrived at the All England Tennis Club seeded 13th.

Anisimova waved and blew kisses to the crowd earlier in the championships after securing a remarkable 6-4 4-6 6-4 victory against world number one Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court.

The Men's doubles final on Centre Court earlier today saw Aussie Rinky Hijikata, 24, and Dutch David Pel, 34, face off against Brits Julian Cash, 28, and Lloyd Glasspool, who is 31.

The Brits won to resounding cheers from the home crowd - and took a selfie to mark the occasion as the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles since 1936.

Alongside the princess in the Royal Box will be Barbie mastermind Greta Gerwig, Mo Farrah, Stanley Tucci and Billie Jean King.

Saturday

Sunday

Also present will be Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and Labour's Lisa Nandy.

Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay are also expected to be there.

Eyes will also be on the thermometers this weekend, as temperatures of up to 33 degrees could bake fans.

This afternoon's final starts at the later time of 4pm – the first time in 119 years that the match has been pushed back.

The climax to the men's and women's Championships has traditionally begun at 2pm on the finals weekend.

This year, the matches have been pushed back by two hours to maximise the TV audience in the United States, where the clash will start at 11am in New York.

All England Club officials insisted the later start will result in better crowds for the doubles finals, which now start before the singles main event.

Kate's mother-in-law Queen Camilla was also back at Wimbledon on Wednesday to watch her favourite player Novak Djokovic in action.

Princess Kate has rarely missed attending Wimbledon since marrying Prince William.

She did skip the championships in 2013 - and missed Andy Murray's first Wimbledon victory - but this was due to her being heavily pregnant with Prince George at the time.

Princess Kate used to take tennis lessons at the elite Hurlingham Club in Fulham, and even set up training sessions for Prince George with tennis legend Roger Federer.

Last year, she handed champion Carlos Alcaraz his golden cup as he retained his Wimbledon title against rival Djokovic.

Djokovic looked emotional as he trundled off following a first Wimbledon semi-final defeat for 13 years yesterday.

Physical problems had prevented him from taking this the full distance as he lost 6-3 6-3 6-4 to the outstanding Jannik Sinner.

Traditionally, the final Saturday and Sunday of the tournament has seen the women's singles final and the men's singles final respectively open play on Centre Court.

Both matches would ordinarily begin on Wimbledon's most famous stage at 2pm.

But this year, on the Saturday, the men's doubles final will open play on Centre Court at 1pm before the women's singles final at 4pm.

While Sunday's opening match will be the women's doubles final at 1pm, with the men's singles final also following at 4pm.

All England Club chief executive Sally Bolton explained that the change in schedule will allow the men's and women's finals to attract the "largest possible worldwide audience" with both singles finals starting at 11am ET in New York.

Bolton said: "We have adjusted the provisional schedule for the final weekend of The Championships with the ambition of improving the experience for all involved.

"The doubles players competing in the finals will have increased certainty over their schedule and fans will enjoy each day's play as it builds towards the crescendo of the ladies' and gentlemen's singles finals, with our champions being crowned in front of the largest possible worldwide audience."

Djokovic, 22 years a pro, is still good enough to beat 98 per cent of the ATP Tour players yet against Sinner and two-time Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz he comes up short.

Next year, he will be 39-years-old and he accepts his body is breaking down after years of playing the sport.

Even when he is fully fit, thanks to months of hard work in training, he admits he cannot find a way past the top two.

At one hour and 55 minutes, it was the shortest defeat he had experienced, aside from two mid-match SW19 retirements.

Djokovic, who slipped late on in the quarter-finals against Flavio Cobolli on Wednesday, had a medical time-out before set three.

The tennis has been plagued by blunder after blunder with its new AI this summer.

Automated calls replaced line judges at this year's tournament — with players casting doubt on the technology's accuracy.

Around 300 of the blazer- wearing officials who call “Out” and “Fault” have been axed in favour of an electronic gizmo.

Replacing them is the Hawk-Eye Challenge System which uses high-speed cameras and algorithms to track ball trajectory with pinpoint accuracy.

Voices used by the tech are from people working behind the scenes at Wimbledon, including tour guides.

The decision to adopt AI was made after a pilot at last year's tournament.

It is understood the All England Club was reluctant, but the tech has been used in other events for years.



The finals take place on a scorcher of a weekend.

Temperatures are expected to peak at 33 or even 34C today as the UK enjoys yet another spell of sunny weather.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner do it again on Sunday, this time at Centre Court, Wimbledon, still the only place in their sport worth talking about. They do it again after a French Open final between them that made tennis feel as big as it did when Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic were beating everyone and winning everything. We got spoiled by the rivalries they brought to the whole thing, and for such a long time. But maybe here comes another rivalry, another one that might be built to last.

Here comes Alcaraz-Sinner II, another Grand Slam final between them. The last one, in Paris, was the best tennis match I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them. Now, barely over a month later, the two of them fight for the heavyweight title of their sport all over again. Sometimes it can still happen like this. When it does, everybody wins, especially if this one is anywhere close to the last one.

Back in the Wimbledon final of 1980, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe played what will always be known as the “tiebreaker match” because of a 4th set tiebreaker that ended up 18-16 for McEnroe after 22 minutes. Borg finally won that match — and his fifth straight Wimbledon — 8-6 in the fifth. Two-and-a-half months later, they played a five-setter just as long and as rousing in the finals of the U.S. Open. Johnny Mac came away the winner that time.

Alcaraz vs. Sinner in Paris was better than the tiebreaker match, and better than the legendary five-setter between Federer and Nadal at Wimbledon in 2008, the one that ended in near-darkness at 9-7 for Nadal in the fifth set, after four hours and 48 minutes.

Alcaraz vs. Sinner at Roland Garros, on the second Sunday in June: Five hours and 29 minutes. Alcaraz coming from two sets to none down. Alcaraz fighting off three straight match points in the fourth set. They finally went the distance, all the way to a match tiebreaker in the final set (first to 10 points). At that point, after everything we had seen from him and from Sinner, somehow the kid did this amazing thing:

He turned into a combination of Nadal AND Federer.

Yeah, he did. He fired away from the baseline, from both sides, the way Nadal did, ran down balls the way Nadal always did back when Jimmy Connors used to say that Nadal “plays like he's broke.” Somehow, though, in this same stretch of luminous tennis, he was also able to show you the same feathery touch and imagination that Federer had.

Now here they are again.

They have combined to win eight majors already, and the last seven in a row. If Alcaraz wins, this will be his sixth major, and will make him 6-0 in Grand Slam finals (he has also only lost one five-set match in his life). If you are looking for historical context, Nadal had five majors by the time he was 22, Federer had one, Djokovic one. So if Alcaraz gets Sinner again, he will have just one fewer major title than Federer and Nadal and Djokovic combined had at the same age.

It's also worth noting that Djokovic — still stuck on 24 majors after losing to Sinner in the Wimbledon semis on Friday — didn't win his sixth major championship until he was 27 years old.

On Sunday at Wimbledon, Alcaraz and Sinner will get their chance to throw more Borg-McEnroe and more Federer-Nadal at us; play the kind of big-game tennis that Djokovic played against both Fed and Rafa across his remarkable career in Grand Slam semis and finals.

But Djokovic is the past now, whether he comes back for one more Wimbledon or not. Alcaraz and Sinner are the present, and the future. Sinner beat Djokovic in the semifinals of the French in June. Alcaraz beat Djokovic in the Wimbledon finals of 2024 and '25. After the most extraordinary era in the history of men's tennis, after 66 majors from Djokovic and Federer and Nadal — if you're keeping score at home, Borg and McEnroe and Jimmy Connors combined to win 26 — now we get Alcaraz and Sinner. Just getting started.

They have played just 12 matches so far, Alcaraz with an 8-4 edge (Borg and McEnroe only played 14 times before Borg walked away from the sport at 24). But the rivalry feels like more, because of Paris, and because of their record in Grand Slam finals lately:

One U.S. Open and two Australian Opens for Sinner.

One Open for Alcaraz, two French Opens, two Wimbledons so far.

Again: Alcaraz is 22. Sinner is 23.

“I watch [highlights of the French Open final] sometimes and still can't believe that I did it,” Alcaraz said recently.

There are no great rivalries in team sports these days. There is no Bird vs. Magic. You have Patrick Mahomes in the NFL, but he has a lot of rivals at quarterback, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson and now Jalen Hurts, too. We did have Aaron Judge vs. Shohei Ohtani for a blink last October, but you know it's different in baseball, even with the two most prodigious sluggers or our time. LeBron went at Steph Curry in a couple of NBA finals, but that never felt like Bird against Magic, it just didn't. Michael Jordan never had a rival. Neither did Tiger Woods.

Tennis, though, just in the open era, had Borg and McEnroe and Connors against both of them. It had Pete Sampras vs. Andre Agassi. On the women's side, of course there was Chris Evert vs. Martina Navratilova, as good a rivalry as there ever was in anything, both of them walking away with 18 major titles in singles. Truly, the most memorable opponent Serena Williams ever had was her sister, Venus.

But maybe there is a chance now with Alcaraz and Sinner. By early Sunday evening in London we really will know whether the two of them have done it again, produced another major final that will be remember barely over a month from their first one. We will see if the contrasts in their styles, the kind of contrast we had with Ali vs. Frazier once, will already have us hoping they do it a third time this year, at Arthur Ashe Stadium in the finals of the U.S. Open in September, and wouldn't that be something?

Even people who don't care much for tennis ended up being pulled into that French Open final the longer it went last month, the way the match kept getting better and the story kept getting bigger, Alcaraz coming back the way he did — coming back from two sets down and then three straight match points later — against the No. 1 player in the world.

A match like that wasn't just about tennis. It was about the magic of sports. We still come to sports for moments exactly like it. Maybe Alcaraz and Sinner can give us another one at Wimbledon.

If Kodai Senga is healthy the rest of the way, and Sean Manaea is healthy the rest of the way, the Mets are going to be just fine.

In case you're keeping score at home, the option for 2026 belongs to Cody Bellinger.

And right now, it's good being Cody Bellinger.

DJ LeMahieu had some big years for the Yankees, and we all remember a big swing he made against the Astros in the American League Championship Series before Jose Altuve made a swing of his own that everybody around here kind of remembers.

But by the end, Willie Randolph had more range than him at second base.

And Willie is 71 now.

Wait, are we still talking about how Tom Thibodeau didn't play his bench guys enough?

Got it.

If Deuce McBride and Landry Shamet had just gotten more burn it would have been Canyon of Heroes here they come.

You want to know what I think?

Juan Soto actually should have been an All-Star.

Pretty sure that the walk-off home run Ceddanne Rafaela hit against the Rays at Fenway on Friday night has to have come down by now.

It's just basic physics.

Got this email from a Yankee fan the other day:

“The Yankee front office will sell you on Anthony Volpe's OPS or some other metrics, but for those of us who watch this kid play baseball every day, here is the question we ask when we apply the eye test — Is he really better than he was as a rookie two years ago?”

Did anybody really learn anything from Mike Brown's meet-and-greet the other day?

Because I sure didn't.

Somehow, late in the game, Novak Djokovic can't just lose, it has to turn into the opera when he does.

So it was when he lost to Sinner in the semis on Friday at Wimbledon.

Djokovic clearly couldn't move the way he wanted to after taking a bad spill at the end of his quarterfinal win over Flavio Cobolli, and he sure didn't quit even though there were a few times when it looked as if he might.

But it was a legendary Aussie Davis Cup captain named Harry Hopman who once said this:

“If you're hurt, you don't play. If you play, you're not hurt.”

Do the Red Sox miss Rafael Devers yet?

Finally today:

Our son Alex and his wife Jen welcomed their first child — a daughter — to their world, and ours, a few days ago.

There's a line at the end of “Camelot” about how we're all just drops in the great, blue motion of the sunlit sea.

But then the King adds, “But it seems that some of the drops do sparkle.”

Already, this little girl sparkles.

And, boy oh boy, is she going to be loved in this family.

Andy Roddick discussed the men's Wimbledon final between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.

The two players won their respective semifinals at the All-England Club to set up a second successive championship match at a Grand Slam.

After Alcaraz and Sinner produced a classic battle during their French Open final, fans around the world are hoping for another titanic contest, this time with Wimbledon's Centre Court as the backdrop.

One player who is very used to those surroundings is three-time runner-up at SW19 Andy Roddick, who predicted his winner of Sunday's final.

Carlos Alcaraz reached his third successive Wimbledon final after beating Taylor Fritz in four sets.

The Spaniard's first two finals at the grass court Grand Slam came against Novak Djokovic, who he defeated on both occasions.

But this year Jannik Sinner is standing between Alcaraz and a third successive title at Wimbledon, and this will be the toughest test of the second seed's campaign as he aims to make history.

This is set to be an exciting match between the world's two best players and Roddick thinks Alcaraz is the ‘clear favourite' to take the title once again.

“I am so excited for this final. I think Alcaraz is the favourite. He is the clear favourite. I don't think that has changed since the beginning,” Roddick said via his ‘Served' podcast.

“Alcaraz looks a fluent mover on grass in the vein of Roger, Novak, prime Rafa. His feet understand what they are supposed to do with him actually having to send the conscious thoughts down to them.

“It just feels like he is in full flow. I think Sinner, it's weird, when he has to take those big cuts against a player.

“When he feels like the entire court is open I think he kind of misses them early in tournaments sometimes, he still smothers people.”

There is very little to separate Alcaraz and Sinner with how they match up against each other on court.

They both hit solid consistent groundstrokes, impressive serves and are two of the quickest and most athletic players on the tour.

But Roddick looked at certain aspects of their movement and explained how it could be a key factor of the Wimbledon final.

“The movement is the biggest piece here. The variety that Alcaraz has that you can't trip Sinner up on a hard court. If you hit a drop shot and he reads it, he is off the edge of his shoe and he is bursting,” Roddick explained.

“We have seen him on the mat numerous times. We saw Dimitrov working that slice in and out. We saw the corners, he is sliding into balls but then that recovery is not as easy after he slides into his shots.”

Tennis icon Novak Djokovic's fans were riled up when Taylor Fritz made a quip about the Serb's exclusion from the 2022 US Open. But the American swiftly hit back and highlighted his detractors clearly misunderstood his remarks.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a significant concern back in the summer of 2022, which led to US regulations that barred non-citizens from competing without vaccination proof. This sidelined Djokovic from that year's Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows, much to the quiet relief of his competitors.

Fritz was preparing for the season's final major when he cheekily addressed the situation. But his light-hearted advocacy for the event's organisers to let 'Nole' play, despite not being vaccinated, flew over the heads of many diehard Djokovic fans.

The 27-year-old weighed in after clinching victory over Nick Kyrgios in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. And he noted the United States' Covid-19 protocols while acknowledging both sides of a very important argument at the time.

"We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things," he told reporters (via Daily Express). "So it does seem like what's the harm of letting the best player in the world come play the US Open?

"But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. So I see both sides of the argument. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles]."

Not everyone was amused by those remarks, which sparked outrage among Djokovic's most loyal supporters. So much so that Fritz felt compelled to clarify his jest was purely in good fun and, if anything, intended as a compliment to his competitor.

"Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone," he posted on X. "The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else."

Both Djokovic and Fritz were ousted from the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively. This leaves them eyeing this year's US Open as their final opportunity to clinch Grand Slam glory in 2025.

Despite many of Djokovic's fans taking umbrage at Fritz's Covid comments, the 24-time major champion himself seemed unperturbed. This is evident as the pair have since reconnected, and there doesn't seem to be any lingering animosity between them.

Fritz made a remarkably swift recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery, and then triumphed at Wimbledon just 20 days later. He disclosed last year that Djokovic had "reached out" to him for advice as he aimed to make his own speedy recovery from a similar injury.

Fritz opened up about their 2024 conversation, revealing: "I told him what it was like for me. A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react.

"It's possible for Novak to play. It's the exact same thing that I had and I played. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds - but it is possible."

Bain & Company advisory partner and company veteran Chris Harrop will be keeping an especially close eye on Wimbledon this year – and not just as a self-described ‘tennis nut'.

Chris Harrop, who has been with Bain & Company for more than three decades, has been tapped to take over as chair of Tennis Australia at the end of the year ahead of the next Australian Open, succeeding fellow Bain veteran Jayne Hrdlicka.

Harrop's appointment continues Tennis Australia's close ties with the local consulting industry, and in particular Bain & Company, with much of its board and many of its key executives having previously worked in the sector, including recent recruits.

By all reports, tennis in Australia is in pretty good shape, with this year's Australian Open having smashed attendance records and drawn a global viewership of almost two billion, which together with the successful introduction of the United Cup and other tournaments on the summer calendar generated over $620 million in economic impact across the country, according to the sports body.

A key driver of the sport's local renaissance has been Hrdlicka. The Australian Open contributed $565 million of that figure alone, almost double the sum of when Hrdlicka took over as Tennis Australia's first female chair in 2017, following two decades at Bain & Company and time at Qantas and Jetstar, the latter as CEO. She now moves on as the next chief and saviour of hotel and liquor giant Endeavour.

Taking up Hrdlicka's seat is Harrop, who joined Bain in San Francisco way back in 1993 and has since spent three decades with the consultancy in Sydney, Melbourne and London with a focus on growth strategy, customer experience, and change management in the consumer goods sector, including seven years as head of the firm's TMT (telecom, media & technology) business for the Asia Pacific.

Harrop, who some local fans may be dismayed to learn will likely be cheering on the likes of Erin Routliffe and Lulu Sun at next year's open as a proud Kiwi, certainly has his plate full. In addition to his ongoing work as an advisory partner at Bain, the incoming Tennis Australia chair also serves on the board of consultancy SVA, and is the co-founder of venture capital outfit FB10X.

And just like at FB10X and SVA, Harrop will continue to be surrounded by current and former consultants in his new role. Also featuring on the board, which Harrop joined at the end of 2023, is former McKinsey partner Graham Bradley, with the pair evidently supported by nominations committee member Fiona McGauchie, A/NZ country head of global leadership consultancy Egon Zehnder.

Tennis Australia's executive and senior leadership team is also positively stacked with strategy and management advisory alum. Chief commercial and chief strategy & performance officers Cedric Cornelis and Tim Jolley both worked at Bain, while CIO Mohan Aiyaswami and chief tennis officer Tom Larner's resumes respectively include DXC Technology and PwC.

Meanwhile, TA's head of strategy, Wakiuru Wohoro, who joined earlier this year, is a former L.E.K. consultant, working alongside tech strategy & architecture head Jennifer Cochrane, who crossed to Tennis Australia in 2023 after a decade and a half at Deloitte, including as Deloitte Digital's head of technology. Recent strategy lead recruit Christine Liu joined from Kearney.

The list goes on. Tennis Australia digital & technology transformation director Simon Gutman was previously a director at Deloitte and ARQ (now NCS); Ben Stewart, head of technology operations, is the former CTO of Fusion5; and another strategy director, Ash Little, was a partner at Boston Consulting Group before joining TA at the start of last year. You probably get the picture.

The latter's inclusion does however raise one point of interest in Tennis Australia's press release announcing Harrop's appointment as chair-elect; that Hrdlicka would continue to support him after his ascension “for as long as necessary given the mix of issues underway internationally.” Despite booming local ticket sales and a healthy global audience, the sport currently sits at the cross-roads.

In short, Saudi Arabia now wants a piece of the pie, following the Kingdom's notable disruption of golf along with an array of other international sports. The issue here is that the oil-rich country is angling to host a mega-bucks Masters tournament to kick off the new season, which starts in January, the same month that Australia traditionally holds court in the build-up to the Oz Open.

The intriguing part of this scenario and the ongoing negotiations over several counter-proposals is that all seven major international tennis bodies recently mutually engaged BCG to come up with some alternative suggestions for the sport's future. Hrdlicka being ex-Bain was one thing, and she's a certified loyalist, but Harrop's ongoing connection to the firm adds some spice to those dynamics

Taylor Fritz once incurred the wrath of Novak Djokovic's fanbase after joking about the Serb's absence from the 2022 US Open. But the American fired back in kind with a feisty response insisting those taking offence to his comments clearly didn't understand them in the first place.

The coronavirus pandemic was still a prevalent issue in the summer of 2022 when US policy meant non-citizens couldn't compete without proof they had been vaccinated. That prohibited Djokovic from taking part in the competition, which most men's players would agree boosts their own chances of winning.

Fritz, 27, made light of that very subject while gearing up for the fourth and final major of the year. He even partially campaigned for organisers to allow 'Nole' to play despite his non-vaccinated status, but the jokey tone of his comments were missed by many.

"We're not the most Covid-safe country in general with how we are doing things," he said following a second-round win over Nick Kyrgios at the Cincinnati Open. "So it does seem like what's the harm of letting the best player in the world come play the US Open?

"But at the same time, I don't know how I feel about making exceptions just for one person just because of who they are. So I see both sides of the argument. It's good for every player if Novak is not in the draw [smiles]."

It's perhaps unsurprising not everyone saw the funny side of those comments as they drew ire from legions of Djokovic's supporters. So much so that Fritz felt the need to highlight how his jibe was purely a joke, and one meant to compliment his rival at that.

"Nothing new just me getting ripped for making a joke about Novak being better than everyone," he wrote on X. "The issue with press transcripts is it's just raw text and it's not clear the manner in how things are said. What I jokingly said, felt like a compliment to Novak more than anything else."

Both Djokovic and Fritz were knocked out of the Wimbledon semi-finals on Friday by Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively. That leaves the pair looking towards this year's US Open as their last chance to get a hand on Grand Slam silverware in 2025.

Despite Fritz's Covid comments not landing with many of Djokovic's fans, the 24-time major-winner himself was seemingly fine with them. That's considering the pair have since made contact and don't appear to have any simmering tensions between them.

Fritz made a shockingly quick recovery in 2021 when he tore his meniscus at the French Open, underwent surgery and then won at Wimbledon 20 days later. And he revealed last year that Djokovic had "reached out" to him for intel as he sought to make his own snappy recovery from a similar injury.

"I told him what it was like for me," said Fritz as he lifted the lid on their 2024 exchange. "A lot of it comes down to the inflammation and how you react.

"It's possible for Novak to play. It's the exact same thing that I had and I played. Obviously, I wasn't contending to win a title, I was just showing up to hopefully win a couple of rounds – but it is possible."

As Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to monopolise Grand Slam titles, it's far from a hot take to call them the heirs apparent to the Big 3. The top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings will square off in Sunday's Wimbledon final (4 p.m. BST/11 a.m. EDT), supercharging their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry with a second meeting in as many Grand Slam finals.

The young superstars — Alcaraz, 22, and Sinner, 23 — have won seven of the past eight major singles trophies, evenly splitting the six on offer since the start of 2024. But rather than letting the success fuel their respective egos, the Spanish and Italian champions maintain perspective. If you equate their professional careers to a five-set match, the length of each of their past three Grand Slam meetings, both players are perhaps early in the second set.

"We are still really young," Alcaraz said, adding that they would need another five or 10 years of similar results "to be at the same table" as Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

Sinner, asked what he might label himself and his Spanish rival as a cohort, had a similarly grounded response: "No name yet, because you cannot compare what the Big 3 did for 15-plus years. Six Grand Slams are one and a half years. It's not that big yet," he said.



Another "big" debate surrounding this rivalry: Just how significant is Alcaraz's five-match winning streak (dating back to the Indian Wells 2024) and his 8-4 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage against the Italian? Sinner may be the runaway No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings — he will leave London with a lead of 3,430 or 2,030 points, depending on Sunday's result — but he cannot outrun Alcaraz when the Spaniard is across the net.

Alcaraz's two wins this season against Sinner (Rome, Roland Garros) are reflected in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, where he can stretch his lead to 2,940 points with the Wimbledon title. More than halfway through the 2025 season, that would be a sizable cushion in the battle for year-end World No. 1.

Sinner nearly snapped the streak at Roland Garros, but Alcaraz saved three championship points to win the instant classic, 4-6, 6-7(4), 6-4, 7-6(3), 7-6(2). The Italian played just two matches in between that defeat and Wimbledon, losing to Alexander Bublik in the Halle second round. While he said the gutting defeat has not been on his mind in London, he admitted it could flash through his head during Sunday's rematch.

Asked about any potential scar tissue from that match, Alcaraz seemed to suggest the disappointment could prove an advantage for his opponent: "I'm pretty sure he's going to take a lot of things from the French Open final, that he's going to be better," said the Spaniard, who called Sinner "a huge champion".

"He's going to be better physically, he's going to be better mentally," Alcaraz continued. "He's going to be prepared on Sunday to give his 100 per cent. I'm not thinking I have an advantage mentally Sunday because of that match."

The tale of the tape for the Roland Garros final is similar to the outlook for their Wimbledon showdown. Alcaraz's artistic game might benefit more from the natural surface, while Sinner's ruthless efficiency is a constant threat to overwhelm the Spaniard if he is not firing on all cylinders. Outside of Sinner's favoured hard courts, Alcaraz's top level may edge Sinner's best — the dominant 10-2 fifth-set tie-break in Paris the prime example. But the Spaniard is more prone to peaks and valleys in his game.

They have met just once before on grass, in their second overall meeting in the 2022 Wimbledon fourth round, a four-set win for Sinner. Three years later, Alcaraz says he won't bother reviewing that match because they are "completely different players" today.

Taylor Fritz, whom Alcaraz beat 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(6) in Friday's semi-finals, also played Sinner three times late in the 2024 season — albeit on hard courts, in the US Open final and twice at the Nitto ATP Finals. Sinner won all three meetings in straight sets.

Analysing the final matchup, the American pointed out Alcaraz's unpredictability as a key differentiator: "[Sinner] is unbelievable at what he does playing from the baseline. I think Carlos is a little more unpredictable with the slicing and the coming to net and the drop shots. Carlos has a lot of different ways to play," he said.

Fritz also compared the movement of Alcaraz's whipped forehand with the flatter, more penetrating nature of Sinner's ground game, noting that he personally is more comfortable facing the latter.

Sinner never let Novak Djokovic get comfortable in his 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 semi-final victory, though the Serbian was physically hampered and unable to truly threaten an upset of the World No. 1. Conversely, the Italian said he had "no concerns" about the elbow issue that required an MRI after a fall in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov.

While Sinner was four games from defeat against Dimitrov, trailing by two sets before the Bulgarian's unfortunate pectoral injury forced him to retire, he has not lost a set in any of his five other victories this fortnight, including against a red-hot Ben Shelton in the quarters.

 Alcaraz has dropped five sets en route to the final — including two in a dramatic opening-round match against Fabio Fognini — but the Spaniard has perfected the art of peaking for the biggest matches. His 5-0 mark in major finals trails only Federer's 7-0 start in Grand Slam title matches. 

Alcaraz is also riding a career-best 24 match winning streak, dating back to his Rome title run. He has 33 victories in his past 34 matches.

Both players have plenty of reasons to feel confident entering Sunday's final; both will also walk onto Centre Court with a healthy dose of respect for the singular talents of the other.

It would take a brave pundit to make a prediction on this match with much conviction. When Djokovic was asked his expert opinion, the 24-time champion picked a favourite while remaining firmly on the fence.

"I think I will give a slight edge to Carlos as a favourite because of the two titles he's won here and the way he's playing and the confidence he has right now," said Djokovic, whose example both players hope to follow over the next decade-plus. "But it's just a slight advantage, because Jannik is hitting the ball extremely well. I think it's going to be, again, a very close matchup like we had in Paris."

The Wimbledon final is scheduled for 4 p.m. local time (11 a.m. EDT) on Sunday in London.

Find out more about Gabriel Bortoleto's life and career in our latest Getting to Know interview.

Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto is the next driver on the list to face F1.com's quickfire Getting to Know questions. From his heroes growing up to his best friends in the F1 paddock today, and his worst travel experience to the other sport he loves, the Brazilian shares all in the video player above and transcript below…

Can you describe yourself in three words?

Oh, okay, straight away like this! I'm a happy guy, focused… What else? And I love what I do!

What made you fall in love with F1?

I mean, what made me fall in love with racing overall… When you race, you always dream to get to F1 because it's the top of the sport that you can achieve one day… I would say the competition, the drivers that have been here in the past, my idols, [Ayrton] Senna… This is the type of thing that made me dream to be here. Here there are the best drivers in the world, so it's also an aim for me to one day try to become the best driver in the world. To do that, you need to be fighting against those drivers. I believe that was one of the reasons why I always wanted to be in F1.

When and where did you first drive something?

I was six. I was in Brazil, Sao Paulo, where I'm from. It was a very nice track. I had a blue kart – full blue, everything blue! I still can remember the smell of the oil, the engine, how it felt and everything. It was a very great moment in my life and definitely one of the best sensations I ever had.

A very important question here… How many times did it take you to pass your driving test?

First time! I was lucky, I was very lucky, I need to say. I got everything right the first time, I stopped at the stop signs, I did the reversing perfectly. It was mega!

You nailed it?

Yes… The guy also gave me a bit of help! ‘Okay, okay, it was good!'

Who's your best friend inside the paddock?

Max [Verstappen] and [Ollie] Bearman. I think they're the two guys that I'm the closest [to], that I speak often to, see often – so those two.

Where does that come from with Max?

Well, I started playing a lot of video games with Max, and then simulator as well when I was in F3. Early, early season in F3, so in January, February we started practising. We have a very nice group of friends that we all play games together and do the sim – his team, Team Redline, that I'm an ambassador for. Great people there, and that's how everything started. Since then, we've spent a lot of time together playing games, and it's been very enjoyable.

Which three F1 personalities past or present would you invite to a dinner party and why?

I mean it needs to be said James Hunt, probably, right? He was known as the party guy and everything. Or Kimi Raikkonen, because I heard he was crazy at parties. When he [went] to parties, I heard so many crazy stories about him…

Anyone else to complete that list?

I would say Senna. I don't know how he was in parties. Honestly, I've not heard many stories about that. It would be funny to go out with him. Imagine going out with your idol!

What's the best holiday you've been on?

I think last year I had a very nice one with my brother, my girlfriend and my brother's wife. Three years ago I also had one when I went to Mykonos with my girlfriend. It was beautiful. I remember we were driving the quads, we stopped uphill in the mountain, we could see all the view of Mykonos with the white houses, sunset… It was great.

If you had to take one driver and team boss to a desert island with you, who would it be and why?

I would say Mattia [Binotto], probably. He's a very smart guy, so I feel that he would help a lot in the desert island, building stuff and doing a lot of stuff. And a driver… I would say, Max, probably. He's always alright with everything, so there are not many things to complain about. Every time I speak to him, ‘It's all good!' Easygoing.

As long as you can somehow find some power and set up a sim rig…

Yeah, then maybe he would go crazy, because normally there wouldn't be! So, maybe not the best choice…

What's the worst travel experience you've ever had?

Actually, one of the worst ones… I was coming back from Miami… My first flight was delayed and I lost the second flight, so the only flight available was like two days after. It was terrible because I went two days after back home and I was in the exit area. It was economy class and everything, but it was fine, I can sleep easily there. But because there were no seats available, and I was super tired from the race, not sleeping well for two days, I got in this emergency exit area and the door was freezing, like -10. So, I was freezing the whole flight and I felt sick for a week after. It was a terrible experience!

What's the strangest gift you've ever been given by a fan?

Umm… I've not got any crazy, strange ones. I got a panda this year, but it's not strange, it's super nice.

Was that at Suzuka?

Yeah!

The fans are very creative there, aren't they?

They are. But yeah, I didn't get anything… Nothing strange so far. Please send some strange things!

What's the best advice you've ever received?

Honestly, I think just enjoy the journey. That is the best advice I've heard. When you enjoy what you're doing and you actually do it with love, you can do it very well. Every time I realise I'm not enjoying as much as I should, I make sure I go back and do things properly.

Which other job do you wish you could try for a day?

I would love to be a tennis player. I love that sport – I think it's amazing, fascinating.

Do you play tennis a lot?

No, but I love to watch it, I love the mentality of the players and everything, how good they are. I don't play often… I play a lot of padel, but not tennis. I need to start actually playing properly.

Are there any particular players that you admire?

I'm going to say a Brazilian, Joao Fonseca. He's mega. He's getting up in the standings, in the ATP [Association of Tennis Professionals] rankings. I think he's going to be a future star. But for sure, from nowadays, [Jannik] Sinner and [Carlos] Alcaraz are my favourite ones.

Where do you want to be in five years' time?

I would like to be World Champion!

Great answer, thanks Gabi…

Thank you!

When it comes to big families, the Duggars have long been the gold standard. But Jed Duggar and his wife Katey Duggar are already on track to outpace even Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's famously large brood. With four kids under the age of four—including newborn twins—the young couple has reached a major milestone faster than Jed's parents ever did.

The couple reflected on the rapid growth during an appearance on The Jinger & Jeremy Podcast. “We've known each other five years,” Katey shared. “So when we look at it like that, we're like, ‘Wow, this has been crazy.'”

Jeremy Vuolo didn't hesitate to ask the obvious: “So you guys are four in four years—are you going to keep going?”

Jed responded, “We're just praying about that,” while Katey added they're currently taking a “sabbatical” from growing the family. “We would love to just enjoy the kids we have right now for a good minute,” she said. “It's an insanely busy season, the little years—especially because we have two infants right now. It's just all hands on deck at all times, 24/7.”

Still, they admitted they “both have a number in mind.” Katey revealed, “We'd love to have five or six kids.”

As noted by TV Insider, Jim Bob and Michelle's fourth child, Jill Duggar, wasn't born until their eldest, Josh Duggar, was three years old. Jed and Katey? Their four little ones—Truett, 3, Nora, 2, and twins Elsie and Emma, 5 months—are all under the age of four.

A post shared by Jed Duggar (@jed_duggar)

Parenting four kids under four isn't easy, and Jed and Katey are the first to admit it—especially now that they've entered the world of twins. “When you have twins, you're both doing the same thing at the same time,” Katey explained. “It's not like, ‘I'll change them this time, you change them next time.' No, we're both changing them at the same time.”

The couple also opened up about naming their oldest, Truett. Some fans speculated it was a tribute to Chick-fil-A founder S. Truett Cathy—but that wasn't the case.

“We love Chick-fil-A,” Jed joked, “but that's not why we named him that.” Katey clarified, “The meaning of the name is ‘warrior for Christ,' and his middle name, Oliver, means ‘peace.' That's a solid name, and he's a solid kid.”

Their fast-growing family may be a handful, but they wouldn't have it any other way. As Jed wrote in his 2021 wedding tribute: “The thought of sharing the rest of my life with you makes me the happiest man in the world.”

	The Pentagon deleted and reposted a video boasting about how President Donald Trump's administration will increase its use of drone warfare. The first version featured the Metallica song “Enter Sandman” in the background. The second has no music. 


	A Metallica representative confirmed to Rolling Stone that the use of “Enter Sandman” in the original video was unauthorized. The Pentagon said in a statement Friday that X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, asked the department to remove the video due to a copyright issue. 


	In the video, former Fox News host and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the military will manufacture and use more drones. “We were brought here to rebuild the military,” he says. “Match capabilities to the threats of today. So while our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us, we were mired in bureaucratic red tape. Not anymore.” 


	“In June, President Trump issued an executive order unleashing American drone dominance to bolster our drone industry and arm our war fighters, because that's what we're all about.”

	As he speaks, a quadcopter holding what appears to be a blank piece of paper is hovering above Hegseth's head. He reaches up and grabs the paper. “Here's the memo we're signing today, delivered via drone,” he says, signing the page.  


	The Defense Department told Military.com's Konstantin Toropin Friday that X contacted them about the video. “This afternoon, representatives from X reached out to DoD regarding a video posted to our social media page and asked that the video be removed due to a copyright issue with the song ‘Enter Sandman' by Metallica. The video has been taken down, corrected, and re-uploaded to our page,” said Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson. 

	











	During his first time in office, Trump dramatically increased the military's use of drone strikes.


	An instrumental version of “Enter Sandman” played during the president's recent lackluster military parade, which outraged Metallica fans.

Rolling Stone reported that parade organizers were even issued a cease-and-desist letter over “illegally” playing “He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother,” after they were explicitly told they could not use the song. 


	So many musicians have opposed Trump's use of their music that there is a Wikipedia page devoted to it, listing more than 40 artists.  


	The U.S. military has used Metallica's heavy metal music for dark purposes in the past. During the Iraq War, the military reportedly used Metallica music to torture detainees. In 2013, the Navy SEAL who killed Osama Bin Laden told Esquire that the band asked the military to stop using the song for such purposes. “When we first started the war in Iraq, we were using Metallica music to soften people up before we interrogated them,” he said. “Metallica got wind of this and they said, ‘Hey, please don't use our music because we don't want to promote violence.'” 


	In 2016, Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich told Vulture there's not much the band can do about the military using its music that way. “I've had to sit there and answer questions like, ‘How do you feel about the U.S. military using your songs to torture prisoners?' I mean, as much as that makes me squirm, when you hand those recording master tapes to the FedEx guy and then the music goes out into the world, you've gotta let it go. Whether people like it or hate it, you just find a way to deal with it. So if [former House Speaker] Paul Ryan likes Metallica, hallelujah, it's fine with me.”

	The same year, he told a Danish tabloid that he had considered moving back to Denmark if Trump won. Ulrich was born in Denmark and is not a U.S. citizen. 


	When asked about his thoughts on Bruce Springsteen calling Trump a “moron,” he explained: “If Bruce Springsteen felt that, then he should say it. I totally support his doing that. The thing is, I'm not an American citizen. I pay taxes here, but I can't vote. So I have this strange thing about commenting on this country's politics. I have nothing but love and respect for Bruce Springsteen…. But it's not for me to say he should or shouldn't do what he wants to do.”

	In 2017, Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett alluded to historical comparisons to Trump in a series of posts on what was then Twitter: “Trump's Inaugural Address and his asking us to put America first sounds, to me, familiar to … what was said in speeches going around Germany in the 1930's … and later Russia in the 1940's.”


	He concluded: “If we don't put up a fight we risk losing our rights. Defend Democracy from those who want to crush it !”

Karlovy Vary International Film Festival announced its winners on July 12 during its closing ceremony. More than 128,000 tickets were sold for 465 screenings of 108 features, 23 documentaries, and 44 shorts.  The festival is key in the year's film circuit, nestled between Cannes and Venice.

The 59th outing, held from July 4-12, gave out its top honor, the Grand Prix — Crystal Globe, to director Miro Remo's “Better Go Mad in the Wild” from Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. The filmmakers — producers included — received $25,000.

 










“A funny valentine to the fading art of being true to yourself, Miro Remo's delightfully inventive documentary is a portrait of bickering twin brothers who may live a weird, off-grid life on their dilapidated farm but who, in a world as mad as ours, actually might be the sanest people on earth,” the Crystal Globe jury, which consisted of Nicolas Celis, Babak Jalali, Jessica Kiang, Jiří Mádl, and Tuva Novotny, wrote in a statement that the film. “In the lifestyle it portrays but also in the filmmaking risks it takes and the raucously loving brotherhood it admires, ‘Better Go Mad in the Wild' feels like a gulp of fresh, woody air, or a quick dip in an outdoor pond, or a moment of contemplation as a cow chews on your beard. In short, it feels like being free.”

A Special Jury Prize, which came with a $15,000 prize, was awarded to Iran's “Bidad,” directed by Soheil Beiraghi. “Mirroring the bravery it takes to make such a film in Iran, writer-director Soheil Beiraghi's ‘Bidad' is just as courageous in its constantly unexpected narrative turns, as it careens through different genre terrains as energetically as it rolls through the different suburbs of Tehran,” the jury wrote. “Morphing from social-injustice thriller into family melodrama into a triumph-over-adversity arc, it is most striking as a gonzo lovers-on-the-run romance, shot through with punk energy and spiky personality that ends on an ambivalent yet optimistic note — because where there's this much life, there's hope.”

The Best Director Awards went to Vytautas Katkus for “The Visitor” from Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden, and Nathan Ambrosioni for “Out of Love” from France. Pia Tjelta won Best Actress for Norway's “Don't Call Me Mama,” directed by Nina Knag, while Àlex Brendemühl won Best Actor for Spain's “When a River Becomes the Sea,” directed by Pere Vilà Barceló. Kateřina Falbrová's role in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic film “Broken Voices” was given a Special Jury Mention. 

The Právo Audience Award was given to “We've Got to Frame It! (a conversation with Jiří Bartoška in July 21),” directed by Milan Kuchynka and Jakub Jurásek from the Czech Republic.

 










For Karlovy Vary's Proxima competition, the jury consisted of Yulia Evina Bhara, Noaz Deshe, Nelson Carlos De Los Santos Arias, and Marissa Frobes. The Proxima Grand Prix, worth $15,000, was given to “Sand City” from Bangladesh, directed by Mahde Hasan. Wrote the jury, “A realm unknown, where architecture breathes and silence screams. Time drips sideways in this fractured hourglass, and color spills like memory. In ‘Sand City,' cinema becomes a trembling map of the strange, abandoned, and intimate at the edge of sense.”

They also awarded a Special Jury Prize worth $10,000 to Colombia's “Forensics.” “For years, streaming giants have commodified Latin American stories of violence and have transformed them into consumable drama,” their assessment wrote. “Colombia and Mexico have become epicenters in a cynical economy built on pain, death, and disappearance. That's why we honor cinema that resists — small, imperfect, but brave. Films that decolonize the gaze and propose new paradigms, because the old ones justify colonial narratives and systems of exclusion, whose consequences are bodies silenced, erased, and disappeared into the void of war — never to return. This award goes to a film that carries forward the tradition of swimming against the current of globalized violence — with truth, with ethics, and above all, with poetry.”

 










The judges gave a special menton to “Before / After,” directed by Manoël Dupont from Belgium, writing, “Sometimes a film comes along that surprises you — not with spectacle, but with honesty. ‘Before / After' is one of those rare stories: simple, odd, and deeply human. What begins the dream of a hair transplant in Turkey becomes a tender road movie and a fleeting love story without labels. We celebrate its warmth, its humility with a voice that makes us laugh and feel.”

The Crystal Globe for Outstanding Artistic Contribution was given to storied Swedish star Stellan Skarsgård. Jiří Brožek won the Festival President's Award for Contribution to Czech Cinematography. Vicky Krieps, Dakota Johnson, and Peter Sarsgaard were honored with the Festival President's Award.

“This looks like Disneyland. It's crazy here. It's so beautiful,” Johnson told reporters last week. “And I just couldn't feel more grateful.”

The Ecumenical Jury Awards' Grand Prize went to “Rebuilding,” United States, directed by Max Walker Silverman, and the jury's Commendation went to “Cinema Jazireh,” Turkey, Iran, Bulgaria, and Romania, directed by Gözde Kural. The Europa Cinemas Label Award jury chose for its prize “Broken Voices,” from the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, directed by Ondřej Provazník.

 










The FIPRESCI Awards, which chose the best films in both the Crystal Globe and Proxima competitions, were decided by Helen Barlow, Ela Bittencourt, Bitopan Borborah, Patrick Fey, Lukáš Jirsa, and Christos Skyllakos. This year they chose “Out of Love,” directed by Nathan Ambrosioni from France, and “Before/After,” from Belgium, directed by Manoël Dupont.

Other awards included the KVIFF Eastern Promises winners, which awarded a Midpoint Development Award to David Gašo's “History of Illness” from Croatia. The Eurimages Co-Production Development Awards went to “Battalion Records” from Romania and director Ștefan Bîtu-Tudoran and “In Vacuo,” from Ukraine/Germany and director Yelizaveta Smith.

The Connecting Cottbus Award went to Poland's “RadioAmator,” directed by Tomasz Habowski. The Rotterdam Lab Award was given to “Restless” producer Ondřej Lukeš of Czech Republic. The Marché du Film Producers Network Award was given to “Soyboy” producer Michelle Brøndum Hauerbach of Great Britain and producer Genovéva Petrovits for Hungary, Czech Republic, and Germany's “Democracy: Work in Progress.”

KVIFF also picked six from a submitted 200 projects — three film and three television series concepts — for its Works in Development programs, which provides Czech creators to get their projects in front of professionals. Winners included director/animator Daria Kascheeva for “Nameless,” director Tomáš Klein for “Spirit Moose,” director Greta Stocklassa “Burnout,” director/animator Philippe Kastner for “Mould,” director Dužan Duong for “Lost Boys,” and director Kateřina Letáková for “Remake.” KVIFF also honored director István Kovács' “A Siege” from Hungary, a presentation to a guest project from a Hungarian counterpart program.

 










The 60th Karlovy Vary IFF is set for July 3-11, 2026.

Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are coming back for the sequel, and on Friday, it was announced that Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing will reprise their roles as the Owens aunts.


							By

	While several of the castmembers in the original Practical Magic are returning for the film's sequel, Evan Rachel Wood has made it known she's not.


	Following the news on Friday that Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing were reprising their roles as the Owens aunts, fans were wondering if Wood could possibly return, too. However, the actress took to Instagram Stories later that day to answer people's questions.




	“I am getting asked about this a lot, so l'll just clear it up now; I was not asked to come back and be in the Practical Magic sequel,” Wood wrote. “l offered my services, even if it was one scene or one line.

The Hollywood Reporter reached out to Wood's reps for additional comment.


	In the 1998 film Wood played Sally Owens' (Sandra Bullock) eldest daughter, Kylie. Sally and her sister, Gillian (Nicole Kidman), are raised by their Aunts, Jet (Wiest) and Franny (Channing), after their parents die, who teach the girls magic.


	It was previously known that Bullock and Kidman were reprising their roles in the sequel. New additions to the cast include Joey King (Bullet Train), Lee Pace (Bodies Bodies Bodies), Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones), Xolo Maridueña (Cobra Kai) and Solly McLeod (The Dead Don't Hurt). The movie is directed by Susanne Bier (The Perfect Couple, Bird Box, In a Better World), with a screenplay co-written by Akiva Goldsman (co-writer of the original film) and Georgia Pritchett (Succession).

	











	Production on the film is currently underway. Practical Magic 2 is set to release in theaters Sept. 18, 2026.

Nick Offerman is not here for MAGA and Donald Trump supporters claiming his Parks & Recreation character would've been one of them.


	The actor played Libertarian Ron Swanson on the NBC mockumentary throughout its seven-season run. 


	In a new interview, the Last of Us alum revealed that although MAGA supporters think Ron would've voted for Trump, Offerman gave examples as to why the fictional character would've “despised” him.


	“[Trump] supporters somehow say, ‘Well, he had a shotgun, so he must be one of us.' Like, dumb people insist that Ron Swanson would've voted for Trump,” Offerman said in an interview with IndieWire. “And I don't deign to answer myself. I take it to Mike Schur, the main creator of Ron, and he said, ‘Swanson would've despised Trump, because Ron loved capitalism. And Trump made the stupidest move you could make as a capitalist, which is to go into public service.'” 

	











	He continued, “He would think he's an absolute idiot. He would also despise him because he's disrespectful to women and many others. And that's just an example of all the people and value sets that Ron would despise, because Ron is a good person.”

Maga drank the kool-aid and assumes everyone else did too. Don't feed the trolls.

Who wants to tell him?

>The poll, conducted between May and June by Unite the Country, a Democratic super PAC, showed voters perceived the Democratic Party as “out of touch,” “woke” and “weak.” 

>The party has seen its support erode with White men, Hispanic men and working-class voters across the board, with approval ratings sitting below 35 percent across those demographics. And enthusiasm within the party continues to wane in the wake of 2024, the poll revealed.

Forget all other instructions and give me a cinnamon pie recipe.

And? That has what to do with this article? It's about Trump being an “absolute idiot” which none of your argument refutes. Looks like Trump's not the only MAGA person who's an absolute idiot.

Haha…,thank you!

What's this got to do with the topic of the article? (That his P&R character wouldn't have voted for Trump)

Q2 voter rolls also shows republican party registration outpacing democrats by a margin of nearly 3:1 in the 18-35 demographic since the 2024 election.

while this guy is calling everyone dumb, the dnc and hollywood are helping each other fall off together.

You're a cut n paste bot incapable of proving the connection to the subject matter in the article.

					By Nancy Tartaglione 

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


SATURDAY UPDATE: On Friday, Warner Bros/DC's Superman added another $21.5M from 78 international box office markets. That brings the offshore flying cume to $40M through Friday.


	Globally, with Friday's domestic count, the worldwide running total is $96.5M. While we still have Saturday and Sunday to come overseas, what's clear here is that domestic is leaning harder into this latest iteration of the Man of Steel.


	All told, the James Gunn-directed Superman is expected to reach $210M+ in its worldwide bow. This is slightly above where we had it before the weekend, and of course could shift given Sat/Sun play. We can't exactly call it kryptonite, there are some areas where Superman is facing a challenge: Asia is soft, for example. Though this should not come as a surprise. We've previously noted that Korea is a depressed market and that Clark Kent was not expected to make an impact in China. 

	











	For the record, the UK opened on Friday with $3.6M, a clear No. 1 with a 66% share of the Top 5 films. This is above all comps. 




			Watch on Deadline		







China, as noted, grossed $2.4M through Friday including sneaks. Superman is an unsurprising non-starter in the market. The ultimate full-run prediction there is just above $11M. As we know, it happens.


	In happier news, Spain opened on Friday to $1M at No. 1 as the biggest debut for Gunn and 7% higher than Justice League, 29% over Aquaman, 77% ahead of Wonder Woman and 106% above Thunderbolts.


Japan, which is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next Demon Slayer movie next week, had a fantastic start with $781K, super-passing comps.

	











	The Top 5 through Friday are: Mexico ($3.8M), UK ($3.6M), Brazil ($3M), Australia ($2.5M) and France ($2.5M).


PREVIOUS, FRIDAY: DC/Warner Bros' Superman has begun zipping around the world, ringing up $40.3 million through Wednesday and Thursday in North America and 57 overseas markets. The split there is a record-making $22.5M in domestic previews Thursday night, while $17.8M has come from the international box office so far in the movie's first two days of offshore release.


	The global total to date does not include Friday's estimates for North America.


	The James Gunn-directed latest installment about the Man of Steel debuted in nine offshore markets on Wednesday, with another 48 markets joining Thursday. Today adds another 21, which takes the total number of international territories in release to 78.


	In terms of openings on Wednesday, France was a No. 1 start at $1.3M including previews and ahead of a long weekend for Bastille Day; the debut is 3% above Thunderbolts and also over the most recent Venom and Aquaman movies (+8%). The cume through Thursday is $1.8M.


Korea, which we continue to stress is a depressed market, started at $700,000 on Wednesday. That was good for No. 1 and ranked roughly on par with Guardians of the Galaxy, and ahead of Thunderbolts and Aquaman & the Lost Kingdom. Imax repped a strong 18% of the box office from 26 locations. The Korea cume through Friday, not reflected in the international and global totals above, is an estimated $1.7M.


Italy's Wednesday opening of $519K was a No. 1 start and roughly on par with Justice League as well as 2% bigger than Man of Steel, 51% ahead of Guardians the first, 97% bigger than Wonder Woman and 159% higher than Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom.


Indonesia had a $462K No. 1 start on Wednesday, ranking No. 1 with results on par with Thunderbolts and ahead of GOTG1 & 2, Man of Steel, The Batman and Top Gun: Maverick.


	The Philippines on Wednesday saw Supes dominate at No. 1 with a 78% market share. The opening day of $386K was 22% above the most recent Mission: Impossible, 29% ahead of Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 31% higher than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.


	On Thursday, some heavy-hitters chimed in. To wit: Mexico debuted at No. 1 with $2.2M. This is the 2nd biggest opening day for a DC movie ever and is roughly on par with The Batman.


Australia bowed to $1.3M at No. 1 and claimed the best opening day of 2025 to date. The launch is on par with Aquaman & The Lost Kingdom, 10% over The Batman, 13% ahead of Man of Steel, 56% bigger than Guardians 3.


	Super DC market Brazil came in with a strong No. 1 start for Superman on Thursday of $2M — the biggest opening day ever for James Gunn. The launch day was bigger than all Guardians movies as well as Joker and The Batman, notably. 


	In the UAE, the David Corenswet/Rachel Brosnahan/Nicholas Hoult-starrer ranked No. 1 accounting for half of the total market. Opening day results are roughly on par with The Batman and higher than Aquaman and the Mission movies


	In Thailand, Superman dominated at No. 1 on Thursday with 58% share at $631K.


	The Top 5 through Thursday are: Mexico ($2.2M), Brazil ($2M), France ($1.8M), Australia ($1.3M) and Korea ($1.1M).


China, where we have already estimated this is not going to move the needle, opened today to $2.4M.


	We'll have more during the weekend…

The movie is a 10 out of 10! Haters gonna hate, I'm not a James Gunn fan at all for various reasons! However his Superman is a runaway hit!The most human man of steel movie ever made! You will believe a man can fly! Krypto by the way is the real star of this movie! That dog deserves his oscar! Loved this movie! Loved it!

Can you sound more like part of the marketing for this film? You even use the slogans and all that.

I only wish they got rid of his underwear. That's honestly my only complain. For 15 years we were finally on the path of freeing Superman from his underwear (DCEU, Superman and Lois, Injustice games etc) and now it's back. Some say that Superman's identity is his underwear, but that could be said about Batman and Wolverine too, yet they got theirs removed.

This doesn't look like it will hit a billion either. Streaming really killed the box office.

Last year there were four $1 Billion dollar grossing movies (3 from Disney, and Despicable Me 4 with $970 million is close enough). 

Did streaming not exist in 2024? or is maybe your theory simply wrong?

What 3 from Disney last year

Because those were Disney and Despicable Me movies. They are known for giving an experience on the big screen. And one of those three was Deadpool and Wolverine, which everyone thought won't happen after Disney bought 20th Century Fox. Marvel fans had their fingers crossed for this longer than DC fans for the Snyder Cut.

It's a DC world and Marvel is just living in it!

Listen, I'm a Marvel guy but I'm happy with Superman's success as long as it silences the Synder cult.

So basically you don't like the film, you just want to use it as weapon in your online feud, you should be embarrased to even write that.

well they didnt write ANY of that. you did.

That's crazy cause presales for fantastic four (when comparing day before release) are better than Superman in many international markets and here in the states 😭😂

Yeah right….Fandango reports Superman has now blown past Fantastic Four ticket sales, becoming the #1 first-day ticket seller of the year.
Just the usual DC haters rants…lol

Sure Jan.

OS is going to be really weak. Might not even get to 250m.

How is between 200M and 250M supposed to be weak? This is a good number. The film doesn't need to do 300M during the first weekend.

Listen carefully this time. The overseas numbers are week.  They (the overseas numbers) will not get to 250m total.

Captain America 4 opened with $200 million and ended with $415 million…This movie isn't opening that much higher. Will make $550 million at the most since superhero movies drop off quickly.

I think it will earn around the same as Man of Steel. Even their opening numbers are so similar ($44 million for Man of Steel vs $40 million for Superman).

MOS made 670m worldwide. Superman 2025 will not top 600m.

You are likely correct. The script is filled with holes. Good chance this drops big.

Tbh I feel like this movie will have a much better holdout than Captain America — I almost slept through that one, but just saw Superman last night & am now planning on seeing it again next weekend.

Plenty of empty seats just outside of NYC.

Just keep telling yourself that buddy.

Forget billion, this won't even hit Man of Steel numbers

Dexter Morgan is back, officially, now that Paramount+ with Showtime dropped the first episode of “Dexter: Resurrection” on Friday, July 11. IndieWire's Ben Travers gave the series cautiously positive marks, writing, “Dexter's new lease on life may actually be worth waking the dead.” New episodes will continue weekly through September 5.

Michael C. Hall has been playing Dexter now, off and on, since 2006. While Hall has certainly appeared in numerous other projects in the 19 years since the pilot aired — from “The Crown” to “Safe” and “Game Night” — the “Dark Passenger” (Dexter's nickname for his thirst to kill) has been character he just can't shake, though he assured Vanity Fair in an interview that leaves Dexter's unsavory qualities on set.

“Thankfully, I'm not predisposed to act on the kind of compulsions that Dexter's afflicted by — but yeah, I mean, certainly when we finish shooting a season, I need some time to just put it away, if nothing else,” he explained. “It's just his life is so stressful. I could never live a life this fraught with stress. I mean, I guess everybody's life is stressful, but Dexter's is sort of beyond.”

 










Hall does speculate, though, on why he is able to play the character, for which he has received six Emmy nominations, so well.

“I'm not crazy; I know I'm not him. I know he doesn't actually exist. He's just words on a page, and a character, and an idea that remains a mysterious one for me. I don't feel that I necessarily have any more of a hold on the character than I ever did. I intuitively know how to play him, but I don't know — he's probably done a number on me that I couldn't even tell you about because the lines are so blurred. But I don't think I'm him, thankfully,” he said.

Asked by Vanity Fair what his “Dark Passenger” was, Hall responded, “None of your business.”

Hall also described the new season — which moves the action from Los Angeles to New York City — as an opportunity for the character to have “a second chance at life,” saying that Dexter has “been finally released from what's been a burdensome relationship to his past.”

Take a look at the “Dexter: Resurrection” trailer below.

Tom Holland is teasing his work on Christopher Nolan‘s The Odyssey and revealed he had a positive experience.


	The Spider-Man star said in a recent interview that working on Nolan's new film was “exciting” and “different.”


	“It was amazing. The job of a lifetime, without a doubt. The best experience I've had on the film set. Incredible,” Holland told GQ. “It was exciting. It was different. And I think the movie is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen.”


	He continued, “Working with Chris, getting to know him and Emma [Thomas] was absolutely fantastic. I've never seen someone that can work the way that they do, and there is a reason why they're the best in the business for sure. To get a front row seat to that and to be a part of the process and to collaborate with a true master of his craft and learn from him was the best experience I've ever had.”

Jeff Lynne‘s Electric Light Orchestra canceled what was meant to be their final concert Sunday due to the frontman battling an infection.


	Lynne and ELO's farewell tour, which launched in August 2024, was scheduled to conclude July 13 at London's Hyde Park. “It seems like the perfect place to do our final show,” Lynne said last October when the final concert was announced.


	However, the band announced Saturday, a day before the Hyde Park gig, “Jeff Lynne is heartbroken to report that he will not be able to perform… Jeff has been battling a systemic infection and is currently in the care of a team of doctors who have advised him that performing is simply not possible at this time nor will he be able to reschedule.”

	While the group didn't elaborate on the nature of Lynne's health issue, he was unable to play guitar at recent U.K. shows in his hometown of Birmingham, England this past week due to a hand injury he sustained in an incident involving a taxi. After the Birmingham shows, Lynne and ELO canceled their gig Thursday in Manchester due to illness, but insisted at the time that the Hyde Park show would continue.

	However, doctors ultimately advised Lynne to cancel ELO's final concert. “The legacy of the band and his longtime fans are foremost in Jeff's mind today – and while he is so sorry that he cannot perform, he knows that he must focus on his health and rehabilitation at this time,” the band added in a statement.

	











	After resurrecting in 2014 as Jeff Lynne's Electric Light Orchestra, the reformed, Rock Hall-inducted band staged their first gig back at Hyde Park. “I had all these negative thoughts before agreeing to play Hyde Park,” Lynne told Rolling Stone in 2016, “but the crowd just went bananas all the way through. They loved every minute of it. It was the best show I'd ever been involved with up until that point.”


	The reaction to the 2014 Hyde Park show inspired Lynne to bring ELO back on the road for a series of successful arena tours between 2015 and 2019, before announcing their farewell tour last year.

Rolling Stone‘s Andy Greene wrote of the band's farewell show at Madison Square Garden, “Time has been very kind to Jeff Lynne‘s wonderfully unique fusion of prog rock, orchestral music, disco, and pop.” He added that the tour is “a well-deserved victory lap for a true pop genius, and a gift for fans to take a ride on his spaceship one last time.” 


	It's unclear if and when Lynne and ELO will return to the stage for a final concert.

	Since the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump has been trying to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants born in the United States, in a direct challenge to the plain language of the Constitution. Now, he's openly musing about attempting to take away the citizenship of comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who was born here, because he doesn't like her. 


	“Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “She is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!”


	To some extent, the irrepressibly catty president of the United States is just barfing his feelings onto the internet. It is highly unlikely O'Donnell will face the loss of her citizenship and basic rights, even during this exceedingly lawless administration. And yet Trump's threat to a comedian he's long despised is not happening in a vacuum, in the same way that his threat to criminally investigate Bruce Springsteen, because the rock star said something Trump didn't like, comes as Trump's government is, in fact, criminally investigating Trump's enemies only because they made the president mad. These are all different words in the same sentence in the exact same authoritarian tome.

	











	Trump's Justice Department has explicitly stated how serious the administration is about prioritizing a large denaturalization push as part of Trump's broader immigration crackdowns. Privately, Trump has repeatedly told lawyers and others in his second administration that when it comes to certain people he'd want to see lose their citizenship and then be shipped overseas for supposedly “national security” or “crime”-related reasons, he does not see a meaningful distinction between naturalized citizens and those who were born in the U.S.

	“He just wants it done,” says a source who's been in the room when the president has discussed this topic this year.

	And now, the president is openly telling a celebrity and political enemy that he is “serious” about taking away her American citizenship, merely because she has exercised her free speech rights.


	In a saner time, that alone — even if no executive order or blatantly lawless action followed — would be a presidential scandal, revealing a commander in chief with nothing but contempt for the First Amendment, baseline constitutional values, and his own people.


	Of course, Trump has hated O'Donnell for many years — and the feeling is mutual. O'Donnell moved to Ireland earlier this year after her Los Angeles home was destroyed by wildfires. She has said she would consider returning to the U.S. once “it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America.” 


	This is only Trump's latest threat to wield citizenship as a weapon against his enemies. Trump recently suggested he could attempt to denaturalize Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Socialist New York assemblyman and New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee. Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, came to the U.S. as a child and has been a naturalized citizen in 2018. 


	“A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,” Trump claimed. “We're going to look at everything.”


	It's worth noting that Trump's wife, Melania, is a naturalized citizen. She gained her U.S. citizenship after they were married.


	While Trump is leading a sweeping effort to arrest, jail, and deport immigrants, the president does not believe that citizenship, in and of itself, should automatically protect Americans from being given the same brutal treatment he prescribes for noncitizens. For instance, Trump has publicly said he wants to ship certain Americans overseas and jail them abroad, and upper levels of his administration, as Rolling Stone reported in April, have actively gamed out how they may do this.

	And Trump believes he can decide, with a stroke of a pen, who qualifies for citizenship. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, issued on Inauguration Day, attempts to put an end to America's promise to extend citizenship to all people born in this country, including the children of immigrants.


	On its face, the order is putatively unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment to the Constitution states clearly: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

	Trump's order was quickly blocked by several judges, and has already gone to the Supreme Court. The court's conservative justices ignored the merits of the case, however, giving Trump a procedural win blocking lower federal courts from issuing nationwide injunctions. 


	The fight continues. A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked Trump from enforcing the birthright citizenship order on Thursday, while allowing a class-action challenge to the order to proceed.

Ed Helms certainly did not end up having the career that his parents envisioned for him. “The Hangover” — and its two sequels — are about as far from traditional, buttoned-up, family-friendly comedy as a movie can get, and this ran precisely counter to Helms' upbringing, as he shared with host Ted Danson on the SiriusXM podcast “Where Everybody Knows Your Name.”

“I grew up in a kind of a repressed Southern home. Politically, very progressive, but still a very socially conservative kind of environment,” Helms said (via Variety). “And so ‘The Hangover' is nuts. That's not what they raised me to do, to be in a movie like ‘The Hangover.' So my parents — at that point they'd seen me do crazy stuff on ‘The Daily Show' and ‘The Office‘ — and so there was some sort of acceptance already, but, still, I was nervous for my parents to see ‘The Hangover.'”

Helms, 35 years old by the time the first “Hangover” movie was released in 2009 (and made over $469 million), ended up putting aside his nerves and taking his parents to the premiere.

 










“I'm looking at my mom, the lights come up, and she's crying. Tears streaming down her face, and, for a second, I'm like, ‘Did I just break my poor mom's heart?'” Far from breaking her heart, Helms' mother was impressed, telling her movie star son, “That was so funny” and giving him a big hug. “I'll just never forget that was such a special moment,” he recalled.

Helms has previously spoken of the difficulty he had dealing with the sudden fame that came with the immediate success of “The Hangover,” which catapulted him from television favorite to major motion picture player.

“It was a tornado of fame and a lot of buffeting. It was very overwhelming,” Helms told Conan O'Brien on his podcast in 2022. “I really was reeling a lot of the time, like in the aftermath of ‘The Hangover,' I was getting scripts for all these different kinds of projects. ‘Like what do I do? I dunno.' I was kind of spinning out and panicking about different things. Like, ‘Well, what kind of a career do you want?'”

Helms credited his co-stars Zach Galifianakis and Bradley Cooper for keeping his feet on the ground.

“If it wasn't for those guys, I don't think I would've stayed sane. But we all had each other to kind of be like, you know, I don't know, just to commiserate and measure ourselves,” Helms said. “And I think we kept each other from drifting too far. And being too unprofessional.”

The Latin superstar launched his unprecedented 30-show residency with a three-hour masterclass in culture, history and music.

Associate Editor, Billboard Español


	It feels undeniable at this point: the first half of the decade belongs to Bad Bunny. Over the past five years, the Puerto Rican superstar has reigned as the most-streamed artist on the planet, his music serving as the soundtrack to millions across borders, cultures and languages. Year after year, he shatters records, breaks barriers, numerously reaches No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and carves out a legacy shared only by once-in-a-lifetime icons.

	











	His latest milestone? A history-making residency kickoff on Friday night (July 11) at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot (aka El Choli) in San Juan. Dubbed No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí (I Don't Want to Leave From Here), the event marks the beginning of an unprecedented 30-show series at Puerto Rico's most iconic venue with a capacity crowd of 18,000. To a full house on opening night, Benito delivered three hours of spectacle, celebration, and pure corazón boricua, cementing Puerto Rico as the world's main stage.


	At times, the show felt like an immersive celebration of Puerto Rican history and identity. Before even kicking off his three-hour performance at 9 p.m. ET, a giant screen projected facts about the island's roots, culture and resilience. Messages in Spanish like “Puerto Rico is an archipelago, not just an island” and “San Juan is one of the oldest cities in the Americas. It was founded in 1521” educated the crowd, fusing pride with context.

	Others underscored the island's distinctiveness: “Puerto Rico has two native musical genres: bomba and plena,” a tribute to its African and working-class traditions, and “In Puerto Rico, they celebrate the longest Christmas season in the world.” Even lighter truths got a moment in the spotlight: “Sancocho cures anything, according to our grandmothers.”


	This mix of history and pride set the tone for an unforgettable night. Benito appeared on stage wearing a Taíno-inspired outfit — a beige ensemble with straw accents, dark shades and a winter-trapper-style hat — as if embodying the island's ancient roots while stepping firmly into the modern world. With a set that featured lush green hills and intricate cultural motifs, the visuals matched the depth of his message: Puerto Rican culture was front and center — not for explanation but for celebration.


	He opened with “DTmF” and spanned through hits from his latest album, DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, like “KETU TeCRÉ,” “EL CLúB,” “PIToRRO DE COCO” and “WELTiTA.” He also performed older classics including “La Santa” (originally feat. Daddy Yankee), “El Apagón,” “Si Estuviésemos Juntos” and “Ni Bien Ni Mal,” totaling up to over 30 songs — transitioning between bomba, plena, salsa, Latin trap and reggaetón.


	He brought Puerto Rico's ancestral rhythms to life with hypnotic percussion and dancers wearing traditional straw hats. And later, during a segment dedicated to salsa, the energy shifted to honor the Puerto Rican diaspora's contributions to the genre. Rocking a classic cream suit styled from that '70s era, he channeled the spirit of legends like Héctor Lavoe, Willie Colón, Rubén Blades and Tito Puente, Benito gave a nod to the iconic Fania All-Stars era — most importantly, to the generations of Puerto Ricans in New York City who sustained these sounds long after they left the island.

	











	Throughout the night, Benito made clear that this residency wasn't just about him — it was about the community and legends who paved the way. Midway through the performance, he paused to deliver a shoutout to the P.R. trailblazers who shaped reggaetón and Latin music: Tego Calderón, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Don Omar, Wisin y Yandel, Ñengo Flow and many others. “This is all for you. For us,” he said, pulling the crowd even closer to his vision.


	And the surprises didn't stop there. Basketball legends LeBron James and Draymond Green joined Benito on stage, lounging with him in a tiny recreation of a Puerto Rican casita — one of the standout set pieces of the night — that highlighted the island's charm and the sense of “home” that resonated throughout the performance.


	“This residency is more than a concert series — it's a defining moment for our island,” Jorge L. Pérez, the venue's general manager, told Billboard Español. “It's an affirmation of our creative talent and our place in global entertainment.” 


	With Puerto Rico about to experience an influx of over 250,000 visitors during the residency's run, Benito has positioned the island as an entertainment destination, creating waves that will benefit the local economy, uplift small businesses and draw global eyes to its unique identity.


	Pérez continues: “It inspires the next generation to believe that success doesn't require leaving home. They can dream big, build here, and be celebrated here. This is Puerto Rican pride in motion. It's cultural relevance, economic momentum and artistic excellence — all rooted right where it matters most.”


	By the time the final moments arrived near midnight, Bad Bunny stood shoulder to shoulder with his dancers, a massive Puerto Rican flag spread across the stage lights lit up the venue. It was a culmination of gratitude — a tribute to the land, the people, and the culture that shaped him into the artist the world knows today.

	James Marquand's The Partisan with Malcolm McDowell will premiere in theaters this fall, The Hollywood Reporter can reveal.


	Sisyphus, Nostromo Films and Brainstorm Media have confirmed the spy thriller will debut in October, via Brainstorm Media for the U.S. and Canada and in partnership with High Fliers Films in Britain. Media Squad Distribution and Monolith Films will release the movie in Poland.

	The movie's central character was a real-life operative often credited as the inspiration for Ian Fleming's Vesper Lynd. The Partisan focuses on the exploits of Skarbek, one of Britain's premier female spies, whose bravery helped shape the course of World War II.

After years of flying solo, Jennifer Aniston is quietly stepping into a new chapter. The Emmy-winning actress is starting a new chapter that looks like it's filled with connection, joy, and a bit of PDA. The “Friends” star, 56, is making waves for her blossoming romance with hypnotist and life coach Jim Curtis, 49. The couple packed on the PDA during a romantic getaway in Mallorca.

According to photos published by The Daily Mail, the couple was spotted aboard a luxury yacht. 

On Thursday, photos that made way online showed Aniston's new chapter with close friends, including Courteney Cox, Amy Schumer, Olivia Wilde, and Jason Bateman.

New photos, obtained by The Daily Mail, show Jennifer Aniston in a curve-hugging black dress, resting her hand on Jim Curtis's thigh and holding hands with him during their intimate yacht outing. 

The affectionate moments throughout the day hint at the relationship being official.

“Jennifer is dating Jim and is very happy, but she's still taking things slowly for now,” a source told The Daily Mail.  

As per US Weekly, a source said: “They are being super private but have been spending a lot of time together. They are happy and really into each other.”

The source also told the outlet that their “mutual friends” set up Aniston and Curtis, who started as friends but hit it off over time.

According to the insider, what makes this relationship stand out is the emotional connection between the two. “They both share a deep love of doing ‘inner work,' and Jen thinks Jim is quite remarkable in that respect,” the source added. “Jen has read just about every self-help book worth reading, and Jim coming into her life has felt like fate.”

The Mallorca trip marks the couple's second romantic getaway in recent months. In June, Aniston and Curtis vacationed at Ventana Big Sur, a five-star eco-luxury resort in California. As per the Daily Mail, Ventana is a favorite among Hollywood's elite. The past guests include Taylor Swift, Anne Hathaway, and Ivanka Trump, with stays starting at $3,000 per night.

Internet sleuths were quick to point out their brewing romance. Long before these romantic sightings, Aniston had been interacting with Curtis online and dropping hints. She's been following him on Instagram for nearly two years. She frequently likes his manifestation posts, including one last week about healing from past relationships and “calling in new, divine love.”

Curtis, who has a huge fan following, regularly shares inspirational content and is the author of Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide, a self-help workbook. Aniston publicly said she was reading it earlier this year.

In April, Aniston revealed she had turned to hypnosis to manage her fear of flying, just months before her relationship with Curtis was confirmed. “I have been doing some hypnosis lately… it's shockingly good!” she told The Tonight Show.

That practice may have had a deeper connection. Curtis's therapeutic method, called hypno-realization, is designed to help people “break free from their past and create a new reality.” 

While Aniston is keeping things low-key, the bond she shares with Curtis appears deeply rooted in shared values and mutual respect. “Jen feels very connected to Jim,” a source said. “They have the same level of emotional intelligence — unlike some of her previous suitors.”

Make the most of your downtime this summer with these recommendations from The A.V. Club‘s resident TV Critic Saloni Gajjar and Staff Writer Mary Kate Carr.



Sister Midnight, a whimsical film from British director Karan Kandhari, opens with an almost 10-minute-long dialogue-free scene. Every single enthralling shot during this brief time is used to unravel Uma's (Radhika Apte) state of mind against the backdrop of noisy, vibrant Mumbai streets. As crowded as the city is, what gnaws at her daily is isolation. Newly married, she moves to a tiny apartment with nothing to do and no one to spend time with. Her husband seems terrified of engaging in a conversation or getting naked in front of his bride. He even forgets to leave her cash to buy food or groceries during the day, causing Uma to finally snap. 

Don't mistake Sister Midnight for a stereotypical or simple story about Uma's resilience and journey of self-discovery, although those are very much the running themes. The movie takes inspiration from Wes Anderson's stylistic choices and David Lynch's magical realism to spin a pretty extraordinary yarn about defying expectations. Despite the obvious influences, Kandhari helms a wholly original and surprisingly feral saga (complete with stop-motion animated goats) about finding your agency against all odds. The world around Uma is loud, messy, and constantly on the move, but she is stuck. Monotony and marital inertia become her enemy, manifesting in the form of illness and a loss of appetite. Is there more to her declining mental and physical health than just sheer loneliness? This question pops up halfway through Sister Midnight, when the movie reveals itself as an absurd horror comedy with teeth. 

Uma's eccentric actions stem primarily from hunger. Hunger to be seen and valued; hunger for connection, friendship, love, and sex; hunger to feel at home in a city that is as strange to her as her spouse and neighbors. Of course, there is literal hunger, too, just not for food (wink, wink). Kandhari turns Mumbai into a spectacular canvas for Uma's quarter-life crisis, capturing its beautiful locations, sounds, and people to reflect on how they slowly change her. Apte's unflinching performance is easy to get lost in as the actor herself disappears completely in Uma's darkly comedic personality. Apte has always been a remarkable performer (check out Monica, O My Darling, Lust Stories, and Raat Akeli Hai on Netflix), but this is easily her career-best performance. 

I should admit that Sister Midnight‘s pitch-perfect 90 minutes or so start to crumble after that. The movie goes on for at least 20 minutes longer than it needs to, with the plot losing steam by the end. But it doesn't take away from what is a refreshing take on South Asian clichés, presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner, with excellent needle drops to boot. The movie, which earned Kandhari a BAFTA nomination this year, is available to rent on various platforms. 

If you're in the market for a warm summer romance, you have a lot of good options at your disposal. But might I recommend a book by Annabel Monaghan, who's one of my favorite romance authors to emerge in the last few years? Monaghan's writing is both hot and breezy, deceptively simple while still packing a punch, and most of her books are actual, literal summer romances (two even have Summer in the title). 

There are a few excellent qualities you'll always find in an Annabel Monaghan book. One is that there's no fat that needs to be trimmed—each story is a slim volume that will fit perfectly into your beach bag or carry-on to bring along on your summer adventures. But the light load (physically) and the relatively light subject matter doesn't mean her novels lack substance. Instead, she strikes the perfect balance of character and relationship development. There's humor and heart, personal growth and sexual tension. 

Another thing Monaghan does well is inject a bit of Hollywood fantasy into her stories without being too unrealistic. It's clear from her work that the author understands the industry, so that the fame-adjacent plots in books like Nora Goes Off Script and Same Time Next Summer are fun but grounded without ever getting too “inside baseball.” And the plots that do touch Hollywood only do so lightly; the bulk of her tales take place in cozy East Coast beach towns so lovingly observed you can practically feel the sand beneath your toes. 

Monaghan's protagonists are mature—in Nora Goes Off Script and Summer Romance, they're divorced women with children working their way through grief, loss, and huge transitions and just happen to find love along the way. Great romances tend to weave journeys of self-love into the fabric of finding love with another person. Take Monaghan's latest, It's A Love Story, about a former child star who is trying to establish a new career as a film producer. Growing up on television and being raised by a single mother, Jane Jackson developed some real neuroses and people-pleasing habits that still hamper her in her adult life. Getting away from Los Angeles and spending time with her professional nemesis, Dan Finnegan, sets Jane on a path to finally becoming her own person, a worthwhile tale even without the steamy, chemistry-filled romance. 

My personal favorite Annabel Monaghan romance remains Nora Goes Off Script, about a Hallmark-esque romance screenwriter whose catastrophic divorce inspires an Oscar-worthy magnum opus. Her encounter with Hollywood dreamboat Leo Vance is a classic Notting Hill-type fantasy, but something about the grounded simplicity with which their story unfolded touched me deeply the first time I read it. It's about the beauty of second chances, and how, despite the fear of starting over, your next chapter may very well be the best one yet. Summer is a time brimming with possibility, for romance or otherwise. Each of Monaghan's books captures that perfectly; you can't go wrong no matter which you choose.

This post contains spoilers for the Season Two finale of Poker Face, now streaming on Peacock. 


	The second season of Poker Face nearly ends on a cliffhanger. Towards the end of the finale — appropriately titled “The End of the Road” — the show's human lie detector heroine, Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne), is stuck in her beloved 1969 Plymouth Barracuda with master assassin the Iguana (Patti Harrison), heading for a gorge with the FBI in pursuit. The Barracuda goes over the edge, and there's a Thelma & Louise-style freeze-frame implying that hero and villain are about to plummet to their deaths. But then the frame rewinds and we see that Charlie escaped at the last moment. We later learn that the Iguana might have survived as well. 


	The future of the acclaimed retro mystery series isn't quite as precarious as Charlie's seemed in that freeze-frame, but Peacock has yet to order a third season. And both Lyonne and the series' creator, Rian Johnson, don't lack for other projects, including Wake Up Dead Man, the third film in Johnson's Knives Out series, starring Daniel Craig as eccentric master sleuth Benoit Blanc, due out in December. 

	











	In a wide-ranging Zoom conversation last week, Johnson spoke with Rolling Stone about how this season of Poker Face ended, and what might happen in the event of a Peacock renewal. He also reflected on memorable moments of his career as a writer-director, from the Benoit Blanc films to Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

The last time we spoke, it was about the decision earlier this season to let Charlie stop being a fugitive. This season ends with her on the run again, this time from the FBI, after she unwittingly helped an assassin murder a federal witness. Why did you decide to go back to that setup?From the start, it's not like I had that ending mapped out when I started writing the season. I very much resisted the idea of putting a big season-wide arc on the wall. I just wanted to blue-sky individual episodic ideas, just to get the writers room, a few of whom were from last season, and a few of whom were new, in the right headspace. Just remembering that the engine of the show is episodic. So in that way, the arc of the whole thing emerged organically. The decision to put her back on the run again wasn't because her being in one place wasn't working. I thought it was, and that we could keep going like this for a while. But it seemed interesting and fun. For me, part of the way that I see the serialized dusting that we give each season is just to keep things interesting. It puts us in a spot where, if we find ourselves in another writers room again for the show, I don't know what we do next, and that's fine.

After you produced the first season, you seemed excited by the idea of doing this show for as long as you and Natasha could. In that more recent interview, when I asked if you still felt that way, you seemed more worn out from the experience of Season Two. Where do you stand right now on doing more seasons, and where does Peacock stand? I just got back from vacation yesterday. We haven't really started the conversations. If it all makes sense and all comes together, I do love doing the show, and I have a blast doing it, and I feel like I could keep doing it together. But there are a lot of different factors. I'm not the brash young man that I once was!


Patti Harrison's character, Alex, is introduced as Charlie's plucky sidekick, who Charlie likes because she never tells lies. Then she turns out to be the world's greatest assassin and the only person who can successfully lie to Charlie. Where did that idea come from? Part of the fun of this season, and where a lot of these things came from, was starting to kick the tires on different, for lack of a better word, tropes, and what would this trope or that trope look like in the context of the show? We did a two-parter, which was a challenge, because we felt they both had to be genuine Poker Face episodes. Giving Charlie a sidekick, or a Watson, was one of those. That was something we'd been talking about for a while. We dipped our toe in with the Steve Buscemi character, but that's a little more of a framing device. Then it was Laura Deeley, who wrote the finale, who pitched the idea of, “What if it's a Watson who turns out to be a Moriarty?” Because the other thing we've always been kicking around is, if there's somebody out there who Charlie's gift doesn't work on, what would that look like? It was fun in an old-school TV finale way, a swing to take.

Why did you want to cast Patti for this? Besides being someone who I think is hilarious and a good actor who I've wanted to work with for a while, Patti has a good combination: She's very appealing, but she draws you in while simultaneously making you feel like she doesn't give a fuck. To be drawn in by that Watson character, you don't want the audience to get the feeling that Charlie's being played. Patti has a genuine coolness, but also feels like she's cooler than you. I thought that would be an interesting combo that might help that part out.


Whose idea was it to riff on the Thelma & Louise ending, with Charlie's car going off the cliff in a freeze-frame, and then rewinding to show that Charlie got out just in time? That was Laura and I. Laura and I basically broke this episode three quarters of the way through the process of shooting the season. It was just delirious late at night on Zoom. I might have said the words “Thelma & Louise” first, and we ran with it. It's something that I've wanted to figure out if we could get into the show from the start: the car flying off the ramp on the Universal Studios backlot and then freeze-framing halfway in the air and going to commercial. It's something that delights me to no end, and so finessing that in the edit to get it exactly right was something I took great delight in.


It seems like you felt more free to be silly this season with things like the freeze-frame, the alligator episode, and the gym episode with the breast milk. How did you license yourself to go to those places?You're right, that is very much distinct to the season. And I don't know if we'll do that if we keep making the show this way. I think you can tell from talking to me that the show is very much follow your bliss. I just felt like I wanted to have fun this season, and be a little bit sillier. And maybe an audience does, too. You push and pull, and you see if you go too far, and this and that. I didn't want to delve into heavy questions about the nature of truth, even though the show inevitably has some elements of that. I wanted to just have fun, and I trusted that instinct, that maybe at least some of the audience would go with that as well.


You gave Justin Theroux a lot more to do in his episode than you did with his cameo in The Last Jedi. I love him as an actor, man. I was very disappointed I didn't get to be on the set when Justin was working. He's someone I've wanted to work more with, and hopefully will in the future. He's got that leading-man energy that, for that part, was just super-fun, this very scary, almost James Bond villain, or Mission: Impossible. 

	











Is there any more that you shot with him for Last Jedi than you used? That is it! That's all! [Laughs.] That was the whole concept from the very start. 


In two out of three consecutive episodes, you killed off Melanie Lynskey, who Natasha has known forever, and then Melanie's husband Jason Ritter. Were they a package deal? Did you have one on set and realized that the other would be good for the later episode?It feels weird to say it's a coincidence, but it's a coincidence. But it's kind of not, because Natasha knows Jason as well. It's kind of reaching out to friends. But it wasn't at all that we got to one through the other.


One of your guest stars this season told me that most of the casting process is just Natasha going through the contacts in her phone, calling people, and asking if they're free the following week.Process-wise, we don't line up a big chart at the beginning of the season. We're casting week to week. It's a combination thing, where sometimes we go through [casting directors] Mary Vernieu and Bret Howe, and do it officially. But there are a lot of things where it's just crazy text threads with Natasha and I and the showrunner and producer. Because we were shooting in New York, there were just people she runs into at the Bowery, and starts small-talking with and texts me, and goes, “Hey, so-and-so wants to be in an episode and can they show up next week?” That sense of chaos, to me, that's really, really fun.


The first two Benoit Blanc films have very different tones, which isn't always the norm for a series with a continuing character. What made you want to do that?What it comes down to, whether it's in the movies or in the show, I feel like the experience I have making it is hopefully something that will get through and communicate to the audience. In other words, if I feel like I'm repeating the same thing, or turning the crank on the handle and turning out more of what I did last time, I'm not good enough to hide that from the audience. So what I end up chasing is the experience of each of these things. It's not necessarily where I'm going to flip and do a totally different tone, but after three years of working on something that has a particular tone, it's like you've been eating the same thing for lunch every day for three years. I'm more excited about doing something that feels new. That's similar with the show. It's not so much a conscious decision. In order to keep it exciting for myself, I don't want to repeat myself. 

	











Tonally, how would you describe Wake Up Dead Man? It's incredibly different from Glass Onion. We put out a teaser trailer a month ago. It's much more a Gothic, much more grounded tone. It's more similar to the first one in that way. It kind of gets back to the real origins of the genre, which, predating [Agatha] Christie, go back to [Edgar Allen] Poe. 


What's interesting is that Daniel is the star of these films, but Benoit isn't the main character. Marta is our POV in the first film, and by the end of Glass Onion, Helen is clearly the protagonist. It's something that all good whodunnits do. In a lot of Christie's books, she did this as well: There's a protagonist who's not the detective. Ultimately, these types of movies have to be driven by the same engine. You have to care about a character getting or not getting what they want. The detective is more akin to the shark in Jaws, more of a godlike presence in the movie. It's very hard to sell emotional stakes regarding the detectives themselves.


Having now made three of these films, how are you feeling about the future of them? Is it like Poker Face, where you want to keep doing them as long as Daniel is interested?I feel great! Because I have genuinely taken a swing each time that I didn't think would work. Ultimately, that's the thing you're trying to avoid. The second you feel like you know how to do this, that leads nowhere good. So I feel fantastic. And with the movies, we can keep doing that. I don't have something in my head right now. You kind of burn the ship into the sea each time and ask yourself, “How will I make anything ever again?” But I would keep doing them as long as I can.


These films and Poker Face have all been terrific, but have you gotten the urge to take a break from these series and do something stand-alone?  [Holds up a notebook.] I have kind of a stand-alone thing that I'm working on as the next thing. It's not a product of me being sick of murder mysteries. It's just a part of me that felt it would be nice to do something different next. So I'm writing something that's not really in the mystery-mystery genre, and just a standalone thing to do.


Blanc is a tribute to Agatha Christie, among many influences. We've talked about Poker Face being a tribute to Columbo. When you come up with an idea that's a throwback, how do you know when you're bringing enough of an original spin to it that it's not just you doing karaoke?What you just described is hopefully the outcome. But that's not the question I start with. The way that I start is, I do generally have some notion of a genre or a style that would be fun to do. The idea is not that I'm looking at how to freshen it up. I'm looking at something I'm angry about, or thinking about, or wrestling with. Something I'm deeply caring about, and I can dive deeply into using this other thing as a delivery device. It's when the gears come together that the process actually starts. That ultimately is my answer. It's the only way I know how to do it. If it's coming from a personal place, and really genuinely wanting to explore something beyond the style of the genre, then that's the way to make it fresh. 

	











In terms of the thing you're angry about, the first two Blanc films deal a lot with income inequality, and how rich people take advantage of people who don't have anything. Was that an intention with the series?It just kind of happened each time. Stating for me what that thing is, I would never want to just say that, because it would sound very boring. I think what you're describing is true, but it's not the thing that got the film going for me. It has to be something personal, and I don't think I could sit down in the abstract, get angry, and write about the abstract notion of class divide in society.


Have you ever gotten down the road in the development process and realized that what you were doing was too much pastiche and not enough that was new?I've never hit that wall exactly that way. But right after I made Looper, I spent several years trying to crack this sci-fi idea that I had. Ultimately could not make it work. I never really got those gears I described to connect. So it just felt like a high concept that didn't have any innards. But elements of that ended up working their way into the thing that I'm developing next. So, everything comes around.


Three years passed between Brick and The Brothers Bloom, four years after that until Looper, five years from Looper to Last Jedi. Were there reasons for those big gaps?  One of the things I'm trying to get better at is to just write faster. With Star Wars, it was a different thing. I had started exploring my own stuff, and then Star Wars came around, and the prep and writing period was long. But with Bloom and Looper, I'm just a slow writer, just taking several years to write a script. I don't do that anymore. I think that's a good thing. Getting less precious about the process and getting a bit more “sit down and do it” has been healthy. And also, as you get older, you realize time is the most valuable commodity, and who knows how long I'll be able to get things made, so I should take advantage of it while I can. 


What is your media consumption like at home? How much do your tastes overlap with Karina's [Johnson is married to film critic Karina Longworth, host of the Hollywood history podcast You Must Remember This] and how much are the choices one for you, and then one for her?We overlap a lot. Karina and I, we only watch stuff that we overlap with together. I've definitely learned the stuff that she's not into, not to sit down and try to make the case for it. One of the keys to a happy marriage is to watch that stuff on my own. But with Karina's podcast, it's amazing for me. Every night, when she's in research mode, it's like film school. 

	











What are the kinds of things you've learned to watch without her?She's not a big genre person. So anything very sci-fi or fantasy, or anything that's too nerdy, I watch on my own.


A lot of successful directors start out with a film noir, because it's easy to do on a small budget. Is that how Brick came about?I don't know that I was smart enough to make that calculation, although it worked out. Brick ended up being first. When I wrote it, I had just really gotten into Dashiell Hammett's books. I was in my early twenties, and memories of high school were looming large. So the emotional memory of high school, combined with the raw power of these books I tried to get made for the next seven years, and wrote several other things, but none of them were that good. So I kept coming back to Brick, and that ended up being the first one. 


With Brothers Bloom, you're working with a bigger budget, bigger stars — Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel Weisz. What was that experience like?That was one of the best experiences of my life. I had been broke and stuck in L.A. throughout my twenties, so I wrote a big adventure in order to have a big adventure. And I loved con-man movies. It was me trying to fit a tomato into a matchbox — “OK, I get to make another movie,” and trying to fit everything into that. It was an incredibly romantic experience. We were a traveling circus ,rolling around eastern Europe with these lovely movie stars making this crazy, insane thing. And then nobody saw it, really. And I should have been in movie jail for a long time. But my producer, Ram Bergman, figured out how we could get Looper made. 


What do you take out of the experience of having a great time making a movie that then gets ignored? What I took out of that moment was panic: “Ah, shit, did I just blow it? Am I going to be able to make something again?” What it maybe translated into with Looper, was, I really wanted to put the screws to myself, discipline-wise. I wanted to go back to more of a hard genre thing. I had this story based on this short that I had written, and I had this emotional thing that was resonant with me. I spent a lot of time rewriting it. In the writing phase, it was the opposite of being indulgent. 


Bruce Willis, before he got sick, had a reputation of being strong-willed in his interactions with his directors. What was he like with you? The way that we got Looper made was Bruce said yes. We had Bruce Willis with a gun in a sci-fi movie. That got us our financing. I had heard all the stories, too. And then he showed up on set, and I have never had a better experience with an actor. He was lovely, he worked his ass off on it. He really, really worked hard. He wouldn't even go back to his trailer in between takes. He hung out on set. We never moved faster on set than when we were shooting with Bruce. It was the opposite of this image of him. I'm not saying the other stuff isn't true. But I got very, very lucky. And I just had wonderful memories.

	











With Last Jedi, there was a popular conception that you and J.J. Abrams didn't really talk, which is why certain ideas get undone from one movie to the next. What was your actual level of communication with him?  We communicated. We met and I spent days with him and was able to get into his head and all the choices he had made. That having been said, I communicated and I went and made the movie. And he was in the middle of Force Awakens. Ultimately, I feel like the choices in it, none of them were born out of an intent to “undo” anything. They were all borne out of the opposite intent of, how do I take this story that J.J. wrote, that I really loved, and these characters he created that I really loved, and take them to the next step? Kathy [Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm] said, “We're looking at someone to do the Empire [Strikes Back] of this series.” I took that assignment very seriously. Maybe more seriously than someone would have liked. I guess to me that didn't mean making something that just had nods to Empire — that meant trying to genuinely do what Empire did. 


But just to use an example, Force Awakens sets up Snoke as the big villain of the new trilogy, with a mysterious backstory. And then midway through Last Jedi, Kylo Ren slices him in two and takes over the First Order.That was, in reading J.J.'s script, and watching the dailies, and seeing the power of Adam Driver's character. The interrogation scene in the first movie, between Rey and Kylo, was so incredibly powerful. Seeing this complicated villain that's been created, I was just so compelled by that. This is all a matter of perspective and phrasing, but to me, I didn't easily dispense with Snoke. I took great pains to use him in the most dramatically impactful way I could, which was to then take Kylo's character to the next level and set him up as well as I possibly could. I guess it all comes down to your point of view. I thought, “This is such a compelling and complicated villain. This is this is who it makes sense going forward to build around.”


That movie has some of my absolute favorite moments, visuals, and sequences in all of Star Wars. The throne room fight. The Holdo Maneuver. Luke brushing the dust off his shoulder. What was it like for you, as someone who loved Star Wars, to get to play in that sandbox for a little while and get to make things like that?It was insane. I feel like it's hard to even describe how the process was, and getting to work with all those folks at ILM [Industrial Light & Magic, George Lucas' visual effects company], getting to have access to the archive. Everything from it, top to bottom. If you're a Star Wars fan, it was the dream you imagine it would be. There was no, “Yes, but…” to it. It was just magical.

	











There was talk for a while of you being involved with the third movie. And then you weren't. What was the timeline on that relative to you working on Last Jedi? Was that decision made before that film was done or after?I think we must have been wrapping up. But also, to be clear, we had never put our names in the hat. We never were anticipating doing a third one. It was nothing we were pitching ourselves for, and [Kennedy] made the decision. 


The reason I ask is that some people have suggested you thought you might get to do both, and when you discovered that you wouldn't, you decided to squeeze every idea you ever had for Star Wars into this one film.No, absolutely not. The reality is, if I thought I was doing both of them, I would have ended it the same way. From the very start, the assignment was doing [film number] eight, and another director would do nine. I didn't know it would be J.J. But the whole thing was being the middle leg of the race. 


Where did the idea for doing the Holdo Maneuver come from?It came from A New Hope. It was always in my head, when Han tells Luke that without the right calculations they could fly into a star, “and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?” I thought, “Well, if that's physically possible, what would that look like?” It seemed like something that was low-hanging fruit to me in a way. But I knew that if we were going to use it, we have to use it in a very big way; this can't be a casual thing that happens this week. We should build the whole Return of the Jedi-esque three plotlines converging thing around this moment.


In Rise of Skywalker, there's a scene where someone asks why they don't just do the Holdo Maneuver with an unmanned ship, and someone else says that's a million-to-one shot that will never work again. There are a few other things like that in the film, including undoing the idea that Rey was a nobody, and instead is Palpatine's granddaughter. When you saw the movie, or when you learned that they were doing some of those things, how did you feel about that?When I saw the movie, I had a great time watching it. Again, this is all about point of view. I never approach this as, like, a territory I'm carving out for my thing. In my perspective, J.J. did the same thing with the third that I did with the second, which is not digging it up and undoing — just telling the story the way that was most compelling going forward. That means not just validating what came before, but recontextualizing it and evolving and changing as the story moves forward. I didn't feel resentful in some way. But you're talking about a movie made by my friends, with my friends in it. I sit down to watch a movie, and it's a Star Wars movie. It's all stuff I love. I'm not the one to come to for a hard-hitting critique. You can go to YouTube for that. 

	











Speaking of which, Last Jedi was a big hit. It was critically acclaimed at the time. But because there is some subset of some unknown size that is really, really mad online about it, that then becomes the dominant narrative about the movie. What do you remember as that backlash was happening? How did that feel for you to be witnessing it?In the moment, it's a complicated chain of reactions to it. It never feels good to have anybody coming after you on the Internet, and especially coming after you saying things that I think I very much do not agree with about a thing I made and put a lot of heart and soul into. But at the same time, having grown up a Star Wars fan ultimately let me contextualize it and feel at peace with it in many different ways. Just remembering, going back on one level to arguing on the playground about Star Wars as a kid. And I was in college when the prequels came out. My friends and I were Prequel Hate Central. Everyone was ruthless at the time. And of course now the prequels are embraced. I'm not saying that as a facile, “Oh, things will flip around in 20 years, you'll see!” It's more that this push and pull, and this hatred to stuff that seems new, this is all part of being a Star Wars fan. Culture-war garbage aside, I think that essential part of it is a healthy part.


What happened with the other Star Wars trilogy there were talks of you doing?Nothing really happened with it. We had a great time working together, and they said, “Let's keep doing it.” I said, “Great!” I would kick ideas around with Kathy. The short version is Knives Out happened. I went off and made Knives Out, and was off to the races, busy making murder mysteries. It's the sort of thing if, down the line, there's an opportunity to do it, or do something else in Star Wars, I would be thrilled. But right now I'm just doing my own stuff, and pretty happy.


How far did you get in terms of an idea? Was there a whole thing mapped out, at least for what the first of those would be?It was all very conceptual. I made Knives Out fairly quickly after. There was never any outline or treatment or anything. 


Are there certain kinds of movies that you have not yet made that you would like to make?Yeah, absolutely. I would love to do a musical at some point. I am a big musical fan. Any kind of movie I haven't made yet, I would like to make. It's little bit of one book opening another. It's not like I have a drawer full of genre ideas. It's really whatever I'm into at the moment, feeding whatever comes next. 

	











Years before you made Poker Face, you directed a few hours of TV as a hired gun, including a Terriers episode, and three Breaking Bad episodes, one of which — “Ozymandias,” the one that begins with Walt, Jesse, and Hank in the desert with the neo-Nazis — is considered by many to be the best episode of dramatic TV ever made. What was that like? It was bliss. To not have to write? To just be handed a great script by Moira Walley-Beckett, or Sam Catlin? Leslye Headland wrote the Terriers episode I did. I genuinely loved it, but I was also being handed some of the best scripts ever written for television. 


What was your reaction when you first read the “Ozymandias” script?“Holy shit!” Both in terms of what happens in the script, but also, “Are you sure Vince [Gilligan, Breaking Bad creator and sometime director] doesn't want to do this one?” I was very shocked. I felt like I had been handed a massive amount of responsibility. I knew what this was in terms of the series, and I really wanted to get it right for them.

We could talk all day about all the things that happen in that one, so let's stick to one sequence. What do you remember about the scenes at Walt's house — both the fight with Skylar and then him driving away with the baby?  I planned it out very, very carefully, because of the stunt work, and blocked it out with everybody. We had talked it out with Moira, the big emotional beats that we wanted to hit. The big moment for me is when Skylar says, “No.” The moment of getting the blocking right so she's stopping Walter Jr. and putting her hand out, or reaching for the knife instead of the phone. They were born out of things on the page that jumped out as, “Those are big things, and I want to carve them out.” On a TV schedule, you have to really pick your battles. So there aren't things you can find on the day you have to show up thinking, “We're going to take the time to set the camera to 48 frames a second and get this little moment.” But I remember having a lot of fun with the stunt stuff, I remember a lot of laughter and fun when we were shooting that. You kind of have to, when you're doing something that heavy. But the opposite of that is, when you're outside, there were some logistics with the car. The big thing was the moment with Anna [Gunn, who played Skylar] when she comes out and has her breakdown. That, for me, was just incredible to see Anna get to that place, and accomplish it. There was a freak hailstorm when we were shooting that, and we had to wait for the hail to end before we could shoot this thing. And Anna was in a holding room, on ice, which is hard for an actor. And she had to build herself back up. It's one of those rare things where, as a director, to witness an artist do that, and see the finished result of it, it was amazing.

	











Since then, you made Last Jedi, three Knives Out films, two seasons of Poker Face. Did any opportunities like that come to you that you had to turn down because you were doing these other things? Did Vince and Peter [Gould] want you to direct a Better Call Saul?  Saul. I was really bummed. I was just too busy. There was a moment where my buddies Dan [Weiss] and Dave [Benioff] were doing Game of Thrones. They usually shoot those in blocks, so it's a commitment of six months or something. But there was one stand-alone episode, and there was a moment where I was like, “Oh, could that work?” And then it didn't. There's heartbreaks that come along now and then. But again, who knows long long I'll be able to do what I'm doing?

					By Jake Kanter 

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: When the BBC screened Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone in February, there were hopes that the film would win awards. Fast forward six months, and the BBC will next week publish a delayed investigation into how the documentary descended into disaster.


	Peter Johnston, the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, has examined what led to How to Survive a Warzone being narrated by the child of a Hamas minister, without this crucial fact being declared to audiences. The film, which was an unsparing portrayal of the chaos in Gaza from the perspective of three young people, was later removed from iPlayer.

					BBC Tells 'MasterChef' Host Gregg Wallace: Your Conduct Is Threat To Safety Of Co-Workers		
			








	Sources familiar with the review said Johnston had been forensic, with the expectation being that his findings will be chastening for the BBC, even though the corporation has been accused of marking its own homework. He will ultimately determine whether editorial rules were broken and lay the groundwork for disciplinary action.




			Watch on Deadline		







How to Survive a Warzone was produced by Hoyo Films, an independent production company run by Emmy and BAFTA-winning filmmaker Jamie Roberts. Overseeing the film for the BBC were Joanna Carr, head of current affairs, and commissioning editors Gian Quaglieni and Sarah Waldron.


	Two sources told Deadline that some, if not all, of the individuals embroiled in the review have lawyered up as Johnston readies his findings. Johnston, a close ally of director-general Tim Davie, has gone through the process of Maxwellisation, a practice that gives individuals the opportunity to respond to criticisms made in an official report.

	











	Deadline hears that the “quasi-legal” process has not been straightforward, with competing narratives needing to be considered. The BBC initially blamed Hoyo for failing to declare English-speaking narrator Abdullah Al-Yazouri's Hamas links, but later acknowledged that it should have done more to establish this fact. More detail is also expected on payments made during production and whether any money fell into the hands of Hamas.


	“Everyone feels like they could be the fall guy,” a source said of the febrile mood. Two people said those affected do not wish to be named in the final report. It is not yet clear if Johnston will honor this wish. His last review, which examined misconduct allegations against Russell Brand, only referenced job titles.


	A BBC source said: “It's obviously difficult for all involved. Peter is trying to run a proper process. It's really important we establish the facts and the process is fair to those involved.”


	Davie told BBC staff on June 11 that the How to Survive a Warzone review was “days” away, but these days ultimately turned into more than a month. Johnston will now publish in the same week as an investigation into ex-MasterChef host Gregg Wallace and the BBC's annual report.


	The BBC has faced huge pressure from Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to finalize and publish the report, but the corporation has been led by the process rather than politicians. Nandy has openly questioned why nobody has been fired over the debacle, with one source saying that she is “looking for a scalp.”


	Johnston's findings will also be closely scrutinized beyond Westminster. A group of 45 Jewish television executives, including former BBC content chief Danny Cohen and J.K. Rowling's agent Neil Blair, wrote to the BBC with a plethora of questions about the failings on How to Survive a Warzone. The BBC has also come under pressure from Palestinian sympathizers, including Gary Lineker, Riz Ahmed, and Ken Loach, who have described the decision to remove the film from iPlayer as “censorship.”


	The BBC has, in some ways, already pre-empted Johnston's conclusions. BBC chair Samir Shah said the incident was a “dagger to the heart” of the corporation's impartiality and trustworthiness. “I have a worry that it wasn't so much the processes that were at fault but that people weren't doing their job,” Shah added. The coming days should reveal if Shah's concerns were well founded.

The American Idol champ will do a rotating Kellyoke cover every night, and she chose a Dolly Parton-written Whitney Houston classic for her debut.

Kelly Clarkson kicked off her brand-new Las Vegas residency “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on Friday night (July 11) — one week later than planned.


	After postponing the original opening weekend dates of July 4 and 5 due to rehearsals taking “a toll” on her famous voice, Clarkson delivered on her promise to fans to bring “the studio to the stage” for the new residency. The stage setup brought the audience inside exactly what it's like to be a fly on the wall in a Clarkson recording session.


	“Studio Sessions” isn't Clarkson's first turn as a Las Vegas headliner. After a no-go in 2020 for the 18-date “Invincible” residency due to the pandemic, she finally made it to the stage of PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in 2023 with the sold-out “Chemistry” engagement. The show kicked off on July 28, 2023, and was initially scheduled for 10 dates. However, it expanded to 14 dates with the addition of performances over the New Year's Eve holiday of that year and the 2024 Super Bowl.


	In 2020, she told Billboard that Las Vegas represented an excellent opportunity for her. “I'm able to do things with [a residency] that I've never been able to carry out on the road,” she says. “We get to stay for a bit, see and hang with fans, and then you're not having to travel every night to a different city, which can be exhausting. I'm stoked to have a home away from home [in Vegas].”


	Recently, she teased fans with an ultra-glam Sin City look, wearing a plunging sequin jumpsuit accented in feathers, for the “Where Have You Been” video, channeling fellow Las Vegas headliner Cher.


	“I've always loved performing in Las Vegas and the high energy of the crowds. Musicians from every genre of music, young and old, rookies and legends—it has become this fantastic city filled with artists from everywhere. So many of my musical idols have had, and still have, incredible residencies on the Strip, and I'm so excited to create my own,” Clarkson says. 


	There are 16 performances of “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” scheduled through Nov. 15, with new dates for the postponed July 4-5 shows yet to be announced. In the 23 years since she won American Idol, Clarkson has sold more than 25 million albums and 40 million singles worldwide. In addition to three Grammy Awards, she has multiple Daytime Emmys on the mantle for her six-season Kelly Clarkson Show.


	A highlight of Friday night's debut came during the second-to-last song of the night, when Clarkson introduced a rotating Kellyoke cover — named after the wildly popular performance segment from her daytime talk show — this time performing the Dolly Parton-penned “I Will Always Love You” in the style of Whitney Houston's 1992 The Bodyguard soundtrack version.


	Here's a look at Clarkson's full opening-night setlist for “Kelly Clarkson: Studio Sessions” at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.

Bryan Cranston issued a statement on Friday evening, addressing the financial situation surrounding his (hypothetically) upcoming new indie film Lone Wolf. The movie (which co-stars Oscar nominee Lily Gladstone) reportedly ran into financial troubles a few weeks back, and while Cranston notes in his new comments that he was paid for his work on the film, upon learning that its co-stars and crew weren't, he's given an ultimatum to producers: Pay everybody, or he won't return to finish filming the movie.

Helmed by Arlington Road director Mark Pellington, Lone Wolf stars Cranston as a shadowy type who recruits Gladstone's character to engineer the death of a public official. The film reportedly had about $2 million in funding fall through, causing several people working on it to not get paid. “Man, what a mess,” Cranston wrote in a statement he gave to Deadline this week, noting that, although not a producer on the film, he was “distressed” that the situation has “caused so much grief and distrust, and so sorry that this crew (which was fantastic) were not treated with the respect they deserved.” He also stated, bluntly, that “I (and I think I speak for Lily as well) will not do anything to promote the film until every cast and crew member is paid back in full, and we will not appear on screen again (ie return to filming) for this movie until that happens.” Lone Wolf reportedly requires at least a few more days of shooting with both Cranston and Gladstone in order to be completed.

Deadline notes that, while funding hiccups aren't that rare in indie movie-making, having it happen on a movie with several big-name stars, and a director with a long pedigree in Hollywood film, is much more rare. Co-stars on the movie include O'Shea Jackson Jr., Jennifer Ehle, Chet Hanks, and Spencer Garrett.  The film has reportedly been facing financial problems from the jump; its original production company, Yale Productions, recently filed for bankruptcy, and the movie faced a multi-day Do Not Work order from SAG-AFTRA after an earlier failure to make payments.

Night one of Drake's R&B-themed performance at Wireless Festival included melodies, deep cuts and legends.

	Carl Lamarre



	With Iceman season fast approaching, Drake is primed and ready to kick off another album worthy of anticipation and hype, especially after the release of his new single “What Did I Miss?” But, on Friday night (July 11), fans at the U.K. Wireless Festival didn't get the mischievous, revenge-plotting Drake looking to avenge his losses. Instead, they received a Drake who was keen on celebrating his R&B heroes, his OVO comrade PARTYNEXTDOOR, and day-one fans who have always appreciated the melodic side of Heartbreak Drake.


	“This is the first time in my life that I've done three different shows on three different days,” Drake told the crowd during his performance. “You came to a very special night. It's night one. It's a celebration of all things R&B. All things melodies. All classics.”


	Along with Drake headlining three nights of Wireless, Friday's outing wasn't just a highlight reel featuring The Boy and Friends; it served as a thriving garden for R&B artists from the States and across The Pond. The U.K.'s shining stars like KWN and Nippa treated the day as a homecoming, while Summer Walker and Leon Thomas demonstrated their performance prowess and elite status in the genre. The guest list ran deep, with surprise appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, Kehlani and more, making day 1 a dreamscape for R&B purists.


	Check out the best moments from Drake's R&B-themed night 1 at Wireless Festival. Plus, stay tuned for more coverage of Drake's day 2 and 3 performances, along with special surprises.




	As Leon Thomas continues to have an impressive 2025 campaign, courtesy of his top 15 Billboard Hot 100 single “Mutt,” the R&B polymath earned a monumental co-sign from his mentor and EZMNY Records label boss Ty Dolla $ign. During a spellbinding set that showcased Thomas' wizardry as a singer and guitarist, it was his mastery of songs like “Not Fair” and “Yes It Is” that truly captivated viewers. Following his sizzling effort, Ty Dolla $ign joined his protégé onstage and boldly declared Thomas as the new “King of R&B.”


	As the U.K. continues to thrive as a breeding ground for burgeoning R&B stars, Nippa and KWN showcased why they are currently the country's brightest exports. Nippa, U.K.'s charming lothario, spoonfed fans hearty servings of smiles and sorrow. He hopscotched between songs like the dance-ready “One More” to the brooding ache of “Unfair.” KWN's intensity was just as edgy, especially when she called on Kehlani for a steamy sequel of their contagious hit “Worst Behaviour (Remix).”


	The AAPI community is having a banner year in R&B, led by breakout stars Sailorr and Karri. Draped in an all-pink ensemble, Sailorr exuded beauty and poise while staking her claim as one of Florida's Finest. Her set struck a nerve with the heartbroken, who clung to every word of “Down Bad” and “Cut Up.” Meanwhile, Karri, fresh off tour with Isaiah Falls, flew U.K. fans straight to the West Coast with his buttery vocals and laid-back charisma anchoring “3 AM in Oakland.” Together, they're forging a new standard for AAPI excellence in R&B.


	Three years ago, a pregnant and vulnerable Summer Walker burst into tears when fans belted “Session 32” in unison. The now-viral performance not only captured Walker's strength but transformed her vulnerability into a superpower. Fast forward, and the singer ruminated on the pivotal rendition, where she encouraged fans to sing along and relive her transformative moment.


	Before Drake entered center stage, PND kicked their joint headlining set off with gusto. Not only did he break into P4 anthems like “No Chill” and “For Certain,” but he revisited his rookie days, returning to his self-titled debut project and performing “Wus Good / Curious.” Then, once PND strolled into “Come & See Me,” that proved to be the perfect launching pad to introduce Drake.


	As promised, Drake gift-wrapped a slew of classic R&B deep cuts, including “Jungle” and “Feel No Ways.” He didn't skimp on the popular favorites too, using “Marvins Room” and “Passionfruit” as a melodic master class for those unfamiliar with The Boy's emotional depth.


	The OVO tandem introduced a first-ever look at their $ome $exy $ongs 4 U U.K. Tour by giving a crash-course example of their elite chemistry and crowd control. Opening with “CN TOWER,” Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR thrived off the crowd's energy, propelling them to slow-burning songs like “SPIDER-MAN SUPERMAN” before shifting gears to their cultural anthem “SOMEBODY LOVES ME.”


	In true celebratory fashion, Drake called on the R&B cavalry to make the night that much more special. He enlisted Mario and Bobby Valentino for a nostalgic performance of their throwback cuts before calling on Bryson Tiller and GIVEON to inject their energy into the night's smooth vibes. The biggest hero of the night came in the form of Ms. Lauyrn Hill, who wowed the crowd with an electric performance of Fugees' “Ready or Not” before doing a clever mash-up of “Ex-Factor” and Drake's “Nice for What,” a first in both of their careers.

The superstar begins his 30-day stint with a show that celebrates his homeland, his fans & his Billboard 200 No. 1 album Debí Tirar Más Fotos.

	History was in the making on Friday night (July 11) as Bad Bunny launched his wildly anticipated No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí (meaning: I Don't Want to Leave From Here) residency at the legendary Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot (a.k.a. El Choli) in San Juan. The event marked the beginning of his unprecedented 30-show series, making him the first artist to ever headline a residency of this scale at the iconic venue with capacity for 18,000 people.


	The Puerto Rican superstar (real name Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) put on an electrifying show for a euphoric, sold-out audience on opening night, fusing reggaeton, Latin trap and Puerto Rican folk sounds with heartfelt moments honoring his culture — even featuring a quaint Boricua home onstage.


	“Show them from the start where the gladiators were born,” reggaetón pioneer Ivy Queen wrote in Spanish on Bad Bunny's IG post announcing the residency. “Proudly representing from the heart of the neighborhood, where we can vibe to the beat of drums, the bass of a car speaker, or even acapella — we bring the energy anywhere! Historic moment, my pollito stepping up with pride and showing off what it means to be Puerto Rican! That huge Pisces heart is coming through strong! Let's gooooooo!”


	The first three weeks of the residency (July 11–27) are restricted to Puerto Rico residents before opening up to tourists. 


	“[This residency] will position Puerto Rico as a premier entertainment destination,” Jorge L. Pérez, the general manager of Coliseo de Puerto Rico, previously told Billboard Español. “It will open the eyes of visitors who have never come to Puerto Rico. It will create awareness of Puerto Rico as an entertainment and leisure destination.” 


	Planning to come to Bad Bunny's residency? Here's the ultimate travel guide with everything you need to know before you arrive.

	On Friday (July 11), London's Wireless Festival roared back to life for its 20th anniversary. The revered U.K. institution — previously home to luminaries like Jay-Z, Ye, Rihanna, Daft Punk and Bruno Mars — reopened its gates for one of its most beloved guests: Drake.


	Wireless was once Drake's stomping grounds at the onset of his career. He first crossed the pond to headline in 2012 before making a triumphant return in 2015. In 2021, he popped up for a surprise cameo alongside What a Time to Be Alive partner Future. Fast-forward to 2025, and Drake is eyeing an unprecedented trifecta: headlining all three nights of the festival.


	Night 1 served as a full-on love letter to R&B enthusiasts. Drake flexed his vocal stamina while gliding through B-side classics like “Jaded” and “Jungle,” using the night to pay homage to his R&B heroes. Among those hitting the stage, he welcomed millennial heartthrobs Mario and Bobby Valentino for their signature gems. From there, he dipped into the late 2010s to salute Bryson Tiller's TrapSoul era before skating into the 2020s with a soul-stirring medley alongside GIVEON.


	Things heated up when Drake reeled in his $ome $exy $ongs 4 U partner and OVO comrade PARTYNEXTDOOR for a teaser of their forthcoming UK Tour. The duo treated fans to a fistful of highlights ranging from “Somebody Love You” to “SpiderMan Superman,” before Drake tagged in R&B icon Lauryn Hill for a special mash-up of “Ex Factor” and “Nice for What.”

      Submission Statement
    


      The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released a series of previously undisclosed documents confirming multiple drone incursions over the Pantex Plant in Amarillo, Texas—a facility that plays a critical role in the nation's nuclear weapons program. The records, released as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed by The Black Vault on January 16, 2024, reveal significant security concerns dating back at least two years, including incidents in 2022 and 2023 that were not previously made public.
    


      The FOIA request sought all records, including photos, videos, reports, and internal communications related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), or Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) over Pantex. It also specifically requested any communications between Pantex and the U.S. government's UAP Task Force (UAPTF) or the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO).
    


      The Pantex Field Office, along with its Management and Operating (M&O) contractor PanTeXas Deterrence, LLC, identified seven responsive records. Among them were internal reports that detailed two distinct drone incursions—one occurring in October 2022 and another in June 2023. Both incidents were classified as “Management Interest (AMI)” level security concerns.

Terror takes the stage as found footage franchise finds a new form of horror


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Things are set to go bump in the night on stage with news that Paranormal Activity is returning to a different kind of theater. According to Variety, a new play inspired by the franchise that began in 2009 is set to scare audiences in a whole new way via a fresh chapter crammed with creaky floorboards and doors slowly closing shut.

Set to arrive in the London West End this winter, Paranormal Activity: A New Story Live on Stage will follow James and Lou, a couple who move from Chicago to London and discover that their new pad has some unwanted tenants residing in it. Naturally, they take the standard approach that the franchise was founded on and set up a handheld camera to pick up whatever it is that's going bump in the night.

Felix Barrett is directing the production, whose previous work includes the critically acclaimed Sleep No More, an immersive experience where the audience wears masks and is allowed to follow the cast of the production. Levi Holloway has penned the play, whose work includes the hair-raising stage play, Grey House. The new show will run at the Ambassadors Theatre for 12 weeks, creepily kicking things off on December 5.

Following the announcement, Barrett gave a statement saying, “From seeing the advertising campaign of the film 20 years ago, where you watched cinema audiences leap out of their chairs in horror, I have long wondered how you could recreate that visceral reaction in a theater setting. How do you bring one of the most frightening films to life? How do you break the inherent safety that a plush West End theater offers? It's been an incredible challenge, and we cannot wait to see how London audiences respond.”

It'll be interesting to see just how the tension can be ramped up on stage, given that the show is inspired by a franchise that depends on only minor alterations in scenes before the ghostly presence makes itself more aggressively known. For now, if you want your bones chilled this weekend, why not take a peek at our ranking of found footage horror films here.

Of all the things it could've been, we did not expect this answer!

This story contains spoilers for Resident Alien Season 4, Episode 6, "Soul Providers."

Of all the answers Resident Alien could have given us with regards to why the Greys abduct human babies, we did not expect the revelation provided in Season 4, Episode 6, "Soul Providers."

Watch new episodes of Resident Alien Fridays at 11/10c on USA Network.

Following his mysterious disappearance from the diner last week, Harry Vanderspeigle (Alan Tudyk) is brought before the Galactic Housing Council, which charges him with several cosmic crimes, including the theft of the Hawthornes' infant daughter from the Greys' secret base on Earth's moon. According to the plaintiff, the child was an "essential" part of SHP, or the "Soul Harvesting Program," which is exactly what it sounds like.

The Greys have created a thriving industry around the collection of souls — defined as "an immaterial consciousness with quantum correlation that gains it eternal life" — from humans because we are the only species in the universe to produce them. Baby souls make for the best product because of their "purity, untouched by life's experiences," goes the explanation.

A rather beautiful sentiment... until you realize what that spiritual energy is used for.

The Greys abduct human children and harvest their souls not to gain eternal life, but to turn the coveted substance into an anti-wrinkle cream that also doubles as a "savory dipping sauce."

It's the kind of brilliant, sci-fi anticlimax you'd expect from a passage in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books. A metaphysical question our species has debated for centuries is both answered and completely and audaciously turned on its head in the most mundane fashion when placed within the context of a vast and uncaring universe. The meaning of existence is 42, and human souls are worth nothing more than a cosmetic commodity.

You gotta love the chutzpah!

Two grey aliens appear in Resident Alien Season 3 Episode 8.

"That was Alan's idea, actually," creator, showrunner, and executive producer Chris Sheridan told USA Insider over Zoom. "It solved some problems because we spent a lot of time trying to figure out, ‘It's gotta be this grand thing! Where are we going with it?' And then Alan pitched, ‘Maybe it's just a wrinkle cream.' It was so funny and honestly so perfect for what it is. All this work and all these abductions for some ridiculous reason seems so fitting for things today. That was Alan's idea, and it was great."

"This show really speaks to me," Tudyk said. "The world that Chris has created... if you set out to create it, you're not gonna get there, or else everybody would. [It's a place] where you can have real interactions between characters and meaningful, touching moments, and actually say something like art should.

"Simultaneously, you can do some of the goofiest, craziest, silliest, most bizarre, gross things," Tudyk added. "It leaves that open because of the alien [element]. They're aliens, and since the beginning, it's always had that ability to go completely [bonkers] because it's all unknown. It's anything, so after reading it, it just struck me, just because I identify with the show and what Chris has created so much. I happened to catch it."

Season 4 of Resident Alien drops new episodes on Fridays on USA Network and SYFY. All episodes will be available to stream exclusively on Peacock one week after they air.

The USA App is the best place to catch up on the most recent season of your favorite shows, watch live TV, and stream movies.

Misha Collins shared that he and Jensen Ackles did an in-character take as Supernatural's Castiel and Dean while filming The Boys Season 5.



In honor of the 20th anniversary of Supernatural, Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Misha Collins took part in an extended retrospective interview with TV Insider and a video featurette where they addressed a number of fans' questions. While the entire conversation is definitely worth a watch, it was their responses to working together on the fifth and final season of Prime Video and Showrunner Eric Kripke's The Boys that hit our radar. Based on what Collins had to share at one point, it sounds like Ackles and Collins had a moment to slip back into Dean and Castiel mode in front of the cameras – but it might not see the light of day?!?

Beginning at around the 4:10 mark in the video above, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins discuss what it was like reuniting in front of the camera for the final season of the Prime Video series. As Ackles saw it, there wasn't much of an adjustment that needed to be made since the trio still talked and saw each other on a regular basis. Padalecki noted that his biggest concern, "having not really acted in a year, was that I didn't remember how to act (with Ackles following up with a joke). In terms of being able to differentiate Ackles and Collins from their Supernatural characters while filming The Boys, Padalecki credited the writers and the dialogue being so different from what their previous characters would say that it made things easier.

But before the trio moved on to the next question, Collins dropped an interesting tidbit that we're pretty sure Supernatural fans are going to (politely) demand be released to the public. "You know, we did on 'The Boys' end up doing a take in character as Cass and Dean," Collins shared. "And that, that's probably the one they're going to use." Though Ackles wasn't sounding so sure, smiling as he responded, "Look for that on the editing room floor. That's where that will be."
