                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu came from 3-1 down in both sets to defeat Jaqueline Cristian in the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva first round. 8 seed Emma Raducanu withstood a stern test from Jaqueline Cristian to advance to the second round of the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva 6-3, 6-4 in 2 hours and 2 minutes. The Briton, who took a last-minute wild card into the tournament, came from 3-1 down to win both sets. The first-round contest between the pair had originally been scheduled for Tuesday, but postponed to Wednesday due to rain. Raducanu will next face a fellow major champion, Barbora Krejcikova, in another first-time encounter as she bids to return to the quarterfinals for a second straight year. "It hasn't been easy -- I feel like I've played this match for the last three days," Raducanu said in her on-court interview. Cristian came out of the blocks with her forehand on song, and had racked up seven winners to zero for Raducanu by the first changeover. But the statistic from the opening few games that was to set the tone was Cristian's lack of efficiency on big points versus Raducanu's ability to lock in when she needed. Moreover, Cristian was unable to to translate her glut of winners into any real momentum thanks to 38 unforced errors outweighing them over the course of the match. All but one game of the first set went to at least one deuce, and as Raducanu gradually reeled Cristian in that one straightforward game proved crucial: a break of Cristian's serve to go 5-3 up, courtesy of two double faults and two sprayed forehand errors. The second set played out in a similar fashion. But from 2-0 down, Raducanu found her best tennis of the day. Her forehand had been erratic for much of the first set, but in the second it clicked with a series of superb winners from that wing. At 4-4, Cristian threw in another game full of cheap mistakes, and Raducanu closed out victory after saving one break point in the final game with another forehand winner. 5 seed Diana Shnaider joined Raducanu in the second round on Wednesday. Shnaider had split sets with qualifier Caty McNally when play was halted the previous day, but took control of the decider to advance 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, despite needing five match points to seal victory. 6 seed Haddad Maia also had to battle to close out her match against Korean wild card Back Dayeon, who made a late charge from 5-0 down in the second set to 5-3 before Haddad Maia sealed a 6-4, 6-3 win on her third match point. 7 seed Sofia Kenin for the second time in 2025 to reach her second WTA 500 quarterfinal of the season, needing just 63 minutes to race past the American 6-3, 6-1. 3 seed Clara Tauson defeated Eva Lys 6-2, 7-6(4) to make her seventh quarterfinal of 2025, holding off a late charge by the German after serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set. Emma Raducanu came from 3-1 down in both sets to defeat Jaqueline Cristian in the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva first round.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has been a testing 2025 so far for Shang Juncheng, but the #NextGenATP star did not disappoint upon returning to action in front of his home fans at the Chengdu Open. Shang, who did not compete from January until late July due to a foot injury on which he underwent surgery in March, dug deep to hold off the World No. The lefty saved six of seven break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during a gutsy performance in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Bergs. At the venue where he became the first Chinese player to win an ATP Tour title on home soil a year ago, Shang did not show much visible emotion upon closing out his win nor while embracing Bergs at the net. Yet he later wore a beaming smile throughout the on-court interview that followed his hard-earned win. A competitor at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Shang remains 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, although he could rise as high as eighth by successfully defending his Chengdu crown. His next test at the hard-court event in Sichuan province is a second-round meeting with fourth seed Brandon Nakashima. Another Chinese #NextGenATP wild card, Zhou Yi, also enjoyed a memorable start to his Chengdu campaign by upsetting World No. His next opponent will be Christopher O'Connell, after the Australian downed Quentin Halys 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-4. Marcos Giron also secured a second-round spots on Day 1 in Chengdu. Giron eased past his fellow American Ethan Quinn 7-5, 6-4 and will next face eighth seed Lorenzo Sonego or Juan Manuel Cerundolo.

Ukraine advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals for the first time in its history after winning both singles matches against five-time champion Spain on Wednesday. In the first quarterfinal match, Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk, ranked No. 26, came from a break down in the first set to defeat No. Bouzas Maneiro broke early to lead 3-1, but the 23-year-old Ukrainian rallied to win the set in a tiebreak. Svitolina beats Badosa in three sets to clinch the tie In the second singles match, Spain's Paula Badosa, playing her first match since Wimbledon after a recurring back injury, claimed a tight first set 7-5 over Elina Svitolina to keep Spain's hopes alive. The victory avenged Ukraine's only other meeting with Spain in the competition — a 3-1 defeat in a 2013 World Group II tie. Ukraine will next face another five-time champion, Italy, which defeated Japan 2-0 in Tuesday's first quarterfinal. The remaining quarterfinals are scheduled for Thursday: Kazakhstan vs. the United States and Great Britain vs. Japan. They will now face Italy in the semifinals, while other quarterfinal matches are yet to be played.</p>
