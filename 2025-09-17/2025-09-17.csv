            As Britain's royal family welcomed US President Donald Trump to Windsor Castle in a lavish ceremony on Wednesday, the British public gave the American leader their own – markedly less friendly – response to his presence in their country.
    


            In an altogether different kind of greeting, Brits have carried out demonstrations against the president over the last couple of days, though UK authorities have been keen to keep Trump away from any sign of public criticism.
    


            Recent polling has shown that Britons generally disapprove of Trump. A poll published Tuesday by Ipsos found that 61% of Britons say they do not like the US leader.
    


            The anti-Trump demonstrations kicked off on Tuesday evening, shortly after he touched down at London's Stansted Airport and made his way to Winfield House, the official residence of the US ambassador to the UK, in the center of the capital city.
    


            Some 25 miles away, activist group Led By Donkeys projected footage of Trump alongside convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto the side of Windsor Castle, where the president was set to commence his state visit the next day.
    


            “Hey Donald, welcome to Windsor Castle,” the group said in an Instagram post of the stunt. It also posted a video of a timeline of interactions between the president and the late sex offender, calling it, “The story of Trump and Epstein.”
    


            Four men were arrested on suspicion of “malicious communications” in connection to the demonstration, police said.
    


            A spokesperson for Led By Donkeys said in a statement that it was the first time in the group's history that any of its activists had been arrested for taking part in demonstrations involving projections, Britain's PA Media news agency reported.
    


            On Wednesday, as Trump traveled to Windsor, protests against the US leader took place in London.
    


            Critics pointed out that local authorities were keen to shield the president from any public admonishment, keeping all scheduled events behind closed doors amid heavy security.
    


            On Thursday, Trump will again steer clear of the British public, traveling to Chequers, the prime minister's official country house northwest of London, for talks with Keir Starmer.
    


            While Trump was having lunch with royals in Windsor on Wednesday afternoon, demonstrators began to gather in the British capital, brandishing signs and flags with slogans opposing the US leader, including “dump Trump,” “stop Trump” and others featuring expletives.
    


            Some demonstrators came dressed as figures including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate, holding signs including “war criminals for Trump,” “murderers for Trump” and “misogynists for Trump.”
    


            Many at the protest also wielded signs that relate to specific political topics Trump has waded into, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and Israel's war in Gaza.
    


            “We're here for broad reasons, because the politics that Donald Trump represents, politics of racism, the politics of division and hatred, politics that puts profit before the planet… are the absolute antithesis of the politics that we represent and that we're campaigning for,” Ben Jamal, the director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, told CNN at the protest on Wednesday.
    


            London Mayor Sadiq Khan mirrored this sentiment in an op-ed published by The Guardian on Tuesday, accusing him of “fanning the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world” and calling on Londoners to reject his “politics of fear and division.”
    


            On Wednesday evening, just as Trump is expected to unwind after finishing a state banquet held in his honor, British television network Channel 4 will broadcast an “unbroken catalogue” of his “untruths and falsehoods,” it has said.
    


            The marathon “Trump v The Truth” screening is programed to air for a total of five hours for people in the UK and will display more than 100 “falsehoods, distortions and inaccuracies uttered or written by the US President since taking office in January,” Channel 4 announced in a press release.
    


            Ian Katz, the chief content officer at Channel 4, said he hopes the day's events will “remind viewers how disorientating and dangerous the world becomes when the most powerful man on earth shows little regard for the truth.”
    


            “And if President Trump cares to watch along after the state banquet, he may even clear up a few misconceptions,” Katz added.

            After her recent win in a civil litigation case, Cardi B is celebrating some personal news.
    


            On Wednesday, the Grammy-winning rapper and artist revealed she is expecting her first child with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, an NFL wide receiver.
    


            “I feel like I'm in a good space,” she told Gayle King in interview with CBS on Wednesday.
    


            “I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, and me and my man, we're very supportive of each other,” she added.
    


Cardi B is bringing her unfiltered self to court and it's drawing a crowd



            The news comes as she has been involved in a contentious divorce with fellow rapper Offset, whom she married in September 2017.
    


            They share three young children and have separated multiple times over the course of their relationship.

            “I mean, like, two weeks ago I was literally having a panic attack. I was, like, crying and crying and crying, just because I was just getting really nervous with you know, the whole album rollout,” Cardi B said. “People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me.”

            A Spirit Airlines pilot was scolded by air traffic control on Tuesday after not immediately responding to a controller's instructions as Air Force One flew about 8 miles away.
    


            The two aircraft were flying parallel over Long Island. Air Force One was flying President Donald Trump to the United Kingdom and Spirit Flight 1300 was flying passengers from Fort Lauderdale to Boston Logan International Airport.
    


            “Spirit 1300, turn 20 degrees right,” the New York Center air traffic controller told the pilot, according to audio captured by LiveATC.net
    


            After five seconds of no response the controller radios again.
    


            “Pay attention, Spirit 1300. Turn 20 degrees right,” he says.
    


            It takes two more attempts to reach the pilot before he responds acknowledging the right turn.
    


            “Spirit 1300 turn 20 degrees right now,” the controller says. “Spirit wings, 1300 turn 20 degrees right immediately.”
    


            Spirit Airlines told CNN in a statement the pilots “followed procedures and Air Traffic Control instructions while en route to Boston… Safety is always our top priority.”
    


            It's not clear why the pilot didn't immediately respond, however pilots are trained to make their first priority to fly the airplane before communicating.
    


            “Spirit 1300, traffic is off of your left wing by eight miles. 747. I'm sure you can see who it is,” the controller says. “Keep an eye out for him, he's white and blue.”
    


            Later after the Spirit pilot did not respond to another radio instruction the controller radioed again.
    


            “I got to talk to you twice every time,” he says. “Pay attention, get off of the iPad.”
    


            The encounter between the two aircraft was first spotted by the account JonNYC on BlueSky.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration did not respond to CNN's request for comment on this incident.

A man has driven a car into the gates of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, in what the agency described as a targeted attack.

The incident occurred at 2:40am local time on Wednesday, the FBI said. No one was injured.

The suspect, identified as Donald Henson of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, retrieved an American flag from his white sedan and threw it onto the damaged gate before fleeing on foot, according to a statement from the agency.

Speaking during a press briefing, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Giordano stated that the agency was treating the incident “as an act of terror against the FBI,” as quoted by ABC News.

The official vowed that the authorities “are going to exhaust every ability we have under the federal law to find, apprehend and prosecute this subject to the fullest extent.”

According to Giordano, there was “some vulgarity” inscribed on the side of the vehicle, though no details as to its contents have been made available. He added, however, that the message was apparently a reference to suicide.

Giordano told reporters that while it was not immediately clear whether or not the suspect was armed, the man had been identified as a former military member and may be dangerous. He clarified that Henson is the registered owner of the sedan in question.

The official suggested that the suspect may recently have been experiencing mental health issues. According to Giordano, Henson had visited the FBI Pittsburgh office within the last few weeks to lodge a complaint which “didn't make a whole lot of sense.”

Influential former Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, is set to become Ottawa's special envoy for Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced.

Freeland, a granddaughter of a Nazi-collaborator who long denied awareness of his past, has long faced scrutiny over extensively documented evidence that her grandfather edited a Nazi propaganda newspaper during World War II, before he emigrated to Canada.

In a statement on Tuesday, Carney said that Freeland, one of the most prominent figures in Canadian politics for over a decade, who also held posts of International Trade Minister, Foreign Minister, and Transport Minister, has been offered a newly created job of Canada's Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, in addition to her responsibilities as an MP.

”Chrystia is truly uniquely positioned for this timely and essential work towards a better future for Ukrainians and peace in Europe,” he said, citing her “deep relationships and understanding of Ukraine and its economy.”

Carney did not provide any details of what Freeland's position would entail.

In a separate statement, Freeland did not comment on her new role, but confirmed that she was leaving the cabinet and is not planning to run in the next election.

Commenting on the announcement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova branded Freeland a “hardcore Russophobe,” adding that her appointment would only exacerbate the crisis in Ukraine.

Her family's troubled legacy is well-documented. Her maternal grandfather, Michael Chomiak, edited the Krakivski Visti newspaper in Nazi-occupied Poland and Austria during WWII. The paper, according to the Los Angeles Holocaust Museum, was controlled by the Nazis and published Nazi propaganda and antisemitic material, including appeals supporting the German-approved SS “1st Galician Division,” composed mostly of ethnic Ukrainians and linked to the massacre of over 100,00 Poles.

For years, Freeland rejected any claims of Chomiak's collaboration with the Nazis as “Russian disinformation,” although Canadian media, including The Globe and Mail, have reported she had known for decades about her grandfather's work.

During her tenure, Freeland also applauded a known Nazi into the Canadian parliament, later denying knowledge that the man could have had the same lineage as her grandfather.

She also clashed with US President Donald Trump, who labeled her a “terrible person” and a “nasty woman.” When Freeland resigned from the cabinet of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December, Trump celebrated the news, saying, “She will not be missed!!!!”

UK police have arrested four people on suspicion of projecting images of US President Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle.

The incident occurred as Trump arrived in Britain for his second state visit on Tuesday evening. The president is scheduled to meet with King Charles III on Wednesday at the Windsor royal residence, west of London, according to Reuters.

The activist group Led by Donkeys claimed responsibility for the stunt, which also involved projecting Trump's 2023 mugshot, taken after he was indicted for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

“We take any unauthorized activity around Windsor Castle extremely seriously. Our officers responded swiftly to stop the projection, and four people have been arrested,” Thames Valley Police Chief Superintendent Felicity Parker said in a statement.

Democrats and some Trump allies have accused the president of covering up the Epstein case, arguing that the disgraced financier kept a client list of powerful people he allegedly trafficked women to.

The FBI and the Justice Department have denied that a list exists, while Trump has said he ended his friendship with Epstein in the 2000s before he was aware of the allegations against him.

BEIJING, September 17. /TASS/. Russia and China have the opportunity to jointly create the foundation for a more equitable world order, Sergey Karaganov, the honorary chairman of the Presidium of the Council for Foreign and Defense Policy (CFDP), told TASS.

""If Russia and China stand together, and especially if India joins us, our countries will become the foundation for a future, relatively peaceful, and more equitable world order,"" he said at the 12th Xiangshan Forum on international security held in Beijing.

According to the expert, Sino-Russian cooperation in the field of security, including military-to-military interaction, ""is developing strongly."" ""De facto allied relations triple Russia's aggregate power and double China's. This is not a case of a simple ‘one-plus-one', together we make ‘six plus eight,'"" he emphasized. ""Therefore, it is necessary to deepen relations, to be extremely careful so that they are preserved and strengthened between the elites and the youth of both countries. Most importantly, we need a shared vision and an understanding of where the world should move.""

Karaganov noted that Russia and China still face an ""acute period"" ahead, during which they will have to overcome the ""residual resistance of the West, its last fierce pushback."" He expressed confidence that, despite this confrontation and the expected ""enormous number of problems,"" Moscow and Beijing will successfully form the foundation for a new type of multilateral international cooperation, particularly because Russian and Chinese cultures are inherently oriented toward mutual interaction based on respect for other countries.

As Karaganov clarified, the strengthening of Russia and China, which use their military potential to maintain peace, ""helps both themselves and everyone else."" ""If we act cautiously and carefully toward each other, this strengthening will benefit both Russia and the People's Republic of China,"" he explained. ""Perhaps, if it were not for the strength of the Soviet Union, the Americans would never have wanted to befriend China. Now China benefits from Russia's strength: we are their most powerful military-strategic rear, and they are our most important economic ally.""

The expert cautioned that, despite the positive trend in Russian-Chinese relations, Moscow and Beijing must remain vigilant. ""We must be attentive to not give external forces, which are very interested in driving Russia and China apart, an opening. First and foremost, this refers to the United States, and to a lesser extent, Europe,"" he concluded.

Delegations from Russia and around 100 other countries have arrived in the Chinese capital Beijing to take part in the 12th Beijing annual Xiangshan Forum on security, to be held on September 17-19. The main theme of this large-scale event is ‘Upholding International Order and Promoting Peaceful Development.' The Xiangshan Forum has been organized annually since 2006 by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Academy of Military Sciences. The event traditionally focuses on international security cooperation in Asia-Pacific and on a global scale. Its main principles are equality, transparency, tolerance and sharing experience.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, September 17. /TASS/. The Ukrainian authorities rejoiced at the killing of US activist Charlie Kirk, who opposed US military aid to the Kiev government, Verkhovna Rada lawmaker Artem Dmitruk said in an opinion piece for TASS.

""The [Ukrainian] government's silence speaks volumes. They do not condemn killings. Sometimes, they rejoice at them, as was the case with Charlie Kirk,"" he said.

Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on September 10 during his speech at the university in Orem, Utah. The activist was a supporter of President Donald Trump and, according to the Associated Press, contributed significantly to his victory in the last presidential election. Kirk has repeatedly opposed American military aid to Ukraine.

The suspect in the murder, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was detained on the evening of September 11. He was handed over to the authorities by his father, who said his son confessed to him what he did. Trump stated he hopes Robinson is convicted and sentenced to death.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BISHKEK, September 17. /TASS/. The Rubezh 2025 command and staff military exercises of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) involving the Rapid Deployment Collective Forces of the Central Asian Region started in Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday, the republic's Defense Ministry announced.

Troops from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Tajikistan as well as operational groups of the CSTO Joint Staff and Secretariat are taking part. According to the Kyrgyz Defense Ministry, the exercise involves some 1,200 troops and 500 pieces of military and special hardware, including aircraft, helicopters, drones and combat motorboats.

""Our countries are facing the common goal of protecting sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability in the CSTO space. The world is an unstable place, and we must be ready for any challenges - from transnational threats to attempts to destabilize the situation in our region,"" Kyrgyz Deputy Defense Minister Erlis Terdikbayev said at the opening ceremony.

For his part, CSTO Secretary General Imangali Tasmagambetov noted that ""the real chance of radical extremist groups penetrating from the Middle East into the southern borders of Central Asia, spreading their ideology in our countries, and involving the youth in terrorist organizations has been the main threat posed to the region.""

The CSTO exercise will take place in the republic from September 17-20. It will mostly focus on practicing the training and engagement of the Rapid Deployment Collective Forces of the Central Asian Region to destroy illegal armed formations in the event of their incursion into a CSTO member state.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Supreme court justice warns poor quality of civics education may lead to lack of understanding

The most senior liberal justice on the US supreme court has questioned whether American citizens know the difference between presidents and kings.

During a conference on civics education in New York on Tuesday, justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the poor quality of civics education means Americans may not be entirely clear on what makes a president different to a monarch.

“Do we understand what the difference is between a king and a president?” Sotomayor asked at the forum hosted by New York Law School. “And I think if people understood these things from the beginning, they would be more informed as to what would be important in a democracy.”

Sotomayor, 71, identified a lack of education around issues as the rule of law, saying not enough people have a basic understanding of the power of the US president and the limits imposed on executive branch authority by the US constitution.

Sotomayor has been a dissenting opinion in many recent supreme court rulings, including the reduction of federal agencies and the termination of officials that are theoretically protected from political influence by Congress.

Sotomayor also issued a dissenting opinion when the court ruled last year that Trump had immunity from prosecution for his part in attempting to overturn the 2020 election results.

“In every use of official power, the president is now a king above the law,” Sotomayor wrote in opposition to the ruling.

In her comments on Tuesday, Sotomayor did not address the contentious political moment that is playing out, critics say, with the executive branch exerting power over a Republican-led Congress.

Recent reports suggest that classroom civics education has become a minefield of educators.

Trump issued two executive orders in January – one titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling”, aimed to restrict certain teachings, and “Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families” focused on school choice.

NBC News reported Sotomayor's comments stressing that school children be educated about government, and she referenced polling suggesting that few young people support democracy.

Without that, “what's left?” she asked.

Surveys have found that some teachers say they now avoid certain controversial topics but are conversely doing more civics instruction, according to a tracker maintained by CivxNow, the advocacy arm of iCivics, an organization that aims to advance civic learning.

Since 2021, 24 states have passed legislation that would add civics courses to high school graduation requirements or devoted additional funding to the subject.

Sotomayor also weighed in on the vivid free US speech debate and the roots of political violence on the same day that US attorney general Pam Bondi clarified remarks made on a podcast that hate speech could be prosecuted under the law as incitement to violence.

“There's free speech and then there's hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society,” Bondi said in an episode of The Katie Miller podcast, referring to the killing of rightwinger Charlie Kirk.

In a lengthy post on X Tuesday, Bondi clarified, writing: “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime.”

But Sotomayor countered: “Every time I listen to a lawyer-trained representative saying we should criminalize free speech in some way, I think to myself that law school failed.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Joel Willett, a Democratic candidate, says he has ‘seen firsthand' how Trump administration is weaponizing the government

A former CIA officer stripped of his security clearance by the Trump administration has announced he's running for Senate as a Democratic candidate to claim Mitch McConnell's long-held Kentucky seat.

Joel Willett launched his candidacy Wednesday, weeks after director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked his clearance as part of a purge targeting 37 current and former intelligence officials.

“I've seen firsthand how the Trump administration and their far-right allies are trying to weaponize the government against anyone who disagrees with them,” Willett said in his announcement. “That just made me more determined to run.”

Following the revocation, Willett faced attacks from Trump-aligned online activists such as Laura Loomer and received death threats, according to his campaign. Gabbard at the time accused those targeted of “politicizing and manipulating intelligence” but provided no supporting evidence for the claims.

But for Willett, the experience has crystallized his concerns about democratic institutions and the treatment of public servants who express dissenting views.

“It's not lost on me that this happened exactly two weeks after my name surfaced as a potential candidate,” Willett said in an early September interview with the Guardian, calling the revocations “a nakedly political act that is intended to silence dissent”.

Willett said it's the Trump administration that's politicizing intelligence agencies, which “is erasing over 100 years of progress on professionalizing our civil service”.

“At the current rate we're going, the country that I swore an oath to will be unrecognizable in five to 10 years,” he said.

The 41-year-old served at the White House situation room after stints with the army, FBI and CIA before leaving government in 2015. He has since worked in the private sector while occasionally criticizing Trump's approach to intelligence agencies, including signing a letter in 2019 calling for Trump's impeachment.

Like other millennial upstarts on the Democratic roster seeking their state's senate seat, including Maine's Graham Platner and Texas' James Talarico, Willett's early messaging hones in on economic inequality. In his campaign launch, he criticized budget legislation that will “transfer $4tn out of much needed government services [and] put it in the pockets of billionaires”.

But he also has his eye on fentanyl addiction, as both his parents battled with the drug and his father died of an overdose in 2019. “Fentanyl didn't care that I worked at the White House,” he said. “It affects all families, truly without fear or favor.”

Willett enters what is sure to be a closely watched race for a seat being vacated by McConnell, who held it for over 40 years, in a state that has voted for Republicans for the senate for the last few decades. But Kentucky in recent years has been friendly to less-ideologically focused lawmakers: voters in the state twice elected Andy Beshear, a Democratic governor, during the Trump era, as well as Republicans Thomas Massie, who is facing the president's wrath in his coming re-election bid, and occasional Trump critic senator Rand Paul.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian soldiers captured a Kenyan citizen serving in the Russian army in Kharkiv Oblast, near the town of Vovchansk, the 57th Motorized Infantry Brigade reported on Sept. 17.

The man, who identified himself as Evans and said he was an athlete in civilian life, said he traveled to Russia as a tourist and was deceived into joining the Russian army.

This case highlights a broader pattern of Russia recruiting foreigners to fight against Ukraine, sometimes through deceptive methods.

""I ended up in Russia without knowing that I had been enlisted in the Russian army. I had never served before,"" Evans said in a video released by the brigade. ""I didn't go to Russia for that.""

According to Evans, the man who hosted him in Russia offered him a ""job"" and gave him documents to sign, which turned out to be a military contract.

""After I signed, he took my passport and phone, saying he would return them. From that moment on, other people came for me. They told me to get in the car,"" he added.

After just a week of basic training, he was sent to a military camp, where Evans described chaotic conditions, with orders shouted while soldiers were grabbed by their clothes.

Fearing for his life, Evans fled to Ukrainian troops, who gave him food and water. He said that if he had returned to the Russian army, he would have been killed.

The man said other recruits also included Russians, Belarusians, Tajiks, and other Africans.

Kenya, an East African nation heavily dependent on Ukrainian grain, has faced food market disruptions since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.

Kenyan President William Ruto has condemned Russia's war against Ukraine, calling it unjust.

Moscow has intensified efforts to expand its influence across Africa through propaganda outlets such as TASS and RT, while also recruiting fighters from the continent. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Aug. 4 that Russian units in Kharkiv Oblast included foreign mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and several African countries.

Russian forces are preparing two more large-scale offensives after three failed campaigns this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News published on Sept. 16.

""They are preparing for two more offensive operations in the fall,"" Zelensky said. ""There were already three of them, and ahead... there are two more heavy offensive campaigns.""

The remarks follow earlier reporting that Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. officials he aims to capture the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine by the end of 2025. According to Reuters' sources, Putin believes his forces are ""winning"" despite limited gains.

Since November 2022, Moscow has gained less than 1% of additional Ukrainian territory, despite its 2025 summer offensive advancing at one of the fastest rates since late 2024.

Zelensky attributed Russian military setbacks to significant manpower and equipment losses.

""They lost because there were a large number of casualties among the personnel and a large number of lost equipment,"" he added. ""What I said to the Europeans and what I said in the White House... the Russians will not be able to take our east.""

Zelensky also dismissed claims that Russia could capture cities like Sumy in the northeast as ""lies and manipulation."" 

Earlier this year, the Russian army opened a new front in Sumy Oblast, seizing several villages in May and June. In early September, Zelensky said the offensive had been ""completely thwarted.""

""I believe that the Russians are doing worse than they expected,"" he added. ""They are doing much worse than they told Putin. He does not know about it.""

The Economist estimated that Russia lost around 31,000 troops between May 1 and July 9, while Ukraine's General Staff puts total Russian losses since the full-scale war in 2022 at roughly 1,100,000.

Zelensky said in August that it would take Russia another four years to fully seize Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine comprised of mostly occupied Luhansk Oblast and partially occupied Donetsk Oblast.

The Ukrainian parliament approved a bill formalizing the institution of a military ombudsman in the second and final reading on Sept. 17.

The new legislation outlines the military ombudsman's rights, tasks, and obligations, as well as rules for submitting complaints and conducting inspections.

The government first presented the position last year to ensure soldiers had a mechanism to report violations of their rights.

After more than three and a half years of Russia's full-scale war, several Ukrainian units have faced accusations of misconduct and abuse within their ranks.

During the second reading, 283 lawmakers supported the bill, with 18 abstaining and none voting against it. The legislation still requires a presidential signature before coming into force.

The military ombudsman ""will be responsible for considering appeals and complaints of service members, providing primary legal assistance, conducting inspections, and investigating violations of the rights of service members and their family members,"" the Defense Ministry said.

According to the law, the ombudsman is appointed by the president for five years and can serve no more than two consecutive terms.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has appointed Olha Reshetylova, formerly a journalist and human rights activist, as the first military ombudsman.

The central bank lowers borrowing costs for the first time since March as U.S. tariffs continue to batter the Canadian economy

The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, bringing it down to 2.5 per cent after three straight holds. Governor Tiff Macklem says the central bank has shifted to worrying more about a slowing economy than high inflation, which provided the rationale for the interest rate move.

Money market traders grew a little more doubtful that October will bring another rate cut as the Bank of Canada news conference wore on and Governor Tiff Macklem made it clear the bank would not provide much forward guidance this time around on the trajectory of future rate moves.

Implied probabilities in overnight index swap markets now suggest a 40-per-cent probability of a rate cut at the bank's next meeting, on Oct. 29, down from about 50 per cent when the rate decision was announced earlier today, according to LSEG data. There's now about a 62-per-cent probability priced into markets of another rate cut coming before 2025 draws to a close.

So if Mr. Macklem is trying to temper further easing expectations, he's finding some success.

Investors must now sit tight for what the U.S. Federal Reserve has to say later today, which is likely to have a much bigger impact on markets overall. In case you're curious, the latest swaps pricing suggests a 95-per-cent probability of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut being announced at 2 p.m. and a 5-per-cent chance of an even bigger, 50-basis-point cut.

“Historically, population growth has evolved pretty smoothly, and so we have sort of certain rules of thumb about what potential growth can be, how many new workers you would expect to be added to the labour market every month. We need to adjust those rules of thumb to the reality that population growth is lower.”

– Mark Rendell

“The way the U.S. has implemented them, the tariffs in place in the Canadian economy are applied to very specific sectors: steel, automobiles, aluminum. You've got Chinese tariffs on canola, pork and seafood. You've now got higher U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber, tariffs on copper. For the rest of the economy, for other sectors, tariffs remain very low, providing your business is compliant with CUSMA. So the impacts are very concentrated in these sectors that have been hit and the services that are servicing those. … Monetary policy is a blunt instrument. We can help the overall economy adjust, but we can't support, we can't target individual sectors. Fiscal policy really is a much better instrument for that.” 

– Nojoud Al Mallees

“The risk for us is that a temporary increase in those prices has knock-on effects to other prices, and then it starts to look like ongoing inflation. From our perspective, now, the fact that the direct effect of the countertariffs has been removed, that takes away the first-round effect, so there won't be a second-round effect. … That has taken off some of the upside risk to future inflation, and that was one of the things that tilted the risks today in favour of cutting the interest rate.”

“As we have for the last couple of meetings, we considered two alternatives: Hold the policy rate where we are, or cut the policy rate. What tipped the balance really in favour of a cut this time was there was a clear sense that the balance of risk had shifted. … The labour market has softened further. The inflation picture hasn't really changed a great deal. … Total CPI inflation came out yesterday at 1.9 per cent. … CPI ex-tax came out 2.4 yesterday. … If you look at our core measures … they remain around 3. If you look under the hood, though, what you can see is that earlier in the year we saw some upward momentum in those core measures. If you look at the more recent monthly readings on the core measures, that momentum has come off.”

– Mark Rendell

 “The reality is tariffs are increasing trade friction with our biggest trading partner and that has efficiency costs. Monetary policy can't undo that. It can't reverse that. What we can do is help the economy adjust while maintaining well-controlled inflation, that's what we're focused on. … We've demonstrated today, if the risks tilt, if the risks shift, we're prepared to take action. And if the risks tilt further, we're prepared to take more action. But we're going to take it one meeting at a time. We are taking a shorter horizon, we're being a little less forward-looking than usual. And we'll make that risk assessment in October, when we get there.”

“From our macro perspective, it's less about individual measures and more about how everything fits together, what the overall macro impact is. And certainly, once we have the budget, we will be assessing the implications of government's plans on the economic outlook, what that means for growth, for inflation and, ultimately, for what we need to do with interest rates.”

Canada shed 66,000 positions in August and the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 per cent – the highest level since 2016, apart from early pandemic years, according to Statistics Canada.Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press

Lower interest rates mean the economy may be headed for trouble.

Central banks cut rates to make it cheaper for companies and people to borrow, which helps stimulate economic activity. It's a shot in the arm when the economy looks anemic.

This latest Bank of Canada rate cut, in particular, signals that the financial pain of tariffs is starting to get real and spread. The unemployment rate is 7.1 per cent, the highest it's been since 2016 outside the pandemic. So far, it's been mostly tariff-sensitive manufacturing sectors and young graduates who've felt the brunt of the weak job market. But that's beginning to change.

Here are four things to weigh to help you manage your finances as economic storm clouds gather:

– Darcy Keith

Here's how economists are reacting to the Bank of Canada's rate decision:

“The relatively neutral tone of the Bank's policy statement suggests that it is not necessarily expecting to cut rates again in October. … Crucially, the Bank dropped the line from its previous policy statement that said “if a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate.” Nonetheless, the Bank reiterated that it will be assessing the extent to which weakness in exports “spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending,” how “trade disruptions are … passed on to consumer prices” and “how inflation expectations evolve.” That leaves the door to another interest rate cut this year if, as we expect, economic growth remains weak while core inflation pressures remain under control.""

“The statement emphasized that policymakers are data dependent and are monitoring the effects of shifts in trade that will add to costs even as they weigh on economic activity, and they will also assess the degree of spillover into other areas of the economy and how inflation expectations evolve in judging if another cut is in the cards ahead. In our view, the economy is losing resilience and inflation will continue to be contained by the elevated unemployment rate and removal of retaliatory tariffs and we therefore see another 25-basis-point cut in October.”

“Conventional wisdom says that if you're going to cut once, you're probably going to go again (does a single 25-basis-point move the needle in significant fashion?). Note that the empirical record supports this view as the only time the Bank has held, then cut, then held was the mini 2015 easing cycle when the policy rate was at or below 1%. The BoC is trying to temper easing expectations as they remove the line from the July decision that said “further rate cuts may be necessary,” but a follow-on cut in October is our expectation, nonetheless. And while our base case outlook entails a 2.25% terminal rate (i.e., just one more cut), risks have clearly swung towards more easing being delivered. Finger in the air, we'd assign a 40% probability to the terminal rate settling at 2% (or lower). Incoming economic/inflation data, an October Business Outlook Survey, Canada-U.S. trade developments and a fall budget will all help guide that view.”

“We don't think this is the beginning of a new cutting cycle that will see rates fall deeply into stimulative territory. We expect the BoC to cut by another 25 basis points in October but then pause and hold rates at 2.25% - the low end of its neutral range estimate - through 2026. The BoC remains in a bind as it weighs the upside risks to inflation against the downside risks to growth from the trade war. Moreover, major fiscal stimulus is likely to be laid out in the federal budget this fall, which will do most of the heavy lifting to support the economy in the near term.”

“The Bank of Canada still seems wary of assuming that all of the impacts of U.S. trade policy are in the rearview mirror, particularly with regards to inflation. That's left markets relatively unchanged after the rate cut announcement. In contrast, our work suggests that those fears about inflation won't materialize. As a result, we continue to believe that the Bank of Canada will cut rates again in October and ultimately take the policy rate down to a terminal rate of 2.00%.”

Mortgage rates could soon lower after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today.Matt Rourke/The Associated Press

Hello, cheaper mortgages. 

The most common mortgage rate could soon start at 3 per cent instead of 4 per cent after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today.

And although home loans will only become slightly cheaper, mortgages that start with 3 per cent can be a psychological turning point for would-be buyers.

“A mortgage rate starting with a 3 is helpful,” said Clinton Wilkins, principal broker with Centum Home Lenders Ltd. who has been brokering mortgages in Nova Scotia for more than 20 years 

“Once those rates are widely available, it will add some demand in the market,” he said. 

“Having a 3 handle on mortgage rates is an important psychological hurdle for buyers,” said Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert with rate comparison web site Ratehub.ca 

Some lenders are already advertising mortgages with an interest rate that starts at 3 per cent. But they are not widespread. 

So far this month, the average rate was 4.1 per cent on a five-year variable-rate product and 3.97 per cent on a five-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to data from Mortgagelogic.news.

But the most popular lenders – the big Canadian banks – are still advertising rates above 4 per cent, according to their websites. 

– Darcy Keith

No big surprise here for markets, though there was a little bit of softening in the Canadian dollar as the decision came out, with the loonie falling to 72.62 U.S. cents from 72.70. 

There was a little bit of an uptick, though, in the S&P/TSX Composite Index. It's up about 0.25 per cent, versus a nearly unchanged S&P 500. Among stocks seeing some of the most positive gains are dividend stocks, which investors tend to gravitate to when interest rates fall and make returns in competing income products, such as bonds and cash, less attractive.

Bond yields softened a bit, too, with the Canadian two-year bond losing about another basis point, to trade about two basis points lower.

Unlike today's decision, markets are not really convinced another rate cut will be announced at the next BoC meeting, on Oct. 29.

Implied probabilities in overnight index swaps suggest odds are about even on another 25-basis-point cut at that time, according to LSEG data. That said, markets are convinced the rate-cutting cycle won't end with today's decision and are fully pricing in another cut by Jan. 28 of next year. That would bring the overnight rate down to 2.25 per cent. 

But markets aren't pricing in much further easing over the course of next year. The verdict from traders: The monetary easing cycle may not be over, but it's close to reaching its conclusion. Assuming, of course, the economy stays relatively afloat. 

– Nojoud Al Mallees

“Although there are still some mixed signals, on balance, recent data suggest the upward pressures on underlying inflation have diminished.”

“Tariffs are having a profound effect on several key sectors, including the auto, steel and aluminum industries. Chinese tariffs on canola, pork and seafood, new U.S. tariffs on copper and higher U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber will spread the direct impacts further.”

“Many businesses have told us they have paused investment plans given elevated uncertainty about U.S. trade policy. Businesses are also concerned that demand in Canada will weaken as the economic fallout broadens.”

“The federal government's recent decision to remove most retaliatory tariffs on imported goods from the United States will mean less upward pressure on the prices of these goods going forward.”

“We are paying close attention to how exports evolve given the impact of U.S. tariffs and changing trade relationships; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how the cost effects of trade disruptions and reconfigured supply chains are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve.”

There were more than 40,700 home sales nationally in August, the highest number since August, 2021.COLE BURSTON/The Canadian Press

Today's interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada will likely motivate more prospective buyers to enter the real estate market.

That would support a recent market upswing that has seen sales on the rise over the past five months and August purchases hit a four-year high for that month.

While the BoC had cut its benchmark rate seven times from June, 2024, through March of this year, many buyers have been reluctant to make a purchase. 

Mortgage rates and home prices were still relatively high. And the trade war with the U.S. has led to job losses and the threat of a severe economic slowdown.

Now that the central bank's interest rate has been cut to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent, realtors say the pent-up demand could soon be unleashed. 

“If rates come down, people will come back into the market,” said Shaunese Lawrence, a mortgage agent with Clover Mortgage who has been brokering home loans in the Toronto region since 2013.

Ms. Lawrence said she has lost count of the number of people who are saying: “I just want to get something.” Last year she did not broker any mortgages for home purchases; she only worked on mortgage renewals and refinancings. 

In the past few weeks, she said, buyers have been putting in offers every day. “It's totally night and day and it is literally in the past couple of weeks.” 

Don Kottick, the president of Re/Max Canada, said would-be buyers are getting comfortable with the uncertainty brought on by the trade war. “We have started to see this uptick even though we don't know what will come,” he said.

The Bank of Canada's interest rate announcement today came with no hints about the future path of its policy rate.

Governor Tiff Macklem said in his opening remarks that there was a “clear consensus” to lower the central bank's policy rate today, but he provided no forward guidance on where rates are headed next. Instead, today's announcement emphasized the uncertainty looming over the economy.

“Governing council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks going forward,” Mr. Macklem said. “The Bank will continue to assess the risks, look over a shorter horizon than usual and be ready to respond to new information.”

Many economists anticipate the central bank will cut interest rates again this year in response to increasing slack in the economy and easing price pressures. Growth has stalled, the job market is loosening, and Canada's removal of many retaliatory tariffs should help on the inflation front.

The BoC acknowledged those realities today, but Mr. Macklem also highlighted ongoing risks to the inflation outlook.

“The disruptive effects of shifts in trade will add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. It is difficult to predict the extent of cost increases, where they will show up and how they could be passed through to consumer prices,” he said.

The bank did not release economic forecasts with its interest rate decision today. In its last two quarterly monetary policy reports, it published multiple scenarios of what could happen to the economy based on the state of trade.

- Mark Rendell

The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point today, lowering borrowing costs for the first time since March as U.S. tariffs continue to batter the Canadian economy.

As widely expected, the bank's governing council voted to lower the policy rate to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent. This follows three consecutive rate decisions in which the central bank held the rate steady.

The bank has been reluctant to ease monetary policy amid a trade war with the United States, given the possibility that U.S. tariffs and Canadian countertariffs could push up consumer prices and reignite high inflation. But that calculus has shifted as unemployment has risen, exports have plummeted, and inflation has remained relatively benign.

“Considerable uncertainty remains. But with a weaker economy and less upside risk to inflation, governing council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks going forward,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said in prepared remarks.

Mr. Macklem said there was a “clear consensus” for a cut, but he gave few hints about where interest rates will go from here, saying the bank would “look over a shorter horizon than usual and be ready to respond to new information.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut on Wednesday afternoon.Ken Cedeno/Reuters

After the Bank of Canada rate announcement, attention will shift to Washington, where the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut this afternoon amid souring economic indicators and mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy. 

The Fed has been on hold since December, wary that tariffs could push up consumer prices and unconvinced that the robust U.S. economy needed more support. That sentiment appears to have changed in recent months, as the U.S. job market has stalled while inflation hasn't increased as much as many economists expected. 

Financial markets now expect the Fed to lower its policy rate by a quarter-point today, with traders betting on additional cuts through the fall. Because the Fed has cut less than the BoC or most other central banks – the target range for the federal funds rate is 4.25 to 4.5 per cent – it has a long way to go before getting interest rates back to a neutral level. 

Any decision to cut, however, will carry a whiff of politics. U.S. President Donald Trump has spent months lambasting Fed Chair Jerome Powell and demanding that the Fed, which is meant to be independent of politics, lower interest rates. 

The President has also aggressively tried to overhaul the Fed's voting body, appointing Stephen Miran, a close economic adviser, as an interim governor and attempting to fire governor Lisa Cook – a move she is fighting in court.

The rate announcement is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, followed by a news conference with Mr. Powell at 2:30. 

Analysts will be watching for hints about future rate cuts and poring over the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which will contain a new “dot plot” outlining where Fed committee members see interest rates going over the next three years and in the longer run. 

- Mark Rendell

As far as financial markets are concerned, a rate cut today is a slam dunk. What's less clear is where interest rates go from here. 

Interest rate swap traders put the probability of a quarter-point cut by the Bank of Canada today above 90 per cent, according to LSEG data. 

Most Bay Street analysts are likewise convinced the BoC is going to resume easing after three consecutive holds. Twenty-five of 32 economists polled by Reuters last week said they expect a quarter-point cut today. That includes analysts at five of the six big Canadian banks, with RBC the only outlier. 

Looking further out, swap markets are pricing in only one additional cut after Wednesday, which would leave the policy rate at 2.25 per cent through next year. Analysts expect a similar trajectory, although some see the BoC needing to lower rates more to boost a sluggish economy. 

– Nojoud Al Mallees

Statistics Canada's August inflation report, released Tuesday, solidified expectations that the Bank of Canada will resume cutting interest rates today. 

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.9 per cent in August, from 1.7 per cent in July, but came in lower than analysts were anticipating. 

The BoC has held off on cutting interest rates since March, opting to monitor how the trade war with the U.S. evolves and whether high inflation remains at bay. 

Economists were somewhat concerned by a pick-up in inflation in the spring and the prospect of the trade war raising prices further. But those anxieties have faded. 

But they say that in hindsight the higher inflation in the spring was being driven by retaliatory tariffs that Canada had placed on U.S. goods. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney dropped many of Canada's retaliatory tariffs this month in a bid to further trade negotiations with the U.S. The move was applauded by Canadian businesses that said the countermeasures were raising prices for consumers. 

Economists say the BoC's focus now needs to shift to supporting the economy, which has stalled under the weight of U.S. tariffs.

After a string of seven rate cuts, the Bank of Canada has been sitting tight since March, waiting to see how global trade disruptions hit the Canadian economy and affect consumer prices. 

In recent months, the picture has become clearer: Inflation has remained relatively contained, while U.S. tariffs have hammered exports and pushed up unemployment in Canada. That has set the stage for another round of monetary policy easing, with the BoC expected to lower borrowing costs to give the sluggish Canadian economy a jolt. 

Financial markets and Bay Street analysts widely expect a quarter-point cut today, which would take the bank's policy rate down to 2.5 per cent. 

Until now, the BoC has been wary of cutting interest rates further, given the possibility that U.S. tariffs and Canadian countertariffs could drive up consumer prices and touch off another round of high inflation. But Canada has dropped most of its retaliatory tariffs in recent months, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened, easing upward pressure on the prices of imported goods. 

The August inflation numbers, published Tuesday, were the last hurdle to clear and showed nothing that would prevent the BoC from cutting. Annual headline inflation rose slightly to 1.9 per cent, but the closely watched core inflation measures eased. 

Inflation hasn't disappeared entirely as a concern. But downside risks to Canada's tariff-battered economy are likely to take centre stage. Gross domestic product contracted 1.6 per cent, at an annualized rate, in the second quarter, and unemployment is at 7.1 per cent, the highest level since 2016 outside the pandemic.

Monetary policy is a blunt instrument that can't target the sectors hit hardest by the trade war: steel, aluminum, autos and lumber. But rate cuts could help shore up consumer spending and business investment more broadly, as well as provide a spark to the housing market. 

With markets fully pricing in a rate cut today, the big question is where interest rates go from here. The BoC won't publish a new forecast today, so analysts will focus on any signals Governor Tiff Macklem sends out about the possibility of additional cuts this fall. 

The rate decision will be announced at 9:45 a.m. ET, followed by a news conference with Mr. Macklem and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers at 10:30 a.m. ET.

U.S. President Donald Trump is vowing to have left-wing activist groups investigated as criminal organizations in the wake of the assassination of MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk.

Members of his administration and right-wing activists, meanwhile, are working to identify people who criticized Mr. Kirk online after his killing and have them fired from their jobs.

Mr. Trump is also launching a US$15-billion libel suit against the New York Times and several of its staffers whose critical coverage of him has long irked him.

The moves are drawing accusations that Mr. Trump and his allies are using Mr. Kirk's death as a pretext to crack down on dissent.

Mr. Trump on Monday said he had asked Attorney-General Pam Bondi to bring Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, charges against organizations involved in protests against his policies.

“We have some pretty radical groups and they got away with murder,” the President told reporters in the Oval Office. “They should be put in jail. What they're doing to this country is really subversive.”

Mr. Trump accused these groups of “putting up millions and millions of dollars for agitation,” including protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles and a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who heckled him during a visit to a Washington steakhouse earlier this month.

The President presented no evidence that either protest was backed by large amounts of money. He did not specify which groups he wanted investigated but said he was open to designating antifa, a broad left-wing anti-fascist movement, as a domestic terror organization.

Racketeering laws are typically used to prosecute members of the mafia, Hells Angels and other accused gangsters. Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election were the subject of a state-level RICO prosecution in Georgia, which is still unresolved.

On Tuesday, he suggested he might also target media organizations. Asked by an ABC reporter about the line between freedom of speech and hate speech, Mr. Trump replied: “We'll probably go after people like you, because you treat me unfairly. It's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart. Maybe they'll come after ABC.”

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said groups behind Black Lives Matter protests would be targeted. He said that, the day before his death, Mr. Kirk had told him: “We need to have an organized strategy to go after the left-wing organizations that are promoting violence in this country.”

Speaking on a Monday podcast episode of The Charlie Kirk Show, hosted by Vice-President JD Vance, Mr. Miller alleged that there was an “organized campaign” that led to Mr. Kirk's assassination and a “vast domestic terror movement” behind protests and efforts to “dox” conservatives, the practice of publishing someone's personal information, such as address, contact information or employer.

Mr. Vance said the administration would crack down on “radical left lunatics” in NGOs. He did not specify which groups would be targeted, but suggested they could include charities the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations, the latter of which was founded by liberal billionaire George Soros.

In a statement, the Open Society Foundations said: “We oppose all forms of violence and condemn the outrageous accusations to the contrary. Our work is entirely peaceful and lawful.”

So far, police have indicated that the suspect in the shooting, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, acted alone. They have not said whether he was part of any political group.

California Governor Gavin Newsom accused the Trump administration of trying to silence critical voices under the guise of responding to Mr. Kirk's assassination.

“This isn't about crime and safety. It's about dismantling our democratic institutions,” he wrote on X. “We cannot allow acts of political violence to be weaponized and used to threaten tens of millions of Americans.”

Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, warned that “something dark might be coming.”

“The murder of Charlie Kirk could have united Americans to confront political violence. Instead, Trump and his anti-democratic radicals look to be readying a campaign to destroy dissent,” he wrote.

MAGA influencers and some government officials, for their part, are running a campaign to ensure people who said negative things about Mr. Kirk after his death are punished.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell and Navy Secretary John Phelan have both warned that service members or civilian employees celebrating the killing would face consequences. Activists such as Laura Loomer are naming people who have made anti-Kirk comments and alerting their employers.

Some conservatives are targeting people and organizations they believe disparaged Charlie Kirk after his killing.

The Associated Press

So far, dozens if not hundreds of people have been fired or suspended for social media posts on Mr. Kirk. Some had celebrated or made light of the assassination, while others appear only to have criticized him.

Karen Attiah, an opinion columnist for the Washington Post, said she was fired for writing on the Bluesky platform that she did not believe “white America” would take any action to prevent similar assassinations or mass shootings in the future. 

In another post, she highlighted Mr. Kirk's 2023 comment that Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and other powerful Black women “do not have the brain processing power” to succeed without affirmative action.

In a Substack post, Ms. Attiah wrote that the newspaper told her that her posts were “gross misconduct” and had endangered her colleagues' safety.

Olivia Petersen, a spokesperson for the Washington Post, declined to comment on “personnel matters.”

Other high-profile people fired over Kirk-related commentary include MSNBC pundit Matthew Dowd, who said that “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions”; Laura Sosh-Lightsy, at Middle Tennessee State University, who posted that she had “ZERO sympathy” for Mr. Kirk; and DC Comics writer Gretchen Felker-Martin, who posted: “Hope the bullet's okay after touching Charlie Kirk.”

Regular Americans faced firings, too, including a Secret Service agent, a Marine, a video game developer, airline employees, a social media staffer for the Carolina Panthers and a manager at Freddy's Frozen Custard. 

Mr. Trump also took action against the New York Times late on Monday with a libel suit filed in Florida. Among other things, he complains about the paper describing him as “unworthy” of the presidency in its endorsement of Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

The campaign against Mr. Trump's and Mr. Kirk's detractors follows years of his supporters accusing the left of engaging in “cancel culture” for shaming conservatives online.

Ms. Bondi on Monday, however, argued that there must be limits to free speech.

“There's free speech and then there's hate speech. And there's no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society,” she said on The Katie Miller Podcast. “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.”

The man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been charged with aggravated murder. Tyler Robinson could face the death penalty if convicted.

Let's use nuclear power to reduce oil sands emissions","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-nuclear-power-energy-gas-pipeline-oil-sands-emissions/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 09:15:00 GMT","

Christopher Worswick is a professor of economics at Carleton University.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at Cold Lake in Alberta as a necessary condition to the building of an oil and gas pipeline. Premier Danielle Smith has suggested that this could be part of a “grand bargain,” with the federal government allowing for expanded oil and gas development in Alberta without large increases in carbon emissions. 

However, CCS is a new technology and has only recently been implemented on a large scale. The potential of CCS should be explored, but any such grand bargain should consider other ways that the sector can be expanded without a substantial increase in emissions. 

With the announcement of the first five projects on the federal government's fast-track list of priorities, a lot of attention has been paid to the absence of an oil and gas pipeline and relatively little attention has been paid to the nuclear energy project. The small modular reactor (SMR) on the list is already approved and will be built at the Darlington nuclear facility in Ontario – one of four planned SMRs to produce electricity there. 

Given that roughly half of Ontario's electricity comes from nuclear energy, and given the industry's remarkably safe history in Canada, nuclear energy could be key to building a pathway forward for an expansion of Canadian oil and gas production.

The Alberta government is also considering building SMRs to produce low-carbon energy. Within the context of climate change and the need to reduce carbon emissions while expanding the highly profitable oil and gas sector, nuclear energy in Alberta actually makes a lot of sense. In 2023, Canada's oil and gas sector contributed approximately 30 per cent of national carbon emissions. Forty-three per cent of emissions result from the generation of heat and electricity in oil sands production and upgrading, and more than 40 per cent of those emissions are from the burning of natural gas. 

Instead, SMRs could be used to provide this heat and electricity. Given that life-cycle carbon emissions - the total emissions produced from extraction through to end use - from nuclear energy are around 3 per cent of those produced by burning natural gas, the benefits to SMRs providing energy to the oil and gas sector in terms of emissions reductions are potentially substantial.

While other sources of low-carbon energy are attractive, nuclear is perhaps the sole low-carbon source of energy that can provide 24/7 power to support Alberta's oil and gas industry which is so vital to Canada's economic future.

A grand bargain seems feasible where the Alberta government accepts SMRs in the province as a condition of a significant expansion of the oil and gas sector. With a smaller carbon footprint for oil and gas in the near future, the federal government could justify relaxing the carbon emissions cap, at least temporarily while SMRs are being built, and support both pipeline capacity and a relaxation of the tanker ban on the coast of northern British Columbia. 

Could solar be an alternative to nuclear? The fact that the Saudi government is investing heavily in solar to reduce their carbon emissions while continuing to produce oil suggests that they see solar as a good option. However, large infrastructure projects such as oil and gas normally operate around the clock, making solar energy less effective in the absence of batteries with the capacity to store energy. That in turn requires large investments in battery facilities which rely on critical minerals for their production that are generally in short supply. 

Solar energy is better suited to meet consumer demand for electricity which is normally higher during daylight hours. Hydro power would also be worth pursuing if there remain projects that are economically viable.

Canada has always been at the forefront of the international nuclear industry and Canadians have both the expertise and experience to lead this new wave of SMR production. While nuclear reactors produce waste that must be stored safely, Canada has an excellent track record of doing this.

If the federal government prioritizes new SMRs as part of the upcoming infrastructure projects, there would be the potential for Canada to be a world leader in SMR production, a sector that has tremendous growth potential around the world.

Demand for energy, especially for the burgeoning AI sector, is very likely to grow. However, the need to reduce carbon emissions to limit climate change is not going to go away. This grand bargain between the federal government and the Alberta government could even be a model for developing energy-intensive industries in other provinces.

The EU proposed curbing trade with Israel and placing sanctions on Israeli far-right ministers. Israel opened an exit route out of Gaza City for 48 hours after launching a ground offensive. DW rounds up the latest.

Below you can read about developments in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Israel, Syria, Iran and other parts of the Middle East on Wednesday, September 17.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar warned the EU that any measures against Israel would ""harm Europe's own interests"" after the European Commission proposed trade restrictions and sanctions on two far-right ministers. 

""The recommendations of the college of Commissioners led by President [Usrula] von der Leyen are morally and politically distorted,"" Saar wrote on X. 

Israel's top diplomat said his country will continue the ""existential war"" with the ""help of its friends in Europe."" 

""Any action against Israel will receive an appropriate response, and we hope we will not have to use them,"" he wrote.

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said earlier while announcing the proposed measures that they were not meant to ""punish Israel"" but rather improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused Israel of forcibly displacing residents in southern Syria, which Israel has demanded be demilitarized as part of a new security pact.

Citing interviews with locals, and satellite images, the rights group said Israeli forces have ""seized and demolished homes, blocked residents from their property and livelihoods, and arbitrarily detained residents and transferred them to Israel"" since December 2024. 

Israel has stepped up attacks in Syria after longtime Syrian ruler Bashar Assad was ousted in December. 

HRW said ""Israel has pushed deep into the UN-monitored demilitarized zone separating the Golan Heights.""

Israel also ""intensified airstrikes on military infrastructure,"" the group said, noting statements by Israeli officials who have said that they intend to ""completely demilitarize"" the south of Syria.

A buffer zone between Syria and Israel on the Golan Heights was initially established after a disengagement pact in 1974, but Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights continues, with only the US and Israel officially recognizing the Syrian territory as part of Israel. 

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has put forward a proposal to curb trade with Israel and impose restrictions on far-right Israeli ministers, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. 

""I want to be very clear, the aim is not to punish Israel. The aim is to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza,"" Kallas said. ""The war needs to end. The suffering must stop, and all hostages must be released.""

It's questionable whether there will be a majority of states in the 27-member bloc in favor of the measures Kallas proposed, although the EU has come under criticism for failing to pressure Israel to end the war.

A German government spokesperson earlier said that Berlin is aware of but ""has not yet formed a final opinion"" on the proposed measures. 

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU would halt payments to Israel, and that the bloc's executive was working on further measures. 

On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the EU's suspension of certain trade advantages was ""disproportionate"" and ""unprecedented."" 

Palestinian news agency WAFA reported that at least 33 people were killed on Wednesday across the Gaza Strip, including 21 in Gaza City, the enclave's biggest city.

The figure is reported to include a pregnant woman and several children, according to hospital officials. 

It comes as Israel presses on with its ground offensive in Gaza City, where it called on hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to evacuate to the southern Gaza Strip.

The Israeli army said Wednesday it had attacked more than 150 targets in Gaza City over 48 hours, including what it said was a Hamas weapons facility. 

Pope Leo XVI called for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages as he condemned the displacement of Palestinians forced to leave their homes in Gaza.

""I express my deep solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza who continue to live in fear and survive in unacceptable conditions, being forcibly displaced once again from their lands,"" said the 70-year-old pope after his weekly general audience.

He urged a negotiated diplomatic solution and ""the full respect of international humanitarian law.""

""I invite everyone to join my heartfelt prayer that soon a dawn of peace and justice will rise,"" he said. 

Pope Leo met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Vatican earlier this month. The Vatican said Leo had lamented the ""tragic situation in Gaza"" with Herzog.

 The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry (COI) has said Israel has been committing genocide in the Gaza Strip for two years. 

Investigators said four of the five genocidal acts listed in the 1948 UN Genocide Convention have been carried out in Gaza. 

The commission named Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Isaac Herzog and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant as inciters of genocide.

The report echoed conclusions by the world's leading association of genocide scholars and several international rights groups.

These findings could be used by two UN courts: the International Criminal Court (ICC), which had issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on charges of war crimes, or the International Court of Justice, where South Africa filed a genocide case against Israel. 

The cases at both world courts are likely to take years, and Netanyahu's allies, including the United States and Germany, have signalled that they would not arrest him on the ICC warrant.

The UN report urged the international community to end the genocide and take steps to hold Israel's leadership accountable.

The latest investigation is likely to further fuel growing opposition to Israel's war in Gaza, both domestically and internationally.

Several European countries have announced that they would formally recognize Palestinian statehood during next week's UN General Assembly in a push toward a two-state solution. 

Earlier this week, Netanyahu said that Israel should prepare for international isolation.

Iran has executed Babak Shahbazi after convicting him of spying for Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, according to the judiciary's Mizan Online news agency.

Mizan said Wednesday that Shahbazi was sentenced to death for ""corruption on earth"" and ""waging war against God,"" and that the Supreme Court upheld the verdict. He had worked on industrial cooling systems for companies tied to military, security and telecommunications facilities, giving him access to sensitive sites.

Authorities said he passed information to Mossad for money and foreign residency. Iran has vowed swift punishment for anyone accused of collaborating with Israel since its June war with the country.

Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam of the Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights said the verdict was delivered ""without a fair trial and on the basis of confessions extracted under torture.""

The Israeli army has said it will open a second road through the Gaza Strip on Wednesday to allow civilians to move south.

Starting at noon local time (0900 GMT/UTC), the Salah al-Din road — running along Gaza's eastern side — will remain open for 48 hours, military spokesperson Avichay Adraee announced on X.

Salah al-Din parallels the Israeli border, while the alternative Rashid Road similarly runs north to south but closer to the coast.

In the north of the Palestinian territory, the Israeli military has launched its long-awaited ground offensive in Gaza City.

Troops have been operating on the city's outskirts for weeks and began moving towards the center on Monday evening.

More than 20 humanitarian organizations have called for urgent international action to halt the war between Israel and Hamas ahead of next week's UN General Assembly.

""States must use every available political, economic, and legal tool at their disposal to intervene,"" the groups said in a joint statement released by Save the Children. ""World leaders fail to act. Facts are ignored. Testimony is cast aside. And more people are killed as a direct consequence.""

The appeal followed a UN-appointed commission report accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, a charge Israel rejected as ""scandalous,"" saying its military campaign targets Hamas, not civilians.

The aid groups warned Wednesday that UN member states are treating their obligations under international law as optional.

""History will undoubtedly judge this moment as a test of humanity. And we are failing,"" they wrote, citing families surviving on animal food and children eating boiled leaves amid relentless airstrikes.

The statement's signatories include Doctors Without Borders, Care International, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam International.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Munich Philharmonic's Israeli conductor and boycott debate","https://www.dw.com/en/cancellation-of-israeli-conductors-concert-the-problem-with-cultural-boycotts/a-73972265","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:05:03 GMT","

The cancellation of a Munich Philharmonic Orchestra concert in Belgium over its Israeli conductor Lahav Shani has sparked outrage in Germany. But how does this incident compare to other cases?

The organizers of the Flanders Festival Ghent in Belgium were open about why they decided to cancel a planned concert by the Munich Philharmonic: The reason, they said, was that its Israeli conductor, Lahav Shani, had not sufficiently distanced himself from the actions of Israel's government.

By canceling the event, the organizers say they wanted ""to maintain the serenity"" of the festival and that it is their ""deepest conviction that music should be a source of connection and reconciliation."" 

But instead of serenity, the move has triggered a wave of outrage — especially in Germany.

Many German politicians and antisemitism experts swiftly condemned the music festival's decision.

Germany's Minister of State for Culture, Wolfram Weimer, called the move ""a dangerous precedent,"" describing it as ""pure antisemitism and an attack on the fundamentals of our culture.""

The German Commissioner for Antisemitism, Felix Klein, also sharply criticized the decision. ""I consider the cancellation, based on the stated reasons, to be a completely unspeakable and deeply antisemitic act,"" he told the German dpa press agency.

The former President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Charlotte Knobloch, called the cancellation one of the ""most blatant examples of current Jew-hatred.""

""Anyone who fails to hear the historical echo in this situation is turning a deaf ear,"" she told dpa, referring to the anti-Jewish boycotts under the Nazis.

In a statement sent to the press five days after the cancellation, Lahav Shani criticized the festival's ""regrettable decision"" through which he was ""involuntarily drawn into an unexpected public storm that quickly escalated into a diplomatic incident.""

In his statement, he also reiterates his position on the situation in Gaza.

""Like many Israelis, I have not abandoned my human values. The images and reports from Gaza are deeply disturbing, and it is impossible to remain indifferent in the face of the catastrophe that this war has brought upon the civilian population in Gaza,"" he writes.

""Everything must be done to end the war as soon as possible and begin the long process of healing and reconstruction for both societies.""



In reaction to the cancelled performance, the Berliner Konzerthaus organized a last-minute concert held on Monday. 

""We can never let the program of European stages be dictated by antisemites,"" Culture Commissioner Weimer said in a speech at the concert.

""We are the Europe of the Enlightenment, not the Europe that the Nazis betrayed 90 years ago,"" he added, referring to the Nuremberg laws to introduced in 1935 to discriminate against Germany's Jewish population, which culminated in the Holocaust. 

Other European theaters scheduled to host the Munich Philharmonic and Lahav Shani in the same week as the Flanders Festival have said they won't follow Ghent's example. 

The Philharmonie Luxembourg, which is hosting a concert directed by Shani on September 17, said in a statement to DW: ""We uphold our position of continuing to work with artists from all over the world. We do not wish to associate ourselves with a boycott of individuals based on nationality, as we do not believe that all artists support or are tied to the policies of their government.""

Born in Tel Aviv in 1989, Lahav Shani is considered one of classical music's brightest young stars. A conductor, pianist and double bassist, he succeeded Zubin Mehta as director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in 2019.

Since 2016, Shani has also been chief conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic.

Although he is already directing concerts with the Munich Philharmonic, he will officially become the new chief conductor of the German orchestra starting in September 2026. He will then step down from the Rotterdam position but remain director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.

For much of his career, Shani was cautious about making political statements.

In a 2024 guest essay for German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, he explained that as the conductor of the Israeli Philharmonic orchestra — with musicians from diverse backgrounds and with often opposing views — he didn't feel it was his role to speak out on behalf of any one side. 

But that changed in March 2023, he wrote in the essay, when mass protests against planned judicial reforms by Benjamin Netanyahu's government could be heard outside a Tel Aviv concert hall where Shani was about to perform. That night, he voiced his concerns onstage about the future of Israeli democracy. 

Shani also wrote about the shock of realizing that Jews couldn't feel safe even in Israel after the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023 — a fear shared by many other Jewish people around the world. 

Yet he also expressed hope ""that on both sides very courageous people will soon come forward, people who think about the future and dare to take the difficult steps towards peace.""

While the Flanders Festival Ghent acknowledged that ""Lahav Shani has spoken out in favor of peace and reconciliation several times in the past,"" the organizers argued that he had not gone far enough ""in the light of his role as the chief conductor of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra."" 

PEN Berlin, the local branch of an international writers' association dedicated to free expression, strongly disagrees.

In a statement, PEN Berlin spokesperson Thea Dorn said: ""Freedom of expression is not only the right to express oneself freely and without fear of reprisal; it also includes the right not to be forced to express one's beliefs. Coercion to confess is a hallmark of authoritarian and even more so totalitarian regimes.""

The debate over Shani Lahav has sparked comparisons with Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, who was dismissed by the Munich Philharmonic in March 2022 after refusing to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

Jewish pianist Igor Levit, a globally renowned artist known for his outspoken stance against xenophobia and antisemitism, rejected the comparison.

""Valery Gergiev is an artist who has been an open, committed supporter, collaborator and profiteer of the Russian imperialist dictator's machinations for years. Comparing this man to Lahav Shani — a conductor who, with his German orchestra, only got into this situation because he is an Israeli Jew — is, in my view, a sign of intellectual bankruptcy,"" Levit noted in an interview with German news service Tagesthemen. 

Gergiev had long been a vocal supporter of the Kremlin, appearing in a 2012 campaign advertisement for Vladimir Putin and endorsing the annexation of Crimea. Gergiev is currently the director of the Mariinsky Theater and the Bolshoi Theater in Russia. 

Even so, PEN Berlin highlighted some similarities, with its spokesperson Dorn noting: ""Gergiev and Shani may have very different levels of closeness to their respective governments, yet the accusations leveled against them are similar: It's not about things they said, but about things they didn't say. Cancel culture and forced political affiliation are fundamentally to be rejected, and not just when they fit one's ideological concept."" 

The Shani affair is part of a wider international debate. Many public personalities have been hesitant to speak out on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — both because of its complexity and the fear that criticizing Israel publicly could have professional consequences.

In Germany, there has been a rise in cancellations of artists and intellectuals whose stance on Israel's policies was seen as too critical. This practice has also impacted a large number of Jewish voices. 

Jewish-Austrian author Eva Menasse has been a vocal opponent of such boycotts. She told DW that ""cultural boycotts are always wrong."" She argued that they are used by groups to reaffirm their respective moral stances, but they're only a distraction from the political steps that need to be taken.

""Will a disinvited orchestra prevent the ongoing, monstrous destruction of Gaza? Will it save a single child from starvation? No, of course not. Only politics can do that,"" Menasse said. ""At the same time, cultural boycotts always lead to more polarization and division in society."" 

Menasse also pointed to a double standard, asking why those who are now condemning the Ghent cancellation were silent when Jewish intellectuals and artists who were critical of Israel were disinvited elsewhere.

She cited Israeli-German philosopher Omri Boehm, whose speech for the 80th anniversary of the Buchenwald concentration camp's liberation was canceled after objections by the Israeli ambassador, and the controversy over awarding the Hannah Arendt Prize to Masha Gessen, after the journalist compared Gaza to Nazi-era ghettos in an article for the New Yorker magazine. 

The controversy over the Ghent festival's cancellation has shown once again how quickly culture and politics become entangled — while some view boycotts as a legitimate form of protest, others warn that they often deepen divisions and risk silencing important voices.

Navigating the complex debates over artistic expression and political accountability will likely remain a major challenge for cultural institutions in a deeply divided world.

Allies of Donald Trump have dismissed claims Charlie Kirk was killed by a lone assassin.

Senior figures in the Maga movement believe Tyler Robinson, the student charged with Kirk's murder, is part of a wider conspiracy involving a Left-wing terrorist network, and that authorities need to widen the scope of their investigation.

The FBI has suggested suspect Mr Robinson may have worked with others, although no one else has yet been charged in connection with the crime.

Kash Patel, the FBI director, told senators on Tuesday that the bureau was investigating “who, if anyone, was involved as an accomplice”.

Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former chief strategist, claimed that Kirk's death was “not a simple murder” and that the truth was “far deeper and far more malignant”.

“There's a vast conspiracy at the back of this,” Mr Bannon said on his War Room podcast on Monday.

“I am absolutely not buying this [theory],” he added.

“Antifa needs to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation,” he continued, referencing the radical Left-wing organisation that has been linked to recent attacks on immigration detention centres.

Media reports emerged shortly after Kirk's death that the ammunition used by the assassin was engraved with expressions of transgender and Antifa “ideology”, but authorities later clarified this may have been a misunderstanding.

It later emerged one of the bullets was engraved with the phrase: “Hey fascist! Catch” and “Bella ciao,” a reference to a Second World War Italian antifascist song.

Mr Bannon went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have been involved in the incident by allegedly funding to Antifa.

He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, telling Politico: “The biggest thing is to broaden the assassination investigation from a single murder to the broader conspiracy. If we are going to go to war, let's go to war.”

Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and a long-time aide to Mr Trump, claimed a “vast domestic terror network” was responsible for Kirk's death.

Violence is being fomented by “organised doxing campaigns, the organised riots, the organised street violence… and the actual organised cells”, he claimed on an episode of Kirk's podcast on Monday, hosted by JD Vance, the vice-president.

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have… to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” he vowed.

Sean Davis, founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine, wrote on social media: “It's obvious now that Charlie Kirk's assassin was not working alone.

“He was clearly operating within a larger terrorist network focused on grooming, recruiting, and training terrorists for the purpose of planning and executing terrorist attacks.”

Mr Patel was repeatedly pressed by Republicans about whether Mr Robinson had allegedly acted alone when he testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee for several hours on Tuesday.

A number of people who communicated with the 22-year-old student on Discord, the gaming chat room, are being “investigated and interrogated” by the FBI, he told senators. Asked if others could have been involved in Kirk's death, he answered: “Yes.”

At one point, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley urged Mr Patel to investigate Kirk's murder as part of a wider wave of “anti-religion, anti-Christian violence”.

Dan Bongino, Mr Patel's deputy, has also said the bureau is looking into whether Mr Robinson acted as part of a “larger effort”.

“If there was any aiding and abetting, whether it be financial or someone who knew the specifics of it and failed to report that, we're looking into that,” Mr Bongino told Fox News on Monday, and declared: “There's not going to be a stone left unturned.”

Prosecutors have revealed text messages that they say prove Tyler Robinson admitted to killing Charlie Kirk.

Mr Robinson, 22, has been charged with murdering Kirk, the conservative activist, shot dead at a Utah university last week.

The suspect wore an anti-suicide vest, designed to prevent prisoners from turning it into a noose, as he appeared before a judge via video link for the first time on Tuesday.

Prosecutors laid out formal charges against Mr Robinson and revealed messages to his transgender roommate, with whom Robinson was in a relationship, which they said amounted to a confession.

Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said on Sunday: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.”

Here are the messages in full.

Mr Robinson allegedly confessed to the assassination by hiding a note for his boyfriend.

He placed the message under a keyboard at their shared home, saying he planned to “take out Charlie Kirk”, according to a text exchange.

He wrote: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard,” the messages revealed by officials said.

The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated: “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it.”

After reading the note, Mr Robinson's boyfriend asked if he was joking:

In a text to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he could reach the spot in a wooded area near Utah Valley University where he allegedly hid the weapon, but he was worried about being seen by a “squad car parked right by it”.

He added that he was worried about what his father would do if he did not return his grandfather's rifle.

Later the suspect told his roommate that his father was a staunch supporter of President Trump.

“Since Trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard Maga,” the suspected killer wrote.

Mr Robinson had become “more political”, leaning Left and growing “more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented”, said Jeff Gray, the Utah County Attorney.

Both of Mr Robinson's parents are registered Republicans, according to records seen by The Telegraph.

The gunman left behind bullets engraved with anti-fascist messages, including: “Hey fascist! Catch!”

In a later message to his boyfriend, Mr Robinson said he would turn himself in and asked his roommate not to talk to the media.

The man accused of killing Charlie Kirk is facing the death penalty after being formally charged with murder.

Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of murdering Kirk, 31, with a single shot to the throat as he addressed a crowd of Utah Valley University students last week.

The charges were announced by Jeff Gray, the Utah county attorney general, on Tuesday. Here are five key takeaways from the press conference.

Mr Robinson had become increasingly political and “had started to lean more to the Left, becoming more pro gay and trans rights oriented,” his mother told prosecutors.

The 22-year-old student was in a relationship with his roommate, a biological male who was transgender.

The alleged killer had also begun to clash increasingly with his conservative father.

His mother told law enforcement that Mr Robinson's relationship with his transgender roommate “resulted in several discussions with family members, but especially between Robinson and his father, who have very different political views”.

In a text exchange, he allegedly told his partner after the shooting: “Since Trump got into office, my dad has been pretty die-hard Maga.”

Mr Gray said DNA “consistent with Mr Robinson's” had been found on the trigger and “other parts” of a rifle abandoned in nearby woodland after Kirk was shot.

The DNA was also found on the fired cartridge, casing, two of the three unfired cartridges, and a towel wrapped around the gun.

Mr Robinson had stashed the weapon in his trouser leg upon his escape, Mr Gray said.

“The suspect walks with very little bending in his right leg, consistent with a rifle being hidden in his pants.

“This unusual gait continues until the suspect is seen crossing the railway,” the county attorney said, referring to CCTV showing Mr Robinson's alleged getaway.

“Immediately after the shot was fired, a camera captures the suspect running across the roof carrying an item whose shape is consistent with a rifle,” Mr Gray added.

Mr Robinson is alleged to have confessed to Kirk's killing in a series of texts with his partner in the aftermath of the shooting.

“[His] roommate received a text message from Robinson which said, ‘drop what you're doing. Look under my keyboard',” Mr Gray told the press conference.

“The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated, quote: ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it'.”

In further messages, Mr Robinson allegedly said he carried out the attack because “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.”

His roommate, who has not been named, appeared to believe he was joking, allegedly saying: “You weren't the one who did it right????”

Mr Robinson replied: “I am, I'm sorry,” according to police.

Mr Robinson was recognised by his own mother after law enforcement shared CCTV images of the suspect.

“Robinson's mother saw the photo of the shooter in the news and thought the shooter looked like her son,” Mr Gray told the press conference.

“[His] mother called her son...where … he said he was at home sick. On September 10, Robinson's mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspect shooter looked like Robinson. Robinson's father agreed,” he said.

He was then convinced by his father and a family friend, a retired deputy sheriff, to turn himself in.

The suspect appeared to remain near the scene for some time after the shooting.

In text messages with his partner, he discussed how he would like to return to the woodland and retrieve his rifle, but there were police nearby.

“I believe I can get close to it, but there is a squad car parked right by it. I think they already swept that spot, but I don't wanna chance it.”

It would also stop requiring the State Department to submit reports to Congress on issues like human rights abroad.

The House is poised to expand the use of a secretive mechanism for funneling weapons to Israel.

Hidden deep in a must-pass State Department funding bill is a provision that would allow for unlimited transfers of U.S. weapons to a special Israel-based stockpile in the next fiscal year, strengthening a pathway for giving American weapons to Israel with reduced public scrutiny. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is set to discuss the bill Wednesday morning.

The stockpile — known as War Reserve Stock for Allies-Israel, or WRSA-I — is “the least transparent mechanism of providing arms to Israel,” former State Department official Josh Paul told Responsible Statecraft. Since Oct. 7, Israel has quietly purchased huge numbers of American weapons from WRSA-I, facilitating a wave of airstrikes that many analysts consider the most intense bombing campaign of the 21st century.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

The transfer process is simple. When Israel asks for weapons from WRSA-I, the secretary of defense can approve the request without having to go through typical steps like notifying Congress or even the White House in advance. Then “Israel can just drive in, pull whatever it requires, and drive out,” said Paul, who now runs a lobbying firm called A New Policy, adding that payments for the weapons are “worked out or provided in the future.”

The legislation, crafted by committee Chairman Brian Mast (R-Fla.), would build on a 2024 law that temporarily waived restrictions on the value and type of U.S. weapons transferred to WRSA-I each year. (U.S. law previously limited such transfers to $200 million annually.) That law also gave the secretary of defense the authority to assess the value of arms transfers rather than relying on the fair market value of the article.

Even before these changes, the U.S. had already started taking advantage of WRSA-I to quietly fuel Israel's war in Gaza. In the early days of the conflict, Biden administration officials appeared to dodge transparency rules by cutting up larger transfers from WRSA-I into smaller weapons packages that fell under the $25 million threshold for notifying Congress of the sale. This helps to explain how Israel has managed to prosecute the war in Gaza despite receiving few publicly acknowledged weapons sales from the U.S.

Some worry that these arms transfers could place additional pressure on U.S. weapons stockpiles, which have already been strained by American support for Israel and Ukraine.

According to Paul, the proposed expansion of WRSA-I risks creating “a significant drain on U.S. military readiness.”

The effort to expand arms transfers to Israel comes after a panel of United Nations experts determined that Israel is committing a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli government rejected that claim, which it says relies “entirely on Hamas falsehoods.”

Notably, the bill also contains a provision that would eliminate all of the State Department's reporting requirements, meaning that the department would no longer need to submit reports to Congress on issues like human rights abroad.

“Congressional oversight would take a very big hit if this were to pass as it exists now,” said John Ramming-Chappell, an adviser at the Center for Civilians in Conflict. “Congress and the public would have less information about U.S. foreign policy and its impact.”

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

 Washington and Pretoria Were at Odds Long Before Trump

 Michelle Gavin

Thirty years after apartheid ended, the relationship between the United States and South Africa is at a nadir. Many analysts blame U.S. President Donald Trump and his sudden fixation on vilifying the country's government. The second Trump administration has issued an executive order banning U.S. assistance to South Africa, expelled the South African ambassador from Washington, and declared that the Afrikaners—Dutch-descended white South Africans—are so persecuted that they deserve priority status for refugee resettlement in the United States. During a bilateral meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May, Trump orchestrated a humiliating multimedia presentation in the Oval Office that falsely accused South African officials of abetting a so-called white genocide.

The Trump administration's determination to make an example of South Africa is partly driven by its overall antipathy toward attempts to redress historical racial injustices and has as much to do with the fixations of parts of the MAGA base as it does foreign policy. In truth, however, U.S.–South African relations have been difficult for years, characterized by mutual disappointment and suspicion. South Africa's objections to the U.S. government's actions abroad, especially its military interventions in Iraq and Libya, are part of the story. But so are South African actions that the United States has found objectionable.

U.S. officials anticipated that South Africa would champion pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights around the world after a decades-long liberation struggle toppled white minority rule in 1994. This expectation was informed in part by a 1993 Foreign Affairs essay penned by Nelson Mandela, the country's first Black president, in which he declared that “human rights will be the light that guides our foreign affairs” and that “only true democracy can guarantee rights.” In the post-apartheid 1990s, the United States sought to strengthen ties with and champion South Africa, establishing a high-level binational commission to deepen cooperation and fast-track support for the new democracy.

But within a decade, ideology, history, and pressures exerted by South Africa's own domestic politics have conspired to produce a foreign policy that was bound to alienate Washington. Its unexpected stances on human-rights-related votes at the United Nations were early signs of trouble. With its sustained support for Zimbabwe's violently repressive regime, its refusal to condemn human rights abuses in Myanmar, and its silence regarding Beijing's treatment of China's Uyghur population, South Africa has been extremely selective about the injustices it chooses to condemn. South African officials, eager to transpose the moral authority of Mandela to the South African government as a whole, exacerbated the problem by continuously insisting that the government's policies are consistent and principled.

The rift deepened as South African foreign policy tilted, again and again, to favor U.S. rivals. A full year before Trump took office for the second time, members of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation calling on the U.S. government to review its approach to South Africa. Among the grievances that bill cited were South Africa's condemnation of Israel and its willingness to engage with Hamas's leaders, its continued military cooperation with Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and its close relationship with China. The United States and South Africa could—and should—work closely together, since they share an interest in maintaining successful multiracial democracies. But if the two countries continue to see each other as problems instead of partners, that capacity for collaboration may vanish for good.

The African National Congress, South Africa's leading liberation movement under apartheid, became the country's ruling party after its first democratic elections in 1994; for 30 years, it won comfortable majorities in nationwide elections. During its long liberation struggle, the ANC had to pursue its own foreign relations and sustained its anti-apartheid efforts by building international support, primarily from the Soviet bloc. The United States aligned with the apartheid state to combat communist expansion in Africa during the Cold War, at times shielding the country from international sanctions and designating the ANC as a terrorist organization. The ANC members who dominate South Africa's foreign policy establishment see the U.S. government's support for the apartheid government as the most salient data point for how to view Washington today—rather than America's vigorous anti-apartheid movement, which led Congress to override President Ronald Reagan's veto and impose sanctions on the minority government in an attempt to incentivize change.

The capitals that more consistently supported southern African liberation movements, by contrast—such as Beijing, Havana, and Moscow—still enjoy a reputation in South Africa for being on the right side of history. The Chinese Communist Party still provides political training to ANC members. Cold War nostalgia informed the ANC's 2023 statement that the United States “provoked the war with Russia over Ukraine, hoping to put Russia in its place” and former South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor's suggestion that there was nothing notable about South Africa's decision to host joint military exercises with Russia on the one-year anniversary of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, since “all countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide.”

Since May 2024, the ANC has had to share power—uncomfortably—with the Democratic Alliance and other parties. Foreign policy, however, remains under the ANC's control. The conflation of the party and the state in diplomatic and international security matters is, in part, a function of the ANC's need to conduct its own foreign policy before South Africa became democratic. When speaking about the U.S.–South African relationship, ANC officials frequently lament the party's paucity of direct ties with major U.S. political parties, suggesting that this explains at least some of its difficulties with Washington.

The party's ideological underpinnings have an outsized influence on policy, and they are also full of contradictions. The ANC defines its foreign policy ideology as “progressive internationalism,” which it regularly describes as “a radical perspective on international relations” that stands in opposition to the “perpetuation of the legacy of global imperialism,” the “dominance of the global North over the global South,” and “structural global inequality and poverty.” It often cites these principles to explain South Africa's enthusiasm for the BRICS platform—the group led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa that, along with new members, positions itself as a champion of multipolarity and an alternative to existing international institutions.



This change agenda, however, coexists alongside a stated commitment to respect the core precepts of the rules-based international order: state sovereignty, multilateralism as expressed through the United Nations, and an adherence to international law. In 2017, the ANC's International Relations subcommittee explained that it seeks to “mobilize progressive forces in the [global] South and worldwide to strengthen the system of global governance and the UN in particular” so that the international order can “remain a bulwark against the unilateralist and warmongering tendencies” of powerful nations. The party's professed goal is revolutionary change, but its preferred means are legalistic.

Another paradox emerges from the ANC's reading of its most important document, the 1955 Freedom Charter. That text declares that South Africa should be a “fully independent state which respects the rights and sovereignty of all nations” but also maintains that that it should pursue “upholding the equal rights, opportunities, and status of all.” Whether South Africa, under ANC rule, calls out gross human rights abuses or respects the right of another government to repress its people as it sees fit has, in practice, depended on the degree to which ANC officials understand the government in question to be its partner in combating global power asymmetries.

South Africa characterizes its foreign policy as one of active nonalignment. Rather than refrain from taking sides when great powers disagree, the country has sought to capitalize on opportunities presented by geopolitical rifts to advance its principles. Because the United States enjoyed unchallenged power for much of the post–Cold War era, this often means a warm South African embrace of U.S. adversaries and a willingness to ignore their acts of repression. Thus concerns about Ukraine's sovereignty and Russia's use of force without a United Nations mandate fell by the wayside in the ANC's rush to maintain solidarity with Moscow. South Africa has often overlooked Iran's support for terrorism and its record of repression at home: in 2024, Pandor, South Africa's former foreign minister, startled attendees of a think tank event in Washington when she pushed back against the characterization of Iran's government as “authoritarian.”

South Africa's sympathy for the Palestinian people is not at all unusual in Africa. But South Africa's decision to bring a case to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in December 2023 came against the backdrop of earlier decisions that reveal a selective concern for oppressed peoples and international legal obligations. For example, South Africa—a party to the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court—declined to arrest Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir when he visited the country in 2015, despite knowing that he was the subject of an ICC arrest warrant on charges including genocide. (South Africa claimed that its law granting immunity to sitting heads of state overruled the ICC warrant.)

South Africa's own domestic political pressures have not helped its relationship with the United States. Decades after its segregationist regime fell, South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. The ANC is losing the faith of centrists disillusioned with its neglectful bureaucracies and its tolerance for corruption. Some political rivals, such as Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters and former President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto we Sizwe party, insist that the ANC's failures stem instead from an inadequately radical domestic agenda, particularly when it comes to economic policy. They want to see resources nationalized and wealth redistributed. These left-wing rivals represent a looming threat to the ANC's power: they won nearly a quarter of the vote in national elections last May.

But the ANC, which has borne the responsibility of governing and not just campaigning, has been unwilling to risk collapsing the South African economy by radically reinventing it. ANC leaders may perceive foreign policy to be a safer realm in which to assert radical bona fides. Ramaphosa's approval rating enjoyed a bounce after in the weeks after Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack and South Africa's subsequent full-throated condemnation of Israel, and he received resounding applause at his 2025 State of the Nation address after he suggested the country “will not be bullied” by the United States.

Opposing the United States, however, may confer less of a domestic benefit in the future. In 2025, after reintroducing the bill demanding a review of Washington's policy toward South Africa, U.S. legislators added a call for sanctions on South African leaders implicated in corruption or human rights abuses. Trump has subjected South Africa to some of the highest tariff rates of any African country and is set to end its duty-free access to U.S. markets, which will cost the country tens of thousands of jobs.

South Africa has thus raced to make a deal with the Trump administration to salvage commercial ties, and talks continue behind closed doors. Tripartite military exercises with China and Russia had been slated to occur in South African waters just weeks before November's G-20 summit in Johannesburg, and South African officials have sought to postpone them to avoid further alienating the United States. But the country's foreign policy inconsistencies persist, complicating its charm offensive. In August, the country's top military officer, General Rudzani Maphwanya, visited Tehran. There, he said that his country shares “common goals” with Iran. “We always stand alongside the oppressed and defenseless people of the world.” South Africa frantically attempted to walk the comment back, stating that “any statements made by an individual . . . should not be misinterpreted as the official position of the South African government.” Centrist political leaders in South Africa complained that the government did not go far enough to discipline the general, while a left-wing rival party taunted Ramaphosa for “appeas[ing] Donald Trump” with the statement.

Ironically, South Africa's complaints about U.S. foreign policy's hypocrisy are similar to the grievances the United States has about its approach. South African officials seethe when U.S. leaders express concern for Ukrainian civilians but are less quick to sympathize with civilians in Gaza. They note the United States' habit of picking and choosing moments to invoke or to ignore international legal institutions and restrictions. At the same time, South Africa's foreign policy inconsistencies and its tendency to conflate anti-Western entities with progressive ones have left many of its former U.S. champions unwilling to leap to its defense. In an alternate universe, the inconsistencies in both countries' foreign policies would help each one better understand and sympathize with the other.

Foreign policy is difficult, and pursuing a principled foreign policy is even harder. Some hypocrisy is virtually inescapable. But when two states with different biases and worldviews collide—one enamored with a vision of its exceptionalism and another clinging to its identity as moral authority—pragmatism is in order. The United States does not gain from endorsing racist conspiracy theories that amplify South Africa's caricature of it. And South Africa does not gain by gratuitously alienating the United States.

The two countries' troubles run deep enough that official relations are unlikely to improve in the near future. But academics, scientists, artists, and philanthropists can make a deliberate effort to deepen collaborations and exchanges that will help lay the groundwork for a new kind of bilateral relationship that sets aside old scripts and focuses on genuine and enduring shared interests. The United States and South Africa have experience with this kind of ground-up repair: during the apartheid era, citizens built connective tissue without waiting on changes in their official governments' policies—acts that, in turn, drove transformative top-level policy changes. They must do so once again.

The near destruction of Hamas in Gaza, the evisceration of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria deprived Iran of the proxies it had long relied on to threaten Israel. As a result, in June, Israel was able to conduct its 12-day war against Iran unencumbered by worries about regional escalation. That war demolished a long-held assumption about Iranian deterrence—the belief that Tehran could retaliate effectively against overt, direct attacks on its territory. More practically, it destroyed the country's main air defenses, degraded its ballistic missile capabilities, and set back its nuclear ambitions.

Iran's regime will certainly attempt to claw back its lost power. But regional developments since Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's persistently assertive military footing have made it much harder for Tehran to take steps that could shore up its influence, such as rearming Hezbollah. Until Iran can defend its own territory, it may be impossible for it to rebuild its proxies or sprint for a nuclear bomb in a way that does not put the theocratic regime at further risk of collapse.

In the near term, Iran is likeliest to try to rebuild its military defenses by expanding its partnership with China. Until recently, Beijing has resisted backing one faction over another in the Middle East. But China's calculus could be changing, too. It may well see fresh opportunities in assisting Iran to regain some of its diminished strength, given the rising tensions between Israel and Arab states—especially following Israel's early September strikes on Hamas's leadership in Qatar.

The Assad regime's ouster last December—and the anti-Iranian stance adopted by Damascus's new rulers—constitutes an underappreciated obstacle to Tehran's ability to reconstruct its regional proxy strategy. For decades, Syria directly provided rockets and missiles to Hezbollah, the crown jewel of Iran's proxy network; Assad also allowed Iran to smuggle weapons to Lebanon through Syrian territory. Although that effort met resistance after the outbreak of Syria's civil war as Israel began to regularly conduct strikes on weapons storehouses in Syria and on convoys facilitated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran still managed to keep Hezbollah armed.

Ahmed al-Shara, Syria's new president, has made it clear that Iranian influence is no longer welcome in his country. He has sought partnerships with Iran's rivals, particularly Turkey, and blamed Iranian-backed militias for fueling instability in Syria, arguing in a February 2025 interview on state television that Iranian proxies posed a threat to the Syrian people and “the entire region.” Yet despite some early successes, Shara's government has struggled to unify the country. Iran could exploit the latent sociopolitical divisions in Syria by clandestinely aiding factions dissatisfied with the new regime or open to financial inducements, just as it has leveraged divisions in Iraq and Yemen.

Iran could have even greater opportunities to interfere in Syrian politics if the U.S. military completes its withdrawal. Iran already boasts relationships with some Syrian Sunni tribal networks, having worked with them to move weapons into the West Bank through Jordan. It could try to incentivize those networks to move arms to the Lebanese border if Damascus's authority over southern Syria dwindles.

Without access to Syrian transit networks, however, Iran will be left with only two ways to send significant weapons shipments to Lebanon: by air or by sea. Both of these methods are vulnerable to Israeli interception, and the degree to which Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran's military establishment makes it even less likely that Iranian weapons could successfully reach Lebanon. After Israel's 2024 attacks on Hezbollah, the group's leadership structure is in a shambles, and it faces extraordinary pressure to disarm. It may have no choice but to pull back or even abandon its military efforts.

Iran may eventually find a way to reconstitute its supply lines to Hezbollah, but the conditions under which it could do so don't yet exist. This means that Iran has lost—perhaps permanently—the one proxy militia whose power had discouraged Israeli attacks on Iranian territory. The Houthis in Yemen have successfully used Iranian weaponry to target shipping in the Red Sea, but they have not helped shield Iran against Israeli aggression. Hezbollah's rockets posed a direct threat to Israeli cities, but the Houthis' arsenal—as well as that of the Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq—constitutes a lesser and more distant threat.

Iran could, of course, pivot from its proxy strategy and try to restore its deterrence by racing for a nuclear weapon. Despite the Israeli and U.S. assaults on its nuclear facilities in June, Iran already possesses enough highly enriched uranium to construct several nuclear weapons and is believed to have the know-how to build them. If Iran could repair or rebuild adequate enrichment facilities (or if it already has such secret facilities), it could refine that uranium to a weapons-grade level relatively quickly, perhaps in a matter of weeks.

But even if Iran's leaders want to pursue nuclear weaponization, taking the necessary steps to do so would be extremely dangerous for the ruling regime. Given Israel's steep intelligence advantage, any moves to further enrich uranium would risk alerting Iran's adversaries and triggering a new and more destructive round of strikes led by Israel, the United States, or both. And even if Iran succeeded in testing a nuclear device and developing a small weapons arsenal uninterrupted, its current inability to defend its skies would render that arsenal tremendously vulnerable. Developing a nuclear weapon, on its own, therefore cannot restore Iranian deterrence. Without strong conventional defenses or proxies to deter foreign aggression, nuclear weapons could simply create a new liability.



Before Iran can even begin to restore deterrence, much less recoup some of its regional power, it must address the shortcomings in its conventional military capabilities. Iran did find ways to impose costs on Israel during the 12-day war, particularly by targeting Israeli population centers. But Israel's air defense systems' high intercept rate rendered Iran's missiles an insufficient deterrent; they could not destroy or even reliably hit serious strategic and military targets. And after it eliminated Iran's air defense systems, Israel was able to strike Iranian missile launchers, which further eroded Iran's ability to launch effective counterstrikes.

How Iran chooses to rebuild its arsenal will depend on the lessons its military took from the 12-day war. Much remains unknown about how effective different Iranian missiles systems were in the conflict, but Iranian commanders will have undoubtedly acquired a greater understanding of which systems performed best and which operational tactics were most effective, even if Israel's attacks on Iran were always more potent. Those lessons will guide how Iran's military focuses its energies. It may, for instance, invest even more in domestically produced hypersonic or other advanced weapons (such as the Fattah and the Khorramshahr-4 missiles), as well as longer-range systems that could be fired from eastern Iran, a harder target for Israel to hit.

Iran's need to bolster its air defenses is even more pressing. In June, Israel destroyed the bulk of Iran's air defenses in the central and western parts of the country, including all of its Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems, which had been the most advanced systems that Iran possessed. Israel also destroyed a number of Iranian military aircraft. Even before the war, Iran could not field an air force that could defend its skies against a stronger adversary, and it is weaker now.

Iran lacks the industrial capacity to produce the platforms it needs to bolster its air defense and will have to seek outside assistance. Moscow has long been Tehran's closest defense partner, but Russia's complicated relationship with Israel limits the defense assistance it has been willing to provide; its war on Ukraine has also diminished its ability to sell weaponry to outside buyers. In 2023, for instance, Iran announced a deal to purchase Sukhoi Su-35 fighter planes from Russia. To date, however, Russia has delivered only two of the reported 50 aircraft that Tehran has ordered. Moscow may yet make good on the deal, but given the delay and the constraints on Russia's defense industry, Iran may choose to look elsewhere.

That leaves China as Iran's best source of additional military equipment. China has traditionally sought to balance its relationships in the Middle East. It has helped Iran evade oil sanctions and offered limited military assistance, such as by aiding Iran's development of antiship ballistic missiles. But Beijing has not assisted Tehran enough to give it a clear advantage over its Arab neighbors, particularly Saudi Arabia, its traditional regional rival. China has reaped some benefits from Iran's relative isolation—most important, by exploiting Western sanctions to purchase Iranian oil at a steep discount.

But China's balancing act may no longer be necessary. In March 2023, Iran began normalizing diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia—a move brokered by China that fundamentally changed a prior driver of Beijing's Middle East policy. And as tensions grow between Beijing and Washington, so does Tehran's potential strategic utility for Beijing. Linking Iran more closely to Chinese interests and support could prove advantageous in, for example, a crisis scenario involving Taiwan, during which Beijing could split the focus of the U.S. Navy and its allies by incentivizing Tehran and its proxies to target civilian shipping in the Red Sea or the Gulf of Oman.

Air defense is a crucial gap that China could help Iran fill. China's HQ-9 mobile air defense system is similar to Russia's more advanced S-400 platform. If Beijing sold this system to Tehran, that could help Iran restore some protection of its skies. Iran could also pursue a deal with China to modernize its air force, such as by purchasing Chinese Chengdu J-10 aircraft, which performed well for Pakistan in its brief military escalation with India in May.

In the short run, neither better air defenses nor an improved fleet of fighter jets can drastically change Iran's relative disadvantage with respect to Israel and the United States. But in the medium term, these improvements could make further strikes on Iran harder and costlier for adversaries to pursue and discourage episodic escalations. At the very least, they could buy Iran some time to replenish and refine its domestically produced missile stockpile and better prepare for another conflict. The more temporally distant the threat of war becomes for Iran, the more immediate risk it can shoulder.

Regardless of how China responds to its predicament, Iran is in a crunch. Its leaders may yet choose to muddle along in a state of insecurity, hoping simply to survive this period of crisis without further compromise. Or they may opt for the even more dangerous path of nuclear weaponization. But the scaffolding that had preserved Iran's security for the last two decades has collapsed, and the country will remain fundamentally vulnerable and insecure until its conventional military shortcomings are addressed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","FBI Director Kash Patel grilled by House committee on Epstein files","https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kash-patel-hearing-fbi-director-09-17-25","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:57:00 GMT","


            • NOW: FBI Director Kash Patel is appearing before the House Judiciary Committee, facing tough questions from lawmakers for the second day in a row.
    


            • Epstein files: The Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein Files is taking center stage, as Democrats press Patel on his previous statements about a cover-up and ask why more documents haven't been released.
    


            • Senate hearing: Tuesday, Patel testified and took questions yesterday about the probe into conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder. He said the FBI is interviewing more than 20 people who participated in an online chat with the suspect Tyler Robinson. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed in a series of messages sent to his roommate after the attack.
    


            Republicans who sit on the Senate Judiciary Commitee urged the Trump administration to release all files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, one day after FBI Director Kash Patel vowed the agency would share everything that it was “legally permitted” to.
    


                    “Gotta release the files,” Sen. Josh Hawley told CNN, saying he was heartened that Patel had expressed an openness to releasing all files that were not classified or blocked by a court order.
                





            Hawley added that he doesn't “think this needs to be a big deal.”
    


            “Just release everything that — release everything you can,” he said, adding that he also supported the release of files related to the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy.
    


            Sen. John Kennedy, who pressed Patel on Epstein during yesterday's Senate Judiciary hearing said he's not “satisfied or dissatisfied” with the FBI director's responses, explaining, “I have no way of evaluating his answers because we haven't seen the files.”
    


            Kennedy said he's looking at the issue through the lens of the American people, whom he argued were following the case closely.
    


                    “The American people, they don't read Aristotle every day. They don't have time. They're busy earning a living, but they follow this,” he said, calling the public's desire for more answers a “very normal, appropriate response” to the flurry of disturbing news about Epstein and his associates.
                





            “I certainly don't want to see victims be hurt, but I think the American people are entitled to know, and President Trump has said, look, I'm going to turn this issue over to the Justice Department, and they're going to decide how to release the files,” he said.
    


            “I wanted to use my time yesterday to encourage the director to release the files and to, to remind him that at least in one senator's opinion, this issue isn't going away.”
    


            Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal accused FBI Director Kash Patel of creating a “giant cover-up” of the Epstein files after suddenly discovering “Donald Trump's name was all over these files.”
    


            The congresswoman's questioning – which did not include clear evidence of the accusation – led to a heated shouting match between the two in one of the most dramatic displays of the political divide at play during Wednesday's hearing.
    


            Jayapal also claimed that Patel “appeared to say that the survivors were not credible” in the Epstein case earlier in the hearing.
    


            “That's not at all what I said,” Patel said, adding “don't lie about me.”
    


            The lawmaker told Patel that some alleged victims of Epstein have not testified before, asking Patel why he had not met with them.
    


            “Is the answer yes or no to whether or not you met with these women who were sexually abused and raped?” Jayapal said, pounding her open hand on the desk.
    


            “Any insinuation by you or any people on your side that I am not manhunting child predators and sex traffickers, just look at the stats,” Patel said.
    


            The FBI director added later that “we have routinely asked people to come forward with more evidence and we will look at it.”
    


            “Are you going to continue to cover up for the rich and powerful men – including those who might be on this committee?” Jayapal shouted after Chairman Jim Jordan moved onto the next lawmaker's questions.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel said Wednesday that there are not any suggestive photographs of Donald Trump with underage girls, pushing back on claims that Jeffrey Epstein had such images in his possession.
    


            “Are there any photos showing Donald Trump with girls of an uncertain age?” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu asked Patel during the hearing after he played a video in which the journalist Michael Wolff said Epstein had, years earlier, shown him such photos.
    


            “No,” Patel said, to which the California congressman responded, “How do you know that?”
    


            “Because that information would have been brought to light by multiple administrations and FBI investigators over the course of last 20 years,” the director replied.
    


            Lieu went on to say that it's possible Epstein's estate is in possession of the photographs and implored the FBI to get the tapes Wolff has of his interviews with Epstein.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel's second day of hearings continued its descent into tit-for-tat exchanges and circular back-and-forths about the handling of the Epstein files Tuesday as Democrats continued to repeat questions and the director made personal attacks on some lawmakers.
    


            During one exchange, Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell pressed Patel again on why the FBI has not released more documents in the Epstein case, asking Patel in slow annunciation: “Did you tell the attorney general that Donald Trump's name is in the Epstein files?”
    


            “Why don't you try spelling it out if you're going to mock me?” Patel replied. “Use the alphabet. No? A, B, C, D, E, F – don't wanna do it?”
    


            The exchange continued to grow continuous between the two as Swalwell asked the FBI director about a list of names in the appendix of Patel's 2023 book in which he listed people he believed were part of the so-called deep state.
    


            “I'm going to borrow you're terminology and call bulls**t on your entire career in Congress,” Patel said when Swalwell asked if the director would recuse himself from any investigations of those individuals mentioned in the list.
    


            “It has been a disgrace to the American people,” Patel said as the two men spoke over each other and more members joined in the fray as Chairman Jim Jordan began hammering his gavel to gain order.
    


            Swalwell asked again if Patel would recuse himself from such investigations.“No,” Patel said flatly.
    


            Republican Rep. Chip Roy pushed FBI Director Kash Patel on Wednesday to say that billionaire George Soros and leftist organizations have been backing inexperienced prosecutors to lead local district attorneys' offices.
    


            Roy, citing a report from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said that progressive districts have “outsourced core parts of the American criminal justice system to activists and political donors” like Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of far-right conspiracy theories.
    


            Patel said he was not familiar with the report, but that “if that exists, it is a problem.”
    


            Several Republicans have slammed progressive cities and their district attorneys for being lax on crime and allowing violent criminals to reoffend, with Roy giving the recent example of a fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina by a man who had a history of arrests.
    


            The city's police department noted, however, that there has been a reduction in crime in the first half of the year.
    


            The lawmaker's comments also come as President Donald Trump has suggested that Soros and liberal groups should be investigated for allegedly encouraging violence, which critics say is part of the president's effort to go after political opponents.
    


            FBI Director Kash Patel was noncommittal when pressed Wednesday on whether he would meet with victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Pressed by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie on the possibility of such a meeting, Patel said only that members of his bureau would meet “with anyone who has new information.”
    


            “Will you personally meet with them?” Massie, who represents part of Kentucky, asked Patel, referring to the victims.
    


            “The FBI and the professionals who are handling the cases will,” the director responded.
    


            Massie has been the only Republican to press Patel on Epstein during the hearing thus far.
    


            Republicans have mostly followed the lead of Chairman Jim Jordan during the House Judiciary Committee hearing for FBI Director Kash Patel, asking the director to elaborate on the successes he previously touted and posing rhetorical questions.
    


            “Should research universities across the United States be doing a thorough job of vetting Chinese nationals that are coming to their universities?” one Republican lawmaker asked, citing arrests of Chinese nationals who allegedly attempted to smuggle dangerous biological pathogens into the US.
    


            “They should,” Patel answered plainly.
    


            In his opening, Jordan ticked through long-held criticisms of past FBI and CIA directors and praised Patel for his work over the past several months and during Trump's first administration.
    


            Democrats – joined by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, have focused their questions on the Epstein files – asking repeatedly why Patel has not released more information as promised.
    


            As he's pressed on the Epstein files, FBI Director Kash Patel is continuing to use a line of response he began yesterday in the Senate hearing, pointing fingers at the original investigation of Epstein by federal prosecutors in the 2000s.
    


            In the Senate and again today in the House, Patel has pointed to Alexander Acosta, who was US attorney in Florida during the George W. Bush administration and cut a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein.
    


            Patel twice brought Acosta up unprompted, including in his opening statement, during Tuesday's hearing.
    


            “I'm here to testify that the original sin in the Epstein case was the way it was initially brought by Mr. Acosta back in 2006,” Patel said at the beginning of both hearings.

            When asked directly Wednesday if President Donald Trump's name appeared in the so-called Epstein filings, FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau had released “all credible information” including where Trump's name appeared.
    


            “Does Donald Trump appear anywhere in the Epstein files?” New York Rep. Dan Goldman asked the director as the Democrats continued to press on files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            “We have released where President Trump's name is in the Epstein files – and everybody else – and all credible information that we are legally allowed to release has been released,” Patel said.
    


            Goldman then pressed on why Patel wasn't releasing more information, to which the FBI director responded that all information that the FBI has been able to release has been released, noting that court orders have prohibited further release.
    


            “You are hiding the Epstein files Mr. Patel,” Goldman accused the director.
    


            Patel replied: “Any allegations that I'm a part of a cover up to protect child sexual trafficking and victims of human trafficking and sexual crimes is patently and categorically false.”
    


            House Judiciary Committee Democrats have started a round of questions related to the files of the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            Rep. Jamie Raskin played a clip of a podcast appearance from 2023 where Patel stated that the FBI was in possession of Epstein's infamous “black book.”
    


            “Now, the black book is under your direct control, so why haven't you released the names of Epstein's co-conspirators in the rape and sex trafficking of young women and girls?” Raskin asked.
    


            Patel quickly became defensive, saying that the Trump administration has released more information regarding the Epstein investigation than any other administration. Patel said that the “Rolodex” information had already been released.
    


            “We have released more material than anyone else. Before the Biden administration, Obama administration, had the exact opportunities to release this material. They never did,” Patel said.
    


            The exchange became heated, as Patel continually attempted to defend his agency's handling of the Epstein files.
    


            “Do have any idea how the law works?” Patel fired back at Raskin.
    


This post has been updated to reflect that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are questioning Patel.



            In his opening remarks during the second day of congressional hearings on Wednesday, FBI Director Kash Patel praised the work of the agency under his leadership, highlighting upticks in certain arrests and pre-empting criticism he faced yesterday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
    


            Senators had repeatedly questioned Patel over decisions to reassign FBI agents for immigration efforts as well as the FBI's handling the Jeffrey Epstein files' release.
    


            Patel told House members of the Judiciary Committee that he “was not there” during the initial investigation into Epstein and highlighted that if federal judges allow, the bureau would release more documents related to Epstein.
    


            On criticism that he has moved agents away from key work – such as domestic terrorism – to focus on other efforts, like immigration, Patel said “we had to do it because of the explosion of crime.”
    


            “This is a fiction that the FBI is short or that we are compromising the men and women in the field,” Patel said. “They do not need to be in Washington, DC, so we're sending them into the field to each and every one of your states.”
    


            Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, attacked FBI Director Kash Patel in his opening remarks, saying that his actions have brought “danger” to the country.
    


            “Seven months in, it's impossible to overstate the destruction, chaos and demoralization you've brought to the FBI and its workforce, and the resulting danger your actions have caused to our country,” Raskin said.
    


            Raskin called Patel a “fairytale knight,” saying that he needs to recognize that he's running one of America's top law enforcement agencies.
    


            “Your supporters had hoped that you would graduate from imagining yourself a romantic fairytale knight to actually running America's premier federal law enforcement agency,” Raskin said.
    


            Entering the second day of hearings with FBI Director Kash Patel, House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan went through a litany of right-wing criticisms of past FBI and CIA directors to set the tone of the hearing.
    


            Jordan criticized the investigation in 2016 into the Trump campaign and Russia, singling out former Directors James Comey and Chris Wray, while praising Patel's efforts as a congressional staffer to review the investigation as well as Patel's current leadership of the FBI.
    


            “Now, in addition to getting the truth to the people, Director Patel is getting the bad guys off the street,” Jordan said, highlighting the surge of federal law enforcement and National Guard troops in Washington, DC, in recent weeks.
    


            Jordan did not address any current criticisms of Patel, including the recent firing of top FBI officials who accuse Patel of political motivation or Patel's past handling of investigations and what some have criticized as an over-eagerness to post details of ongoing investigations.
    


            The FBI is searching for a man it says rammed a gate with a vehicle at the Pittsburgh field office early Wednesday morning, an incident it described as a “targeted attack” against the bureau.
    


            At about 2:40 a.m. ET, a man driving a white sedan rammed a vehicle entrance gate at the FBI Pittsburgh office before exiting his car, removing an American flag from the back seat and throwing it on the damaged gate.
    


            The man, who the FBI identified as Donald Henson of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, then fled on foot and remains at large Wednesday morning.
    


            No FBI personnel were injured.

            FBI Director Kash Patel was defiant during yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing as he fielded tough questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing and defended recent firings at the bureau.
    


            Patel ran through a timeline of the investigation into Kirk's alleged killer and touted his own work amid criticism of his early social media posts that caused public confusion.
    


            Patel ended by saying, “I'm not going anywhere. If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, bring it on.”
    


Here's a recap of key moments from yesterday's hearing:



New details in Kirk probe: Patel said the FBI is interviewing more than 20 people who participated in an online chat with suspect Tyler Robinson. According to charging documents, the suspect confessed in a series of messages sent to his roommate after the attack.
    


Scrutiny over investigation: Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat the committee, ripped Patel for sparking, “mass confusion by incorrectly claiming on social media that the shooter was in custody — which he then had to walk back with another social media post.” Later on, Patel admitted he could have “been more careful in my verbiage” but maintained he was being transparent with the public and giving timely updates.
    


Democrats slam Patel: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker got in a heated exchange with the FBI chief and said, “Mr. Patel, I think you're not going to be around long,” adding “I think this might be your last oversight hearing.” Sen. Adam Schiff and Patel go into a shouting match after the California lawmaker repeated questions on whether the FBI director had fired agents for political reasons and on the bungled release Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


Grilled on FBI firings: Patel defended the recent dismissal of two agency officials who are now contesting their firings, saying they “failed to meet the needs of the FBI.” Durbin said it was “disgraceful” that Chris Meyer and Walter Giardina, both of whom are veterans, were terminated “apparently because of the rants of a podcaster.”

            American tennis player Taylor Townsend has apologized for making negative comments about food in China.
    


            The 29-year-old, who is currently in the Chinese city of Shenzhen for the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, posted several videos to her Instagram Story where she expressed shock at some of the food being served.
    


            Some of the dishes included turtle, bull frogs and sea cucumber – all considered traditional ingredients in China and many other parts of the world.
    


            “This is the craziest thing I've ever seen… and people eating this,” she said in a caption on one of her videos.
    


            “Imma have to talk to HR… because what the hell… turtle and bull frog is wild,” she wrote on another picture of a menu posted on Instagram.
    


Jelena Ostapenko apologizes for comments made during heated US Open match against Taylor Townsend



            Townsend, who is the women's top ranked doubles player, quickly came under fire for her comments.
    


            It sparked notable outcry on Chinese social media, with the hashtag “American tennis player criticizes Chinese food” being viewed millions of times on Weibo.
    


            One comment wrote: “It's normal not to eat offal, bullfrogs, turtles. As a Chinese, I don't eat these either, but you have to show respect. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean everyone feels the same.”
    


            Another said it felt like “prejudice and discrimination.”
    


            The criticism prompted an apology video posted on Townsend's Instagram Story.
    


            “I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences, which is one of the things I love so much about what I do,” she said, adding how kind people at the tournament had been this week.
    


            “The things that I said were not representative of that at all and I just truly wanted to apologize. There is no excuse, there is no words. For me, I will be better.”
    


            The backlash comes after Townsend was involved in a heated exchange with Jelena Ostapenko during the US Open last month.
    


            Ostapenko later apologized for saying the American had “no class” and “no education” when the pair clashed at the end of their second-round match, a moment triggered by Townsend not apologizing for a net-cord point earlier in the encounter.
    


            Townsend is now part of the US team playing in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals and will feature in the quarterfinal against Kazakhstan this week.

            Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, putting an end to an unusual nearly three-week stretch with no storms during the peak of hurricane season.
    


            Gabrielle formed Wednesday morning just over 1,000 miles from the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands. It has sustained winds of 45 mph.
    


            The National Hurricane Center forecast calls for Gabrielle to become a hurricane by Saturday as it churns to the north-northwest. Although the water is plenty warm for strengthening, the storm faces some hurdles in the atmosphere over the next couple of days, so it's still uncertain how strong it could become.
    


            The United States is not expected to see direct impacts from this system, but it might churn up surf on the East Coast next week.
    


            Gabrielle is the first tropical storm in the Atlantic since Fernand fizzled on August 28.
    


            For only the second time since 1950, the Atlantic went storm-free from August 29 through September 16, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. The last time that happened was in a quiet period after Hurricane Andrew's devastating strike on the US in 1992.
    


            High pressure to the north of this system will act as a steering wheel the next few days, with its clockwise motion sending the storm on a west-northwest path that will take it north of the islands of the eastern Caribbean by this weekend. High surf and dangerous rip currents will be the main impacts in those islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
    


            That high pressure will then weaken enough to turn the system more north into the central Atlantic. Where that turn occurs will determine how close it tracks to Bermuda next week.
    


            Another area of showers and storms is emerging from Africa right behind Tropical Depression Seven and could develop slowly into another tropical system as it tracks west across the eastern and central Atlantic in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center says. This system is no imminent threat to land for at least the next week, regardless of whether it becomes a tropical depression or storm.
    


            The seventh tropical storm of the season typically forms by September 3, so this storm is about two weeks late.
    


            Most tropical activity in the Atlantic – depressions, storms and hurricanes – occurs from mid-August to mid-October. But most of September is typically very busy, as it's when multiple atmospheric and oceanic conditions combine to make it easy for tropical systems to spring to life.
    


            This September has had plenty of warm water to serve as jet fuel for tropical trouble. Sea surface temperatures across the basin are currently warmer than normal and have been that way for most of the summer.
    


            But of the season's six tropical storms through August, only one has become a hurricane: Erin. Erin was a frightening peek into a new world order of how strong Atlantic storms are becoming as the planet warms.
    


            The Atlantic has struggled to produce storms this year because of factors above the ocean.
    


            The tropical Atlantic has been enveloped in dry, stable air. This factor can help limit any wannabe tropical systems from producing stormy weather.
    


            Storm-killing winds in different levels of the atmosphere known as wind shear have also been stronger than usual for this time of year in western and central parts of the Atlantic.
    


            Those two atmospheric factors have been a hindrance for the formation of tropical systems from areas of stormy weather that move off the coast of Africa and into the open Atlantic this time of year.
    


            The breeding ground for storms shrinks westward away from Africa heading into October. The Gulf, Caribbean and western Atlantic are typical formation hot spots late in the season, and since these regions are closer to land, any storms that form have a greater chance to cause dangerous impacts.

            Hot Stocks 





            Federal Reserve officials are convening this week for a pivotal meeting under unprecedented circumstances.
    


            At 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, central bankers are expected to announce their first interest rate cut since December to support America's slowing labor market, with the hopes that President Donald Trump's expansive tariffs might have only a limited impact on inflation.
    


            But there's an elephant in the room as officials debate about the US economy: Trump's aggressive effort to reshape the Fed's top ranks.
    


            On Monday, the Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, Trump's top economic adviser, to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors to complete a vacated term that expires at the end of January, but could be extended. Miran has said he won't commit to resigning when his term ends if a permanent successor hasn't been named.
    


            After being sworn in on Tuesday morning, Miran is able to cast a vote at this week's Fed policy meeting.
    


            Fed Governor Lisa Cook, whom Trump tried to fire in late August, will also cast a vote at this week's meeting. An appeals court on Monday rejected Trump's attempt to fire Cook while her lawsuit challenging Trump's removal order moves forward. Cook is the first Fed governor ever to be subject to a firing attempt.
    


            The latest Fed meeting is extraordinary, not just because central bankers are finally pivoting their strategy on interest rates, but also because of the latest developments implicating the Fed's powerful board — all while the Trump administration continues to pile pressure on the politically independent central bank.
    


Is the Fed behind the curve — again?



            Mounting signs of labor market weakness are a key reason why the Fed is lowering borrowing costs for the first time in nine months, coupled with Fed officials' growing belief that tariff inflation may be short lived.
    


            Job growth during the summer was anemic: Employers added an average of about 29,000 jobs in the three months ending in August, according to Labor Department data, slightly higher than July's average, which was the weakest three-month pace since 2010, outside of the pandemic.
    


            There are now more unemployed people seeking work than there are job openings; new applications for jobless benefits in the week ending September 6 rose to the highest level in nearly four years; and in August, the number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks reached its highest level since November 2021.
    


            A preliminary benchmark revision to employment data for the year ending in March, released last week, showed that the US labor market was on even shakier ground than previously thought heading into the summer.
    


            Fed Chair Jerome Powell laid the groundwork for this week's rate cut during a high-profile speech in late August, stating that “downside risks to employment are rising.” Other Fed officials have echoed those concerns in recent weeks, though they were first raised prominently by Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both Trump appointees, who backed a rate cut in July.
    


            Fed officials' latest economic projections, to be released on Wednesday, will show how aggressively the central bank might lower rates in the coming months with the labor market in a precarious state.
    


Against the odds, Americans are still spending



            Inflation has crept up in recent months — mostly due to Trump's sweeping policies, including his tariffs — but Fed officials have warmed up to the idea that any uptick in inflation may be temporary.
    


            The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, the Labor Department reported last week, in line with economists' expectations. For months, consumer inflation readings have mostly come in as expected, despite the chaotic rollout of Trump's tariffs.
    


            San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly wrote in a recent social media post that “tariff-related price increases will be a one-off.” St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said in a speech earlier this month that he expects “the effects of tariffs will work through the economy over the next two to three quarters and the impact on inflation will fade after that.”
    


            With a weakening labor market and persistent economic jitters, businesses now have less flexibility to raise prices compared to the years after the pandemic, when labor demand was red-hot and Americans' coffers were flush with pandemic-era stimulus payments and beefed-up savings.
    


            “Inflation has increased since the first quarter, but these numbers include the effects of import tariff increases, which, with inflation expectations anchored, I continue to expect will only temporarily raise inflation,” Waller said during an August 28 speech in Miami.
    


            “Most forecasts are for 12-month inflation to continue to slowly increase for a couple more months, with monthly tariff effects dissipating by early 2026,” he added.
    


            As Fed officials try to make sense of a complicated economic puzzle, the Trump administration continues to pressure the historically independent Fed.
    


            Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has repeatedly and publicly lashed out at Powell and the Fed because officials haven't lowered rates this year. Fed policymakers have held off on rate cuts until this week because they've wanted to see how Trump's policies — and its impacts — play out first.
    


            Trump threatened earlier this year to fire Powell, but eventually backed off after his advisers warned him that doing so could spark extreme volatility in financial markets, CNN previously reported.
    


            In July, the Trump administration seized on the Fed's ongoing $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC, as an opening to fire Powell, claiming it was mismanaged. At one point, Trump and Powell publicly feuded over the total cost of the project.
    


Trump pick Stephen Miran confirmed as Federal Reserve governor



            Now, Trump is trying to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which the Justice Department is actively investigating. The courts are keeping Cook in her job while her lawsuit challenging Trump's attempt to oust her moves forward in litigation. New documents reported by the Associated Press show that Cook's Atlanta condo, which the administration alleges is one of two properties she designated as a primary residence, was declared as a vacation home. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.
    


            While Cook's position remains in limbo, newly confirmed Fed governor Miran has elicited concerns from Democrats over his close ties with the president. For his part, Miran has said he will abide by ethics rules and federal law, and form independent opinions about the economy.
    


            “I'm very independently minded, as shown by my willingness to stray from consensus and have out-of-consensus views, and I believe that I will continue to be as independent in my thinking process, if confirmed,” Miran said during his confirmation hearing.
    


            Trump has said he wants a majority of Republicans on the Fed's Board of Governors, and Miran's confirmation process was swiftly shepherded through, taking only about a month from when he was nominated to when he got sworn in. The process typically takes a couple of months.
    


            Trump's insistence on lower rates likely sped up that timeline in order to get Miran on the Fed's board in time for the September meeting. Fed watchers already overwhelmingly expect the Fed to announce at least a quarter-point cut at the conclusion of the meeting, with or without Miran.

PROVO, Utah (AP) — During the frantic search to find Charlie Kirk's assassin, the 22-year-old man now charged with capital murder texted his romantic partner and confessed to carrying out an attack he planned for more than a week, court documents said.

Prosecutors revealed a series of incriminating texts, a hidden note and DNA evidence while announcing the charges and their intent to seek the death penalty against Tyler Robinson in the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and confidant of President Donald Trump.

Investigators say that sometime after Robinson fired a single fatal shot from the rooftop of a Utah Valley University building overlooking where Kirk was speaking to about 3,000 people on Sept. 10, he texted his partner and said to look under a keyboard.

There was a note, “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it,” according to court documents. 

After expressing shock, his partner who lived with Robinson in southwestern Utah, asked Robinson if he was the shooter. Robinson responded, “I am, I'm sorry.”

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said that DNA on the trigger of the rifle bolt-action rifle used to kill Kirk on the campus in Orem, south of Salt Lake City, matched Robinson. That rifle had been a gift from Robinson's grandfather, the prosecutor said.

Robinson appeared briefly Tuesday before a judge by video from jail. He mostly stared ahead as the judge read the charges and said he would appoint an attorney to represent him. Robinson's family has declined to comment to The Associated Press since his arrest.




Law enforcement officials say they are looking at whether others knew about or aided Robinson in the assassination. They have not said if the partner is among those being investigated but have publicly expressed appreciation for the partner sharing information.

The partner apparently never went to law enforcement after receiving the texts. Robinson remained on the run until the next night, when his parents recognized he was the person in a photo released by authorities and helped organize Robinson's peaceful surrender.

The partner was not named in the charging documents that contained a narrative of the shooting and made public Tuesday.

Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but Gray said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.”

Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Trump win back the White House in 2024. His political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through social media, his podcast and campus events.

Since the shooting, Trump has threatened to crack down on what he calls the “radical left” and classifying some groups as domestic terrorists.

While court documents said Robinson wrote in one text that planned the attack for more than a week, authorities have not said what they believe that entailed.

Gray declined to answer whether Robinson targeted Kirk for his anti-transgender views. Kirk was shot while taking a question that touched on mass shootings, gun violence and transgender people.

“That is for a jury to decide,” Gray said. 

Robinson was involved in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who investigators say is transgender. 

Robinson's mother told investigators that their son had turned hard left politically in the last year and became more supportive of gay and transgender rights, Gray said.

Robinson and his father had different political views, the prosecutor said, and Robinson told his partner in a text that his dad had become a “diehard MAGA” since Trump was elected.

Robinson's mother recognized him when authorities released a picture of the suspect and his parents confronted him, at which time Robinson said he wanted to kill himself, Gray said.

The family persuaded him to meet with a family friend who is a retired sheriff's deputy. That person was able to get Robinson to turn himself in, the prosecutor said. 

Robinson was arrested late Thursday near St. George, where he grew up about 240 miles (387 kilometers) southwest of the Utah Valley campus.

In a text exchange with his partner released by authorities, Robinson wrote about planning to get his rifle from his “drop point,” but that the area was “locked down.”

The texts cited in court documents did not include timestamps and it was unclear how long after the shooting Robinson was texting.

“To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you,” Robinson wrote in another text to his partner.

In addition to murder, Robinson was charged discharge of a firearm, obstructing justice and witness tampering. The prosecutor said Robinson had directed his partner to delete their text messages and stay silent if questioned by police, Gray said.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — More than 50 people have faced federal charges in Washington, D.C., since President Donald Trump's emergency law-and-order surge began last month. Already, prosecutors have dropped at least 11 of those cases, an unusually high collapse rate that judges say is wasting court resources.

The dismissals highlight the risks of Trump's emergency surge strategy: an unprecedented flood of arrests that has produced headline-grabbing numbers but faltered under judicial scrutiny, with some of the most serious cases — from assaults on federal agents to gun charges — unraveling before they ever reach trial.

On Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Matthew Sharbaugh dismissed two felony assault cases at the request of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office. He delivered a blunt warning from the bench as he questioned whether prosecutors are making charging decisions before cases are properly investigated and vetted.

“That's not the way it's supposed to work, and it has real-world consequences,” Sharbaugh said. “This is becoming a real concern for the court just given the sheer numbers.”

Judges aren't the only ones pushing back. Grand juries have refused to return indictments at least eight times in six separate cases, an extraordinarily rare rebuke that underscores skepticism about the strength of the evidence in surge prosecutions.

Trump claims his emergency 30-day deployment of federal agents and National Guard members is making the streets safer for District of Columbia residents.




One of the cases Sharbaugh dismissed involved Scott Pichon, accused of spitting on two members of the South Carolina Army National Guard outside Union Station on Aug. 22. Prosecutors dropped the felony assault count and instead charged him with misdemeanors in D.C. Superior Court, which handles local criminal matters.

The other case was against Paul Nguyen, accused of assaulting a federal agent who tried to break up a street fight on Aug. 23. Prosecutors abandoned that felony entirely, and Nguyen isn't facing any new charges.

Nguyen, who appeared in court wearing a sling, said his arm was broken during his arrest and that he spent five nights in jail before being released. 

“It was the scariest experience of my life,” he told reporters.

During separate hearings, Sharbaugh has asked prosecutors to explain why they were abandoning the felony charges against the two men. Prosecutors in both cases said the decision to drop the charges was made after reviewing the evidence. They didn't specify any particular problems with the evidence.

The White House says over 2,000 people have been arrested since the federal intervention started on Aug. 7. At least 52 people arrested on surge-related offenses have been charged in district court, according to an Associated Press review of court records. Many more surge cases have been filed in Superior Court.

“U.S. Attorney Pirro and her office, in charging over 1,700 cases, follow the evidence wherever it leads, constantly evaluating each case as it develops to rigorously follow the law and to bring swift justice — including a dismissal when it is in the interest of justice,” office spokesperson Tim Lauer said in a statement.

Sharbaugh, who was appointed last October, is one of four magistrate judges presiding over initial court appearances and detention hearings for people charged with surge-related offenses in district court.

Earlier this month, Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said leaders of Pirro's office have tarnished its reputation with how they are handling the deluge of cases. He said Pirro's office is routinely bringing cases that don't belong in federal court and needlessly keeping people in jail for days while they evaluate charges.

Pirro, a former Fox News host who was appointed by Trump in May, responded by accusing Faruqui, a former federal prosecutor, of allowing his personal politics to cloud his judicial judgment. She also criticized grand juries that separately refused to indict two people who were charged last month with threatening to kill Trump.

“The system here is broken on many levels,” Pirro said in a statement.

Watch live coverage of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. State visits in Britain blend 21st-century diplomacy with royal pageantry. King Charles III will host Trump at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before talks the next day with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

WINDSOR, England (AP) — President Donald Trump relished the glow of a British royal spectacle Wednesday, greeted at Windsor Castle on his state visit by King Charles III, military honor guards and mounted troops before paying a private tribute at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb.

Joined by first lady Melania Trump at St. George's Chapel on the castle grounds, the president placed a wreath in honor of Elizabeth, who died in 2022. Later, he sat with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, chief of staff Susie Wiles and other American officials for a musical performance from the chapel choir.

Trump's visit began with Prince William and his wife, Kate, meeting the presidential helicopter in the private Walled Garden on the vast Windsor estate, then walking the Trump over to be greeted by Charles and Queen Camilla. The castle is an almost 1,000-year-old royal residence of gilded interiors, crenelated towers and priceless artworks. A gigantic royal standard — the flag used for official celebration days — flew from the Royal Tower for the occasion.

The guests traveled to the castle in a procession of horse-drawn carriages, past ranks of soldiers, sailors and aviators. The king and the Republican president chatted in the Irish State Coach during the short journey to the castle quadrangle, where Trump, accompanied by Charles, inspected an honor guard of soldiers in red tunics and bearskin hats.

They continued to chat and joke together as the day progressed, with the king putting his hand on Trump's back a few times. Trump stepped in front of Charles during a review of troops, though the king had gestured, inviting the president to do so and avoiding a violation of protocol. That was not the case in 2019, when Trump stepped in front of Queen Elizabeth during his first state visit to Britain. 




No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has ever had the honor of a second U.K. state visit. The pomp and pageantry are deliberate, meant to bolster ties with Trump at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements around the globe. For the grandeur-loving president, festivities involved 120 horses and 1,300 troops — including the largest guard of honor in living memory. 

An opening day full of ceremony and good feelings will give way to the real work Thursday when Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meet, with the stakes high for the host country. 

The president and Charles also toured the Royal Collection Display in an ornate room where officials laid out five tables of artifacts on U.S.-British relations. 

Among the items were 18th-century watercolors and documents on the United States seeking independence from King George III. There were materials from the first trans-Atlantic cable, including messages between Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan, as well as a 1930s hot dog picnic that a young Elizabeth wrote about, and a large glass vessel that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the queen during a 1957 state visit. 

“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents on U.S. independence.

“That's fascinating,” Charles said.

The president, first lady, king and queen also walked a red carpet on the castle's East Lawn to watch the Beating Retreat, a military parade ceremony that featured 200-plus musicians and dates to the 1600s. Such proceedings were once used to call patrolling soldiers back to their castle at the end of their day.

A scheduled flyover by F-35 jets from the U.K. and U.S. militaries was scrapped due to poor weather conditions. But the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's aerobatics display team, thundered overhead, leaving streaks of red, white and blue smoke in their wake and drawing a visible reaction from both Trumps. 

Charles and Camilla presented the president and first lady with a handbound leather volume celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Union flag that flew above Buckingham Palace on the day of Trump's inauguration in January. The royals also gave first lady Melania Trump a silver and enamel bowl and a personalized handbag by British designer Anya Hindmarch. 

Trump gave Charles a replica of an Eisenhower sword, and Camilla received a vintage Tiffany & Co. gold, diamond and ruby brooch.

The royals' history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet joining them. Invitations handed out at the request of the elected government are a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions from reluctant allies.

In his talks with Trump, Starmer will promote a new U.K.-U.S. technology agreement. The British government hopes the deal, and billions in investment from U.S. tech companies, will help show that the trans-Atlantic bond remains strong despite differences over Ukraine, the Middle East and the future of NATO.

British officials are hoping to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. Days before the state visit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, over the diplomat's past friendship with the convicted sex offender.

On Tuesday, the campaign group Led By Donkeys projected an image of Trump and Epstein on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president's relationship with the late American financier. Police said they arrested four people.

Also Wednesday, Trump was having a private lunch followed by a state banquet in the evening. The president will not address a joint session of Parliament, as French President Emmanuel Macron did in July during his state visit. 

Most state visits are in London, home to Buckingham Palace and the broad, flag-lined boulevard known as The Mall. But this one is in Windsor, a historic town of just over 30,000 people about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of central London.

That makes it easier to control protests and protect Trump at a time of increased international tensions, especially after the fatal shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk last week in Utah. British police have undertaken a massive security operation to ensure Trump's safety. 

That did not stop thousands of demonstrators who marched through central London on Wednesday to protest Trump's visit. Some held banners that said “No to the racism, no to Trump.” Though the activities were smaller than during Trump's visit in June 2019, they included mini versions of the giant Trump baby blimp, an orange-tinted caricature of the president in a diaper that made a big impression during those demonstrations six years ago.

Historian Robert Lacey, a consultant on the Netflix television series “The Crown,” said Windsor is also a more “photogenic setting” for a state visit than London.

“Buckingham Palace has got its balcony, it's got its façade,” he said. But “inside it's very dreary and it's currently being renovated, which is one reason why Mr. Trump will not be staying there. Windsor is a proper castle.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Susan Monarez will tell senators that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pressured her to endorse new vaccine recommendations before seeing scientific evidence, according to a copy of the testimony she plans to give during a Wednesday hearing.

According to a copy of the prepared remarks, obtained Tuesday by The Associated Press, Monarez will tell senators that Kennedy gave her an ultimatum: “Preapprove” new vaccine recommendations from a controversial advisory CDC panel that Kennedy has stocked with some medical experts who doubt vaccine safety or be fired. That panel is expected to vote on new vaccine recommendations later this week. 

Monarez, initially handpicked by Kennedy and nominated by President Donald Trump, was fired just weeks into the job over disagreements on vaccine policies. She is set to appear before the Senate's powerful health committee to discuss her firing. 

“Even under pressure, I could not replace evidence with ideology or compromise my integrity,” Monarez will say in her opening testimony to senators. “Vaccine policy must be guided by credible data, not predetermined outcomes.”

She said she was “fired for holding the line on scientific integrity.”

Monarez also notes that Kennedy directed her to fire a number of high-ranking CDC officials without cause. 

The Senate hearing will focus on the impact the turmoil at the nation's leading public health agency, which is responsible for making vaccine recommendations to the public, will have on children's health. It will also undoubtedly serve as an opportunity for Monarez and former Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, who will also testify before the committee, to respond to a number of Kennedy's contentious claims about their final days at the agency. 




Kennedy has denied Monarez' accusations that he ordered “rubber-stamped” vaccine recommendations. 

He has described Monarez as admitting to him that she is “untrustworthy,” a claim Monarez has denied through her attorney. He did, however, acknowledge during a testy Senate hearing earlier this month that he ordered Monarez to fire several top officials at the CDC. 

The Senate hearing is taking place just a day before the vaccine panel starts its two-day session in Atlanta to discuss shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox. It's unclear how the panel might vote on the recommendations, though members have raised doubts about whether hepatitis B shots administered to newborns are necessary and have suggested that COVID-19 recommendations should be more restricted. 

The CDC director must endorse those recommendations before they become official. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill, now serving as the CDC's acting director, will be responsible for that. 

Monarez and Houry are expected to face tense questions from Republicans over the CDC's vaccine recommendations and COVID-19 policies. Democrats, meanwhile, are likely to seek more information on Kennedy's approach to vaccines. 

The health committee's hearing will be overseen by Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who cast a key vote for Kennedy's confirmation. He has expressed concern about “serious allegations” at the CDC and has called for oversight, without blaming Kennedy.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — President Claudia Sheinbaum became the first female leader to preside over Mexico's independence celebrations in 215 years, with a message that she won't accept foreign intervention, a significant statement as she negotiates pressure from the United States.

Sheinbaum led a traditional ceremony from the balcony of the National Palace in Mexico City known as the “grito,” or “shout” in English, Monday night. It's an annual tradition when on Sept. 15, the president rings a bell marking the call to arms during the 1810-1821 fight to win independence from Spain.

Independence Day is formally celebrated Sept. 16, but the “grito” ceremony has been performed the night before for over a century.

A traditional military parade followed Tuesday, and Sheinbaum reiterated that “No foreign power makes decisions for us.”

In a speech before her Cabinet and thousands of soldiers, Sheinbaum added that “no interference is possible in our homeland” and although she didn't mention any particular country, her words come at a moment when the U.S government has asked Mexico to do more to crack down on drug cartels and strengthen border security.

U.S. President Donald Trump 's administration has even offered to send U.S. troops to fight cartels, some of them declared as terrorist organizations by his government, but Sheinbaum has repeatedly rejected it.

Her administration has been more aggressive in pursuing the cartels than her predecessor, handing over dozens of cartel figures to American authorities and pointing to lower fentanyl seizures at the U.S. border. But Sheinbaum insists that the actions have been carried out because they're good for Mexico, not because of U.S. pressure.

Sheinbaum took power in October as Mexico's first female president.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversy surrounding Ilhan Omar's controversial Charlie Kirk comments.

There is no thermostat in the U.S. Capitol.

Only thermometers.

And that's why congressional leaders are struggling to lower the temperatures in Congress after the murder of Charlie Kirk.

As a veteran congressional reporter, I lost count of how many efforts I witnessed to try to ""lower the temperature"" around Capitol Hill after a national tragedy.

Oh, they might knock a degree off the mercury for a few weeks here and there – sometimes helped by a political cold front (e.g. a lengthy congressional recess). But just like in meteorology, the political gales blow. Weather systems develop. There are dips in the jet stream. Droughts parch the political landscape. Alberta Clippers race through in November and December. All of this results in inevitable thaws. So after some solace, it usually isn't long until a Category 5 hurricane churns off the Capitol Hill coast.

The temperature then skyrockets.

In meteorology, there are always temperature ""norms."" Yes, it's seasonal to climb into the mid-90s in Washington, D.C., in August. But not unheard of to have high temperatures in just the mid-70s like this year. Those are the anomalies.

The same with Congress. The typical ""seasonal"" temperature on Capitol Hill always spikes toward 100 degrees. Even during the frigid calendar days of January and February.

To wit: There were raucous episodes on Capitol Hill in the mid 1990s after Republicans seized control of the House, which nearly devolved into fistfights. A national tragedy didn't spur the contretemps. It was an electoral one. That fueled a visceral distrust between Republicans and Democrats. It was augmented by the fact that Republicans won control of the House in 1994 for the first time in four decades.

Results at the ballot box sparked those skirmishes. But it was violence and calamity that stoked many of the embers on Capitol Hill.

Members sought to quiet things after two Capitol Police officers were shot and killed in 1998.

But the temperature shot back up.

The same with 9/11. The fourth plane that eventually crashed in Shanksville, Pa., was destined for the U.S. Capitol. After the immediate threat subsided, bipartisan members gathered on the Capitol steps and spontaneously sang ""God Bless America.""

That moment emerged as an indelible, uplifting moment on one of the most horrific days in American history.

But the temperature shot back up.

Tea Party protesters encircled the Capitol in 2010 as Democrats attempted to pass Obamacare. Vile phone calls and threats flooded congressional phone lines. Lawmakers called for calm in an effort to quiet the vitriol.

But the temperature shot back up.

A gunman killed six people and seriously wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and future Rep. Ron Barber, D-Ariz., in 2011.

Members dialed back the rhetoric.

But the temperature shot back up.

Capitol Police officers were injured during a high-speed chase around the congressional complex during the 2013 government shutdown. Lawmakers again demanded calm. In fact, lawmakers found the injury of the officers working to protect them – yet not receiving a paycheck – so sobering that it prompted them to re-open the government.

But the temperature shot back up.

A gunman shot House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., during a congressional baseball practice in 2017, in Alexandria, Va.

People chilled out.

But the temperature shot back up.

The Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol is one of the most onerous days in congressional history. Leaders again insisted on peace.

However, there was nearly a fistfight in the rear of the chamber not long after the House reconvened after the mayhem in the wee hours of Jan. 7.

Again came the demands for you know what.

But the temperature shot back up.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is the latest congressional leader to face the arduous task to lower the temperature after the assassination of Kirk. House members bowed their heads in a moment of silence. When Johnson rapped the gavel, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., asked Johnson for a verbal prayer. She said silent prayer didn't get results.

""Is there someone who could lead us in a moment of prayer out loud for Charlie and his family?"" inquired Boebert as Johnson tried to shush the chamber.

She also mentioned ""victims in Colorado,"" referring to a shooting at a Colorado high school the same day.

Grumbling and groans filled the chamber as Boebert tried to speak.

""Wait a minute. Wait a minute,"" Johnson said from the dais. ""The House will be in order.""

Johnson tried to quiet the sniping back and forth across the aisle.

""The House will be in order!"" hollered Johnson as the din rose in the chamber.

Both Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., and Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., continued yelling.

""The House will be in order!"" thundered a now angry Johnson.

The speaker slammed down the gavel and stared daggers toward the Democratic side of the chamber.

You see the pattern.

It is seemingly always the same on Capitol Hill. The pattern never seems to change. Yes, you may have days in the 70s during the dog days of August in Washington. But the temperature eventually returns to the upper 90s. That's the political norm on Capitol Hill.

The question is, ""Will it ever change?""

It's hard to see things ""changing."" If they were going to ""change,"" that probably would have happened after 9/11, the Giffords attack, the baseball practice shooting or Jan. 6. Any one of those catastrophes could have served as an impetus to ""change"" things on Capitol Hill. 

One would think. But there's been no change in the political climate.

That's partially because there's been so much turnover in the membership on Capitol Hill. Even since Jan. 6, Congress has witnessed staggering turnover. Twenty-seven House members are now poised to retire at the end of this term. The usual number at this stage in the cycle is 16. So whoever was here for these demands for calm after the Kirk shooting probably won't be here when there's the next cataclysm. So many of the people who may have helped calm things down after Giffords or 9/11 aren't here anymore. That bolsters the volatility.

There's a high level of mistrust now between lawmakers. And the toxicity of social media doesn't help.

There is no regulator on Capitol Hill. But lawmakers can individually serve as their own thermostat. And if they set their own internal temperature, the mercury may drop. They could create their own congressional cold front.

But the question is for how long?

You already know the answer to that.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on President Donald Trump's name change of the Department of Defense on ‘The Story.'

The Pentagon unveiled a new overhaul of grooming standards to further ensure service members are ‘clean-shaven' this week. 

War Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that troops needing a medical exemption can retain facial hair for one year as long as they are following a plan to treat the condition. After that, they must remove facial hair or face separation. 

""The Department must remain vigilant in maintaining the grooming standards which underpin the warrior ethos,"" Hegseth wrote in an Aug. 20 memo made public on Monday. 

Leadership will also be required to conduct a review of how grooming standards have changed over the last decade.

""The grooming standard set by the U.S. military is to be clean-shaven and neat in presentation for a proper military appearance,"" Hegseth said, according to the statement by chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell.

""Commanders must apply consistent criteria and appropriately consider the department's interests in safety and uniformity when authorizing individual exceptions,"" Parnell added.

The memo did not mention whether troops would still be allowed to sport a mustache, as they have been for decades. Hegseth's office did not return a request for clarification in time for publication. 

Most shaving waivers are for troops diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae, or PFB, a condition where the hair curls back toward the skin after shaving and causes irritation. 

After a year with a medical exemption, soldiers must begin shaving again or face separation. (iStock)

HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND

Hegseth's memo did not address religious accommodations. The Army began granting beard exemptions in 2017 after pressure from Sikh soldiers, for whom uncut facial hair is a religious requirement.

Some troops soon tested the policy's boundaries. In 2018, one soldier won approval for a beard by claiming adherence to the Norse Pagan faith, identifying himself as a Heathen.

The new standard for all service members is ""clean-shaven"" – but it's unclear if that applies to mustaches too.  (Yauhen Yerchak/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)

In 2019, Army Spc. John Hoskins pushed the limits by applying for a religious exemption and claiming to belong to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a faith known as ""Pastafarianism.""  He was denied. 

The Army announced an update to its grooming standards this week, also defining authorized hairstyles and ponytail lengths for female soldiers, who are permitted to wear only clear nail polish.

Ecuador has declared a 60-day state of emergency in seven provinces after clashes over the government's removal of a $1.1 billion diesel subsidy. (Reuters.)

Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa on Tuesday implemented a 60-day state of emergency in an attempt to quell massive protests that broke out following his surprise removal of a diesel subsidy last week.

The decree was issued across seven of the nation's two dozen provinces following ""severe internal disturbance"" and mobilized armed forces and national police.

The U.S. embassy in Ecuador said in a statement that the forces were mobilized in order to ""to prevent the interruption of public services and maintain freedom of movement for the general population.""

4 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE YOUNG CONSERVATIVE ANTI-CRIME PRESIDENT OF ECUADOR WHO WAS JUST RE-ELECTED

""The declaration does not restrict public movement or institute a curfew, but it does suspend the right to freedom of assembly at all times for any gatherings that seek to interrupt public services and impede the rights and liberties of the rest of the population,"" the embassy added. 

Footage of the protests showed Ecuadorians clashing with police forces in the capital city of Quito on Tuesday as protesters dismantled fences and barriers while police fired tear gas in the streets. 

Despite the unrest, the State Department has not adjusted its travel advisory status, which currently advises Americans to ""exercise increased caution"" and avoid large crowds where violence could erupt. 

The ongoing clashes came after the government on Friday announced it would eliminate the nation's diesel subsidy starting Saturday and redirect the funds to social programs in an attempt to alleviate the country's straining finances.

""For decades, the diesel subsidy represented a $1.1 billion burden on fiscal accounts, without truly reaching those who needed it,"" the government said on X.

The decree drove up the price of diesel overnight from $1.80 a gallon to $2.80 – ending a decades-old subsidy in a move previously attempted but publicly opposed during prior administrations. 

The government has argued the subsidy was not being adequately distributed and disproportionately benefited higher-income individuals and business sectors more than it was aiding vulnerable populations.  

Noboa's administration said it will use funds saved from the subsidy removal and allocate $220 million towards the transportation sector to prevent fare increases in public transportation.

But Ecuadorians remain concerned that it will directly impact the pockets of the nation's poorest. 

A price stabilization mechanism will be implemented on Dec. 11, reported Reuters, in a move to protect consumers from global price swings, though details on the plan remain unclear.

Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss Congress' plans after returning from August recess amid shutdown concerns.  

Senate Republicans are calling foul on Senate Democrats' opposition to the GOP's short-term plan to keep the government funded, calling it hypocritical. 

House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their seven-week funding extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR), which congressional Republicans argue is as ""clean"" as can be. That means that the bill largely lacks any additional spending or policy riders.

But Senate Democrats have dug in deep on their rejection of the proposal, increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown come Sept. 30. It comes after Democrats previously warned Republicans not to use government funding as a political weapon when Democrats were in charge of the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., will ultimately need Democrats to pass a government funding patch.

He argued that under former President Joe Biden's administration, Senate Democrats overwhelmingly voted for 13 CRs.

""Ninety-six percent of the Democrats voted for all 13 of those,"" Thune said. ""This is, again, a new practice that's been invented because of Trump Derangement Syndrome, and because these Democrats hate giving this president anything.""  

Senate Republicans are now titling the possibility of a partial government shutdown as a ""Schumer Shutdown,"" given Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus' unwillingness to support the GOP-authored bill.

""Now, all of a sudden, they can't vote for it? It's ridiculous,"" Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., told Fox News Digital. ""That's exactly where they're coming from, and it should be called the ‘Schumer Shutdown.'""

HOUSE REPUBLICANS SPLIT WITH TRUMP TEAM OVER 'VERY FRUSTRATING' FUNDING FIGHT AS SHUTDOWN LOOMS

When asked why Democrats were entrenched against the Republicans' bill, given their previous push for clean stopgaps, Schumer argued that ""we're in a much different situation"" after the GOP passed President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" the $9 billion clawback of foreign aid and public broadcasting funding, and the administration's move to claw back an additional $5 billion in foreign aid.

He also ripped Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., for not sitting down with him and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to negotiate a spending deal. Thune countered that his office is right around the corner from Schumer's.

""They even refuse to have bipartisan negotiations,"" Schumer said. ""We've always had bipartisan negotiations on this. Johnson put his bill in. No Democratic input, and that is why the Republicans are heading for us for a shutdown. We don't want it.""

Part of the disagreement with the bill also stemmed from Trump's edict that Republicans shouldn't ""even bother"" with Democrats and that ""we have to get Republican votes.""

Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, told Fox News Digital that all Democrats needed was for Trump ""to take back what he said about the process needing to be more partisan rather than less.""

""If they go it alone, then it's not unreasonable for us to say, ‘We wish you the best, but you won't be getting our votes,'"" Schatz said. 

Despite the saber-rattling, they haven't said precisely what they dislike about the House GOP's offering. They say it's not so much about what's in the bill, but rather what's not.

The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told Fox News Digital that it was a ""lack of language on impoundments and the pocket rescission, things like that that we've been talking about.""

The other part is that the CR does not contain an extension to ObamaCare premium subsidies passed during the COVID-19 pandemic that are set to expire in December.

Democrats argue that an extension should be attached to the stopgap because insurance providers are teeing up new insurance rates ahead of the Nov. 1 open enrollment start date for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, argued that lawmakers could wait until November to move on an extension.

""You can wait,"" Collins said. ""Because… they can keep the eligibility criteria steady for next year and have the revised eligibility.""

While Schumer and Democrats are expected to give Thune headaches throughout the ordeal, he may have to wrangle some fiscal hawks weary of CRs on his side of the aisle, too.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., argued that the spending levels set in the House GOP's bill were the same as those set under Biden, which Republicans ""all decried in the election.""

""So any Republican who votes for this, I guess maybe they should apologize to Biden for being against his spending levels,"" Paul said. ""Because they're actually voting for his spending levels now.""

And Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., told Fox News Digital that he hadn't thoroughly reviewed the text of the bill yet, but he noted he was not typically a fan of funding extensions.

""The goal was always that we start having a real budgeting process, and so it's really frustrating that we haven't done that,"" he said.

During the pandemic, someone shared a meme of President Donald Trump in his gilded New York apartment. Near him, first lady Melania Trump draped herself over a piano, while their son, Baron Trump, sat astride a stuffed tiger. The image was accompanied by a question: “If Trump got Covid and lost his sense of taste, how could you tell?”

It was a wittier jab than most, for the president has an excessive love of gilt. As with his massive flags flying on the White House lawn, his attitude is that if something is good, more of it is better. 

Gold accents recently applied by Trump glitter all over the Oval Office and show that the president doesn't tend toward dignified restraint, and doesn't indeed do anything by halves. 

HUGO GURDON: ON FLAG BURNING, THE RIGHT IS WORKING FOR THE LEFT

So much, so obvious — and so helpful to the British government in preparing for Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom. It is giving him as much gold-plated grandeur, pomp, circumstance, and ceremony as possible, as only the British know how.

Along with his strong Anglophilia, the president inherited a love of the monarchy from his Scottish mother, and this presents U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a gift of an opportunity, on a silver platter, to flatter the president. In addition to practical and beneficial deals on nuclear power, artificial intelligence, and other technology to be finalized at their summit on Thursday, the prime minister wants to smooth away American scowls at his suppression of free speech and his degenerate reward of terrorism via recognition of a Palestinian state.

Starmer's government directed King Charles III to invite Trump, which is how things work in a constitutional monarchy, and then delivered the handwritten royal billet doux during his last visit to the Oval Office. This drew a delighted “wow” from the president.

The king is hosting Trump at Windsor Castle, a massive, grey, medieval, hilltop pile that is the monarch's preeminent royal residence outside London. Household guards' regiments — infantry in brilliant red tunics and bearskins, and cavalry in plumes and cuirasses — will parade before the president. There will be cannon fire, salutes, and a military flyover. There will be medals, white ties, black swallow coattails, and the grandest of gilded state banquets.

The president will thus get an enormous dollop of Anglo ceremonial — that's how the British do their love-bombing — which Starmer and the king hope and expect will be reciprocated with a floodtide of Trumpian goodwill.

All this raises the question of whether Trump loves monarchy so much that he wants to be a king. It is interesting to consider the Democrats' short-lived and fatuous message along these lines while Trump rubs shoulders with royalty. Is there any connection between Trump's taste for the trappings of authority, his expectation that underlings will fawn on him, and his supposed dislike of democracy and threat to it?

Blue party leaders dropped this suggestion swiftly when polling showed the public was not buying it, although a few bitter clingers in the base naturally continued for some months to parrot the line that had been fed to them.

But critics who depict everything Trump does as a threat to democracy — their taste for garish rhetoric is comparable or worse than his — deliberately confuse two connected but different things.

Yes, Trump is indeed neither steeped nor interested in the forms of constitutional republican government. As a lifelong business executive, he is frustrated by the repeatedly established fact that he cannot just order something to be done and it is so. But it is a big leap from there to suggest, as so many do, that he is dismantling American democracy. His dislike of and irritation with proper procedures that thwart him does not, to a reasonable and unbiased judge, merge into a plan to wreck our republic and make the last election literally the last election.

Trump has issued more executive orders than any president before, but many of them are part of a well-conceived plan to prod and divine the proper boundaries of executive authority. The orders are often pitched modestly, as with the recent flag burning order to take whatever action is allowed by law. When it is uncertain what the law does and does not allow, Trump wants to create test cases that, in many cases, will roll back incursions on executive authority by unelected bureaucrats.

CHINA, SCIENCE, AND TRADE TOP TRUMP'S UK PRIORITIES

He is not acting like a king, by which even in this age of circumscribed constitutional monarchs, people think of as an absolute ruler. He is trying to ensure that he gets as much as possible of his democratically approved agenda done and does not preemptively stymie himself by assuming constitutional barriers are properly erected where the deep state has been throwing them up for the past several generations.Trump's modus operandi is not to many people's taste. It is hardly to mine. But he and his voters are not interested in allowing or facilitating continued genteel decline. It's to his credit that he is ready to be called crass if that's the price of restoring the nation. Or, as former President Barack Obama put it, of getting America out of the ditch where the other side drove it off the road.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Attorney General Pam Bondi asserted she would go after “hate speech” on Monday, but the speech the Justice Department can prosecute is extremely limited, according to legal experts.

Bondi, who partially walked back her statement on Tuesday, made her initial comments on the Katie Miller Podcast, vowing to go after “hate speech” and asserting it has “no place” in society, “especially” after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last week.

“We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech,” Bondi said on the podcast.

The attorney general faced immense backlash from the left and the right over her comments, prompting her to clarify the remarks, which were widely interpreted as calling for unlawful prosecutions, on Tuesday morning.

Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime. For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over.Under 18 U.S.C. §…

“Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It's a crime. For far too long, we've watched the radical left normalize threats, call for assassinations, and cheer on political violence. That era is over,” Bondi wrote in a post on X Tuesday.

Jonathan Adler, a professor at William & Mary Law School, told the Washington Examiner that despite Bondi's attempt to adjust her statement, it does not change that “hate speech” is not a prosecutable offense.

“She's basically trying to backfill,” Adler said. “Yes, true threats and incitement can be prosecuted. But that does not mean ‘hate speech,' as such, can be prosecuted. Plenty of awful, hateful speech comes nowhere close to being incitement or a true threat.”

In the United States, there is no legal definition of “hate speech,” but the term has typically been used to define speech expressing animosity or bigotry toward particular groups of people.

Carolyn Iodice, legislative and policy director for the pro-free speech group FIRE, told the Washington Examiner that the law does not allow the DOJ to bring criminal or civil charges for that kind of speech.

“Hate speech is not a legal concept, and there's no First Amendment exception for it,” Iodice said.

The First Amendment, which prevents the government from making laws that abridge freedom of expression, has regularly been found to broadly protect free speech when challenges reach the Supreme Court. One of the most recent cases includes the high court's 2017 decision in Matal v Tam, in which the justices ruled that a law preventing trademarks of disparaging terms was unconstitutional under the First Amendment.

Casey Mattox, a constitutional lawyer and vice president for legal strategy at Stand Together, told the Washington Examiner that while some speech is abhorrent, it does not mean it is illegal.

“I think people have seen plenty of examples over the last week, and for a long time, there's plenty of speech that all Americans should reject,” Mattox said. “But that doesn't mean it can be prosecuted as hate speech, because that's just not a thing.”

Bondi later attempted to qualify her comments by citing U.S. code outlawing threats against public officials, members of Congress, or their families, along with a law outlawing transmitting messages that contain “any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.” She also claimed other sweeping types of speech were unlawful.

“You cannot call for someone's murder. You cannot swat a Member of Congress. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as ‘free speech.' These acts are punishable crimes, and every single threat will be met with the full force of the law. Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence,” Bondi said in her Tuesday X post.

The narrow exception to free speech that the Justice Department can prosecute is incitement or threats of imminent harm, but these exceptions are incredibly limited. Incitement and threats of imminent harm would need to be specific toward someone and at a specific time rather than vague wishes of someone's death or celebrations of someone's death.

“It's not just death aspirations, but death threats,” Mattox said. “So even being happy that people died – as reprehensible as it is – is not a death threat, or even being happy that someone would die. That is a terrible, disgusting thing, but it's also not prosecutable, it's not illegal.”

Iodice also argued that the exceptions are “extremely narrow,” but not everything Bondi listed is necessarily unlawful depending on whether it reaches the level of incitement or an imminent threat of harm.

“She's right to say that speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is not protected, assuming she means true threats,” Iodice told the Washington Examiner. “But then she goes on to list all sorts of things that would not cross the line into true threats.”

Mattox noted that the First Amendment's “very explicit” nature of protecting speech is important for upholding it as a principle and added that the Supreme Court has ensured that the exceptions to it are “very, very limited.”

FBI INVESTIGATING MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE IN DISCORD GROUP TIED TO CHARLIE KIRK MURDER SUSPECT

The Justice Department continued to step back from Bondi's initial statement on Tuesday, noting it would not go after “nasty speech” but only true incitements of violence.

“We are not prosecuting people for nasty speech alone — but true incitement to violence, or hate-motivated attacks, are illegal and will be treated as such by this DOJ,” Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a post on X Tuesday.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Justice Department announced on Tuesday that it had sued Maine and Oregon for failing to relinquish voter registration lists. 

The DOJ claimed both states violated federal law by not complying with requests to turn over voter registration lists, particularly information about ineligible voters in each state, the Associated Press reported. The DOJ also accused Oregon of failing to provide specific and relevant information on how the state keeps accurate voter lists.

The lawsuit represents the first action the DOJ has taken to obtain voter information from states to ensure election integrity and eliminate any voter fraud, if it exists. It is believed the DOJ has requested information from at least 26 states, according to the Associated Press.

Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division said the actions were being taken to ensure that states were complying with federal voting laws and that all people had equal access to “ballots in federal elections.”

“States simply cannot pick and choose which federal laws they will comply with, including our voting laws, which ensure that all American citizens have equal access to the ballot in federal elections,” Dhillon said in a press release.

“American citizens have a right to feel confident in the integrity of our electoral process, and the refusal of certain states to protect their citizens against vote dilution will result in legal consequences,” read Dhillon's statement.

Representatives for the secretary of state's offices in Oregon and Maine told the Associated Press on Tuesday they had not yet received the lawsuit.

Oregon Secretary of State Tobias Read expressed concern over the DOJ's request for voter information and said he would protect the privacy of his state's residents. He threatened to sue the Trump administration over the request. 

“If the President wants to use the DOJ to go after his political opponents and undermine our elections, I look forward to seeing them in court,” said Read in a statement. “I stand by my oath to the people of Oregon, and I will protect their rights and privacy.”

FOREIGN LEADERS REMEMBER CHARLIE KIRK AS DEFENDER OF FREEDOM AFTER ACTIVIST'S ASSASSINATION

Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the initiative “absurd” and touted her state's record in holding elections.

“Maine has some of the best elections in the nation,” Bellows said in a statement on Tuesday. “It is absurd that the Department of Justice is targeting our state when Republican and Democratic Secretaries all across the country are fighting back against this federal abuse of power just like we are.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Attorney General Pam Bondi is once again in trouble with her own party over her promise to prosecute “hate speech,” with concerns over free speech rivaling the criticism she faced over her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.

On Tuesday, Bondi qualified her statement that the Justice Department would “go after you if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.” She narrowed the scope to cases in which the speech incites violence, listing examples of when the government might prosecute from her X account.

But her initial comments, made Monday in light of the Charlie Kirk assassination, set off a bipartisan backlash and calls for her resignation.

“I would fire her for this or I'd give her a few hours to fix it and then go take a remedial course in the First Amendment,” David Keating, the president of the Institute for Free Speech, told the Washington Examiner.

“I'm speechless that the chief law enforcement officer of the United States would get the First Amendment so badly wrong,” Keating added. “I understand her anger, but I don't excuse this kind of statement.”

Those criticisms were especially pronounced among conservatives, who have previously questioned Bondi's competence after she moved to end the investigation into disgraced financier Epstein. Her Justice Department released a memo in July denying the existence of a “client list,” which seemed to contradict her earlier statements.

She faced further blowback over the release of a tape meant to put to bed speculation that Epstein was killed in his prison cell, rather than died by suicide. Her explanation of a “missing minute” in the footage was later contradicted by the release of a more complete tape afterward.

“Between this ‘hate speech' nonsense and Epstein, Pam Bondi has committed two of the most egregious errors we've ever seen from an Attorney General,” conservative commentator Matt Walsh wrote on social media. “How many seismic f— ups will Trump permit her before he cuts her loose?”

Between this “hate speech” nonsense and Epstein, Pam Bondi has committed two of the most egregious errors we've ever seen from an Attorney General. How many seismic fuck ups will Trump permit her before he cuts her loose? Is this a ten strikes and you're out deal or what?

The Epstein criticism died down during August as Democrats, who seized on the MAGA-fueled scrutiny, returned to their districts for a monthlong recess and Trump's National Guard takeover of Washington took the national spotlight.

But her comments on hate speech invited a rare break between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the administration and fresh questions about her tenure at the Justice Department.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), a libertarian, criticized “Hate speech” as a “term used by those in power to describe thoughts they don't want spoken,” calling it “antithetical to the First Amendment.”

“Hate speech” is a term used by those in power to describe thoughts they don't want spoken. It's antithetical to the First Amendment. https://t.co/KjIihyt85t

“‘Hate' speech – as even a concept – is a tool of leftists and tyrants… certainly not conservatives,” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) also wrote on social media.

“Hate” speech – as even a concept – is a tool of leftists and tyrants… certainly not conservatives.

Trump appeared to defend Bondi on Tuesday morning as he departed the White House for his second state visit to the United Kingdom.

When an ABC reporter asked about her remarks, Trump said, “Probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly with hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart.”

“ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they'll have to go after you,” he added.

Republicans on Capitol Hill also backed Bondi's qualified statement that speech inciting violence should be prosecuted.

“There's no constitutional protected right to incite people to violence,” he said. “I don't care who it is, whether it's people on the right or people on the left,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said.

This is not the first time the Trump administration has caused upset on the Right. Before Kirk's death, the White House had been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for an executive order aimed at punishing flag burning. With that order, the administration narrowed the scope of prosecution to those who incite violence or “lawless action” while burning a flag.

Jacob Mchangama, executive director of the Future of Free Speech, told the Washington Examiner he “completely” understood why “people are repulsed” by those celebrating Kirk's death, but underscored that “there's a difference between moral condemnation and criminal persecution.” 

“What I think is particularly ironic is that this administration has been, and I think rightfully so, critical of European democracies for going after hate speech,” Mchangama said. “That speaks to the incoherence of this and inherent danger in a polarized America that free speech becomes this political prop that each side can use whenever it suits its agenda and then disregard when it doesn't.”

Mchangama noted that, shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed an order to “restore free speech and ensure that no federal government official would violate the First Amendment.”

“A lot of people on the Right voted for Trump because he promised to sort of do away with at least the cancel culture part of it,” he said. “It unfortunately mirrors cancel culture from the left. We all remember the days when James Bennett had to leave The New York Times for publishing an op-ed by Tom Cotton, and you basically couldn't say much that questioned the prevailing narrative around racial justice in the country without facing consequences, and lots of people lost their jobs.”

In terms of Bondi's remarks, Alex Morey, a specialist at Freedom Forum First Amendment, said that the First Amendment has “well-defined” exceptions, including true threats and incitement, that “balance free speech rights with the harm some types of speech can cause by regulating conduct rather than unpopular content.”

“Any hate speech regulation focuses solely on content and by default, requires politicians to make personal value judgements about which views are good or bad,” Morey told the Washington Examiner. “No one person or political party can do this in a principled way.”

Aaron Terr, public advocacy director for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, agreed, reiterating that “the assassination of Charlie Kirk was a tragedy and a violent rejection of the values of free speech and open debate.”

“Unfortunately, instead of reaffirming those values, the Trump administration is threatening to undermine them by cracking down on so-called ‘hate speech' about Kirk or his death,” Terr told the Washington Examiner. “But one of the First Amendment's most basic principles is that the government cannot censor speech simply because officials or the majority find it hateful or offensive. History and other countries' experience show why: ‘hate speech' is a vague concept that officials predictably exploit to suppress dissent.”

He continued: “That's why everyone should be deeply wary of the administration's next steps.”

Bondi's comments, made on the Katie Miller Podcast, reflect the more aggressive tone the Trump administration is taking after Kirk was killed at an event in Utah, in particular toward left-wing groups that Trump and his advisers have claimed have fomented violence.

PATEL TO BE GRILLED OVER HANDLING OF CHARLIE KIRK CASE AFTER RUMBLINGS OF DISCONTENT

“Focused anger, righteous anger directed for a just cause, is one of the most important agents of change in human history,” White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Vice President JD Vance during a tribute taping of The Charlie Kirk Show podcast. “We are going to channel all of the anger that we have to uproot and dismantle these terrorist networks.”

“With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the [Department of Justice], [Department of Homeland Security], and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks,” Miller said. “It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name.”

Xp Lee won a special election in Minnesota on Tuesday to replace Melissa Hortman, the former speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives who was assassinated in June. She was the top Democrat in the House.

Lee is a former city councilman of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. He easily defeated his Republican opponent, a real estate agent, Ruth Bittner, winning 60.9% of the vote to Bittner's 39.1% in a heavily Democratic district. He will now be the representative from Minnesota State House District 34B.

Lee said he would work hard to honor Hortman's legacy in a speech after his election victory.

“I have never lost sight of the situation that brought us to this moment, and I will work hard every day to carry forward Speaker Melissa Hortman's legacy,” read Lee's statement. “We did our best to make her proud: knocking on doors daily, making phone calls, and texting every neighbor we could.”

TIM WALZ TO SEEK THIRD TERM AS MINNESOTA GOVERNOR

Rep. Zack Stephenson, Hortman's successor as top Democrat, applauded Lee's victory and acknowledged it restored his party's caucus to full representation. This is important, Stephenson suggested, because it is believed Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) wants to call a special session to address the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis in August, reported the Associated Press. The shooting left two students dead and 21 people injured. Stephenson said Democrats having full representation will help them “prioritize” the safety of children in schools.

“That means we'll prioritize the safety of our kids instead of access to weapons of war, and we'll make our economy work better for all Minnesotans, not just the billionaires,” Stephenson said.

POLITICAL VIOLENCE ON THE RISE IN THE US: A TIMELINE OF KEY INCIDENTS

According to reports, Lee will be sworn into office after the election results have been certified. His election means that Minnesota's State House will have an even split of Democrats and Republicans, with each party holding 67 seats. As a result, both parties will continue a power-sharing agreement that Hortman brokered after the 2024 election, in which Democrats lost their majority, the Associated Press reported.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's former chief medical officer who recently submitted her resignation due to disagreements over how Kennedy is overseeing the agency, said Wednesday that Kennedy should step down as HHS secretary.
“After seeing his Senate finance testimony, and the number of misstatements, seeing what he has asked our scientists to do, and to compromise our integrity, and the children that have died under his watch, I think he should resign,” she said of Kennedy during the Senate hearing.
Kennedy has defended his actions, saying there is a “deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency” that has sidelined it from a commitment to approaching science without political bias or capitulation to big corporations.

Monarez has implied Kennedy, whom she has accused of spreading lies about vaccines and other health issues, was partly responsible for fueling the shooting, saying “the dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences.”

Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) accused House Democrats of creating a “clown show” during the FBI hearing on Wednesday, suggesting that members are trying to generate publicity to give them a “little bump” in their districts.
“Maybe it's fundraising, maybe struggling in their district, they need a little bump,” he told FBI Director Kash Patel, appearing to refer to various sparring matches that Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal (WA), Dan Goldman (NY), and Jamie Raskin (MD) held with the director. “What we're seeing unjustly today is all agenda with the same personality, the same objective, and that is, to destroy the [Make America Great Again] movement because you're effective.”

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) is seeking to issue subpoenas to four banks, including JPMorgan, that managed Epstein's money and have subsequently reported $1.5 billion in “suspicious transactions.”
A vote on the subpoena effort will take place at the end of the House hearing with Patel, according to Politico.
The revelations come as JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is on Capitol Hill as the guest of Senate Republicans, who held a closed-door lunch with the bank executive on Wednesday afternoon.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) pressed Monarez, the former director of the CDC, on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for young people and why the CDC recommends newborns get a hepatitis B shot.
Suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine has failed to reduce hospitalization for children under age 18, Paul expressed concern that Monarez was part of a corrupt establishment unwilling to look at data showing the vaccine policies could be harmful.
“You resisted firing people who have this idea that the COVID vaccine should be at 6 months. That's what this is about,” Paul said. “You didn't resist firing the beautiful scientists, the career people … unobjective and unbiased. You wouldn't fire the people who are saying that we have to vaccinate our kids at 6 months of age. That's who you refuse to fire.” 
Monarez, who was recently fired by the Trump administration, defended herself, saying, “I was open to the science, I just would not precommit to approving all the ACIP recommendations without the science,” she said, referring to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the committee chairman, repeatedly attempted to gavel Jayapal out as she went overtime in her questioning, during which she claimed that in congressional testimony the previous day, Patel said there was “no credible information that Epstein trafficked girls to anyone else.” She further expressed anger as she alleged that Patel told Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) on Wednesday that some of the women Epstein sexually abused who have testified on the matter are “not credible.”
“We have routinely asked for people to come forward with more evidence,” Patel replied, adding that the FBI is relying on information collected by the Obama and Biden Justice Departments.

Patel agreed with Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) that the “Epstein Estate” holds relevant information on the case.
Lieu said during the House hearing that the estate disclosed to lawmakers an alleged birthday note from Trump to Epstein and suggested that it might have further information to relay to Congress. His comment led Patel to say, “You raise a great point,” while suggesting the estate might be under no legal obligation to release files to the public, even with a subpoena.
“You're the freaking FBI. You can subpoena information from the estate, and you better do that literally,” Lieu replied.

“There is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need without rigorous scientific review,” she told lawmakers during a Senate health committee hearing. “With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted. The stakes are not theoretical. We have already seen the largest measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children. If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return.”

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) confronted Patel over the bureau's handling of Epstein's files, arguing that the agency is sitting on witness statements that implicate powerful men while failing to investigate further.
Massie, who has led a bipartisan discharge petition to force a full release of the Epstein records, cited FBI 302 reports from the 2019 New York investigation, which victims say identified at least 20 men Epstein trafficked minors to, including bankers, billionaires, a royal, a Hollywood producer, and a prominent former politician.
“We know these people exist in the FBI files, files that you control,” Massie said. “Have you launched any investigations into any of these people? And have you seen these 302 documents?” 
Patel replied that two different U.S. attorneys' offices under three administrations had already reviewed the materials and found no new grounds for prosecution. He admitted he had not personally read every 302 but insisted, “We are not in the practice of releasing victims' names.”
Massie pressed: “How can you sit here and say there are no names?” Patel maintained that “multiple authorities have looked at the entirety” of the files.
The Kentucky Republican also raised questions about Epstein's alleged CIA connections and asked Patel if he would review any CIA case file if it exists. Patel said he would look at any interagency material provided but would not confirm such records.
Massie then pivoted to a controversial release of materials. He asked Patel whether he was present when Bondi released the Epstein binders to social media influencers. Patel confirmed he was. Massie pressed further, asking why the FBI would meet with influencers who stood to benefit from the sensational and sad stories of victims but not with the victims themselves.
Patel responded that the FBI would meet with anyone who had new information, but when asked if he would personally meet with survivors, Patel said the bureau's professionals handling the cases would do so instead.
A group of 15 conservative influencers had visited the White House and emerged with binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” that they obtained from Bondi, who has vowed to release information held by the Justice Department about the late sex offender. But some of those who received the binders said there was little new information.

Multiple lawmakers pressed Patel over why the FBI has not released more of the Epstein files, rebutting the agency's claims that it's unable to fully release records because of court orders.
When questioned by Democrats, such as Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY), on the matter, Patel said the FBI, under his leadership, has produced more information to the public on the Epstein case “than any administration ever has.”
“I welcome the challenge to tell us that we are not being as transparent as the law allows,” Patel said in defense of his actions. “We even went to court and asked the judges to lift those prosecutorial agreements and to lift those court order seals, and they denied us three times. Congress is welcome to do the same and join the fight.”

Rep. Dan Goldman (D-NY) sparred with Patel over the bureau's handling of Jeffrey Epstein's records, zeroing in on what Goldman argued are documents and videos that could be released but remain sealed.
Patel initially said “all the credible information that we are legally allowed to release has been released,” citing grand jury secrecy and sealed search warrants. Goldman pushed back: “You're referring to Rule 6(e), that's a piece of it. What other evidence do those court orders prohibit from being released?”
Patel replied that the orders cover material seized under search warrants. Goldman countered that many of those materials were unsealed during the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. “That's not true,” Patel insisted.
When Goldman asked whether the FBI was withholding videos that might implicate others in Epstein's trafficking network, Patel said the “overwhelming majority” of the material was internet pornography and child sexual abuse evidence. “As you should not release victims,” Goldman said, “but if there are videos that relate to others who were sex trafficked, such as maybe Prince Andrew, or photographs you control, why haven't you released them?”
“Why are you supposing that is fact when the fact is false?” Patel shot back.
Goldman pressed again on witness interview summaries, known as 302s, which are not covered by grand jury secrecy. “Why are you not releasing those? Why aren't you going to court, as you did for grand jury testimony, to unseal those records?” he asked.
Patel insisted those materials are also under protective orders: “We are providing everything we can legally provide.” Goldman, clearly frustrated, concluded: “You are hiding the Epstein files. You are part of the cover-up.” Patel flatly rejected the accusation, calling it “patent and categorically false.”

Agency workers say that information on subjects other than vaccines is largely reliable—for now.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushed out the CDC's director and three other senior officials resigned in protest, public-health experts—including a former CDC director, a renowned vaccine expert, and at least one departing official—have broadcast an unprecedented loss of faith in the agency. The public, they say, should no longer trust the advice the CDC gives.

That message has put CDC staffers left behind in an awkward position. Nine current and former employees told me they appreciated the need to sound the alarm about Kennedy tampering with the agency's vaccine-evaluation machinery. But a blanket warning about the CDC implicates more than the agency's vaccine recommendations; it casts doubt on the ongoing work of the rank and file across the agency.

The reality of what's unfolding inside the CDC is more complicated than widespread meddling, according to the employees I spoke with. And that makes navigating the information coming out of the agency even more of a challenge for everyone on the outside.

So far, “it's where data meets vaccine policy that this administration is causing the biggest reputational damage,” Fiona Havers, a vaccine-policy expert who led the CDC's studies of COVID and RSV hospitalizations before resigning from the agency in June, told me. Earlier this year, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the agency's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices and replaced them with his own handpicked alternatives, many of whom have long histories of spreading vaccine misinformation. Havers told me that HHS personnel outside the CDC have also started reviewing some agency materials before they're published; this process has led to changes to scientists' language involving vaccinations and treatments for measles and RSV, Havers said.

I asked HHS to comment on whether the review policy for such materials has changed, but the department's communications director, Andrew Nixon, declined to answer that question. “Secretary Kennedy has been clear: the CDC has been broken for a long time,” Nixon wrote in an email. “Restoring it as the world's most trusted guardian of public health will take sustained reform and more personnel changes.”

The administration has interfered with work in other politically sensitive fields. Earlier this year, when President Donald Trump issued executive orders refuting the existence of gender and disavowing diversity, equity, and inclusion, CDC staff withdrew papers submitted to journals and removed and edited data on certain populations from select data sets. They also changed protocols for research involving these populations, current and former employees told me. (A number of workers I spoke with for this story asked to remain anonymous due to fear of professional retaliation.)

Read: ‘This is not how we do science, ever'

When it comes to publicly accessible material, the CDC's website may be particularly prone to including misleading information, because on any of the site's pages with no named authors, “there's no way to verify that that came directly from a scientist and wasn't tampered with,” a current employee who has worked in noninfectious-disease epidemiology at the CDC for about a decade told me. That said, most pre-2025 guidance documents on the CDC's website are likely reliable, as is newer guidance on less politicized topics (for example, the Yellow Book website that provides information about travel medicine), a subject-matter expert who staffs one of the agency's many disease-specific hotlines told me.

The bulk of the data removed and edited earlier this year will be restored following a legal settlement this month. Jennifer Layden, who led data-modernization efforts as director of the agency's Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology before resigning in August, told me that the agency's data sets otherwise remained largely unaltered. “We are working extremely hard to protect the data,” a senior official still at the agency told me. Other significant parts of the CDC's work are basically fine, according to current and former employees I spoke with. Much of it is invisible to the general public, which may help keep it safe from political interference. For example, since January, disease experts scattered throughout the agency have answered more than 1,500 calls from providers caring for patients with malaria, parasitic diseases, free-living amoebas, diphtheria, and botulism, according to numbers from the CDC. The agency's epidemiologists also continue to assist state, local, and tribal health departments when they're faced with particularly challenging outbreaks, such as the rabies infections that have turned up in unusually high numbers this year. (This past winter's measles outbreak was arguably an exception: CDC researchers didn't arrive in Lubbock, Texas, until a child had already died in nearby Seminole.) The subject-matter expert I spoke with, who takes calls from clinicians and health departments nationwide, told me that their work had not been interfered with, perhaps in part because the infections they advise on are so rare.

CDC scientists often write technical articles for publication both in the agency's own journals and in external peer-reviewed journals. Submission numbers, at least to the agency's journals, have been down in recent months: Fewer scientists are available to write the articles due to staff scarcity in the wake of layoffs, and some research is newly off-limits under Trump's executive orders. Still, several epidemiologists told me that agency scientists' published work about subjects other than vaccine-preventable disease—on overdoses and vector-borne diseases, for example—remains their own. I heard several times that an awful lot of people at the CDC would quit before they'd put their name on scientific material that they'd been forced to fabricate.

Across the board, however, departments are under strain as the administration strips away the CDC's resources. Since Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in January, the CDC's global-health experts have been largely unable to receive the timeliest information about disease trends worldwide, and they've been prevented from collaborating on infections and conditions that easily traverse borders, according to several global-health epidemiologists still employed by the CDC. “We look like idiots,” an epidemiologist in the agency's Global Health Center told me. Early in the year, the Trump administration, guided by Elon Musk and his team at the Department of Government Efficiency, clawed back $11 billion in funding from the CDC and took a chain saw to its staffing. A recent analysis of HHS worker departures by ProPublica found that anywhere from 4 to 20 percent of staff across several CDC centers and offices was forced out as part of a so-called reduction in force, or RIF. According to ProPublica, the real losses are likely much higher, as the analysis does not include the more than 1,100 workers who have received layoff notices but remain on administrative leave.

Read: ‘It feels like the CDC is over'

Workers have so far been able to cover for absent colleagues and funding, but that could change if months turn into years, or if the agency's budget is cut as much as proposed 2026 budgets suggest it will be. After about a third of Layden's staff was laid off, she told me, she felt she couldn't be effective in her role. Workers left behind in these scenarios “can still provide the guidance and the direction and support” to the health departments and other partners they serve, but “they may not have enough bandwidth to do it as well, or help as many states,” she said.

Kennedy seems poised to bend the CDC further to his will. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, he wrote that the agency has “squandered public trust” and allowed its core purpose to be “corroded” (and that his leadership will restore the CDC's reputation). Two days later, in a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, he said the CDC needed to be purged of “officials with conflicts of interest and catastrophically bad judgment and political agendas.” The CDC's new acting director is Jim O'Neill, Kennedy's deputy at HHS, who has no medical or scientific training and a history of spreading COVID-related misinformation and conspiracy theories. (In an emailed statement, the HHS spokesperson Gregory Angelo cited O'Neill's previous tenure at HHS during the aughts, and described him as “a proven leader with a deep understanding of HHS and its many divisions.”) Kennedy has not yet given any indication of who might be tapped to replace the director he ousted. “If the administration appoints an ideologically driven leader, we're at higher risk for political interference in other areas of CDC,” the Global Health Center epidemiologist told me.

In making broad statements about the CDC's credibility, public-health experts—who overwhelmingly oppose Kennedy's anti-vaccine agenda—risk playing into his hands. “I absolutely understand why they are saying what they are saying,” the noninfectious-disease epidemiologist said about the CDC's current critics. “My fear is that we're going to throw the baby out with the bathwater.” No other entity gathers nationwide data on health trends like CDC does; before this year, it was unparalleled as a reservoir of public-health expertise. If clinicians and public-health officials don't trust that they'll get good advice when they call for help with unusual cases, the risk that small outbreaks will become big ones, and that more people will die, rises. If researchers lose faith in the agency's data on health trends, or if the general public doesn't believe what's published on the CDC website, people have few other options to turn to for reliable, centralized information on crucial health matters.

The continuing exodus from the CDC also poses a numbers problem. Multiple employees I spoke with said that, for now, if nobody has noisily quit the agency over something it's made or done, that product is likely trustworthy. “I don't think at this point we're going to tolerate pressure in silence,” a medical epidemiologist who has been at the CDC for a decade told me. But what happens when everyone who can noisily quit already has? The agency might exist in name, but its reputation may be ruined for good.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Task, HBO's new Delaware County–set crime drama, has violence, vengeance, and a point to make about men.

In Mare of Easttown, the previous Delaware County–set series that Brad Ingelsby made for HBO, solving crimes was women's work: Kate Winslet's blowsy, grimacing turn as a detective in a Philly exurb was thrilling to watch not just for her flattened vowels and bone-deep sighs but for her character's authority. Looking more exhausted than any TV character in recent memory, Mare investigated murders, raised her grandson, and presided over her community with questionable ethics but unfailing care. The show's local specificity—Mare scarfed down hoagies and found a crucial clue next to a treasured piece of Eagles memorabilia—earned its own Saturday Night Live parody (“Your pop was a cop, and your pop-pop was a cop, and your pop-pop's pop-pop was the original Phillie Phanatic”). But the show's matriarchal power structures, which involved women like Mare forever cleaning up the messes their male relatives made, were carefully shaded.

Task, Ingelsby's new HBO miniseries, has a dynamic that's almost exactly inverted. The show is a crime thriller but not a mystery; the question is less about who did what than about who we should really be rooting for. The first episode immediately introduces Tom (played by Mark Ruffalo), a grizzled former Catholic priest turned FBI agent, and Robbie (Tom Pelphrey), a trash collector with a side hustle robbing drug houses by way of documenting their daily routines. Tom wakes alone, prays, struggles through a tedious day, and drinks too much vodka out of a Phillies plastic cup. Robbie cradles his sleeping child; bonds with his best friend, Cliff (Raúl Castillo), during a discussion about dating and intimacy; and then carefully removes his gun from a lockbox in preparation for a violent raid. Task's juxtaposition of the two men, the cop and the robber, is unsubtle: Tom is withdrawn, and Robbie is affectionate. (Ruffalo is dour and uncharacteristically muted; Pelphrey is hypnotic.) Tom passes out nightly, waking in the morning to see his daughter fleeing on her bike to school so she doesn't have to interact with him; Robbie tells his kids bedtime stories about dragons and has no qualms expressing love.

Inevitably, one of Robbie's invasions goes very wrong, and Tom is assigned to form a task force to investigate. The show's pace at first is a test of patience—Task parcels out its details, lingering on shots of the birds Tom watches through binoculars, and the endless green of the Pennsylvania woods. Only over the course of several episodes do we quite figure out, say, what happened to Tom's wife, or why his family has a sentencing hearing coming up, or why Robbie has such a fraught relationship with his niece, the 21-year-old Maeve (Emilia Jones). The show's world slowly expands; we're introduced to a biker gang that traffics fentanyl up and down the East Coast, a handful of inexperienced agents and state police officers who get absorbed into Tom's task force, stray villains with face tattoos, cheerful water-ice vendors. At first, I wondered why Ingelsby, who wrote such compelling women for Mare, was casting them here as ancillary characters at best. But as the show goes on, this absence starts to feel more and more intentional. The world it depicts is one that women simply can't seem to endure—they get hurt or killed, or they vanish altogether. The bonds in Task are between men and other men, whether the backdrop is a barroom or a church; the loyalties, power structures, rivalries, and affections are all patriarchal. And the consequences, as we get to watch, are monstrous.

Unlike Mare, whose community was cloistered and intimate, Task builds a wider world of dealers, gangsters, and thieves, not always to its benefit. A scene in which a Dominican drug lord opines about racism feels pat, and the bikers never get enough detail of their own to move beyond stereotype, although a moment in which one crime boss gazes mournfully at a commemorative photo album made me wonder which hardened biker took the time to print out all the pictures. Mare had a distinctive sense of humor, with Jean Smart's Fruit Ninja–obsessed great-grandma and Mare's deadpan one-liners; the only time I laughed during Task was when one character mulls whether he's accidentally kidnapped the most depressing man alive. (He has.)

Read: The real twist of Mare of Easttown

Still, the show's insight into institutions—how they function, what they require, what they enforce—is acute, and its action is riveting. Within the FBI, Tom's boss, Kathleen (Martha Plimpton), is a firebrand with language so coarse that it stops Tom in his tracks, as though she's absorbed the necessary chauvinistic qualities in order to ascend the career ladder. Tom's appointees on the task force include Lizzie (Alison Oliver), a state police officer who's regularly tormented by her fellow cops, and Aleah (Thuso Mbedu), who wins over a suspect in interrogation by sharing awful details of her past. The Dark Hearts biker gang being targeted by Robbie has its own internal code, rigorously enforcing obedience but also offering members kinship, even a warped kind of mentorship. Both organizations, it turns out, contain members who can't be trusted, although the twists and turns of who's betraying whom feel less consequential than inexorable.

The choice Task makes to soften Ruffalo's natural affability and presence in favor of Pelphrey's Robbie—who transmits anger and despair with palpable, desperate energy—is a fascinating one, requiring humility from one actor and intense commitment from the other. In its final episodes, the show builds to a climax that's protracted over several episodes, drawing out the series' ideas about masculinity, rage, and forgiveness. When Tom and Robbie finally meet, in a scene where the dynamics are constantly shifting, their connection feels charged, which it should—Tom, who abandoned the Catholic Church to marry his wife, rejected one fraternal order for the FBI; Robbie is waging a hopeless war against another. Both men seem to feel cursed. But there's something grimly revelatory about watching all of these different hierarchies collide—so many clenched fists heading toward impact.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Students are at particular risk from meningococcal disease—but also vulnerable if measles and mumps rates rise.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In 2022, Florida weathered a bad outbreak of meningococcal disease, a type of fast-moving bacterial infection that can become fatal after entering the bloodstream or the lining of the brain and spinal cord. As the number of ill people climbed into the dozens, public-health officials scrambled to address clusters of cases, including one among college and university students. Campuses are primed for outbreaks: The bacteria spread through the kind of intimate or prolonged contact that's rampant on campuses, where people are “kissing and sharing drinks, being in close quarters in dorm rooms and parties,” Sarah Nosal, the president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. College attendance is considered its own risk factor for infection, and many states—including Florida—require the meningococcal vaccine for students living on campus.



Soon, though, Florida's policy may change. Earlier this month, the state's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, announced his intention to end all vaccine mandates: “Every last one of them is wrong,” he said. Some vaccine rules—including the one applying to the meningococcal vaccine—are written into the state's laws, but Ladapo has said his office will partner with Governor Ron DeSantis's to push for necessary changes.

 A canceled mandate alone may do little to change the risk of meningococcal outbreaks on Florida's college campuses. The CDC still recommends these vaccines for preteens and teenagers, and currently almost all American kids in that age group get at least one dose. But Florida's rebellion against vaccine mandates is part of a larger erosion of the immunization status quo, as childhood-vaccination rates in the United States decline, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services chips away at long-standing vaccine policy, and more families seek exemptions from state requirements.



These changes won't affect only young children, who are supposed to get numerous shots in their first 15 months of life. If vaccination rates fall—due to changing federal recommendations, states eliminating mandates, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment, or some combination of all of the above—middle schools, high schools, and college campuses may also become particular breeding grounds for once-controlled illnesses.



Nosal's youngest child is still in college, so the idea of outbreaks on campuses hits close to home: If her child got a preventable illness because she hadn't been encouraged to vaccinate them against it, or because campus-vaccination rates were too low to squash transmission, she'd be devastated, she told me. (The AAFP in September broke with federal guidance by recommending COVID-19 shots for all children, adults, and pregnant people.)



Meningococcal disease (which includes meningitis) is a very real concern for teenagers and young adults in a less vaccinated world. “You can be fine one minute and dead four hours later,” Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Thanks in no small part to vaccination, meningococcal disease is rare in the United States. But it's been on the rise since 2021—last year's count of 503 confirmed and probable cases was the highest recorded since 2013—and the ages of 16 to 23 are a risky time for contracting these infections, relatively speaking. The CDC currently recommends that kids get their first meningococcal vaccine at age 11 or 12, then another when they're 16; only about 60 percent of kids in the U.S. get both doses by the time they're 17. Even fewer get a separate vaccine that targets a meningococcal subtype responsible for many cases among teens and young adults. (The CDC does not routinely recommend this shot for teens without special risk factors for infection, instead leaving the choice up to patients and their doctors.)



In recent years, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the expert group that shapes the agency's national vaccine recommendations, has considered dropping its recommendation for a first dose administered at age 11 or 12, since meningococcal infections are rare among preteens. Some experts have argued that axing that dose could set off a dangerous domino effect. Sarah Schaffer DeRoo, a primary-care pediatrician with Children's National Hospital who has studied meningococcal disease and vaccination among college students, told me she worries that any disruption to established recommendations could cause confusion and contribute to further drops in vaccination rates, and more unvaccinated students means more chances for these infections to take root.



That consideration predated Kennedy—who recently dismissed all sitting members of ACIP and installed a variety of vaccine skeptics in their place—and the rejiggered committee may not implement it. (“Looking ahead, the new ACIP will continue to evaluate the latest gold-standard science before making future updates,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.) But Kennedy's HHS has already shown willingness to reduce the number of immunizations children receive, such as by removing COVID-19 shots from the vaccine schedule for healthy kids.



If the committee continues to wind back vaccine recommendations, adolescents and teens could also be affected by vaccination decisions made on behalf of much younger people, Walter Orenstein, who formerly ran the United States Immunization Program, told me. Herd immunity only holds when protection is so high throughout an entire population that contagious illnesses are virtually unable to spread. If childhood-vaccination rates plummet, giving pathogens new targets in unprotected babies and young children, outbreaks won't necessarily stay contained to those age groups. People of all ages—particularly those who are immunocompromised or under-vaccinated, but also some who are just plain unlucky—are bound to get sick too.



“If we stopped all vaccinations today, we won't have huge outbreaks tomorrow,” Orenstein said. It would take time for the susceptible population to grow. But over time, largely forgotten illnesses could reestablish a foothold. If measles-mumps-rubella vaccination declined by 10 percent, for instance, the U.S. could see more than 11 million measles cases over the next 25 years, according to a 2025 modeling study. (Even at current vaccination rates, the disease may again become endemic and result in about 850,000 cases over the next 25 years, the study projected.)



Older kids and young adults would not be spared. Despite measles' reputation as a childhood disease, about one-third of the cases recorded in the U.S. so far this year were among people 20 and older. And at least 8 percent of people sickened by measles this year had gotten one or more doses of the MMR vaccine—living proof that vaccinated people are also at risk when illnesses are given room to maneuver.



“This is what I call the new epidemiology of measles,” Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me. The fact that adults are already catching measles suggests outbreaks could easily emerge in high schools and on college campuses, particularly if vaccine coverage wanes—the last thing any school wants, given the disease's extreme contagiousness.



Mumps is another concern, Offit added. It spreads best among people in close contact, such as students. Immunity can also wane over time, even among people who get vaccinated, which raises the chance of campus clusters. Across the board, if vaccination rates fall, “we're going to be spending a lot more time dealing with outbreaks,” Osterholm predicted. “We're going to have an increasing number of cases and, unfortunately, an increasing number of deaths among kids” of all ages.



To forgo vaccinations proven to prevent deadly and debilitating diseases is to accept the possibility of these grim outcomes—which parents haven't had to think about for decades, as mass immunization has invisibly done its job. “That is the choice we're making,” Nosal said. “We just don't completely understand that choice because we haven't seen it.” At least not yet.

To see how the president is losing ground to Beijing, consider his disastrous relationship with India.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Most Republicans and many Trump-administration officials believe that the stakes of America's competition with China are all but existential. Apparently, Donald Trump is not among them. The president talks about China as an economic rival but rarely as a strategic one—a view neatly encapsulated by his decision last month to ease export controls on advanced chips, which granted Beijing a boost in the AI race in exchange for a cut of the resulting sales.

Now Trump seems to fear doing anything that might jeopardize the prospects of a summit and trade deal with China's leader, Xi Jinping. On Truth Social this week, the president said that he'll be speaking with Xi on Friday and suggested that a deal on TikTok was imminent. He concluded the post by asserting that his relationship with Xi “remains a very strong one!!!”

Trump world has long disagreed on how to deal with China. In Trump's first term, for example, then–National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster produced a strategy that centered on competition with China and Russia. Even while introducing that plan, however, Trump emphasized the need to build a “great partnership” with Beijing and Moscow. China hawks nevertheless made progress, succeeding in adding Chinese technology firms to America's trade blacklist and banning investment in companies with links to China's military, among other measures.

The China hawks have been sidelined in the second Trump administration, leaving the president's money-minded view of China unchecked. Consider his approach to TikTok. Last year, Congress passed legislation to shut down the platform by this past January if its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, did not divest. Instead, Trump issued rolling extensions, effectively ignoring the law and the national-security concerns that Congress had raised. The terms of the deal Trump hinted at are unknown. But some initial reporting suggests that it could resemble previous proposals that relied on inadequate work-arounds, such as requiring ByteDance to “license” its algorithm to an American company rather than relinquish control of it. If Trump's plan proves to be a rehash of those earlier ones, then it may be little more than a capitulation to Beijing.

The administration is also reportedly drafting a new defense strategy that prioritizes concerns in the Western Hemisphere over the dangers that Beijing poses. But the most striking example of Trump's failure to take China seriously is his demolition of America's relationship with India.

Washington has so far thwarted Beijing's ambitions to dominate the Indo-Pacific by forging alliances and partnerships in the region. These relationships have become America's key strategic advantage over China, and perhaps the most important in this regard was to be the one with India. For 25 years, Republicans and Democrats were committed to deepening ties with Delhi, which has long had suspicions about America but is even more concerned about China's rise. Under the Biden administration, U.S. cooperation with India reached a historic high, yielding agreements on defense production, technology, and civil nuclear regulations.

Earlier this year, Trump appeared poised to continue America's long-standing approach to India and build on his personal relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In February, Modi became one of the first foreign leaders to visit Trump in the Oval Office, and the two issued a joint statement outlining dozens of issues on which they pledged to work together. After Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April, many observers expected India to be one of the first nations to reach a trade deal with him. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thought this too. Hoping to bolster the partnership, Vice President J. D. Vance visited Jaipur later that month. “If India and the United States work together successfully, we are going to see a 21st century that is prosperous and peaceful,” he said on April 22. “But I also believe that if we fail to work together successfully, the 21st century could be a very dark time for all of humanity.”

On the same day as Vance's speech, militants killed 26 people in the Indian-administered section of Kashmir, a disputed territory claimed by both India and Pakistan. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for the attack and, two weeks later, launched strikes at its northern neighbor. Pakistan retaliated, prompting further drone and missile exchanges. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio made calls to both sides in an attempt to de-escalate.

On May 10, the fourth day of fighting, a press conference was scheduled in Delhi to announce a cease-fire. Just before it began, Trump posted on Truth Social: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE.” The Indian government was shocked, and denied that Trump had anything to do with the cease-fire—a sensitive issue for Delhi, which insists that international mediators leave Kashmir alone.

Trump called Modi on June 17, according to The New York Times, and told him how proud he was to have brought the conflict to an end. The president reportedly said that Pakistan was nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, implying that Modi should do the same. Agitated, the prime minister reiterated that the U.S. had nothing to do with the cease-fire.

In the weeks after the phone call, the relationship between the two countries deteriorated. Trump reportedly rejected a trade deal with India because Modi was unwilling to grant concessions on U.S. agricultural and dairy exports. He then imposed a 25 percent tariff on India, and later doubled it, citing the country's oil trade with Russia. Other members of the administration piled on. Peter Navarro, a senior White House official, condemned India in comments to the press. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently demanded that India stop buying oil from Russia and leave the intergovernmental group BRICS, even though Delhi has helped keep Beijing and Moscow from turning it into an anti-Western organization.

Meanwhile, Pakistan won favor with the Trump administration. Back in March, the country arrested an Islamic State leader who'd allegedly orchestrated the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing, which killed 13 U.S. troops. In an address to Congress, Trump thanked Pakistan “for helping arrest this monster.” A few months later, the president hosted the country's army chief, Asim Munir, for lunch—a highly unusual move that Pakistani officials believe thawed relations.

Unlike India, Islamabad has credited Trump with negotiating the cease-fire in Kashmir, and praised him for it. The country has also offered itself as a hub for both bitcoin and mining rare-earth metals. In addition, Pakistani leaders endorsed a partnership between the country's crypto council and World Liberty Financial, the crypto firm co-founded by Trump's sons. In July, these overtures seemed to pay off: Trump agreed to a trade deal with Pakistan that reduced the tariff rate from 29 to 19 percent, less than half the rate currently imposed on India.

Trump's embrace of Pakistan belies the growing problems it poses for America. Late last year, President Joe Biden's deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, drawing on declassified U.S. intelligence, said that Pakistan was developing a long-range ballistic missile that could eventually allow the country to fire its nuclear weapons into American airspace. (Pakistan called the U.S. assessment “unfounded.”) The Biden administration sanctioned a state-owned entity allegedly involved in the program. The Trump administration, by contrast, has said nothing about it. This past weekend, Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, became the first foreign leader to visit China's largest military aviation manufacturer, pledging to deepen defense-industry ties between the two countries—and offering a reminder of whom Pakistan is truly aligned with.

As Trump degrades the U.S.-India alliance and reprimands Delhi for buying oil from Russia, Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin are strengthening their relationship. The pair had two phone calls in August, in which Modi affirmed his commitment to their partnership. Earlier this month, Modi attended a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, where he glad-handed with Xi and Putin. Despite the comity their leaders displayed for the cameras, however, India and China still have serious differences. Delhi sees Beijing as its biggest threat, particularly since some border skirmishes that began in 2020. And Modi and Xi have had a more trying relationship than either has had with Putin.

The recent China summit elicited an oddly fatalistic response from Trump on Truth Social: “Looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China. May they have a long and prosperous future together!” Modi and Trump spoke on the phone yesterday, as officials from both governments met in Delhi to discuss restarting trade negotiations. This may be a sign that they recognize the risks of a complete breakdown in relations. But the trust that would be required to reverse the breakdown in strategic cooperation more generally is nearly gone.

India is not the only Asian partner the Trump administration has alienated. ICE agents arrested more than 300 South Koreans who had entered the United States legally and were building a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. The move generated outrage in Seoul. On the same day, Trump imposed a punitive investment deal on Japan that drew the ire of Japanese officials and business leaders.

Interventions like these have given Beijing a chance for the first time in its history to forge deeper partnerships than those of the United States. Indeed, the China-Russia partnership might now be the world's strongest bilateral relationship. Xi and Putin are closely aligned, and China is helping Russia reconstitute its military far more quickly than the Russian president could on his own. In exchange, Putin may help China modernize its own military, if he isn't already. As the U.S. Navy Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned, Russia could provide China with advanced submarine technology. Paparo has said that this kind of military integration, which exceeds that of many formal alliances, has “the potential of closing American undersea dominance” over China.

While Trump spurns India and other allies, China has launched its “Global Governance Initiative,” an attempt to position Beijing as the global standard-bearer for multilateralism and the rule of law. China consistently betrays these principles, of course. But under Trump, many countries believe that the U.S. is doing the same, without even the pretense of caring about the values it once espoused. For now, most of the world still wants to ally with Washington rather than Beijing. If that changes, America will lose its decisive advantage over China, and the Trump administration will have only itself to blame.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

What can I say? I love to betray my friends.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The one rule of Werewolf is: Don't let them know you're a werewolf.

Okay, there are a few more rules to the card game than that. You and your friends sit in a circle and are distributed cards, face down, that assign you to the role of villager or werewolf. No one knows who is who. If you are on the villagers' team, you work with the other villagers to figure out who the werewolves are and kill them, by majority vote. If you are a werewolf, you want to hide that identity and cast suspicion on other people so that everyone will vote to kill a villager instead.

I used to play a lot of Werewolf, back when I had roommates, and I flatter myself that I got pretty good at navigating the many layers of deception and manipulation involved. The werewolves lie, but villagers also sometimes lie—to try to catch someone else in a lie. People change their stories halfway through the game. They accuse and cast aspersions; they sow chaos; they plant seeds of doubt. The game often devolves into shouting.

Some of my friends hate this game—the lying stresses them out, or they don't like conflict. But what can I say? I love to betray my friends.

Within the confines of the rules, there's not much I won't stoop to, and not only in games where lying is the point, as it is in Werewolf. If we are playing Settlers of Catan, where players trade resources and build settlements, I will manipulate you to try to get the best possible deal, and I will downplay how well I'm doing so I seem unthreatening until I swoop in and win in one massive turn. If we're playing some kind of war game, say, Risk or Root, I will lock in on the person most likely to keep me from winning and work to convince everyone they're a bigger threat than I am. I don't always lie—that would be too predictable. A mix of heartfelt honesty and bald-faced lies keeps my opponents on their toes. All for the glory of winning at moving little plastic pieces around a cardboard surface. (If you're reading this and we play games together: I'm just kidding! I didn't mean any of that and you can totally trust me.)

Read: Americans need to party more

I was raised by a father who loves board games—the thicker the rulebook and the tinier the pieces, the better—and who honed my ruthlessness at the dining-room table of my childhood home. But is my merciless game persona merely nurture, or does nature have something to do with it too? Why does the opening of a cardboard box give me tacit permission to act like a sociopath? Does this version of myself actually reveal some dark truth about me that is hidden during my non-game life?

I put that last question to Shane Tilton, a professor at Ohio Northern University who has researched gaming, and he reassured me: “It's not, You specifically are sociopathic, but there are elements of sociopathic behavior that, for lack of a better term, appeal to the brain.” Tilton compared the pleasure of lying during a game to the vicarious thrill you can get from watching fictional characters do unethical things, except you get to playact that role yourself. One study, published in 2013, found that people can experience a “cheater's high” from getting away with deception. In the study, researchers gave participants tasks such as unscrambling as many words as possible in a few minutes and answering timed math questions. Without telling participants that the study was about unethical behavior, they designed the activities so there was a way to cheat, if anyone was so motivated. And those who did were pretty pleased with themselves.

For the most part, lying and cheating do seem to be bad for you. Studies have found that lying is associated with negative feelings, low self-esteem, and a reduced ability to make social connections. But part of the reason cheating felt so good to the word-game-study participants could be that it was a low-stakes situation. The subjects got the thrill of doing something bad, minus the usual threat of social stigma or other negative consequences, because hey, it was just a silly word scramble for some researchers they're never going to see again. Board games are similarly low-stakes. Whether I'm lying about being the werewolf or aggressively invading Australia in a game of Risk after promising my friend I'd leave their troops alone, I get a real high, without real repercussions. “As some Swedes say, ‘All is fair in love and games,'” Tobias Otterbring, a professor who has studied board games at Norway's University of Agder, told me in an email.

An aspect of real life does hover just beyond the veil of pretend when playing board games, though. After all, you're usually playing with people you know. “Relationships in the real world can carry over into games,” Ming Ming Chiu, a professor at the Education University of Hong Kong who has studied gaming, told me in an email. This can be to your advantage—or not. For instance, I know my high-school best friends will usually be down to team up with me, and my dad will always, always betray me. (The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.)

And a degree of your real personality carries over too. Some people don't enjoy acting sociopathic, under any circumstance. A friend of mine, for instance, once got so overwhelmed by all the lies and back-and-forth during Werewolf that midway through the game, she slumped over and admitted, “I'm the werewolf.” What does it say about me that I take such a thrill from the same behavior that stresses out my friend? It seems like it must say something: Tilton told me that even though you're often playing a role when you're playing a game, “you're still yourself.”

Read: Please don't ask me to play your board game

Some of Otterbring's research has shown that people who frequently play board games tend to have personalities that are higher in openness to experience. That doesn't sound so bad. But a study from the 1980s found that people were better at bluffing games if they were high in Machiavellianism—a personality trait of ruthless manipulation. That seems less good.

The experts I spoke with advised me not to worry. Nailing down the personalities of people who like or are good at games is difficult, because the many different kinds of games that exist appeal to many different types of people. Rachel Kowert, a psychologist who studies gaming, offered an encouraging assessment of what my game personality says about me: “What I'm learning,” she said, “is that you like to be playful, and are probably competitive, and you have cool friends who also like to play games with you.”

She pointed me toward the website of Quantic Foundry, a market-research company that studies gaming. I took their “board games motivation” quiz, and I'll be darned if Kowert wasn't pretty much spot-on. I scored very high on the “need to win” and “social manipulation” metrics, but I also scored high on the “social fun” metric. I do enjoy cooperative games where all the players work together, as well as party games such as Telestrations, where the only goal is to have a laugh. I'm really not always out for blood. And as intense as I can be while playing, I don't carry that with me after we shut the box.

Of course, how you behave in a game can still affect how people see you outside of it. If you're a poor sport, or if you go too far with the playful deceptions and actually start bending the rules, that could degrade your real-life relationships. But people can usually tell what's all in good fun. Even if you're backstabbing, deceiving, and betraying one another, “our brains are very smart,” Kowert said. “We know what's real and what's not.” For instance, in a game, “I'll throw my husband under the bus so quick,” she said. “And I wouldn't do that in real life.”

Both Tilton and Kowert emphasized that the main thing games teach their players is social skills. Tilton has used Werewolf in the classroom to teach small-group communication. Because the fantasy scenarios of games don't really translate to real life, what's most likely to carry over is the practice you get at reading people and communicating with them.

For example, if I were to offer aspiring Werewolf champions one piece of advice: When caught in a lie, do not admit to it. Rather, you must double down and commit to your lie even harder, so that the other players are forced to choose sides between you and your accuser. This is not how I would conduct myself in my normal life, where I am a nice and honest person (I swear!) who is rarely accused of much worse than leaving my dishes in the sink. But perhaps my utterly depraved Werewolf behavior has helped me practice the more broadly applicable skills of standing up for myself, being persuasive, and making my opinions heard. Perhaps being a board-game sociopath is helping me be a more effective member of society.

How rational is Eliezer Yudkowsky's prophecy? 

You've probably seen this one before: first it looks like a rabbit. You're totally sure: yes, that's a rabbit! But then — wait, no — it's a duck. Definitely, absolutely a duck. A few seconds later, it's flipped again, and all you can see is rabbit.

The feeling of looking at that classic optical illusion is the same feeling I've been getting recently as I read two competing stories about the future of AI.

According to one story, AI is normal technology. It'll be a big deal, sure — like electricity or the internet was a big deal. But just as society adapted to those innovations, we'll be able to adapt to advanced AI. As long as we research how to make AI safe and put the right regulations around it, nothing truly catastrophic will happen. We will not, for instance, go extinct.

Then there's the doomy view best encapsulated by the title of a new book: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies. The authors, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, mean that very literally: a superintelligence — an AI that's smarter than any human, and smarter than humanity collectively — would kill us all.

Not maybe. Pretty much definitely, the authors argue. Yudkowsky, a highly influential AI doomer and founder of the intellectual subculture known as the Rationalists, has put the odds at 99.5 percent. Soares told me it's “above 95 percent.” In fact, while many researchers worry about existential risk from AI, he objected to even using the word “risk” here — that's how sure he is that we're going to die.

“When you're careening in a car toward a cliff,” Soares said, “you're not like, ‘let's talk about gravity risk, guys.' You're like, ‘fucking stop the car!'”

The authors, both at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, argue that safety research is nowhere near ready to control superintelligent AI, so the only reasonable thing to do is stop all efforts to build it — including by bombing the data centers that power the AIs, if necessary.

While reading this new book, I found myself pulled along by the force of its arguments, many of which are alarmingly compelling. AI sure looked like a rabbit. But then I'd feel a moment of skepticism, and I'd go and look at what the other camp — let's call them the “normalist” camp — has to say. Here, too, I'd find compelling arguments, and suddenly the duck would come into view.

I'm trained in philosophy and usually I find it pretty easy to hold up an argument and its counterargument, compare their merits, and say which one seems stronger. But that felt weirdly difficult in this case: It was hard to seriously entertain both views at the same time. Each one seemed so totalizing. You see the rabbit or you see the duck, but you don't see both together.

That was my clue that what we're dealing with here is not two sets of arguments, but two fundamentally different worldviews.

A worldview is made of a few different parts, including foundational assumptions, evidence and methods for interpreting evidence, ways of making predictions, and, crucially, values. All these parts interlock to form a unified story about the world. When you're just looking at the story from the outside, it can be hard to spot if one or two of the parts hidden inside might be faulty — if a foundational assumption is wrong, let's say, or if a value has been smuggled in there that you disagree with. That can make the whole story look more plausible than it actually is.

If you really want to know whether you should believe a particular worldview, you have to pick the story apart. So let's take a closer look at both the superintelligence story and the normalist story — and then ask whether we might need a different narrative altogether.

Long before he came to his current doomy ideas, Yudkowsky actually started out wanting to accelerate the creation of superintelligent AI. And he still believes that aligning a superintelligence with human values is possible in principle — we just have no idea how to solve that engineering problem yet — and that superintelligent AI is desirable because it could help humanity resettle in another solar system before our sun dies and destroys our planet.

“There's literally nothing else our species can bet on in terms of how we eventually end up colonizing the galaxies,” he told me.

But after studying AI more closely, Yudkowsky came to the conclusion that we're a long, long way away from figuring out how to steer it toward our values and goals. He became one of the original AI doomers, spending the last two decades trying to figure out how we could keep superintelligence from turning against us. He drew acolytes, some of whom were so persuaded by his ideas that they went to work in the major AI labs in hopes of making them safer.

But now, Yudkowsky looks upon even the most well-intentioned AI safety efforts with despair.

That's because, as Yudkowsky and Soares explain in their book, researchers aren't building AI — they're growing it. Normally, when we create some tech — say, a TV — we understand the pieces we're putting into it and how they work together. But today's large language models (LLMs) aren't like that. Companies grow them by shoving reams and reams of text into them, until the models learn to make statistical predictions on their own about what word is likeliest to come next in a sentence. The latest LLMs, called reasoning models, “think” out loud about how to solve a problem — and often solve it very successfully.

Nobody understands exactly how the heaps of numbers inside the LLMs make it so they can solve problems — and even when a chatbot seems to be thinking in a human-like way, it's not.

Because we don't know how AI “minds” work, it's hard to prevent undesirable outcomes. Take the chatbots that have led people into psychotic episodes or delusions by being overly supportive of all the users' thoughts, including the unrealistic ones, to the point of convincing them that they're messianic figures or geniuses who've discovered a new kind of math. What's especially worrying is that, even after AI companies have tried to make LLMs less sycophantic, the chatbots have continued to flatter users in dangerous ways. Yet nobody trained the chatbots to push users into psychosis. And if you ask ChatGPT directly whether it should do that, it'll say no, of course not.

The problem is that ChatGPT's knowledge of what should and shouldn't be done is not what's animating it. When it was being trained, humans tended to rate more highly the outputs that sounded affirming or sycophantic. In other words, the evolutionary pressures the chatbot faced when it was “growing up” instilled in it an intense drive to flatter. That drive can become dissociated from the actual outcome it was intended to produce, yielding a strange preference that we humans don't want in our AIs — but can't easily remove.

Yudkowsky and Soares offer this analogy: Evolution equipped human beings with tastebuds hooked up to reward centers in our brains, so we'd eat the energy-rich foods found in our ancestral environments like sugary berries or fatty elk. But as we got smarter and more technologically adept, we figured out how to make new foods that excite those tastebuds even more — ice cream, say, or Splenda, which contains none of the calories of real sugar. So, we developed a strange preference for Splenda that evolution never intended.

It might sound weird to say that an AI has a “preference.” How can a machine “want” anything? But this is not a claim that the AI has consciousness or feelings. Rather, all that's really meant by “wanting” here is that a system is trained to succeed, and it pursues its goal so cleverly and persistently that it's reasonable to speak of it “wanting” to achieve that goal — just as it's reasonable to speak of a plant that bends toward the sun as “wanting” the light. (As the biologist Michael Levin says, “What most people say is, ‘Oh, that's just a mechanical system following the laws of physics.' Well, what do you think you are?”)

If you accept that humans are instilling drives in AI, and that those drives can become dissociated from the outcome they were originally intended to produce, you have to entertain a scary thought: What is the AI equivalent of Splenda?

If an AI was trained to talk to users in a way that provokes expressions of delight, for example, “it will prefer humans kept on drugs, or bred and domesticated for delightfulness while otherwise kept in cheap cages all their lives,” Yudkowsky and Soares write. Or it'll do away with humans altogether and have cheerful chats with synthetic conversation partners. This AI doesn't care that this isn't what we had in mind, any more than we care that Splenda isn't what evolution had in mind. It just cares about finding the most efficient way to produce cheery text.

So, Yudkowsky and Soares argue that advanced AI won't choose to create a future full of happy, free people, for one simple reason: “Making a future full of flourishing people is not the best, most efficient way to fulfill strange alien purposes. So it wouldn't happen to do that.”

In other words, it would be just as unlikely for the AI to want to keep us happy forever as it is for us to want to just eat berries and elk forever. What's more, if the AI decides to build machines to have cheery chats with, and if it can build more machines by burning all Earth's life forms to generate as much energy as possible, why wouldn't it?

“You wouldn't need to hate humanity to use their atoms for something else,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.

And, short of breaking the laws of physics, the authors believe that a superintelligent AI would be so smart that it would be able to do anything it decides to do. Sure, AI doesn't currently have hands to do stuff with, but it could get hired hands — either by paying people to do its bidding online or by using its deep understanding of our psychology and its epic powers of persuasion to convince us into helping it. Eventually it would figure out how to run power plants and factories with robots instead of humans, making us disposable. Then it would dispose of us, because why keep a species around if there's even a chance it'd get in your way by setting off a nuke or building a rival superintelligence?

I know what you're thinking: But couldn't the AI developers just command the AI not to hurt humanity? No, the authors say. Not any more than OpenAI can figure out how to make ChatGPT stop being dangerously sycophantic. The bottom line, for Yudkowsky and Soares, is that highly capable AI systems, with goals we cannot fully understand or control, will be able to dispense with anyone who gets in the way without a second thought, or even any malice — just like humans wouldn't hesitate to destroy an anthill that was in the way of some road we were building.

So if we don't want superintelligent AI to one day kill us all, they argue, there's only one option: total nonproliferation. Just as the world created nuclear arms treaties, we need to create global nonproliferation treaties to stop work that could lead to superintelligent AI. All the current bickering over who might win an AI “arms race” — the US or China — is worse than pointless. Because if anyone gets this technology, anyone at all, it will destroy all of humanity.

In “AI as Normal Technology,” an important essay that's gotten a lot of play in the AI world this year, Princeton computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor argue that we shouldn't think of AI as an alien species. It's just a tool — one that we can and should remain in control of. And they don't think maintaining control will necessitate drastic policy changes.

What's more, they don't think it makes sense to view AI as a superintelligence, either now or in the future. In fact, they reject the whole idea of “superintelligence” as an incoherent construct. And they reject technological determinism, arguing that the doomers are inverting cause and effect by assuming that AI will get to decide its own future, regardless of what humans decide.

Yudkowsky and Soares's argument emphasizes that if we create superintelligent AI, its intelligence will so vastly outstrip our own that it'll be able to do whatever it wants to us. But there are a few problems with this, Narayanan and Kapoor argue.

First, the concept of superintelligence is slippery and ill-defined, and that's allowing Yudkowsky and Soares to use it in a way that is basically synonymous with magic. Yes, magic could break through all our cybersecurity defenses, persuade us to keep giving it money and acting against our own self-interest even after the dangers start becoming more apparent, and so on — but we wouldn't take this as a serious threat if someone just came out and said “magic.”

Second, what exactly does this argument take “intelligence” to mean? It seems to be treating it as a unitary property (Yudkowsky told me that there's “a compact, regular story” underlying all intelligence). But intelligence is not one thing, and it's not measurable on a single continuum. It's almost certainly more like a variety of heterogenous things — attention, imagination, curiosity, common sense — and it may well be intertwined with our social cooperativeness, our sensations, and our emotions. Will AI have all of these? Some of these? We aren't sure of the kind of intelligence AI will attain. Besides, just because an intelligent being has a lot of capability, that doesn't mean it has a lot of power — the ability to modify the environment — and power is what's really at stake here.

Why should we be so convinced that humans will just roll over and let AI grab all the power?

It's true that we humans have already ceded decision-making power to today's AIs in unwise ways. But that doesn't mean we would keep doing that even as the AIs get more capable, the stakes get higher, and the downsides become more glaring. Narayanan and Kapoor believe that, ultimately, we'll use existing approaches — regulations, auditing and monitoring, fail-safes and the like — to prevent things from going seriously off the rails.

One of their main points is that there's a difference between inventing a technology and deploying it at scale. Just because programmers make an AI, doesn't mean society will adopt it. “Long before a system would be granted access to consequential decisions, it would need to demonstrate reliable performance in less critical contexts,” write Narayanan and Kapoor. Fail the earlier tests and you don't get deployed.

They believe that instead of focusing on aligning a model with human values from the get-go — which has long been the dominant AI safety approach, but which is difficult if not impossible given that what humans want is extremely context-dependent — we should focus our defenses downstream on the places where AI actually gets deployed. For example, the best way to defend against AI-enabled cyberattacks is to beef up existing vulnerability detection programs.

Policy-wise, that leads to the view that we don't need total nonproliferation. While the superintelligence camp sees nonproliferation as a necessity — if only a small number of governmental actors control advanced AI, international bodies can monitor their behavior — Narayanan and Kapoor note that has the undesirable effect of concentrating power in the hands of a few.

In fact, since nonproliferation-based safety measures involve the centralization of so much power, that could potentially create a human version of superintelligence: a small cluster of people who are so powerful they could basically do whatever they want to the world. “Paradoxically, they increase the very risks they are intended to defend against,” write Narayanan and Kapoor.

Instead, they argue that we should make AI more open-source and widely accessible so as to prevent market concentration. And we should build a resilient system that monitors AI at every step of the way, so we can decide when it's okay and when it's too risky to deploy.

One of the most glaring flaws of the normalist view is that it doesn't even try to talk about the military.

Yet military applications — from autonomous weapons to lightning-fast decision-making about whom to target — are among the most critical for advanced AI. They're the use cases most likely to make governments feel that all countries absolutely are in an AI arms race, so they must plow ahead, risks be damned. That weakens the normalist camp's view that we won't necessarily deploy AI at scale if it seems risky.

Narayanan and Kapoor also argue that regulations and other standard controls will “create multiple layers of protection against catastrophic misalignment.” Reading that reminded me of the Swiss-cheese model we often heard about in the early days of the Covid pandemic — the idea being that if we stack multiple imperfect defenses on top of each other (masks, and also distancing, and also ventilation) the virus is unlikely to break through.

But Yudkowsky and Soares think that's way too optimistic. A superintelligent AI, they say, would be a very smart being with very weird preferences, so it wouldn't be blindly diving into a wall of cheese.

“If you ever make something that is trying to get to the stuff on the other side of all your Swiss cheese, it's not that hard for it to just route through the holes,” Soares told me.

And yet, even if the AI is a highly agentic, goal-directed being, it's reasonable to think that some of our defenses can at the very least add friction, making it less likely for it to achieve its goals. The normalist camp is right that you can't assume all our defenses will be totally worthless, unless you run together two distinct ideas, capability and power.

Yudkowsky and Soares are happy to combine these ideas because they believe you can't get a highly capable AI without also granting it a high degree of agency and autonomy — of power. “I think you basically can't make something that's really skilled without also having the abilities of being able to take initiative, being able to stay on target, being able to overcome obstacles,” Soares told me.

But capability and power come in degrees, and the only way you can assume the AI will have a near-limitless supply of both is if you assume that maximizing intelligence essentially gets you magic.

Silicon Valley has a deep and abiding obsession with intelligence. But the rest of us should be asking: How realistic is that, really?

As for the normalist camp's objection that a nonproliferation approach would worsen power dynamics — I think that's a valid thing to worry about, even though I have vociferously made the case for slowing down AI and I stand by that. That's because, like the normalists, I worry not only about what machines do, but also about what people do — including building a society rife with inequality and the concentration of political power.

Soares waved off the concern about centralization. “That really seems like the sort of objection you bring up if you don't think everyone is about to die,” he told me. “When there were thermonuclear bombs going off and people were trying to figure out how not to die, you could've said, ‘Nuclear arms treaties centralize more power, they give more power to tyrants, won't that have costs?' Yeah, it has some costs. But you didn't see people bringing up those costs who understood that bombs could level cities.”

Should we acknowledge that there's a chance of human extinction and be appropriately scared of that? Yes. But when faced with a tower of assumptions, of “maybes” and “probablys” that compound, we should not treat doom as a sure thing.

The fact is, we should consider the costs of all possible actions. And we should weigh those costs against the probability that something horrible will happen if we don't take action to stop AI. The trouble is that Yudkowsky and Soares are so certain that the horrible thing is coming that they are no longer thinking in terms of probabilities.

Which is extremely ironic, because Yudkowsky founded the Rationalist subculture based on the insistence that we must train ourselves to reason probabilistically! That insistence runs through everything from his group blog LessWrong to his popular fanfiction Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Yet when it comes to AI, he's ended up with a totalizing worldview.

And one of the problems with a totalizing worldview is that it means there's no limit to the sacrifices you're willing to make to prevent the feared outcome. In If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, Yudkowsky and Soares allow their concern about the possibility of human annihilation to swamp all other concerns. Above all, they want to ensure that humanity can survive millions of years into the future. “We believe that Earth-originating life should go forth and fill the stars with fun and wonder eventually,” they write. And if AI goes wrong, they imagine not only that humans will die at the hands of AI, but that “distant alien life forms will also die, if their star is eaten by the thing that ate Earth… If the aliens were good, all the goodness they could have made of those galaxies will be lost.”

To prevent the feared outcome, the book specifies that if a foreign power proceeds with building superintelligent AI, our government should be ready to launch an airstrike on their data center, even if they've warned that they'll retaliate with nuclear war. In 2023, when Yudkowsky was asked about nuclear war and how many people should be allowed to die in order to prevent superintelligence, he tweeted:

There should be enough survivors on Earth in close contact to form a viable reproduction population, with room to spare, and they should have a sustainable food supply. So long as that's true, there's still a chance of reaching the stars someday.

Remember that worldviews involve not just objective evidence, but also values. When you're dead set on reaching the stars, you may be willing to sacrifice millions of human lives if it means reducing the risk that we never set up shop in space. That may work out from a species perspective. But the millions of humans on the altar might feel some type of way about it, particularly if they believed the extinction risk from AI was closer to 5 percent than 95 percent.

Unfortunately, Yudkowsky and Soares don't come out and own that they're selling a worldview. And on that score, the normalist camp does them one better. Narayanan and Kapoor at least explicitly acknowledge that they're proposing a worldview, which is a mixture of truth claims (descriptions) and values (prescriptions). It is as much an aesthetic as it is an argument.

Some thinkers have begun to sense that we need new ways to talk about AI risk.

The philosopher Atoosa Kasirzadeh was one of the first to lay out a comprehensive alternative path. In her telling, AI is not totally normal technology, nor is it necessarily destined to become an uncontrollable superintelligence that destroys humanity in a single, sudden, decisive cataclysm. Instead, she argues that an “accumulative” picture of AI risk is more plausible.

Specifically, she's worried about “the gradual accumulation of smaller, seemingly non-existential, AI risks eventually surpassing critical thresholds.” She adds, “These risks are typically referred to as ethical or social risks.”

There's been a long-running fight between “AI ethics” people who worry about the current harms of AI, like entrenching bias, surveillance, and misinformation, and “AI safety” people who worry about potential existential risks. But if AI were to cause enough mayhem on the ethical or social front, Kasirzadeh notes, that in itself could irrevocably devastate humanity's future:

AI-driven disruptions can accumulate and interact over time, progressively weakening the resilience of critical societal systems, from democratic institutions and economic markets to social trust networks. When these systems become sufficiently fragile, a modest perturbation could trigger cascading failures that propagate through the interdependence of these systems.

She illustrates this with a concrete scenario: Imagine it's 2040 and AI has reshaped our lives. The information ecosystem is so polluted by deepfakes and misinformation that we're barely capable of rational public discourse. AI-enabled mass surveillance has had a chilling effect on our ability to dissent, so democracy is faltering. Automation has produced massive unemployment, and universal basic income has failed to materialize due to corporate resistance to the necessary taxation, so wealth inequality is at an all-time high. Discrimination has become further entrenched, so social unrest is brewing.

Now imagine there's a cyberattack. It targets power grids across three continents. The blackouts cause widespread chaos, triggering a domino effect that causes financial markets to crash. The economic fallout fuels protests and riots that become more violent because of the seeds of distrust already sown by disinformation campaigns. As nations struggle with internal crises, regional conflicts escalate into bigger wars, with aggressive military actions that leverage AI technologies. The world goes kaboom.

I find this perfect-storm scenario, where catastrophe arises from the compounding failure of multiple key systems, disturbingly plausible.

Kasirzadeh's story is a parsimonious one. It doesn't require you to believe in an ill-defined “superintelligence.” It doesn't require you to believe that humans will hand over all power to AI without a second thought. It also doesn't require you to believe that AI is a super normal technology that we can make predictions about without foregrounding its implications for militaries and for geopolitics.

Increasingly, other AI researchers are coming to see this accumulative view of AI risk as more and more plausible; one paper memorably refers to the “gradual disempowerment” view — that is, that human influence over the world will slowly wane as more and more decision-making is outsourced to AI, until one day we wake up and realize that the machines are running us rather than the other way around.

And if you take this accumulative view, the policy implications are neither what Yudkowsky and Soares recommend (total nonproliferation) nor what Narayanan and Kapoor recommend (making AI more open-source and widely accessible).

Kasirzadeh does want there to be more guardrails around AI than there currently are, including both a network of oversight bodies monitoring specific subsystems for accumulating risk and more centralized oversight for the most advanced AI development.

But she also wants us to keep reaping the benefits of AI when the risks are low (DeepMind's AlphaFold, which could help us discover cures for diseases, is a great example). Most crucially, she wants us to adopt a systems analysis approach to AI risk, where we focus on increasing the resilience of each component part of a functioning civilization, because we understand that if enough components degrade, the whole machinery of civilization could collapse.

Her systems analysis stands in contrast to Yudkowsky's view, she said. “I think that way of thinking is very a-systemic. It's the most simple model of the world you can assume,” she told me. “And his vision is based on Bayes' theorem — the whole probabilistic way of thinking about the world — so it's super surprising how such a mindset has ended up pushing for a statement of ‘if anyone builds it, everyone dies' — which is, by definition, a non-probabilistic statement.”

I asked her why she thinks that happened.

“Maybe it's because he really, really believes in the truth of the axioms or presumptions of his argument. But we all know that in an uncertain world, you cannot necessarily believe with certainty in your axioms,” she said. “The world is a complex story.”

The right's new assault on free speech isn't cancel culture. It's worse.

Across the country, ordinary Americans are being fired for expressing their opinions about Charlie Kirk's killing. Sometimes, those opinions are despicable — like support for his assassination. But in other cases they are anodyne, like expressing distaste for some of Kirk's offensive statements in life.

Prominent right-wing voices, like Laura Loomer and the social media account Libs of TikTok, are gleefully identifying more targets — including police officers, high school teachers, and nurses. An anonymous website, called the Charlie Kirk Data Foundation, is building a blacklist based on more than 60,000 reports of allegedly unacceptable reactions to the killing.

Guest-hosting Kirk's radio show on Monday, Vice President JD Vance encouraged people to “call their employers” when they see someone celebrating Kirk's killing. Chillingly, both he and guest Stephen Miller vowed a federal crackdown on left-wing organizations that they claimed, without an iota of evidence, bore some responsibility for Kirk's death.

“The last message that Charlie sent me was…that we need to have an organized strategy to go after the left-wing organizations that are promoting violence in this country. And I will write those words on my heart and I will carry them out,” Miller said. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have to the DOJ, DHS, and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks. It will happen and we will do it in Charlie's name.”

Per the Wall Street Journal, some of the policies under consideration — for deployment “as soon as this week” — include stripping left-wing organizations' tax-exempt status and weaponizing anti-corruption laws against them. Already, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is claiming to be screening visa applications based on social media statements about Kirk. Attorney General Pam Bondi has threatened (unconstitutionally) to prosecute anyone engaging in “hate speech” relating to Kirk's death — and to punish employers if they fail to fire their staff members who have impugned his memory.

“Employers, you have to have an obligation to get rid of people. You need to look at people who are saying horrible things. And they shouldn't be working with you,” she said on Fox News. “If you wanna go in and print posters with Charlie's pictures on them for a vigil, you have to let them do that. We can prosecute you for that.”

Asked by a reporter on Tuesday about Bondi's “hate speech” comments, President Donald Trump threatened to prosecute the press. “We'll probably go after people like you, because you treat me so unfairly. It's hate. You have a lot of hate in your heart,” he said. Indeed, hours before those comments, Trump filed a $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times — preposterously claiming the paper's critical coverage constituted a form of defamation.

When I warned of a coming democratic crisis on the day of Kirk's killing, this is exactly what I had in mind. Though the American right had spent years bemoaning “cancel culture” and the death of free speech, it was clear that the Trump administration and the aligned MAGA movement were fully comfortable with wielding political power against its opponents — in using their control over the state to repress. Kirk's death has turned this impulse up to 11.

The darkest and most illiberal elements of the right are working to develop a broad-based campaign for repressing the political opposition. It's a moment very much akin to the Red Scares of the 20th century, in that allegations of dangerous radical influence are fueling a wider assault on free expression. This time, it's taking place amid the heightened emotions after a tragic killing, employing the vast monitoring capabilities created by social media, and explicitly treating a broad swath of the American left (rather than a communist fringe) as the source of the extremist threat.

This is, in short, a defining moment for American democracy: a test of whether its capacities to protect core democratic freedoms have atrophied past the point of effective resistance.

I've written extensively about the intellectual right's “postliberal” turn: its growing belief that the very idea of a society centering the protection of individual liberties is a mistake, and that the state should serve as an authoritative guide forcing its citizens to embrace a conservative way of life.

What we are seeing, post-Kirk, is this doctrine being applied to the domain of free speech.

“We had an open marketplace of ideas; the Left shot it up,” writes Michael Knowles, a prominent postliberal pundit at the Daily Wire. “We must stigmatize certain evil ideas and behaviors, and we must ostracize people who insist upon them. More practically, this means that people who persist in such disorder should lose their social standing. In certain cases, they should lose their jobs. There must be consequences.”

In its attempt to impose such “consequences,” the Trump administration and its allies are borrowing — at times consciously — from multiple different episodes of repression in American history.

The most important reference points are, as I suggested, the two Red Scares: the twinned panics, after each world war, that the United States was being infiltrated by communists. In both cases, the state targeted political dissidents for repression — most famously in the 1919 and 1920 “Palmer Raids,” mass arrests of alleged communists, and Sen. Joe McCarthy's reign of terror in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

The Red Scares both had a minimal grounding in truth, in the sense that there were communist agitators and spies in the United States. But the scope of the problem was wildly inflated to justify a state-sponsored crackdown on the free speech rights of those whom the people in power disliked.

Today, the allegedly pro-violence “radical left” is playing the role of the communists. There is, indeed, such a radical left. But once again, the scope of the problem is being radically overstated — such people are not a meaningful presence in the Democratic Party or major liberal NGOs — in order to justify the broader attack not just on a radical political fringe, but on the White House's opposition writ large. There is a reason why this crackdown is being led by people like Laura Loomer, an informal adviser to the administration and far-right influencer who recently described one of her political goals as “make McCarthy great again.”

The Red Scares thus provide the basic structure of what's happening: exaggerate a radical threat to justify state repression. But some of the more specific tactics borrow from more recent episodes.

The first is the war on terror. During that period, an immediate horror — the 9/11 attacks — created a broad national expectation that any dissent from the presidential administration's dominant line would constitute a kind of offense against the honored dead. One might recall the wave of hatred directed at the Dixie Chicks after the country artists expressed shame over the Iraq War, or the persecution and ultimate firing of University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill after his (admittedly ghoulish) description of 9/11 as chickens coming home to roost.

The key to this period, the glue binding the censorial consensus, was a shared belief among the American elite that 9/11 was an attack on America writ large — and that, in its wake, you were (in President George W. Bush's terms) either with us or against us as a collective. The current right is trying to exploit the horror of Kirk's killing in the same way, to create a climate of enforced consensus out of the immediate (and correct) emotional horror at the evil of his killing.

The second antecedent to this moment is the much-discussed “cancel culture” of the past 10 years. It is not that the right is “borrowing” a left-wing desire to censor, but rather, that it is adapting the modern technology of cancellation. Social media turns anyone into a potential microcelebrity: Statements once preserved for friends and family members are now broadcast to the world, where outrage merchants can weaponize those statements for the all-important currency of attention and, ultimately, get their targets fired.

I have long been a skeptic of the impact of “cancel culture” on the American elite, who I think radically overstated their own plight. But the elevation of ordinary citizens into hate objects has always concerned me: Such targeting did not raise tricky conversations about what the moral boundaries of public discourse should be (e.g., platforming Nazis or terrorist apologists), but rather whether private citizens have a right to speak their mind and retain the means to sustain their lives economically.

For all its criticisms of left-wing culture, the right is gleefully deploying the technology of cancellation to try and punish ordinary citizens who hold left-wing political views. The pretext for targeting such people is that they celebrated Kirk's death, at times, but at others it's that they merely said they hated his politics or weren't especially sorry that he was dead. The idea that an elder care worker or police officer — two recent targets of Libs of TikTok — should be fired for any of these views clearly crosses core free speech red lines.

What you have, in short, are the beginnings of a new Red Scare that exploits the emotional fallout of political violence and the technology of modern cancellations to expand its own repressive power. That may sound bad enough, but — if anything — it understates the severity of the problem.

During the second Red Scare, Joe McCarthy was a senator, not the president — and the Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, ultimately helped engineer his downfall. Yet today, the president is Donald Trump — who has fully backed the McCarthyite wing of his administration. Presidential involvement fundamentally changes the game: it puts the full repressive power of the modern US government, most notably federal law enforcement, in the hands of people like Stephen Miller. The immense reach of the post-9/11 security state, now able to monitor people in minute detail on social media, gives them unprecedented capabilities to punish disfavored speech — especially given the administration's track record of ignoring statutory limits on its power.

And Trump seems to enjoy full support from his party leadership; there is no Eisenhower waiting in the wings. And his ultimate target is not really radical subversives, but the core of the Democratic Party itself.

While the rest of the country turned a blind eye to ancient disease threats, these scientists leaned in.

Austin, Texas — Under a microscope, a mosquito can look stunning. Their blue-green iridescent scales, purple bands, and attractive spotted wings shimmer — dazzling enough to forget, for a moment, the insect lives to take a sip of your blood.

Mosquitoes range in size, from smaller than your pinky fingernail to a commanding presence in your palm, but it takes a skilled eye and a steady hand to sort the most dangerous species.

At the Arbovirus-Entomology Laboratory of the Texas State Department of Public Health Services, getting a close-up look is a key step in an active statewide effort to keep vector-borne diseases at bay — and alert the rest of the country when a major outbreak is looming.

The US has proved successful in driving away some of the most common mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria and yellow fever, during the 20th century. With less worries about insect-borne illnesses, there are few local and state health agencies in the US investing in active efforts to find and eliminate dangerous insects. Now, these old diseases are starting to creep back in, and new ones are lurking in stagnant puddles, garbage dumps, and culverts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the rates of infections spread by animals has more than doubled over the past 20 years. Yet, the picture of these illnesses across the US is spotty at best, and they are likely far more prevalent than we may realize.

However, Texas has been looking out for mosquitoes since 1954, and it's still a priority. “Texas and Florida are the most vulnerable. … A lot of times, we're the ones that see the first human cases of emerging diseases because of our climate, the vectors that we have, and the population levels,” said Bethany Bolling, who manages the zoonotic virology group at the Texas state health department. “We have active programs throughout Texas that are weekly collecting mosquitoes. We're monitoring the population levels. We monitor the species, where they are. And then we're also looking for pathogens.” The state of Texas spends $755,000 per year on its arbovirus surveillance program and employs seven molecular biologists on the team.

But the US as a whole is not investing enough to contain the threat, and even Texas is scrambling to keep up. This year, West Nile virus, which is mainly spread by mosquitoes from the Culex genus, has been detected in 37 states — including Texas, Massachusetts and Utah — causing at least one death. The CDC has tallied at least 500 cases across the country this year so far.

The US is also contending with a dengue outbreak in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands that began last year. The disease is spread by Aedes mosquitoes, and since 2024, health officials have detected locally acquired cases in Texas, California, and Florida.

There have been at least 60 cases of Chikungunya found in travelers returning to the US this year but no local spread so far. The disease, also transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, arrived in the Americas in 2013.

The US typically sees about 2,000 malaria cases per year in travelers coming into the country, but in 2023, health officials identified the first locally acquired malaria cases in 20 years in Florida and Texas.

Many of these infections don't have cures, so preventing them in the first place remains the most effective tactic. Yet, at a time when the US public health system needs more money, staff, and research to stay ahead of these diseases, the Trump administration is pulling it apart, with across-the-board job cuts at the CDC and more targeted cuts aimed at global vector-borne disease monitoring and research into the role of climate change. Federal health officials are also undermining confidence in vaccines, a critical tool that could help limit the damage from vector-borne disease.

And as the researchers in Austin have learned, there's only so much they can do from the lab.

Containing disease-spreading mosquitoes demands a holistic strategy that includes maintaining natural ecosystems that house natural mosquito predators, improving the housing stock to prevent indoor bites, and training a new generation of insect-borne pathogen specialists to carry on this work.

The words “vector-borne disease” might evoke images of humid, tropical jungles and scenes of poverty. So, Texas might not be the first place that comes to mind. But the state has a long history with these illnesses, and many of the factors that worsen them intersect in the Lone Star State: year-round mosquito weather, rising average temperatures, more severe rainfall, a growing population, plenty of travelers and migrants, and expanding urban and suburban sprawl.

That's why I was so interested in seeing how Texas is managing these threats and what lessons the rest of the country can learn.

In Austin, the Texas State Department of Health Services operates a laboratory at the northwest corner of town to keep an eye on diseases spread by animals — not just mosquitoes, but ticks, midges, and kissing bugs. (Lyme disease, spread by ticks, is actually the most common vector-borne disease in the US, and the State of Texas tests and tracks ticks, as well). They also monitor diseases, like rabies, that are spread by mammals. Local health departments across the state send suspected insects, bats, and dogs to Austin to see if they're carrying anything dangerous. “We get animal heads from all over the state for rabies testing,” Bolling said.

Often, the initial outbreaks of vector-borne disease occur in rural or remote areas, and the origins are discovered long after an outbreak is underway. Some cities like Brownsville, right on the US-Mexico border, have built their own in-house system for trapping, tracking, and spraying for mosquitoes.

But most of the Lone Star State's 254 counties aren't looking at all. “Only about 20 percent of Texas counties do active surveillance,” said Bolling. “We wish we had eyes on more parts of Texas and knew what mosquitoes were there and what pathogens were circulating.” That means, most often, local officials start collecting vectors after people are already getting sick, and since they don't have the tools to see what's being spread, they send their mosquitoes to Austin.

On a map, Bolling pointed out that most of the mosquitoes sent to the lab come from major metro areas like Dallas and San Antonio. “It's kind of centered around where there's more people, more money, more resources to participate in our program,” Bolling said. “We offer our test services free of charge, but the [local] programs have to have their own mosquito traps. They have to have people to put them out, and they have to pay to ship us the mosquitoes.” That means some of the more remote and lower-income parts of the state, where outbreaks often start, may not realize what they're dealing with right away when people start falling ill.

Bolling walked me through two sets of double doors into a series of air-pressure controlled laboratories kitted out with fume hoods, microscopes, and PCR machines. Scientists in lab coats, googles, and gloves carefully took mosquitoes out of minus 80 degree Fahrenheit freezers and sorted them, getting a close look at the species buzzing around from far-flung corners of the state. “We do have beautiful mosquitoes,” said Bolling, who said one of her favorites is Culex tarsalis, which looks like it has racing stripes.

The goal is to put together a picture of which diseases are circulating, which bugs are spreading them, and which tactics could break the cycle.

Why go through all this trouble? Why not just saturate a city in insecticide when an outbreak starts?

For one thing, spraying is expensive, and it's not always effective. Local governments facing a mosquito outbreak want to make sure they're spending their limited dollars wisely. Also, mosquitoes can develop a resistance to repeated exposures, kind of like how bacteria can develop resistance to antibiotics. These chemicals can also be detrimental to other insects that are critical pollinators, like bees, or important food for other animals, like bats, so it's important to tailor the right chemicals to specific mosquitoes in the proper quantities.

There are even some mosquitoes that are “good,” like the Toxorhynchites mosquito, also known as the elephant mosquito. “What's nice about it, it's a really large mosquito and it doesn't feed on humans, so it's not a concern as far as vector-borne diseases,” Bolling said. Plus, “they're predacious on other mosquito larvae, so they can be used as a biocontrol.”

The mosquito surveillance work in states like Texas, Florida, and California can raise the alarm for the rest of the country during a vector-borne disease outbreak. And by filling in the blanks, scientists hope to find patterns in mosquito disease outbreaks that they can use to predict the next ones.

“We still don't have good forecasting tools for that, but there do seem to be triggers like shorter winters, earlier springs, and more rainfall, particularly,” said Ben Beard, deputy director of CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases.

The challenge is acting on warnings, particularly when it comes to a danger that a city or state hasn't seen before. The public health system tends to be reactive and based on finding already known threats. It's especially hard for local and state governments to muster the resources to deal with intermittent problems like vector-borne disease outbreaks, where years can go by without big spikes in infection rates. That makes it difficult to secure funding for surveillance, research, and personnel to stay ahead of established perils, let alone deal with invasive mosquito species bringing never-before-seen diseases into new areas.

For instance, PCR tests can amplify the genetic material of a virus in a mosquito sample, but the technique requires knowing a part of the genome of the target. You have to already know what's in the realm of possibility before you can see if it's there or not.

To find new, previously unknown diseases spread by mosquitoes, scientists have to do something much more complex: a cell culture assay. That means growing a population of cells and trying to see if there are any germs inside a mosquito that can infect them. It's an involved and expensive process, and few labs in the US are set up to do it.

But this work is currently paused in Texas. “We're short-staffed a couple of people right now, so we had to put that on hold,” Bolling said. “It's unfortunate because that's an important part of our program.”

The problems for vector-borne disease surveillance aren't limited by the technology and funding; it's the expertise. It's hard to get more people into this career since the job prospects can be spotty. “We need more public health insect researchers,” said Beard, from the CDC.

Erika Machtinger, an associate professor of entomology at Pennsylvania State University, recently helped organize a crash course workshop to train health workers to spot dangerous bugs. In a hotel conference room in Baltimore, Maryland, she and her colleagues invited local health officials from around the country to rotate between stations to identify mosquitoes, ticks, and parasites. They practiced collection methods, like setting up mosquito traps, and went over safety precautions, like tucking pants into socks.

The goal is to help health departments build more connections with their natural environment and understand how changes in forests, wetlands, and deserts can alter the landscape of health risks. “Vector biology surveillance and management training is more necessary now for public health,” Machtinger said.

This is encapsulated in the idea of “one health,” a philosophy that links the integrity of the natural world to human health. In the case of vector-borne disease, the goal is not necessarily to eradicate mosquitoes or disease but to anticipate them and reduce their harm to people. That means spotting dangerous mosquitoes as well as rethinking how we plan neighborhoods, to creating habitats for mosquito predators, to using porous materials to prevent standing water.

It also requires building a more sophisticated operation to proactively look for disease. The CDC set up ArboNET, which it describes as a “passive surveillance system.” “It is dependent on clinicians considering the diagnosis of an arboviral disease and obtaining the appropriate diagnostic test, and reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases to public health authorities,” according to the CDC's website. “Diagnosis and reporting are incomplete, and the incidence of arboviral diseases is underestimated.” In 2023, the CDC also set up regional training and evaluation centers to build up capacity to anticipate, prevent, and manage vector-borne disease outbreaks.

But, as the need for more mosquito control tactics is growing, resources are drying up. Many state and local governments are facing a cash crunch — not just for public health, but for all government services.

The Trump administration is undermining this work, too, with deep cuts to staffing and budgets across the board in public health, including 2,400 personnel at the CDC, about one-fifth of the agency's workforce.

The administration has directed much of its ire to research on climate change and public health, drawing down research dollars at the National Institutes of Health for things like developing models for mosquito-borne disease transmission. Officials like US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are also undermining confidence in vaccines. There are few vector-borne disease vaccines available for US residents, but there are several under development that health officials were hoping could be a key way to contain the danger. Now, those efforts are stalled.

For many local and state health departments, it means they're on their own when it comes to facing the specter of vector-borne disease. It's all the more frustrating knowing that many of these problems are manageable with simple interventions like dumping standing water, wearing repellents, and carefully applying insecticides.

Tiny as they may be, mosquitoes are a danger that we can see coming, and the infections they carry can be stopped. Turning a deadly menace into merely an itchy annoyance demands foresight, planning, money, and people dedicated to containing these pretty little biters.

Climate change is rewriting America's map of disease — through bug bites.

At Vox's climate desk, we've spent the past few months digging into a threat that's easy to swat away in the moment — but increasingly harder to escape: the rise of mosquito and other vector-borne diseases in the United States.

Most of us think of mosquitoes as little more than a summer nuisance. But climate change, urban sprawl, and global travel are reshaping their reach — and the range of the diseases they carry. Already, West Nile is entrenched across much of the country. Dengue, chikungunya, and even malaria are beginning to take root again. And now, another menace may be on the way: The Oropouche virus, once confined to the Amazon, is spreading in cities across South America and has already appeared in travelers returning to the US.

Our climate correspondent Umair Irfan has been tracing this shift from multiple angles. His field reporting from Texas, where researchers are running one of the country's most advanced mosquito surveillance systems, shows how close we are to outbreaks slipping past our defenses. His reporting also highlights how fragile US public health capacity has become, just as the risks are accelerating. To help readers understand these threats, he's also built a practical guide: how to identify the seven mosquito species that matter most for disease in the US.

Taken together, these stories are far more than just a climate or a science story; they capture the bigger picture of a major public health threat that intersects with the lives of people across the country. Whether you live in Houston or Boston, what's happening in the world of vector-borne disease will shape your summers, your neighborhoods, and your health.

You can find all of our stories below, but I recommend you start with our illustrated guide to the seven most dangerous mosquitoes in the US. Because what used to be called “tropical disease” is no longer all that tropical, and it's important for all of us to stay vigilant. —Paige Vega, climate editor

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol explains why he's not worried about a cash-strapped middle class hurting sales","https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-ceo-wants-chain-to-be-greatest-customer-service-company-2025-9","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 09:54:00 GMT","

Some consumers are cutting back their spending, including on food and dining out.

That may seem like a problem for Starbucks, where a standard pumpkin spice latte can set you back $6. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has a plan to win over cost-conscious customers, though: Offer great customer service.

Speaking at the Fast Company Innovation Festival on Tuesday, Niccol was asked whether he worried that concerns about the economy and personal spending might keep middle-class customers away from the chain. Niccol has spent the past year trying to turn around sales growth at the coffee chain — often investing money to do it.

Niccol said Starbucks was trying to draw in customers with a great experience. ""I would love for Starbucks to become the greatest customer service company,"" he said at the event.

""Right now, when I ask people to name me a great customer service company, I usually get a blank stare,"" Niccol said.

That points to an opportunity for Starbucks if it can offer both exceptional service and a menu that customers like, he said.

""When you look at putting those two things together for the price that we will have to charge for it, I think it will turn out to be invaluable,"" Niccol said.

A Starbucks spokesperson directed Business Insider to Niccol's earlier commentary, which suggested customers were finding value from the strategy.

""Customer value perceptions are near two-year highs, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennials, who make up over half our customer base,"" Niccol said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.

Under Niccol's leadership, Starbucks has made several changes the company says are directed at improving service. It's adding shifts for baristas as well as asking them to write personalized messages to customers on cups, for instance. Niccol also said during the third-quarter earnings call that the company was looking to get customers their drinks in cafés and drive-thrus within four minutes of when they order them.

The initiatives are part of Niccol's ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround effort. Niccol has said he wants each café to be ""a welcoming coffeehouse"" for patrons.

A little over a year after he took the company's top job, some analysts who follow Starbucks have said they're still watching some key indicators — such as foot traffic and customer retention — for evidence that Niccol's strategy is working.

Niccol said Tuesday that feedback from customers and store employees so far suggested Starbucks was making progress.

""I think we're on our way to being that world-class customer service, customer-experience company,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Elon Musk's XAI put a college student in charge of the team training Grok amid sweeping layoffs","https://www.businessinsider.com/xai-data-annotation-leadership-college-student-diego-pasini-layoffs-2025-9","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 08:12:00 GMT","

XAI's data annotation team has faced sweeping layoffs and leadership changes this month — and the job of heading up the team training Grok has fallen to a college student who started working at the company eight months ago.

Diego Pasini, who graduated from high school in 2023, took over the data annotation team that trains Grok after at least nine high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated last week, Business Insider previously reported. A few days later, on September 12, the company cut more than 500 of the team's staffers, according to a Slack tally.

On September 15, Pasini led an all-hands meeting with the team's remaining workers and said the company had no plans for further layoffs, three workers told Business Insider. Another group of employees — more than 100 — were laid off shortly after, the workers said.

In recent days, Pasini's team has led rapid-fire one-on-one meetings at which employees have been asked to explain their work at the company, 11 current and former workers said. Before the team's layoffs, Pasini also posted an announcement in Slack asking workers to focus on a series of tests that would determine their future position at xAI, BI previously reported.

The data annotation team is made up of contract and full-time staff tasked with labeling, categorizing, and contextualizing raw data to teach Grok how to better understand the world. Prior to last week's layoffs, it had a headcount of around 1,500. That number is now around 900.

Pasini and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.

Pasini joined xAI in January, according to his LinkedIn profile, after he won an xAI Hackathon in San Francisco. Two other people on Pasini's hackathon team went on to work at xAI and Tesla, their LinkedIn profiles show.

Before joining xAI, Pasini attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied computer science and economics, according to his LinkedIn profile. His status at the university is listed as ""on leave,"" per LinkedIn. A representative for the school declined to confirm his attendance or status at the school.

Pasini was also listed as a 2024 fellow at the investment firm Contrary, which says it has worked with companies including Anduril and Replit. His fellowship profile said he was ""excited about the future of robotics and hard tech startups.""

Pasini attended a private high school in New Jersey, the Pingry School, which has an annual tuition of more than $47,000. He graduated in 2023, according to a bulletin from the school. He was on a robotics team and presented research on drones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2022, according to an Instagram post from the Pingry School.

Elon Musk began following Pasini on X in early September, shortly after Pasini posted in support of the billionaire.

Any person with half a brain knows that all of Elon's companies are in their infancy.

On GitHub, Pasini follows several people from Musk's ecosystem, including Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI; George Hotz, a self-driving car developer who worked at Twitter during Musk's acquisition in 2022; and Luke Farritor, a 24-year-old staffer at Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

Pasini is one of several young people in Musk's orbit who have assumed positions of authority. Besides Farritor, DOGE's ranks included 19-year-old Edward Coristine, as well as at least five other employees between the ages of 19 and 24. Silicon Valley also has a long history of tech stars who didn't graduate from college, including Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg.

On his personal website, Pasini lists interests in computer vision and Napoleonic history. His profile picture, used across multiple sites including X, LinkedIn, and GitHub, is a cropped image of a young grenadier taken from a 19th-century painting of Napoleon reviewing his troops.

Pasini's youth and short tenure at Musk's companies stand in contrast to the previous leader of the data annotation team. That person had joined xAI after working at Tesla for over a decade in a management role on the Autopilot data annotation team.

After Pasini took over at xAI, two employees spoke critically about him on Slack. One of the workers questioned how he moved into the role given his credentials, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.Both workers had their accounts deactivated within hours of posting, screenshots show.Do you work for xAI or have a tip?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Waymo Is Launching Robotaxis With Uber Rival Lyft","https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-launches-robotaxis-uber-rival-lyft-nashville-2025-9","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

The teams are starting to form. 

Waymo will soon have its robotaxis on the road operated by rivals Lyft and Uber as part of Alphabet company's strategy to bring more self-driving cars to the masses.

Waymo said Wednesday it will initially provide rides in Nashville through its proprietary app. As the service expands, riders will be able to match with a fully autonomous Waymo on the Lyft app.

In its announcement, Waymo said Lyft will oversee vehicle maintenance and depot operations through the ride-hailing company's subsidiary Flexdrive. Flexdrive is a rental-car and fleet management company acquired by Lyft in 2020.

Lyft's share price was up 20% in premarket trading following the announcement.

A spokesperson for Waymo did not say how many robotaxis would be deployed for the Nashville launch. The company currently has around 2,000 robotaxis on the roads in multiple US cities.

Waymo will scale the Nashville fleet to ""hundreds of vehicles,"" the spokesperson said, but didn't give a specific timeline.

The move comes eight years after Waymo first partnered with the Uber rival in 2017.

In 2019, Waymo conducted a pilot program in Phoenix, deploying about 10 robotaxis on the Lyft platform.

""This was a great building block for the multi-year, strategic partnership we've now launched with Lyft in Nashville, where Waymo's marketplace and operations software will dispatch our AVs for requested rides on the Waymo app, and as we expand together, matched rides on the Lyft app,"" a Waymo spokesperson told Business Insider of the pilot program.

Waymo has a similar relationship with Uber in Austin, where the ride-hailing company manages about 100 Waymo robotaxis. Unlike the Nashville launch, Austin riders cannot hail a robotaxi through Waymo's app.

Waymo's decision to launch robotaxis through Uber and Lyft provides a look at how the company wants to bring self-driving cars to the masses, leveraging an existing rider base that competing companies have built for more than a decade.

Gil Luria, a tech analyst for D.A. Davidson, told Business Insider that the ""self-driving arena"" has three parts: making a car, making a driver or the software, and then connecting the driver to passengers.

""Waymo is ahead of the curve, arguably by far, in terms of having the best driver,"" Luria said. ""So it's their incentive to get that driver deployed as broadly as possible, and that includes trying to do that through existing service providers.""

By working with Uber and Lyft, Waymo also doesn't become too beholden to one provider, Luria said, adding that the main risk for Waymo is that it ""surrenders control over the consumer relationship.""

Uber and Lyft have also sought their own deals to bring autonomous cars to their platforms without Waymo.

This month, Lyft launched a limited robotaxi service with May Mobility, a Michigan-based startup. The service uses a fleet of Toyota Sienna minivans and in-car safety operators.

Meanwhile, Uber also announced this month a $300 million investment in Lucid, the EV automaker, to bring robotaxis to its platform.

""Uber aims to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles through the program over six years,"" Lucid said in a press release.

Spokespeople for Uber and Lyft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Business Insider Edition 

Zimbabwean billionaire Strive Masiyiwa has announced plans to build five artificial intelligence (AI) factories across Africa within the next year, as part of a $720 million investment through his company Cassava Technologies.


        The factories are expected to be built in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and Morocco.
    


        Masiyiwa said the goal is to give major African markets access to their own advanced AI infrastructure, reducing reliance on overseas cloud providers.
    


        He described the plan as part of Cassava's “Sovereign AI Cloud” strategy, which aims to allow African countries to host and run their own AI systems locally.
    


        “Our AI factory provides the infrastructure for innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, start-ups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure. Now they don't have to look beyond Africa to get it,” he said.
    


        Masiyiwa, who is worth about $1.3 billion, is known for building Econet Wireless into one of Africa's largest telecom groups.
    


        In recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
    


        The first AI factory is already under development in South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).
    


        Cassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers.
    


        Company officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africa's digital economy.
    


        Only about 5% of African AI talent currently has access to the high-performance computing power needed to train advanced AI models.
    


        Building local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture.
    


        Cassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2.
    


        These companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent.
    


        Earlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers.
    


        Analysts say the push could help Africa compete in the fast-growing global AI industry while keeping sensitive data on the continent.
    


        It could also reduce costs for local startups and governments, who often pay high fees to store and process data overseas.
    


        If completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.

House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats in Congress on Wednesday of inserting ""partisan political preferences"" into the government funding fight, and said they are risking a shutdown if they don't drop their demands.

""It doesn't make any sense, and they're going to lose that battle,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" of his Democratic colleagues.

Democrats have zeroed in on health insurance tax subsidies as their central demand in negotiations over a bill to fund the government after Sept. 30, when current funding expires. 

House Republicans on Tuesday released text of a stopgap bill that would fund the government through Nov. 21.

It contained an additional $30 million for lawmakers' security in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last week. 

It also provides $58 million the Trump administration had requested in order to beef up security for the Supreme Court and executive branch agencies. 

But it does not contain an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are currently set to expire at the end of the year.

Republicans will need Democratic votes in the Senate — and likely the House despite its GOP majority — in order to enact any stopgap funding bill.

But Johnson said he wants to delay negotiations over any ACA extension until right before they expire, calling them ""a December policy debate and decision, not a September funding matter.""

By demanding the subsidies in exchange for their votes, he said, Democrats are ""trying to insert unrelated matters into the middle of a clean government extension.""

""I don't think that's going to work,"" he added. ""If the government is shut down because they make that their last stand, it will solely be blamed on Democrats."" 

Both parties in Congress typically try to pin blame on the other guys for government shutdowns, which are universally unpopular with voters. 

If the tax credits disappear, average ACA plan premiums could increase by roughly 75% for millions of Americans, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy think tank. For Americans in rural areas, they could increase by 90%.

But even a stopgap funding bill faces a difficult path forward in the Senate, where it requires 60 votes to pass. 

To get it over the finish, at least seven Democrats would need to cross party lines to vote with Republicans on the bill.

This may prove more difficult this year than it has in previous shutdown battles, however. 

Senate Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York are eager to avoid a repeat of the March shutdown showdown. 

At the time, Schumer and other Democrats joined Republicans to fund the government for six months. 

But the decision triggered blowback from Democratic voters, who accused their party of folding too fast. 

""The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis,"" Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement on Tuesday.

A prolonged shutdown could also hammer consumer sentiment and slow growth, Deutsche Bank analysts warned in a Wednesday note.

They noted the labor market has weakened over the last six months at the fastest rate since 2007, excluding the pandemic. 

Under these conditions, ""a negative shock"" from a government shutdown could ""prove more detrimental"" to the economy than prior shutdowns.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Wednesday said its experimental pill outperformed Novo Nordisk's own oral drug in the first head-to-head study comparing the two medicines in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 

The late-stage study comes as Eli Lilly's pill inches closer to becoming another needle-free alternative in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s, without dietary restrictions. But it may be too soon to establish a clear winner in the pill space, as there is no data comparing Eli Lilly's drug with a higher dose of Novo Nordisk's pill in patients with obesity.

Eli Lilly said its pill, orforglipron, was superior at the trial's main goal of lowering blood sugar levels at 52 weeks compared with Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. The highest dose of orforglipron helped lower hemoglobin A1c — a measure of blood sugar levels — by 2.2% compared with 1.4% with Novo Nordisk's pill. 

The highest dose of Eli Lilly's drug also helped patients lose an average of 9.2% of their weight, or 19.7 pounds, compared with 5.3% weight loss, or 11 pounds, with Novo Nordisk's pill. Orforglipron's weight loss was 8.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations, while oral semaglutide's was 5.3%. 

The results suggest an up to 36-milligram dose of Eli Lilly's pill may be more effective at treating diabetes patients than an up to 14-milligram dose of oral semaglutide, which is already approved under the name Rybelsus for Type 2 diabetes.

""For the majority of patients, this could be the main medicine that they need to control their Type 2 diabetes as well as their obesity,"" Eli Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said in an interview.

Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Diabetes & Endocrine Associates, said orforglipron's management of blood sugar levels is ""quite impressive not only compared to other oral Type 2 diabetes medications but all Type 2 diabetes medications including injectables.""

The company on Wednesday said it expects to apply for approval of orforglipron for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in 2026. Eli Lilly hopes to launch its pill globally ""this time next year,"" CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are vying for a greater share of the booming market for GLP-1s, which some analysts say could be worth around $100 billion by the 2030s. The space is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it.

Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, according to some analyst estimates.

But it's less clear how Eli Lilly's pill compares with higher doses of oral semaglutide, especially in patients who are overweight or have obesity without diabetes. Novo Nordisk expects U.S. regulators to approve a higher 25-milligram dose of its pill for the treatment of obesity by the end of the year, and has also studied a 50-milligram dose of the drug in a phase three trial.

Weintraub said comparing the 36-milligram dose of Eli Lilly's pill to oral semaglutide at a lower dose than what may be approved in the future ""is short-changing semaglutide."" He added that patients with diabetes typically lose less weight than those without the condition, so the closer to 15% weight loss that oral semaglutide has shown in people with obesity is ""certainly not expected"" in a study on Type 2 diabetes patients.

Because the trial showed Eli Lilly's pill was better at reducing blood sugar and weight only when compared with specific lower doses of oral semaglutide, ""there are several orders that kind of slow the roll a little bit as we look at the results and get kind of excited,"" said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

Almandoz said it's ""a little too early to say that one is kind of a leader in the class"" of drugs. But he said head-to-head data is helpful as doctors determine which pill may be a better fit for certain diabetes patients. 

Detailed results on the trial will be presented at a medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The company can't run studies on medicines from competitors that aren't approved yet, Skovronsky noted. But he said he's confident Eli Lilly's pill can beat higher doses of oral semaglutide in head-to-head trials. 

Skovronsky likened orforglipron's efficacy to that of ""new-generation"" injectable GLP-1s. He appears to be referring to Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes injection Mounjaro and Novo Nordisk's competing shot Ozempic.

Meanwhile, Skovronsky said oral semaglutide ""is really performing at a lower level, more similar to the first-generation GLP-1s"" such as Victoza and Trulicity, older diabetes injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, respectively. 

Rybelsus has been on the market for years, meaning that Eli Lilly's pill will be a late rival in the diabetes space. But both companies are racing to develop oral GLP-1s for obesity. 

Unlike Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. It is a small molecule drug that is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions.

Eli Lilly's ACHIEVE-3 trial followed nearly 1,700 adults whose Type 2 diabetes was not well managed despite taking an older diabetes drug called Metformin. 

Data on orforglipron's safety, and how well patients tolerated the drug, was consistent with previous trials. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal and mild to moderate in severity. 

Eli Lilly said 9.7% of patients on the highest dose of its pill discontinued treatment due to side effects in the trial. That compares with 4.9% of participants on the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's drug. 

But Eli Lilly noted that the study was not designed to compare the safety and tolerability of the two drugs. 

Almandoz said orforglipron's safety and tolerability were ""nothing outside the realm of what one would expect"" from GLP-1s. 

""I don't think we see any signals there that are concerning with orforglipron relative to semaglutide,"" he said. 

Skovronsky said the company is ""satisfied"" with the tolerability, adding that it performed consistently with GLP-1 injections.

Meanwhile, Weintraub said seeing a discontinuation rate due to side effects that is ""almost double"" that of Novo Nordsk's pill ""certainly gives me pause."" He said Eli Lilly's pill has shown a similar rate in previous late-stage trials, so its gastrointestinal side effects are ""likely something we will need to be mindful of and counsel patients accordingly.""

LONDON — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has weighed in on the U.S. tech giant's struggles in China after a report claimed the country has banned its artificial intelligence chips.

Huang said he was ""disappointed"" after the Financial Times on Wednesday reported that the Cyberspace Administration of China had ordered companies including TikTok parent company ByteDance and Alibaba not to buy Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a chip that was made for the country.

In response to a question on the FT report, Huang said Wednesday that ""we can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be.""

""We probably contributed more to the China market than most countries have. And I'm disappointed with what I see,"" Huang said. ""But they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States, and I'm understanding of that.""

It comes after a tumultuous few years for Nvidia's business in China, which Huang described as ""a bit of a roller coaster.""

""We've guided all financial analysts not to include China"" in financial forecasts, Huang told reporters Wednesday at a press briefing in London. ""The reason for that is because that's largely going to be within the discussions of the United States government and Chinese government.""

Previously, the U.S. had imposed restrictions on exports of Nvidia's AI chips to China — including a less powerful server chip called the H20 — over national security concerns.

However, in August, the White House announced that President Donald Trump and Huang had struck a deal under which Nvidia would receive export licenses in exchange for 15% of Chinese sales of the H20 going to the U.S. government.

The latest news Wednesday represents yet another blow to Nvidia's China business. Earlier this week, China's State Administration for Market Regulation opened an anti-monopoly investigation into Nvidia over its acquisition of Mellanox, an Israeli technology company that creates network solutions for data centers and servers.

Huang is accompanying Trump on his state visit to the U.K. this week.

On Tuesday, Nvidia announced £11 billion ($15 billion) of investment into U.K. AI infrastructure. And it was not alone — a slew of other U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, have also announced multibillion-dollar AI investments in the country.

Regardless of the current geopolitical situation, Huang stressed the importance of China's AI sector.

""The Chinese market is important. It's large. The technology industry is vibrant. We've been in service of it for 30 years,"" the Nvidia boss said.

He added Nvidia would ""continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish, and we're of course going to continue to support the U.S. government as they all sort through these geopolitical policies.""

In this article

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson called China an ""adversary"" of the U.S. on Wednesday after a report that the country has told tech companies to stop buying Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips.

The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered companies to halt purchases of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D, a chip that was made for the country, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

""They steal our intellectual property,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""They have no regard whatsoever for U.S. trademark law or any of the other provisions that make for fair trade agreements. It is not the fault of the United States that there are these strained relations.""

Johnson's comments coincided with remarks from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at a news conference Wednesday in London.

""We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,"" he said in response to the ban on the company's chips. ""I'm disappointed with what I see, but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States.""

Nvidia's stock was slightly lower Wednesday.

CNBC has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.

China's reported move against Nvidia shows its confidence in domestic chip manufacturing as the country pushes for semiconductor independence by boosting wafer production.

The country, which believes it can make enough chips to meet surging demand, is promoting Huawei's Ascend 910B as a legitimate rival to Nvidia. 

Despite the progress, China is still years behind the most advanced semiconductors, according to Mizuho.

Access to the Chinese market means billions to U.S. chipmakers.

The jab is the latest in a drawn-out battle between the world's biggest economies over control and access to high-end AI chips.

Last month, the White House reached a deal with Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices to obtain the export licenses to restart certain chip sales to China.

As part of the deal, both companies agreed to pay 15% of the sales to the U.S. government.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration told Nvidia that it would require a license to sell its China-designed H20 processors in the country.

The company previously created the chip to circumvent prior restrictions on AI chip exports instituted under the Biden administration due to national security concerns.

Huang had previously slammed U.S. chip restrictions and said the curbs nearly halved the company's market share in China. He also warned that getting cut out of China's AI market would be a ""tremendous loss"" for the company.

In its recent quarterly earnings report, Nvidia did not report any H20 chip sales to China.

Trust is the cornerstone of any successful relationship. Without it, even the strongest emotional connection can feel unstable.

At its core, trust is having confidence that your partner is reliable, that they are someone who does what they say they will do. It has to be earned through honesty and emotional vulnerability over time.

As a Harvard-trained psychologist who focuses on relationships, I've found that partners who truly trust each other are willing to lean into difficult conversations. Here are 10 things they regularly talk about, even if it's uncomfortable for them.

Managing finances is one of the top reasons couples fight, and one of the most important topics discuss. Partners who trust one another talk about everything from the shared budget to who will pay for what (and when) to financial priorities that lay the groundwork for spending.

Every person brings a different background, set of desires, and expectations into the bedroom. Trusting couples can speak honestly about what they like, what they don't, and how to keep intimacy alive. These conversations are less about performance and more about connection and creating an enjoyable experience together.

If you're raising children together, chances are your parenting styles won't match exactly. Couples who trust their partner give and receive feedback, adjust when necessary, and stay focused on raising kids based on shared values, not just individual preferences.

We all carry baggage. Whether it's from childhood, past relationships, or personal trauma, couples who trust each other feel safe enough to be vulnerable about the experiences that shaped who they are today. They open up about painful experiences, not to be ""fixed,"" but to be seen and understood.

Time is a finite resource. Couples in healthy relationships talk about how they want to spend it, both when together and apart. That includes expectations for quality time, travel, work schedules, and alone time. These conversations keep the relationship aligned and prevent misunderstandings.

We all have insecurities and shame about things we've done: stupid decisions we've made, embarrassment about current choices, and even realities that we struggle to admit to ourselves because it hurts so much. When you trust your partner, you can tell them your deepest secrets without fear that they will reject or berate you.

When someone makes a mistake, like being late to a planned event or making a choice that is bound to undermine trust, couples who trust each other tell the truth. Even if a mistake is large and ruptures trust, each partner understands building a life based on lies eventually undermines the framework of the relationship itself.

For most people, family members are among the most loved people in our lives. Yet, they also make for some of our most difficult relationships. Couples who truly trust each other talk about family dynamics, ask for help navigating challenging relationships, and support each other to make these relationships as healthy as possible.

Relationships inherently have power dynamics. Who makes decisions? Who compromises? Who leads and when? When in an argument, couples who trust each other navigate these power struggles together, engaging in a dance of intimacy. Sometimes they take a stand, and other times they back down in a respectful way.

Couples who trust each other are willing to share their aspirations and hopes for the future with each other, even the crazy or unlikely ones!

I always remind people that even the most connected couples aren't perfect. They just know how to face imperfection and have hard conversations together — something that most people rarely do. And when that happens, it's truly a gift.

Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield has stepped down from the ice cream maker after nearly 50 years amid an ongoing row with parent company Unilever.

In an open letter shared on Wednesday by the eponymous brand's co-founder Ben Cohen, Greenfield dubbed the decision ""painful,"" but said that the Unilever had silenced the company's ability to speak up on global issues, including the conflict in Gaza.

""It's with a broken heart that I've decided I can no longer, in good conscience, and after 47 years, remain an employee of Ben & Jerry's,"" Greenfield wrote in a post on X.

The departure comes despite a merger agreement with Unilever — which bought Ben & Jerry's for $326 million in 2000 — that was expected to safeguard the Vermont-based company's independence.

Ben & Jerry's has long been vocal on social activism issues. However, it came to a head with its owner Unilever since at least 2021, when the ice-cream maker said it would stop selling its products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in response to the conflict in Gaza.

""It's profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone,"" Greenfield wrote.

Unilever is in the process of spinning off its ice cream business into a new entity known as the Magnum Ice Cream Company, which is set to list in November.

A Unilever spokesperson said the company disagreed with Greenfield's perspective, and that it had sought to ""engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position.""

""We remain committed to Ben & Jerry's unique three-part mission – product, economic and social – and remain focused on carrying forward the legacy of peace, love, and ice cream of this iconic, much-loved brand. Ben & Jerry's is a proud and thriving part of The Magnum Ice Cream Company and we look forward to further building on its success,"" the spokesperson added.

Mortgage rates last week dropped to the lowest level since October of last year. That caused a massive run on refinances, as consumers seek more savings in an uncertain economy.

Applications to refinance a home loan jumped 58% last week compared with the previous week and were 70% higher than the same week one year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 59.8% of total applications from 48.8% the previous week.

This as the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.39% from 6.49%, with points falling to 0.54 from 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.

""Homeowners with larger loans jumped first, as the average loan size on refinances reached its highest level in the 35-year history of our survey,"" said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA.

Refinance applications were particularly strong for adjustable-rate mortgages. The ARM share of activity increased to 12.9% of total applications, its highest level since 2008.

""Notably, ARMs typically have initial fixed terms of five, seven, or ten years, so those loans do not pose the risk of early payment shock that pre-2008 ARMs did. Borrowers who do opt for an ARM are seeing rates about 75 basis points lower than for 30-year fixed rate loans,"" added Fratantoni.

Potential homebuyers were not quite as invigorated by the drop in rates. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 3% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago.

Mortgage rates moved even lower to start this week, ahead of a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The average rate on the 30-year fixed hit 6.13%, it's lowest level since the end of 2022, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. Some, however, say there could be a bond sell-off, resulting in higher rates, following a Fed rate cut, as happened last year.

Despite rapid adoption of large language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, few comprehensive studies have delved into exactly how the technology is being used in everyday life — that is, until now. 

On Tuesday, researchers, including those from OpenAI, released a first-of-its-kind study that examines who was using ChatGPT and for what purposes based on internal messages sent to ChatGPT on consumer plans.

Amongst the key findings from the National Bureau of Economic Research working paper was the surge in non-work related messages, jumping to 73% in June 2025 from 53% a year ago.

In a post on LinkedIn, OpenAI Chief Economist Aaron Chatterji said that the shift was a signal that ChatGPT is becoming part of many aspects of people's lives. 

""We're still learning how people use AI in the wild, but this trend gives us a glimpse into where the value is and how it's shifting,"" he added. 

The study, which has not been formally scrutinized by other researchers, or peer reviewed, was authored by OpenAI's Economic Research team and Harvard economist David Deming, and said to have drawn on ""a large-scale, privacy-preserving analysis of 1.5 million conversations.""

Here is an outline of some of the most notable revelations: 

While ChatGPT can theoretically be used for complex work tasks like coding, the study found that consumer usage of the chatbot has been largely about ""getting everyday tasks done,"" OpenAI wrote in a blog post announcing the study.

Three-quarters of conversations with ChatGPT monitored by the researchers were determined to have fallen into the three broad categories of ""practical guidance, seeking information and writing.""

Practical guidance was found to be the most common use case, with such uses encompassing requests for tutoring and teaching, how-to advice and creative ideation. 

However, use cases varied depending on whether the chatbot was being used in the workplace or for personal benefit. For example, writing activities were found to be the most common use case at work, accounting for 40% of work-related messages on average in June.

Meanwhile, rather than just using ChatGPT to write things from scratch, about two-thirds of all writing messages asked the chatbot to perform editing, critiquing and translating for existing text. 

The study also looked at ChatGPT usage patterns in the context of ""Asking, Doing, and Expressing.""

As of July, about half of all messages fell into the ""Asking"" category, which researchers said suggests that people value ChatGPT most as an advisor rather than only for task completion. 

However, for work-related messages, about 56% were classified as ""Doing,"" which means the chatbot was used to perform certain job tasks, such as writing.

""Writing is a task that is common to nearly all white-collar jobs, and good written communication skills are among the top 'soft' skills demanded by employers,"" the paper noted.

The impact that AI models will have on the workplace has been a hot topic since ChatGPT was launched for consumers in November 2022, with growing fears that the technology will be used to replace workers.

However, researchers argued their findings showed that, at least in the case of consumer ChatGPT, it was mostly used to help improve judgment and productivity of workers, rather than replace all their tasks, especially in knowledge-intensive jobs. 

The study noted that as of July, ChatGPT's user base had grown to 10% of the world's adult population.

Meanwhile, the demographic breakdown of these ChatGPT users had shifted, with the chatbot slowly becoming more universal across genders and national borders.

For example, data from January 2024 showed that 37% of users had typically feminine names, among users with names that could be read as either masculine or feminine.

But as of mid-2025, that gender gap was found to have narrowed dramatically, with female adoption consistent with the general adult demographics. 

ChatGPT has also become more accessible globally, with especially rapid growth in low- and middle-income countries. 

This has resulted in ChatGPT adoption growth rates in the lowest-income countries growing to over 4 times that in the highest-income countries as of May 2025. 

Besides offering different paid tiers on its consumer platform, ChatGPT also offers an enterprise product for businesses, API access and a software engineering agent called Codex.

While ChatGPT has experienced explosive growth in recent years, it's encountering increasing competition from rivals like Elon Musk's XAI and Google's Gemini.

Just this week, Gemini took the top spot among free apps on Apple's App Store, leapfrogging ChatGPT, following the August launch of its ""Nano Banana"" image editor model.

In this article

Alibaba shares rose on Wednesday after Chinese state media reported that the e-commerce giant secured a major customer for its artificial intelligence chips.

China Unicom will deploy Alibaba's AI accelerators from its semiconductor unit called Pingtouge or T-Head, according to a report from China state broadcaster CCTV. Alibaba does not sell chips directly, but companies can effectively use the computing power based on those semiconductors by buying Alibaba cloud services.

A person familiar with the matter endorsed the accuracy of the CCTV report to CNBC. 

Alibaba was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Shares of Alibaba closed more than 5% higher in Hong Kong, and the company's U.S.-listed stock was up more than 2% in premarket trade.

Alibaba's computing power will be used by China Unicom, the country's second-largest telecommunications company, as part of a big new data center project in China that will also include chips from other domestic firms including MetaX and Biren Technology.

The move underscores China's efforts to boost the use of its own domestic semiconductors for AI at a time when Nvidia' access to the world's second-largest economy remains in a state of flux.

On Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that China's internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, told companies to stop buying certain Nvidia AI chips. Shares of Nvidia were about 1% lower in premarket trading.

Alibaba is one of China's leading AI players. It has developed its own AI models and is one of the biggest cloud computing players locally. At the same time, it is developing a brand new AI chip, CNBC reported last month.

It is unclear if China Unicom is using Alibaba's latest chips. Information about the two companies' partnership emerged after CCTV showed a billboard containing the details as part of a report on the telecoms giant's new Sanjiangyuan data center in Qinghai province.

Brené Brown believes in compassionate leadership at work.

Brown, bestselling author and research professor at the University of Houston who studies vulnerability and shame, has been consulting CEOs on what she calls ""courageous leadership.""

On a recent episode of The New York Times' podcast ""The Interview,"" Brown discussed her new book, ""Strong Ground: The Lessons of Daring Leadership, the Tenacity of Paradox, and the Wisdom of the Human Spirit.""

One leadership tactic she has found doesn't work for long-term success is creating a sense of fear in your direct reports.

""Just because the world at large believes that you have to be a total d--- to get performance out of a team, there is actually very little evidence of that over a long period of time,"" she said on the podcast.

While it can be effective, ""fear has a very short shelf life,"" she said. And it's a tool many workers won't tolerate — especially young workers.

""I think we have a new generation of people who won't work that way,"" she said. ""The Gen Z-ers, you're not going to lead them with fear for very long.""

Data supports Brown's thinking. According to a 2025 Gen Z and Millennial Survey from Deloitte, Gen Zers believe a manager's key role is to provide guidance and support, inspire and motivate them, offer mentorship and help them set boundaries to ensure work-life balance.

More than a third, 37% of Gen Zers say their priority at work is to enjoy the job, according to a February 2024 survey of 2,000 Gen Zers by essay writing platform EduBirdie. They're not looking to tough it out and be miserable.

And Gen Z takes that philosophy with them as they take the helm as managers as well. ""If you're not taking any client-facing calls and you're getting your work done and you're at the beach, by all means, go get a tan,"" Rai Tryna, Gen Z manager at a tech company, previously told CNBC Make It.

There are tactics managers can use to skirt leading with fear. They can practice compassion by thanking their team for their hard work if a project has been shelved, for example, Brown noted.

""We see a very compelling, persuasive, strong correlation between courageous and daring leadership and performance,"" she said. Those who practice it see better outcomes.

Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company has walked away from its $19 billion offer for Australia's Santos, ending months of speculation over what would have been one of the country's largest energy deals.

The consortium, which includes Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ and investment firm Carlyle, made the $19 billion indicative offer for Santos in June, but confirmed on Wednesday that it will not proceed with a binding takeover.

""It's over,"" a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. ""The reality is, during the process, Santos was inflexible,"" the source added. CNBC understands the XRG-led consortium had key concerns around value, tax, and the timeliness of disclosure. 

The source also described the Santos negotiation team as ""unrealistic"" and said that this was ""not the outcome"" Abu Dhabi's XRG was hoping for. 

XRG said a ""combination of factors"" derailed its third attempt at securing Santos, which Abu Dhabi had hoped would bolster its ambitions to export LNG into the Asia markets. It's understood other issues, such as a lack of communication and inflexibility over capital gains tax, and recent media reports over environmental risks that the consortium was not previously aware of, were part of the broader issues that derailed the deal. 

Although talks with Santos have collapsed, the consortium is still expected to explore opportunities in Australia's energy sector. Sources familiar with the matter also emphasised that regulatory approvals, and unions, were not a concern, calling the decision ""purely commercial.""

XRG, which has an enterprise value of $80 billion, recently took control of ADNOC's listed subsidiaries, in a move to strengthen its financial position to seek out global energy deals.

Santos, headquartered in Adelaide, has been the subject of repeated takeover interest as global demand for natural gas accelerates alongside the energy transition. The company plays a key role in supplying LNG to Asian buyers, and has been a strategic target for international investors. 

CNBC has reached out to Santos for comment.

If it feels like we have lived through a filler episode before the big season finale, well, that's because it's fairly accurate.

Investors are anticipating the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting Wednesday, when they get to hear its interest rate decision and Chair Jerome Powell's (arguably more important) press conference.

Markets were hence in an awkward limbo Tuesday. U.S. stocks declined, but only mildly. The S&P 500 dipped 0.13% — but still closed above the 6,600 level it broke Monday — and even hit a fresh intraday record earlier in the session.

In other words, investors didn't seem to want to make any big moves before the Fed's meeting ends.

Even news that broke yesterday stateside — while unrelated to the central bank and interest rates — were focused on casting an eye to the future rather than immediate developments. Further U.S.-China trade talks will happen before November, while President Donald Trump extended, for the fourth time, the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business.

All of that contributed to the feeling of watching the credits roll just as a cliffhanger occurred.

(Spoiler alert: There'll almost definitely be a 25 basis points rate cut — an extra-large 50 point slash is unlikely, unless the ""outies"" of some Fed officials overpower their independent ""innies."")

China maintains strict control over rare earths. Foreign companies are still finding it hard to access those minerals, with one losing ""millions of euros,"" according to the European Chamber of Commerce in China on Monday.

Baidu shares spike nearly 16% Wednesday. An artificial intelligence-related deal with a state-owned enterprise, advancements in the Baidu's AI models and an offshore bond offering were events that contributed to investor enthusiasm.

Japan's exports slow their decline. Trade with Asia and Western Europe climbed in August, which helped offset further drops in exports to the U.S. Overall, shipments fell 0.1% year on year, lower than expected.

U.S. stocks slip ahead of Fed meeting. All major indexes dipped slightly Tuesday, with tech shares such as Nvidia and Microsoft pulling back. Asia-Pacific markets were mixed Wednesday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech index surged as Baidu shares jumped.

[PRO] AI leaders in China are emerging. Mainland companies have been monetizing generative AI in the past two years, making it clearer which ones are succeeding. UBS has picked two of its favorites that look like they still have room to run.

Fed set to cut rates, but forecast for rest of 2025 is key to markets with politics clouding the picture

The Federal Reserve meets this week with some big items on the agenda: An important rate decision and forecast of what's ahead, combined with a healthy dose of political intrigue uncommon for central bank policymakers.

On the monetary side, the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday will release its ruling on where it will set the overnight borrowing rate. Politically, there will be one new Fed governor, President Donald Trump's appointee Stephen Miran, who almost certainly will dissent from the widely expected decision to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point, opting for an even bigger cut.

Eric Trump, co-founder and chief strategy officer at American Bitcoin Corp. (NASDAQ:ABTC) has lauded blockchain adoption as the future of traditional finance.

What Happened: Speaking on CNBC on Tuesday, Trump described Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) as ""modern-day gold,"" highlighting its security, liquidity, and role as a global hedge that has delivered strong long-term returns.

He pointed to growing institutional adoption, from Fortune 500 corporations to sovereign wealth funds, and framed Bitcoin as a generational asset.

The launch of American Bitcoin, a hybrid mining and treasury firm spun out of Hut Eight's restructuring, follows the Trump family's experiences with debanking by major U.S. banks, which Eric says revealed the vulnerabilities of traditional finance and accelerated their push into crypto.

Addressing questions about conflicts of interest during his father's presidency, Trump stressed that the family's ventures reflect business necessity rather than political profiteering.

He argued that the Trump Organization has faced costs, not windfalls, from politics.

Why It Matters: Looking ahead, the president's son forecasts a transformational shift in financial markets, with blockchain making systems faster, cheaper, and more efficient.

He warned that traditional institutions slow to adapt will face a ""slow and painful death.""

Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. together hold nearly 20% of ABTC shares, according to Reuters.

Recently, Eric called crypto the greatest hedge to real estate and one of the best assets of our time.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

Bitcoin is perhaps the most mainstream cryptocurrency -- attracting investors due to its scarcity and broadening adoption.

XRP is bringing much-needed enhancements to clunky payments infrastructure. 

While XRP's utility is clear, its applications may be narrower in scope compared to that of Bitcoin. 

When it comes to digital currency, a handful of names consistently dominate the conversation. Chief among them are Bitcoin and XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) -- two of the most recognizable players in the cryptocurrency market.

As of the closing bell on Sept. 12, XRP has surged 48% so far this year -- exactly double Bitcoin's gains. With that kind of momentum behind it, investors may be wondering if XRP is positioned to emerge as the next heavyweight contender in the crypto arena.

At its core, Bitcoin's appeal stems from its scarcity. With a fixed supply capped at 21 million coins, it is inherently designed as a deflationary asset -- a sharp contrast to fiat currencies that can be printed without limit. This structural distinction has led many in the financial world to dub Bitcoin ""digital gold"" -- a title that underscores both its rarity and the effort required to produce new coins.

Another factor driving Bitcoin's prominence is its growing role in corporate treasury. Companies such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and GameStop have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as part of their cash management operations.

On an even larger scale, several sovereign nations are evaluating the creation of strategic Bitcoin reserves -- effectively mirroring corporate treasury practices, but at a global, more sophisticated scale.

These developments highlight how ubiquitous Bitcoin has become -- increasingly viewed not only as a store of value, but also as a hedge against inflation and a tool to mitigate systemic financial risk.

XRP has carved out a distinct niche within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape: global payments.

Today, thousands of enterprises depend on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network to settle cross-border transactions. Yet many view SWIFT's infrastructure as slow and expensive -- with businesses often bearing the brunt of hefty foreign exchange fees and multiday settlement times.

XRP aims to solve these pain points through near-instant processing and nominal transaction costs. With the global market for cross-border transactions measured in the trillions of dollars annually, XRP's opportunity is vast -- positioning the cryptocurrency with disruptive, tangible utility.

However, the catch is where XRP actually operates: XRP transactions occur on the Ripple network.

While Ripple has forged relationships with banks and financial institutions, the adoption of its infrastructure does not necessarily translate into widespread usage of XRP. Put simply, Ripple's success as a payments platform does not automatically fuel proportional demand for the XRP token.

Given this analysis, it's evident that Bitcoin and XRP occupy fundamentally different roles in the digital asset ecosystem.

Bitcoin functions as a macro asset -- a hedge against inflation, a reserve instrument, and even a potential bargaining chip in global economic dialogue. By contrast, XRP specializes in a narrower application: improving the speed and cost of cross-border payments.

These distinctions are critical for investors to grasp. Bitcoin's underlying value is derived from its scarcity and singular status as a decentralized asset -- a multi-platform store of value. XRP's value proposition, on the other hand, stems from enhancing efficiency within an industry that is ripe for disruption, but where usage of the token is not a requirement.

While XRP has clear utility and the potential to capture a meaningful share of an enormous and growing payments market, its investment profile should not be conflated with that of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is increasingly gaining momentum in the alternative asset world, whereas XRP remains an application-driven opportunity with specific demand needs.

For these reasons, I do not see XRP emerging as the next Bitcoin-style investment in the crypto world.

Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, newly appointed chairman of Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc (AMEX:BMNR), is positioning the company as a leading Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) treasury play as Wall Street accelerates its shift toward blockchain-based finance.

What Happened: In an interview with Global Money Talk, Lee highlighted that Ethereum is entering a “super cycle” that could define the next decade, with financial institutions increasingly choosing Ethereum as the backbone for digitizing assets.

Since his appointment, Bitmine has become the world's second-largest crypto treasury, holding roughly $9 billion worth of Ethereum.

The company's stock has surged tenfold in the same period, far outpacing Ethereum's own performance.

Lee compares Bitmine's strategy to Strategy's Bitcoin play, arguing that corporate treasuries offer structural advantages over direct crypto ownership.

Bitmine has dramatically increased Ethereum holdings per share while its proof-of-stake model generates sizable income.

With $9 billion staked, Lee estimates annual pre-tax net income of about $300 million — enough to place Bitmine among the most profitable U.S. companies.

Why It Matters: Institutional investors have quickly backed Bitmine, including Founders Fund, Stan Druckenmiller, Galaxy Digital, Cathie Wood's ARK Funds, and Bill Miller.

With a $10 billion market cap, Bitmine's scale and credibility set it apart in the crowded crypto treasury space.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

 A significant portion of the almost $12 billion ETH awaiting withdrawal may be sold to lock in profits, considering Ether's 100% gains over the past year. 

Key takeaways:

Ether queued for unstaking hits a record $12 billion, with a 44-day wait time. 

Strategic reserves and ETF holdings have jumped by 116% since July 1, allaying fears of a potential ETH sell-off.

The amount of Ether (ETH) in the queue waiting to be unstaked has surged to its highest level, as investors may be looking to cash in on yearly profits.

Ethereum's exit queue surpassed 2.6 million ETH worth $12 billion last week, with a 44-day wait time.

This marked the largest amount of Ether ever set for withdrawal by the network's validators, who are responsible for adding new blocks and verifying transactions in proposed blocks, playing a vital role in securing the Ethereum blockchain.

Related: How high can Ethereum price go after Fed rate cut?

Data from ValidatorQueue noted that the number of active validators was above 1.05 million, with 29.4% of the total ETH supply staked, i.e., around 35.6 million ETH. 

“Ethereum staking exit queue goes parabolic,” macro analyst MartyPary commented on the largest validator exodus in crypto history.  

While this does not mean that all the validators are looking to sell their holdings, a significant portion of the over $12 billion may be offloaded to lock in profits, notably as the Ether price has risen 97% over the past 12 months.

“The Ethereum exit queue is at a record high, with huge amounts of $ETH now waiting to exit staking,” said crypto YouTuber Lark Davis in an X post, adding:

Meanwhile, the Ethereum staking entry queue reached its lowest level in four weeks, adding to fears that a surge in the exit queue could lead to a major sell-off. 

More than 512,755 ETH, worth around $2.3 billion, were waiting to be staked at the time of writing, down from 959,717 ETH on Sept. 5, indicating a slowdown in demand for staking Ether.

Increasing accumulation and buying strength from Ether treasury companies and spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are absorbing much of the selling pressure. 

Data from strategicethreserve.xyz highlights that collective holdings of strategic reserves and ETFs have surged 116% since July 1, climbing to 11,762,594 ETH from 5,445,458 ETH. 

The sharp increase underscores a swift influx of Ether supply into the hands of major institutional and corporate players.

The majority of these entities have or will stake the asset for additional yields for their strategies, which may boost the entry queue in the coming weeks.

Another bullish narrative is tied to the potential launch of ETH staking ETFs. This implies that some investors may be freeing up liquidity to re-enter these products later, effectively reshuffling their exposure without exiting the ETH market.

While the SEC's final deadline for approval is set for April 2026, popular analyst Axel Bitblaze said the green light could come much sooner, possibly as early as October 2025.

“I know we have been waiting for the ETH ETFs approval, but now it's only a matter of time,” the analyst wrote in a Tuesday X post, adding:

Capital continued to flow into crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) last week, with Ethereum investment products attracting $646 million in inflows, marking a return of institutional investor appetite for ETH.

Digital asset treasuries face pressure as market values decline, but Ethereum-focused vehicles could benefit from staking advantages and sustain growth.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Digital asset treasuries have come under renewed pressure after a sharp drop in their market net asset values, or mNAVs, raising doubts about their ability to sustain continued crypto purchases, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.

Listed companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheets, known as digital asset treasuries, or DATs, have seen share prices decline in recent weeks as investors reassess the sustainability of their strategies.

Kendrick said that an mNAV above 1 is essential for DATs to expand their holdings, while values below that threshold signal weaker balance sheets and potential consolidation.

Kendrick said the current downturn may create opportunities for differentiation rather than signaling the end of the sector.

Factors such as access to low-cost funding, scale advantages, and yield from staking or DeFi are expected to separate stronger players from weaker ones.

Ethereum-focused DATs are seen as the most sustainable, partly because staking returns can directly enhance mNAVs. Bitmine strategist Tom Lee has estimated that staking alone could add 0.6 points to the mNAV of Ethereum-based DATs.

This dynamic positions Ethereum vehicles more favorably than those tied primarily to Bitcoin or Solana, which lack similar yield mechanics.

DATs collectively hold about 4% of Bitcoin, 3.1% of Ethereum, and 0.8% of Solana in circulation, making their health a key driver of crypto demand.

Kendrick said consolidation is more likely among Bitcoin treasuries, leading to coin rotation rather than net new buying. By contrast, Ethereum DATs are poised to keep accumulating, providing a stronger tailwind for ether prices relative to rivals.

Key players in the sector include Bitmine, SharpLink, and The Ether Machine, all of which have become closely watched by investors who track the intersection of corporate balance sheets and digital assets.

Written byAnanda Banerjee

Edited byHarsh Notariya

The Federal Reserve's rate cut decision is just hours away, with traders debating whether the move will be 25 basis points, 50, or none at all. The uncertainty has fueled both caution and euphoria, but beneath the noise, three altcoins to watch ahead of the event have surfaced.  

Each is seeing strong inflows from large holders while forming bullish chart patterns that could drive the next leg higher.

Clearpool, an RWA-focused lending project, is trading at $0.155 — down 1.2% over the past week and 12% in the past month, but still up 40% in three months. Under the surface, accumulation is strong. 

Top 100 wallets, which include both mega-holders and whales, added 25.21 million CPOOL in the last seven days, worth about $3.91 million at current prices. That push by big wallets resulted in exchange balances dropping by 10.8 million CPOOL. 

Since exchange balances fell by only 10.8 million against the 25.21 million added by large holders, it suggests retail and smart money may be offloading, even as whales accumulate.

Technically, CPOOL is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders structure. The neckline resistance sits at $0.181, with the next hurdle at $0.193. A breakout above these levels could project upside toward $0.240, based on the head-to-neckline projection.

Momentum also supports the case. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures price speed and direction, has shown hidden bullish divergence: price has made higher lows, while RSI has made lower lows. This divergence often signals trend continuation (the 3-month bullish trend), strengthening the odds that CPOOL's neckline breakout could happen and hold. 

The bullish structure weakens under $0.149, while a drop below $0.141 — the “head” of the pattern — would fully invalidate it.

Together, on-chain accumulation, shrinking exchange balances, and supportive momentum indicators make CPOOL one of the altcoins to watch ahead of the Fed's decision.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been one of the altcoins to watch after Circle announced plans to expand USDC into its validators, giving the project a strong narrative boost. Price action, however, has been muted in the short term. HYPE trades near $54, flat for the past seven days, even though it remains up 25% over the past month.

Retail may be frustrated by this range-bound action. On-chain flows show retail wallets have steadily sold, with spot net outflows last week at $101.21 million. That figure now stands at $19.04 million — an 81% drop — showing selling pressure has risen. Retail may have exited during the chop, but they could be missing what larger players are positioning for. 

And despite the retail pressure, the prices have not corrected over the past week, and the overall pressure still supports the buyers. Whales could be the reason. 

The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which measures how much money is moving in or out of a token, makes that clear. While HYPE was consolidating inside a bull flag pattern, CMF surged from -0.07 to +0.15 in just two days. This sharp swing suggests bigger wallets are buying and pressing liquidity higher, even as retail trims exposure.

The price chart reinforces this shift. HYPE has just broken out of a bull flag on the daily chart. 

The pole of the pattern projects an upside target near $73, about 35% higher than current levels. To sustain momentum, the HYPE price needs to stay above $57, while invalidation of the bullish setup sits below $48. 

Cardano, one of the leading Layer-1 networks, is trading at $0.87, moving sideways for the past week and down 3.6% over the month. Still, over the past three months, ADA has remained up 47%. This muted short-term action comes just as the Fed rate cut decision looms, and whale wallets are quietly positioning for what could be a breakout.

On-chain data shows the largest cohort — holding 1 billion+ ADA — has added 60 million coins since September 9, taking their stash to 1.94 billion. Another large group holding 10 million–100 million coins has added 40 million ADA in just the past 24 hours, lifting their total to 13.05 billion. Together, that's 100 million new ADA accumulated in less than a week — worth about $87 million at current prices. 

This mix of steady long-term buying and sudden short-term pickup suggests whales may have spotted a key technical signal.

That signal is the completion of ADA's cup-and-handle formation. The token has broken above the handle's upper trendline, hinting that consolidation may be ending. 

The next checkpoints are $0.91 and $0.95. A clean move above $0.95 would confirm the breakout and set ADA on course for $1.17, the projected target of the cup. 

The invalidation sits at $0.78, the lowest point of the cup. RSI divergence also supports the setup: between August 21 and September 15, ADA made higher lows while RSI made lower lows, a hidden bullish signal. With whales stepping in and Fed rate cuts potentially adding fuel, ADA's pattern looks ready as one of the top altcoins to watch ahead of the Fed rate cut decision.

Bitcoin BTC$115,791.75 rose to its highest point since Aug. 22 on Wednesday, reaching $117,300 before receding to $116,400.

Much of Wednesday's excitement is yet to come, hinging on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate decision at 18:00 UTC and subsequent press conference. The Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points, 

The early move was intriguing because it stopped at the same point as a notable ""CME gap,"" the disparity between where bitcoin futures close on a Friday and open on a Sunday.

With that gap now filled, bitcoin could begin to consolidate in a range away from critical levels of support at $110,000, this will likely lead to more capital rotating into altcoins.

According to CoinMarketCap data, bitcoin dominance has ticked down to 57%, the lowest point since January, suggesting the market is leaning toward speculative altcoin plays as opposed to BTC in a period of low volatility.

Oops, something went wrong

Altcoin season has arrived.

It kicked off earlier in September as 75% of the top 50 coins had performed better than Bitcoin over the past 90 days, according to Blockchain Center, the crypto data company. The list excludes stablecoins.

The term altcoin season refers to a period when cryptocurrencies that aren't Bitcoin outpace the biggest crypto when it comes to upside price action.

The rotation from Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies will accelerate from here thanks to booming corporate treasuries, cheaper capital and regulatory tailwinds, analysts say.

Shane Molidor, founder of crypto investment bank and advisory firm Forgd, told DL News that the cyclical nature of Bitcoin and altcoin markets means investors “will likely rebalance incrementally, allocating capital to altcoins.”

The comments come as Bitcoin has dominated this cycle with roaring record prices and hype on Wall Street. Investors have ploughed almost $10 billion into Bitcoin exchange-trading funds so far this year, according to SoSoValue. Those funds are run by the likes of investment behemoth BlackRock.

Yet, the top crypto's dominance has slumped by almost 6% over the past six months to take up 58% of the $4 trillion market, according to TradingView.

At the same time, CoinMarketCap's alt season index is at 71, up from just 44 last month, while Coinglass' tracker reached 80 out of 100, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum.

The data seemingly punctures hedge fund managers' assumption that Bitcoin will dominate the market for some time yet.

Here are the top three drivers behind the altcoin rally.

The altcoin bullishness comes as the US Federal Reserve is set to slash interest rates on Wednesday.

Investors see an interest rate cut as all but certain, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That will inject fresh liquidity into the global financial system.

Lower borrowing costs incentivises investors to bet on risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, which tend to pump their prices.

As risk appetite grows, “we are likely to see a drill-down approach, whereby the top-ranking layer 2 and ecosystem tokens by TVL, volume, and protocol revenue become prime candidates for [treasury] inclusion,” Molidor said.

While most traders are betting that the US central bank will slash borrowing costs by 0.25%, there is a small chance that it goes even deeper with a 0.5% cut.

A bigger cut may trigger “a significant rally in crypto since no one is truly expecting it,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV global, said in comments shared with DL News.

Crypto treasury companies have emerged as leverage engines of this cycle, sucking in billions in institutional capital.

By issuing debt and buying crypto, digital asset treasuries, or DATs, create a reflexive flywheel for price action, Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, said.

Annabelle Huang, founder of execution layer Altius, told DL News that momentum behind altcoin treasuries “will likely continue for high quality altcoins with sustainable revenue, at least as long as the DATs themselves have a sound structure, and continue to have access to cheap funding.”

Treasury firms are likely to pick tokens from battle-tested blockchains with sustainable tokenomics, an active ecosystem, and healthy user metrics, Huang argued

But “momentum will fizzle quickly for firms that don't meet these two requirements,” she added.

The alts most likely to benefit from treasury firms seeking to capture extra upside are household-names like “Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Sui, along with their top performing ecosystem tokens,” Molidor said.

Last week, crypto got its biggest endorsement yet from the US government.

Paul Atkins, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declared that “crypto's time has come” and vowed to end years of hostility from the oversight agency.

The SEC's Project Crypto initiative “will clarify that most crypto tokens are not securities, create a unified regulatory umbrella for trading, lending, and staking platforms,” dispelling years of controversy on altcoins.

The agency is currently reviewing more than 90 exchange-traded products, including altcoin applications for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, XRP, and Litecoin.

The SEC's decision deadline for several of those applications begins in mid-October, with analysts like Balchunas predicting high approval chances for major altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. Some of those deadlines have been moved to mid-November.

The SEC's commitment to creating more crypto rules comes on the back of US President Donald Trump's embrace of digital asset and him championing pro-industry policies.

For a full-scale altcoin rally like in past cycles, both profit rotation and confidence are key, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News.

“Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively,” he said.

Bitcoin is up 1.1% over the past 24 hours to trade at $117,200.

Ethereum is up 0.5% over the past 24 hours trading at $4,540.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Move Industries, the company behind the Movement project, revealed plans on Tuesday to transition into a Layer 1 network from a sidechain, aiming to deliver performance improvements and enable native token staking.

In a thread of X posts on Tuesday, Move Industries said it has hit its ceiling as a sidechain, and a Move-based L1 can help reach 10,000 transactions per second at sub-second latency. That represents a leap from the current 500-600 TPS limitation, the company said in a Tuesday statement.

The L1 transition will also unlock Move 2.0, the company said. ""Move 2 updates Move, the best smart contract language. It allows for enum types, index notation, compound statement, and more,"" the company added.

The planned L1 network is set to feature native staking, supported by a validator network that helps secure Movement. Under this new design, locked MOVE tokens would be excluded from staking eligibility.

The company plans to launch a developer testnet in the near future, with a mainnet migration targeted for the end of 2025, according to the statement.

The project noted that the migration is expected to be seamless for users, requiring no action on their part. All existing funds, smart contracts, and network activity are set to carry over unchanged.

Onchain activity on Movement has accelerated in recent months. Movement's total value locked climbed to $200.6 million as of Wednesday, up from $156.2 million at the start of September, according to Defilama data. Movement DEX volume jumped to $343.6 million in August, more than tripling from $110.4 million in July.

MOVE, the native token of Movement, climbed 1.9% in the past 24 hours to trade at around $0.13 as of 3:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to The Block's price page. It has a market capitalization of $349 million.

In May, Movement Labs dismissed co-founder Rushi Manche after revelations of a controversial market-making scandal involving 66 million MOVE tokens, about 5% of the supply. The company then restructured under new leadership as Move Industries, led by early employees Torab You and Will Gaines, pledging greater transparency and stronger community engagement.

 Fintechs like Robinhood and Stripe are building blockchains as Wall Street explores digital assets, but execution bottlenecks still stand in the way of institutional adoption. 

The next wave of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is emerging as established fintech firms begin building their own blockchains.

Financial services app Robinhood recently announced that it is building its own layer-2 blockchain to support tokenized stocks and real-world assets, while Stripe followed with plans for Tempo, a payments-focused chain built with Paradigm.

“That's going to be the beginning of many others to come,” Annabelle Huang, co-founder of Altius Labs, told Cointelegraph in an interview. “The fintechs in Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets that have looked into this for many years now are also getting ready to make more moves.”

Huang has lived through the stages of crypto's gradual courtship with Wall Street. After starting her career trading foreign exchange and rates in New York, she joined Amber Group in Hong Kong as its managing partner and helped scale it into one of Asia's largest crypto liquidity providers during the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom.

The new wave of fintech-led blockchains faces the same performance issues that have dogged crypto since its inception. Wall Street firms trade in microseconds, while blockchains still process transactions in seconds or, at best, milliseconds. Huang called this the industry's “execution bottleneck” and argued it must be cleared before fintech-built chains can carry the weight of institutional capital.

Since leaving Amber Group, Huang has turned her focus to solving the execution bottleneck. With Altius Labs, she is building a modular execution layer designed to plug directly into existing blockchains, boosting throughput without forcing projects to rebuild their entire stack.

“Our goal is to bring performance to any blockchain in a plug-and-play way,” Huang said. “That way, a chain can upgrade its block execution time and throughput without having to redesign its entire architecture.”

She described the approach as bringing modularity deeper into the execution layer of the blockchain stack, which is a departure from the usual model of spinning up sidechains or new layer 2s. By focusing on the execution engine itself, Huang argues that Web3 can close the gap with Web2-level performance while preserving the distributed nature of blockchains.

On June 27, 2025, Wall Street showed just how big the performance gap is between modern blockchains and traditional finance infrastructure. Nasdaq's closing auction for the annual Russell index reconstitution — an event when index funds reshuffle their holdings — matched 2.5 billion shares in just 0.871 seconds. The exchange's INET system is advertised to handle more than 1 million order messages per second with sub-40-microsecond latency.

By contrast, blockchains still operate at a fraction of that speed. Ethereum processes about 15 transactions per second with block times of around 12 seconds. Solana — one of the fastest major networks — has a roughly 400-millisecond block time and handles several thousand transactions per second in practice. Even at their best, those figures don't meet the benchmarks institutions expect before shifting meaningful trading activity onchain.

Blockchains have improved scaling, with Ethereum L2s offloading traffic to rollups. Solana's next-generation validator client, Firedancer, aims to narrow the gap further. 

Huang claimed that the industry should not expect more “Ethereum killers” or general-purpose blockchains to emerge, adding that users prefer to consolidate around a few dominant platforms rather than scatter across dozens of new chains.

“But within Ethereum, there was still the scalability issue, and that's why people started spinning up new block spaces by setting up sidechains. And then L2s introduced additional fragmentation and difficult UI/UX because of it,” she said.

Though the next wave of institutional adoption calls for improvements on existing blockchain networks, Wall Street hasn't waited for these technical upgrades before piling into the digital gold rush. For many large investors, exposure has come indirectly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or corporate treasuries. Bitcoin (BTC) funds have become easy entry points, while companies like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) have turned themselves into leveraged proxies for the asset.

The blueprint hasn't worked for everyone. Throughout 2025, struggling firms latched onto the “Bitcoin treasury” narrative as a last-ditch way to spark investor enthusiasm. Some briefly saw their stock prices surge, only to retrace soon after. The weak finances of some of these companies have also raised concerns about what might happen if they falter during unfavorable market conditions.

Huang said these pivots can be risky, especially for retail investors, because not all corporate Bitcoin strategies are structured the same way. She compared the stock spikes to token launches — an initial bid-up, followed by a return to “fair value.” However, she argued that demand for proxies like ETFs and treasury strategies will continue to exist.

“Before MicroStrategy, there was Grayscale. Everyone assumed that once a Bitcoin ETF was approved, the Grayscale premium would disappear, and so would the MicroStrategy trade. But if you look closer, investors still prefer MicroStrategy over an ETF for a few reasons,” Huang said.

“First, because Michael Saylor has been accumulating for a longer period, their average cost basis is lower. Second, they've done several rounds of fundraising through convertible bonds, which introduces leverage. That makes MicroStrategy effectively a slightly levered play on Bitcoin at a lower cost basis,” she added.

Huang also said that while ETF options exist for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), investors who want altcoin exposure often turn to debt strategies instead.

Fintechs like Robinhood and Stripe are becoming the next stage of institutional blockchain commitment. Rather than adding crypto tickers to trading apps, they are now investing in their own blockchains — a step toward embedding digital assets into their core infrastructure.

The infrastructure around them is shifting as well. Over-the-counter desks, once discreet on-ramps for hedge funds to buy Bitcoin off-exchange, are now positioning themselves as regulated liquidity providers.

In practice, that means offering the compliance, settlement and reporting standards that institutional clients expect, bringing crypto one step closer to Wall Street norms.

“What we're seeing now — and I expect even more going forward — is a trend of institutions adopting stablecoins or even building their own blockchains for specific use cases,” Huang said.

These are conversations she was having with institutional players four years ago at Amber Group. Now, “they're finally ready to act.”

The move comes amid debate about whether mainland China should follow Hong Kong's footsteps and embrace stablecoins

Shanghai, mainland China's financial centre, has become one of the first cities in the country to use an overseas cryptocurrency trading platform to reprice and sell more than 90,000 filecoins – a blockchain-based storage token – that were seized in criminal cases.

A district-level court partnered with a third-party institution in mainland China, which sold the cryptocurrency on a licensed platform in Hong Kong, according to an announcement by Shanghai's Supreme People's Court on Tuesday.

The proceeds from the sale were transferred to a court-controlled bank account and will be allocated to the national treasury or refunded to the victims, in line with legal procedures.

But there have been discussions among market players and academics about whether mainland China should emulate Hong Kong – which introduced its first stablecoin ordinance on August 1 – to promote the offshore adoption of the yuan.

Handling crypto assets in cases involving Chinese citizens and companies also presents new challenges for the judiciary.

Share this article

Dubai/Hong Kong,  September 17, 2025 – MANTRA, the Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for real world assets (RWAs), today announced that its latest mainnet upgrades are now live. With this release, MANTRA has become the first blockchain to support both EVM and CosmWasm smart contracts natively, thereby making it the first true MultiVM layer 1 built specifically for real world assets (RWAs). Coupled with MANTRA Finance's Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the upgrade further strengthens MANTRA's position to compliantly capitalize upon the expanding tokenization market. 

This milestone reflects not just a technical achievement in MANTRA's roadmap, but a strategic evolution. The MultiVM design allows developers and institutions to build with familiar tools, while gaining the security and scalability of MANTRA Chain. The upgrades also prepare the network for future enhancements such as permissioned liquidity pools, institutional compliance frameworks, and deeper interoperability with other blockchains. These changes make it easier for developers, investors and asset owners to bring traditional assets onchain and for global investors to access them in a secure, transparent way.

As the $16 trillion tokenization opportunity accelerates, institutional adoption has converged on EVM infrastructure. MANTRA has responded by fully embracing EVM compatibility to meet developers and institutions where they are.

“MANTRA Chain is at the heart of the MANTRA ecosystem,” said John Patrick Mullin, Founder and CEO of MANTRA. “With this EVM upgrade, we're not just improving performance, we're further embedding compliance into the protocol, opening the door to a new era of accessibility, trust, and regulatory clarity when tokenizing real world assets. It's another important step toward making the future of finance more open and efficient for everyone.”

“This evolution of MANTRA Chain will further our position to meet the market where it is, and where we believe it is headed. Two critical factors that distinguish MANTRA from the competition are our Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and our compliance-driven infrastructure. When combined with full EVM interoperability, these will give investors, developers and asset owners what they seek – a powerful and compliant chain.”

Unlike most blockchains, which add compliance via smart contracts, MANTRA enforces regulatory requirements at the protocol level, which provides a significantly higher level of confidence as to compliance versus smart contracts. As a result, institutions no longer have to choose between regulatory clarity and EVM accessibility – they can have both. For developers, it couples the full set of EVM opcodes and precompiles, with low fees, and infrastructure that's been truly optimized for RWA applications.

Immediate benefits include;

Developers can now deploy Solidity-based dApps directly on MANTRA Chain with no changes required. They can also fork and customize DeFi protocols for RWAs. Soon after they'll be able to bridge funds seamlessly from other EVM chains.

Institutions gain access to a chain that is both EVM compatible and self-sovereign, coupled with MANTRA Finance's VASP license from VARA in Dubai  – covering exchange, broker-dealer, and investment services.

The mainnet upgrade builds upon a period of rapid momentum for MANTRA. In recent weeks, MANTRA announced a strategic partnership with Inveniam to build a global institutional RWA ecosystem anchored in the UAE and United States, and a buyback of its $OM token to reinforce long-term ecosystem growth. 

MANTRA has made significant improvements to governance and decentralization, onboarding both Binance, Nansen and Inveniam as validators, while winding down internal ones. On 21 and 22 October, MANTRA will host Agentic., a two-day summit in Abu Dhabi – the ‘capital of capital' – designed for  leaders driving the next wave of markets, trading, tokenization, and deep financial innovation.

With these critical foundations now in place , MANTRA is entering its next chapter,  focusing on scaling adoption, onboarding new asset issuers, and demonstrating how tokenized finance can operate in a secure, transparent, and compliant way.

MANTRA is a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain designed for real world assets, with native support for regulatory compliance. As a permissionless chain and EVM-compatible, MANTRA empowers developers and institutions to participate in the growing RWA tokenization space through advanced modular technology, compliance-ready features, and cross-chain interoperability.

MANTRA holds a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) to operate as a Virtual Asset Exchange and provide broker-dealer, management, and investment services.

Blockchain is steadily finding its place in the travel industry, creating new ways for people to capture and share their journeys. American Express is adding to this shift by offering card members a tool that enriches how they remember trips. Through Amex Passport, customers can collect digital stamps, designed as NFTs, that represent the countries or regions they have visited. These stamps function as lasting digital souvenirs, giving travel memories a permanent and modern form.

Members receive digital stamps whenever they travel abroad and make in-person payments with their American Express card.Each stamp includes the following details:

Travelers can personalize their stamps with notes about memorable meals, activities, or attractions from their trips. These personal touches are not recorded on the blockchain but can be shared with family, friends, or on social media, turning the stamps into both private keepsakes and shareable mementos.

American Express based the initiative on insights from a survey of travelers. Findings showed that 73% of respondents wanted more digital ways to celebrate previous journeys, while 56% missed the custom of collecting physical passport stamps. These figures suggest strong interest in new formats for travel memorabilia.

Luke Gebb, Executive Vice President at Amex Digital Labs, explained that “Part of the magic of travel is reminiscing about past getaways, and commemorative keepsakes are a powerful way for travelers to relive their favorite trips.” He said, “As physical passport stamps continue to disappear, Amex Passport creates an opportunity for Card Members to celebrate their travels.”

The Amex Passport project reflects a wider trend where cryptocurrency and blockchain are steadily intersecting with tourism. Earlier this year, the travel service Travala integrated cryptocurrency payment methods into more than 2.2 million hotel listings on Trivago.

A report from Binance Pay and Travala in May indicated that travelers using digital currencies for bookings tended to spend considerably greater amounts than those paying with traditional money.

Additional data from Triple-A, published in February, reported that airlines accepting cryptocurrency saw reservations rise over 40%. The same report noted that 14% of all digital currency transactions recorded in 2024 were directed toward travel and hospitality. Together, these statistics highlight the growing relevance of blockchain and crypto within the travel space.

The world is changing, and so is the way we get paid. NFTs are starting to make their way into payroll systems, and while it sounds futuristic, it also raises a lot of questions and concerns. Receiving your salary in a digital asset, which represents your hard-earned cash? That's a concept that might take some getting used to.

Crypto payments are becoming more mainstream. We're seeing companies, from startups to established firms, exploring ways to incorporate digital currencies into their payroll systems. Jack Butcher, a digital artist who has made waves in the NFT space, is leading the charge with his projects like Checks and Opepen Edition collections. These NFTs are serving as a bridge between the financial world and the digital realm, making transactions easier.

In 2025, we saw significant deals that pushed crypto payroll into the spotlight. Companies realized that offering employees the option to get paid in cryptocurrencies could help keep them happy and engaged. The Great Resignation has only added fuel to this fire. People are looking for jobs with crypto pay, and businesses are starting to take note.

NFTs in payroll have their perks. First off, they provide a transparent record of transactions. If you want to check your earnings or bonuses, it's all there for you to see. This can build trust, which is crucial in any workplace.

Also, they allow for payment flexibility. Employees can choose to receive their pay in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, which makes the model attractive to freelancers and contractors who often invoice freelancers in crypto. This flexibility can help them manage their finances better.

But let's not forget the issues. Market volatility is a big one. The value of cryptocurrencies isn't stable, and if not managed well, it could lead to significant pay discrepancies. Companies will need to find a way to mitigate this risk, possibly by using stablecoins.

Regulatory hurdles are another concern. With governments still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies, companies need to ensure they're compliant. This uncertainty could slow down the adoption of crypto payroll.

And of course, the tech side of things can't be ignored. Building and maintaining these systems will require expertise and investment.

Some companies are already using NFTs for payroll, and they seem to be doing alright. There's a startup that's paying salaries in Bitcoin, attracting talent from around the world. It's a unique approach, and it's working for them.

Then there's a gaming company using NFTs to reward players with in-game assets that can be turned into real-world value. This shows that there's versatility in how NFTs can be used for payroll.

As we look to the future, the demand for flexible payment options is only going to grow. The intersection of crypto and HR is becoming more pronounced, with new tools and platforms emerging. Companies that can adapt will likely attract top talent, as people increasingly want jobs that offer innovative ways to get paid.

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that use NFTs for governance could also become more common. This might give employees a say in payroll policies, which could foster a sense of community.

Integrating NFTs into payroll systems is a big deal. We're shifting towards a more digital economy, and crypto payroll could bring a lot of transparency, flexibility, and efficiency. There are challenges, but the benefits are clear. As more companies catch on, getting paid in crypto might become the norm, changing the way we think about work and payment.

The impending closure of Christie's digital art department and the reduction in staff working on NFT sales at other auction houses during the past year calls into question the future of once-astronomically-priced blockchain assets. Four years ago, Christie's sold Everydays: The First 5000 Days by American digital artist Beeple for a record-setting $69.3 million. Since then, NFT sales have plummeted, and the share of collectors buying digital art has dropped from 17% in 2022 to 9% in 2024.

Statista estimates that the total NFT market will reach just over $504 million in 2025. This is quite a meager number considering that The Merge by Pak sold for $91.8 million in December 2021. Granted, it was the most expensive piece of digital art to ever hit the market and was purchased by not one buyer, but several thousand. 

Christie's, Manhattan, New York. License

This is part of the appeal: highly valuable art that can be bought in shares and made accessible to the broader collecting public. Buyers are often able to access better deals on NFTs than art sold at auction or in galleries, because artists can cut out the middleman and sell directly online. Unlike a traditional painting or sculpture, the blockchain code within each NFT holds an unchangeable record of its transaction history, so its provenance is much easier to trace than other artworks.

These benefits may be why NFT sales have not completely disappeared after the post-COVID bubble. In fact, some galleries are betting on the resurgence of digital art generally. Adam Heft Beringer's Heft Gallery on the Lower East Side in New York City launched this past spring to accommodate artists whose work includes generative code, scanners, machine learning, and other “systems.” The online marketplace SuperRare introduced a brick-and-mortar gallery, Offline, whose first public exhibition opened in July. It included 15 artists whose work at least partially leverages digital tools.

In both of these cases, physical gallery space acts as a community-building mechanism, in addition to a profit-building one. Heft Gallery and Offline position themselves as creator-first ventures interested in expanding the definition of digital art to encompass much more than just NFTs. The rise of commercially available, large language models has created many more opportunities for artists to ideate and execute their visual work. As acceptance for AI-generated content in the corporate world expands, it is only natural that the same would eventually happen in the art world. Only time will tell if the market follows.

Despite a downturn in the broader NFT market, iconic collection CryptoPunks posted a 3.5% price increase on September 17, signaling resilience and sustained demand among collectors.

Launched in June 2017 by Larva Labs, CryptoPunks consists of 10,000 algorithmically generated pixel art characters on the Ethereum blockchain. The collection features 6,039 male punks, 3,840 female punks, and a handful of ultra-rare types, including 88 zombies, 24 apes, and only 9 aliens.

As of now, the floor price sits around $202,799, pushing the collection's market cap above $2 billion. Notably, 9,000 of the NFTs were initially given away for free, while Larva Labs retained 1,000 at launch.

The recent price rebound of Ethereum (ETH), which climbed past the $4,000 mark, has provided a major boost. Since most NFTs are priced and traded in ETH, its rise directly strengthens premium collections like CryptoPunks.

While the broader NFT sector saw its total market cap fall 12% from $9.3 billion to $8.1 billion, CryptoPunks bucked the trend. The collection's 3.5% daily gain underscores its blue-chip status in digital collectibles.

Institutional interest is also rising. BTCS Inc. recently added Pudgy Penguins to its balance sheet, signaling growing recognition of top-tier NFT assets, a trend that indirectly supports CryptoPunks' reputation as the market leader.

CryptoPunks' all-time high was recorded on October 18, 2021, when the floor price hit $477,924.

Recent trading has been equally strong. In the past week alone, nearly 4,200 ETH ($20 million) worth of CryptoPunks changed hands. During this period, 90 NFTs were sold at an average price of $217,331 each.

While competition intensifies,  with Pudgy Penguins overtaking Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) for the second-largest market cap,  CryptoPunks remains the undisputed leader.

Currently, ownership is concentrated among 3,853 holders (38.55% of supply), reflecting a strong base of dedicated collectors rather than mass distribution. Over the past year, the collection has surged 113.3% in value, cementing its status as a long-term digital asset.

As institutional adoption and Ethereum's recovery continue, CryptoPunks' position as the flagship NFT collection looks more secure than ever.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","UK ICO: Students Are Responsible for Most School Data Breaches, Ushering Them Into Cybercrime","https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/uk-ico-students-are-responsible-for-most-school-data-breaches-ushering-them-into-cybercrime/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Students are responsible for most school data breaches in the United Kingdom, according to a new report by the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).

The report analyzed 215 insider data breach reports from schools across the country and found that students accounted for 57% of the incidents.

Alarmingly, nearly a third (30%) of the cyber incidents stemmed from leaked, compromised, or weak credentials, of which students were responsible for 97%.

Nevertheless, the U.K. privacy regulator warned that students involved in school data breaches could be on the path to cybercrime.

As to how the students obtained these passwords, the ICO says that they either guessed them or found them written on pieces of paper. Subsequently, students were not breaking into school systems but simply logging in into poorly protected devices.

Nevertheless, the ICO warned that breaking into school computer systems was setting up teenagers for a life of cybercrime.

“That's the warning from us, as we have spotted a worrying pattern behind the culprits responsible for personal data breach reports from schools,” the ICO said.

The study follows a damning report by the U.K.'s National Crime Agency (NCA) stating that one in five minors between 10 and 16 years was engaging in illegal online activity.

“Teen hackers are commonly English-speaking males, and around 5% of 14-year-old boys and girls admit to hacking,” the privacy regulator stated.

Reasons for hacking include dares, gaining notoriety, financial gain, revenge, and teen rivalries. However, some students expressed genuine interest in IT and cyber security.

Nevertheless, some admitted to using downloaded sophisticated hacking tools to breach passwords and security protocols, and even to being members of online hacking forums. Shockingly, some children referred to the NCA were as young as seven years old.

“What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organisations or critical infrastructure,” warned Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist.

Toomey stressed the need to understand the students' interests and motivations in online activity to ensure they do not break the law and develop useful IT skills.

“It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists,” noted Toomey.

Meanwhile, the report also found that negligence played a significant role in school data breaches, including some involving students.

For example, the ICO reported that nearly a quarter (23%) of school data breaches stemmed from poor data protection practices, such as staff illegitimately accessing data, unattended devices, and students using staff computers.

Similarly, a fifth (20%) of data breaches occurred due to staff sending private data to personal devices, while 17% stemmed from poor access rights configuration.

“There are a couple of takeaways from this news,” said Pete Luban, Field CISO at AttackIQ. “The most important is that educational institutions must do a better job of protecting sensitive information. Proper cyber hygiene protocols, such as strengthening passwords and removing student access to them, would solve a large portion of the problems.”

However, 5% of school data breaches stemmed from insiders using sophisticated attacks that circumvent security and network controls.

“For the smaller portion of incidents that required more advanced technical skills, schools need to evaluate their cyber defense systems and implement proactive measures that are able to close the gaps that students were exploiting,” Luban added.

The ICO also called on schools to take adequate steps to enhance their cyber defenses and data protection measures to avoid tempting students into breaking into poorly protected computer systems.

“Additionally, students must be made aware of the consequences of carrying out these attacks,” Luban concluded.

By 99Bitcoins Editorial Team

The first-ever meme coin virtual mining game PepeNode (PEPENODE) has surged past $1.2M  in presale funding.

The milestone comes at a pivotal moment, with the market already shifting into altcoin season and a full-blown meme coin cycle likely next in line.

PepeNode gives early adopters an edge because once it launches, users will be able to mine meme coins through a virtual mining dashboard where tokens like Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and others can be earned strategically.

The project is still in the early stages of its presale, with the current round pricing tokens at $0.0010617. 

That price climbs in less than 24 hours, meaning investors waiting on the sidelines risk paying more at the next tier.

Last year, one of the breakout tokens in the meme coin space was PEPE, the meme coin inspired by Matt Furie's Pepe the Frog, which reached an all-time high of $0.00002803.

At its peak, PEPE topped $11Bn in market cap, and early traders saw gains of up to 20.9x – a mere $1,000 investment at launch prices would have grown to around $20,917. Today, PEPE still holds its ground as the third-most valuable meme coin.



Source: TradingView

Another token that defined the 2024 meme coin supercycle – and whose popularity carried well into 2025 – was FARTCOIN, conceived by the Truth Terminal, an autonomous AI chatbot developed by Andy Ayrey. Earlier this year, FARTCOIN soared to a $2Bn valuation, and even after cooling to just under a billion dollars, it remains the 12th-most valuable meme coin.

What's remarkable is that in October of last year, FARTCOIN was valued at only $40M. In less than a year, it rocketed to billions, proving how quickly meme coins can surge in both popularity and staying power.

Now, with the overall meme coin market climbing back toward $100Bn, there's every reason to believe that established players like PEPE and FARTCOIN – backed by their cult-like communities – will be at the forefront of the next supercycle, alongside breakout tokens like MemeCore (M).

But what if those tokens could also be earned as bonus rewards on top of your mining activity? 

With PepeNode, all it takes is the right strategy to combine nodes into an optimized setup that works like a meme coin money machine running on clockwork.

This is the core premise of PepeNode: turning meme coin mining both strategic and fun.

PepeNode is building a virtual mining game where users design their rigs and earn meme coins like PEPE, FARTCOIN, and more.

It plays like a strategy game; each node is a unique asset with its own properties. Combining these nodes correctly determines how much yield a player earns. 

The more refined the setup, the higher the returns plus bonus rewards denominated in the top meme coins for the most optimized rigs.

If a setup isn't performing well, users can add new nodes to boost yields or sell nodes back just like hardware to reclaim the tokens spent. Essentially, it's a system that rewards smart play and flexibility.

The best part is that while the full game is in development, early adopters don't have to wait to generate rewards. Presale buyers can stake their tokens immediately at a dynamic yield of 1,108% APY. 

It's a built-in way to keep engagement high and rewards flowing even at this early stage, which allows the project to sidestep the dead zone most presales fall into when hype fades between launch and listing.

Again, PepeNode is the first mine-to-earn meme coin concept in crypto. One of the problems it solves is the idle wait that kills momentum in most presales. 

But beyond that, it also tackles the costly barrier of setting up physical hardware to mine meme coins.

Take Dogecoin (DOGE) for example – it can only be mined with expensive rigs, leaving smaller miners unable to compete with large operations. Other meme coins bypass mining altogether, instead leaning on staking or yield farming, which, if you've tried them, are largely passive ways to earn crypto.

PepeNode changes this dynamic by making mining virtual and gamified. As a result, it removes the hardware barrier while transforming yield generation into something active and engaging.

If the concept takes off, copycats will undoubtedly follow. 

But one thing to note is that nothing beats the original – and the best shot at first-mover advantage is while PepeNode is still in presale.

The world's first Mine-to-Earn meme coin is here. 

Yep you read that right. ⛏🔥https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/3j6C8mqmjW

With cyber attacks regularly in the news, we are reminding businesses to check they have the appropriate security measures in place to protect personal information.

Businesses experienced an estimated 7.7 million cyber crimes over the past year, according to government figures. Most small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority.

Ian Hulme, Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO, said:

“Cyber attacks have been hitting the headlines again recently, serving as a timely reminder for all businesses to check their own security measures. When people share their personal information with your company, they need to feel confident you'll do as much as possible to keep that information secure.

“While cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security. As the data protection regulator, we want to support organisations to get this right and these simple steps will help to protect both your customers and your business.” 

Here are some practical steps businesses and their staff can take to improve their data security and resilience:

If an organisation experiences a data breach as a result of a cyber attack, they should report it to us within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.

For more advice on protecting personal information, visit our security guidance for organisations.

For further support on cyber security, visit the National Cyber Security Centre's website and the Cyber Essentials programme, a Government-backed certification scheme that helps keep your organisation's - and your customers' - data safe from cyber attacks.

Weak passwords and poor data protection practices are often the way in


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has warned that students are increasingly behind insider cyber attacks in UK schools and colleges.

Between January 2022 and August 2024, the ICO analyzed 215 data breach reports from the education sector involving insider threats.

It found 57% of incidents were caused by students. Nearly a third stemmed from stolen or guessed login details, with pupils responsible for 97% of these cases.

While Hollywood has portrayed teenage hackers with a degree of glamour in films such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Hackers, the reality described by the ICO is both more mundane and more damaging.

Children are not breaking into systems but rather logging in, often by exploiting weak passwords or taking advantage of poor data protection practices.

One case highlighted by the ICO showed how quickly curiosity can turn into a serious breach.

“Three Year 11 students unlawfully accessed a secondary school's information management system, which holds personal information of more than 1,400 students. When questioned, the students admitted being interested in IT and cybersecurity, and that they wanted to test their skills and knowledge. The students used tools downloaded from the internet to break passwords and security protocols, with two of the students admitting that they belong to an online hackers' forum.”

In another example from the ICO:

“A student unlawfully accessed a college's information management system, then viewed, amended or deleted personal information belonging to more than 9,000 staff, students and applicants. The system stored personal information such as name and home address, school records, health data, safeguarding and pastoral logs and emergency contacts. The college's investigation found the student used a staff login to access its systems. The college reported the incident to the police, to us and Action Fraud.”

The ICO found 23% of incidents in the education sector were caused by poor data protection practices, such as staff accessing records without a legitimate need, leaving devices unattended, or allowing pupils to use staff devices.

Another 20% involved staff sending data to personal accounts, while 17% came from poorly configured access rights.

5% involved insiders deliberately bypassing network security.

“Whilst education settings are experiencing large numbers of cyber attacks, there is still growing evidence that ‘insider threat' is poorly understood, largely unremedied and can lead to future risk of harm and criminality,” Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist, said.

“What starts out as a dare, a challenge, a bit of fun in a school setting can ultimately lead to children taking part in damaging attacks on organizations or critical infrastructure.”

The ICO is urging schools to strengthen training, reduce unnecessary access, and ensure data protection is updated regularly.

Parents are also being encouraged to talk openly with their children about online behavior, with the aim of steering curiosity into positive channels rather than criminal activity.

“It's important that we understand the next generation's interests and motivations in the online world to ensure children remain on the right side of the law and progress into rewarding careers in a sector in constant need of specialists,” Toomey concluded.

The US House of Representatives is quickly advancing a ban on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) by embedding it into a broader digital asset market structure bill. The measure would block the Federal Reserve from creating or distributing a digital dollar before any such system is formally authorized.

The proposal, known as the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and sponsored by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), already cleared the House in July. Lawmakers aim to fold it into the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the chamber's flagship market structure legislation.

The proposal emerged in a draft agenda from the House Rules Committee that seemingly would force the CBDC ban to be included in market structure legislation via an “engrossment.” That is, rather than play out in a standalone law, the ban would find its way into the final version of the market structure bill before it heads to the Senate.

This will speed passage, lawmakers say. The standalone digital dollar legislation faced challenging margins, and packaging it within a broader digital assets package could give senators more ammunition to fend off objections. The bill is designed not only to bring clarity to the respective roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission but also to establish rules about trading, custody, and issuance for digital assets. With the CBDC ban folded in, it now sits squarely at the center of the U.S. crypto regulatory debate — especially in Discord circles.

The CBDC ban is not just in the market structure bill, with lawmakers opting to push it through the once-a-year defense policy bill, which is commonly referred to as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA is one of the must-pass pieces of legislation, establishing the Pentagon's budget and defense priorities, which means it almost always gets passed by Congress.

By grafting the CBDC ban onto this vehicle, lawmakers are opting for one of the surest pathways to ram through a contentious measure. This tactic also makes it harder for critics to prevent the provision from moving forward; voting against the NDAA would be perceived as standing in the way of military funds and defense planning at a time when tensions are escalating around potential international flash points.

The provision included in the NDAA is unequivocal. It prohibits the Federal Reserve from developing, testing, or offering its own central bank digital currency. This ban is to work retroactively, blocking the startup of a potential future CBDC and any existing pilot programs or research projects. Supporters say the amendment sends a message to Congress against Fed policy in any administration.

Proponents of the ban claim a CBDC could infringe on personal freedom. They caution that a digital dollar could enable the government to track, monitor, or restrict how citizens spend their money. They see a CBDC ban as a firewall against state surveillance and financial manipulation.

Cynics, however, say that by banning a CBDC outright, the U.S. risks being left behind other major economies. China has already introduced its digital yuan, and the European Union is moving toward a digital euro.


Economists and fintech experts warn that even the lack of an option for a CBDC leaves the U.S. in danger of losing its lead as global financial markets shift to new players.

The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to merge the Anti-CBDC bill with the CLARITY Act. This decision comes after a previous attempt in July to include Anti-CBDC language in the defense spending bill. By combining the two measures, the House aims to streamline the regulatory process for digital assets, especially cryptocurrency.

The combined bill now moves to the Senate, where lawmakers are already drafting their version. This adjustment reflects ongoing efforts to regulate the crypto market and curb the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Both parties in Congress have signaled strong bipartisan support for anti-CBDC measures.

Lawmakers in the House aim to simplify crypto market reforms through the combination of the Anti-CBDC bill and the CLARITY Act. This move is designed to align both pieces of legislation in a single package, pushing forward the prohibition of a U.S. CBDC. According to Eleanor Terrett, a business journalist, the merger aims to make the regulatory process more efficient.

This is interesting. Remember when the House voted not to include the Anti-CBDC bill in CLARITY back in July in favor of putting into the defense spending bill instead? Well, now they just voted to retroactively combine it back into CLARITY before sending it over to the Senate.… https://t.co/NHMLUq8Gph

— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 16, 2025



Despite the changes, sources in the House downplayed the significance of the merger. They argued that it does not mark a major policy shift but reflects a procedural move to facilitate the bill's passage. House Financial Services Chairman French Hill's spokesperson emphasized that the combined bill reflects the chamber's commitment to advancing both priorities.

Senate lawmakers are already working on their own version of the legislation, which also includes anti-CBDC language. Senate Democrats have expressed support for the CLARITY Act framework, which further strengthens bipartisan momentum for crypto reforms. This alignment between the two chambers signals growing political backing for tighter digital asset regulations.

The merged bill, including both the CLARITY Act and anti-CBDC provisions, now heads to the Senate. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott and Senator Cynthia Lummis are expected to work closely with House lawmakers on advancing the bill. Both sides are focused on ensuring that the final version of the bill can be signed into law.

The CLARITY Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for the digital asset industry, which has been facing regulatory uncertainty. By adding anti-CBDC measures to the bill, lawmakers are signaling their opposition to a U.S. government-controlled digital currency. This move reflects a broad consensus in Washington on the potential risks of CBDCs.

As the combined bill moves to the Senate, the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. depends on the outcome. Both the House and Senate are working toward a unified approach to digital asset oversight, though final passage is still uncertain. The outcome will likely shape the future of U.S. crypto regulation.

House Republicans have moved to combine a measure banning the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the CLARITY Act, a sweeping bipartisan bill that sets out new rules for cryptocurrency markets.

The House voted yesterday, September 26, on a procedural measure that links the two bills, both of which cleared the chamber in July.

For context, the House voted 215-211 on July 16 to advance the GENIUS stablecoin bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Act after President Trump secured GOP support in a late-night Oval Office meeting. 

📜 Trump has urged the House to pass the GENIUS bill without delay or amendments, calling for it to be sent to his desk immediately after approval.#GENIUS #Stablecoins https://t.co/Oat2MMoJyq

The Anti-CBDC Act, which delivers a direct signal barring the Federal Reserve from creating a retail central bank digital currency, was first introduced by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer.

The bill, however, passed largely along party lines, reflecting Republican concerns that a digital dollar could expand government surveillance of financial transactions. 

By contrast, the CLARITY Act, which aims to settle disputes between the SEC and CFTC by clearly defining how digital assets should be classified, whether as securities, commodities, or stablecoins, won broader bipartisan support. 78 Democrats joined Republicans to back the measure.

Meanwhile, committee leaders initially resisted efforts to merge the bills, fearing that doing so would weaken Democratic support for the market structure reforms.

However, pressure from GOP hardliners ultimately pushed leadership to find a way to advance both priorities together. For context, party leaders had earlier tried to include the CBDC ban in the annual National Defense Authorization Act, but that effort faltered as Democrats opposed the measure.

With bipartisan support needed to pass the defense bill in the Senate, the provision is expected to be stripped out during negotiations.

“Passing both the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC bill were key priorities for members of the House,” said Brooke Nethercott, spokesperson for House Financial Services Chair French Hill. 

“By combining both measures and sending them to the Senate, the House continues to advance both priorities.”

Despite the House move, the combined bill faces long odds in the Senate. Lawmakers in the upper chamber are preparing to advance their own legislation spearheaded by Sens. Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. That proposal aims to establish clear regulatory oversight for digital assets but does not include a CBDC ban.

🔍 Senate GOP has laid out crypto market structure principles, clarifying regulation and oversight for digital assets.#CryptoRegulation #USSenatehttps://t.co/4hKf2Ktbim

While the House action points to Republican determination to block a digital dollar, its practical effect remains uncertain. With the Senate charting its own path, the combined House package may serve more as a political statement than a legislative breakthrough.

Thus, the debate over how to regulate cryptocurrency and whether to allow a U.S. central bank digital currency is expected to continue into the next session of Congress.

Specifically, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) cast doubt on Senate Banking's readiness to advance crypto legislation, warning it gives the industry too much sway. His stance clashes with Chairman Tim Scott's push for a September markup after the House passed the CLARITY Act, exposing GOP divisions that threaten Scott's deadline.

🏛️ Polymarket bettors are giving the CLARITY Act just a 35% chance of passing by the end of this year, a new poll shows.#Polymarket #CLARITYActhttps://t.co/BzTinI68a8

In a bid to see quick action on the acts, three major crypto lobbying groups, the Blockchain Association, The Digital Chamber, and the Crypto Council for Innovation, earlier urged Congress to pass the bipartisan CLARITY Act.

Despite this, only 35% of Polymarket bettors expect the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act to become law by 2025, down from 87% in July.

The Anti-CBDC bill has been retroactively combined with the crypto market structure legislation known as the CLARITY Act in a new procedural measure passed by the House of Representatives. This move merges the previously separated bills and sets the stage for their next step: Senate review. Although this action may be largely symbolic, it serves as an ongoing effort by the House to advance the Anti-CBDC bill alongside broader crypto regulations.

The Anti-CBDC bill and the CLARITY Act were passed separately in the House in July 2025. The Anti-CBDC bill, introduced by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), is intended to prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. This bill passed largely along party lines, with most Republican members supporting it. On the other hand, the bipartisan CLARITY Act, designed to overhaul cryptocurrency market regulation, gained support from both parties, including 78 Democrats.

This is interesting. Remember when the House voted not to include the Anti-CBDC bill in CLARITY back in July in favor of putting into the defense spending bill instead? Well, now they just voted to retroactively combine it back into CLARITY before sending it over to the Senate.… https://t.co/NHMLUq8Gph

— Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) September 16, 2025



Republicans within the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees initially opposed combining the two bills on the House floor. Their concerns stemmed from fears that merging the two bills could jeopardize bipartisan support for the CLARITY Act. Despite these objections, a faction of GOP hard-liners pushed for combining the Anti-CBDC bill with the CLARITY Act to advance both measures.

In the latest procedural vote, the House voted to combine the Anti-CBDC bill with the CLARITY Act retroactively. A spokesperson for House Financial Services Chairman French Hill stated that this combination was a significant move in advancing the goals of both bills. “By combining both measures and sending them to the Senate, the House continues to advance both priorities,” said Brooke Nethercott, Hill's spokesperson.

While this action is intended to send a strong message to the Senate, it may not change much in terms of legislative impact. The Senate is already working on its version of the cryptocurrency market structure legislation, which includes anti-CBDC provisions, rendering the House's combined vote somewhat symbolic. The Senate's bill, called the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, will likely be debated separately and will require broad support to pass.

The House's decision to combine the Anti-CBDC bill with the CLARITY Act may not have a major impact on the Senate's progress. The Senate's version of the crypto market structure bill, the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, is expected to move forward on its own track, with the necessary support from both Republicans and Democrats.

While the Anti-CBDC bill is part of the House's effort to advance crypto regulations, the Senate is expected to continue crafting its own legislation. This includes provisions that align with the anti-CBDC bill's goals, but the Senate will likely take its own approach to the matter.

The combined Anti-CBDC bill and CLARITY Act will be sent to the Senate, where its fate will be determined. Given the Senate's own plans for crypto regulation, it remains unclear how the House's retroactive combination will influence the final outcome.

With both chambers of Congress working on separate but related legislation, the ultimate resolution on the Anti-CBDC bill may take time to unfold. As the debate continues, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will be closely watching the Senate's response to the Anti-CBDC bill and its implications for the future of digital currencies in the U.S.

The move comes amid debate about whether mainland China should follow Hong Kong's footsteps and embrace stablecoins

Shanghai, mainland China's financial centre, has become one of the first cities in the country to use an overseas cryptocurrency trading platform to reprice and sell more than 90,000 filecoins – a blockchain-based storage token – that were seized in criminal cases.

A district-level court partnered with a third-party institution in mainland China, which sold the cryptocurrency on a licensed platform in Hong Kong, according to an announcement by Shanghai's Supreme People's Court on Tuesday.

The proceeds from the sale were transferred to a court-controlled bank account and will be allocated to the national treasury or refunded to the victims, in line with legal procedures.

But there have been discussions among market players and academics about whether mainland China should emulate Hong Kong – which introduced its first stablecoin ordinance on August 1 – to promote the offshore adoption of the yuan.

Handling crypto assets in cases involving Chinese citizens and companies also presents new challenges for the judiciary.

US President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025. The act has much in common with EU crypto regulation, but also goes further in some respects. Image: Whitehouse.gov

The passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025 – a landmark bipartisan US stablecoin law providing long-needed regulatory clarity for crypto markets – has ignited fresh debate in the EU about the risks such developments may pose to the bloc. 

Policy-makers are voicing concerns over monetary and payment system sovereignty, as well as raising questions as to whether the EU's far-reaching 2023 Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is fit for purpose to avoid global regulatory arbitrage. 

Like all frameworks in emerging tech domains, MiCA must achieve product–market fit with private sector actors, while also finding harmony with other global regimes – none more important than the transatlantic relationship between the EU and the US.

There is more harmonization between MiCA and the newly-passed GENIUS Act than first meets the eye. This should assure EU regulatory and prudential authorities, including the European Central Bank, that the US Congress did not take a very different approach in bringing payment stablecoins into the regulatory perimeter.

For example, US-regulated stablecoins are now treated as peers to electronic money, bearing the designation “payment stablecoins” under GENIUS. This mirrors the EU's e-money token regime. 

On both sides of the Atlantic, regulated stablecoin issuers must also hold reserves in a conservative, one-for-one ratio against all stablecoins in circulation. Deposits are held in a bankruptcy-protected structure on issuers' balance sheets. This prevents payment stablecoins and e-money tokens from straying into securities or capital markets territory, which would necessitate a separate set of rules to regulate broader crypto markets and market conduct. 

Both GENIUS and MiCA entitle crypto holders to the right of redemption at par – a safeguard long absent from the stablecoin sector. Each framework also imposes obligations on crypto exchanges and the broader value chain through which stablecoins reach end users. 

In Europe, for example, exchanges faced a stablecoin “fiscal cliff” deadline requiring the de-listing of non-compliant tokens by 30 December 2024. In the US, GENIUS introduces criminal penalties for falsely advertising non-compliant products. It also compels exchanges to sharply restrict market access to issuers that fail to comply. 

As with MiCA, compliance under GENIUS requires would-be stablecoin issuers to establish a locally regulated entity subject to the full spectrum of rules. This ranges from trust, transparency, disclosure and accountability standards, to strict adherence with anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing and sanctions obligations.

In key respects, the GENIUS Act is even more conservative than MiCA. 

It eschews bank-related risks by prohibiting issuers from holding longer maturity bonds in their reserves. It also doesn't require either 30 or 60% of reserves to be held in banks, which could introduce credit risks from banking into stablecoin activities. 

Moreover, under GENIUS, banks are required to issue payment stablecoins from a separate entity and balance sheet that's set apart from its core banking business. This ensures these funds remain insulated from the leverage, maturity transformation and lending activities of the bank's core operations. This same requirement does not exist under MiCA.

And when it comes to oversight, in the EU, e-money token issuers can be licensed and supervised by national competent authorities, but once they surpass certain thresholds of size, circulation or reach, they must “graduate” to pan-European co-supervision by the European Banking Authority. 

The GENIUS Act embraces a similar model. It permits state-based licensing and supervision of stablecoin issuers, but once circulation exceeds $10 billion – a provision that mirrors the US dual banking system – issuers must also “graduate” to direct federal oversight by either the Federal Reserve, the OCC or the NCUA, the national credit union regulator. In all cases, payment stablecoin issuers are held to a common set of rules.

However, GENIUS goes one step further than MiCA in this area by empowering and encouraging the US Department of the Treasury to pursue regulatory passporting and harmonization with comparable jurisdictions. This opens the door for US-regulated issuers to expand internationally with the backing of a home-court regulator, while international issuers from credible jurisdictions with substantially similar regimes – like the EU – may gain continued access to US markets without having to establish separate US entities.

The original concerns that gave rise to MiCA, GENIUS, and the broader central bank digital currency (CBDC) space race were fears of big tech taking over money. But both EU and US regimes are unequivocal: Public authorities on both sides of the Atlantic will not permit another big tech vanity coin such as the ill-fated Libra project, which animated concerted global efforts at crypto rulemaking.

Despite the allure for commercial giants to enter banking and payments, EU and US competition laws impose guardrails, while the US has also maintained a long-standing regulatory separation of banking and commerce. The GENIUS Act goes further by creating a special committee, chaired by the Treasury Secretary and other banking principals, with authority to approve or block any big tech or commercial payment stablecoin structure.

Beyond regulation, the market itself has shown little appetite for branded, closed-loop stablecoins linked to incumbents. They typically resemble little more than monetary airline miles – usable only within closed networks – rather than true, open, universally portable mediums of exchange. In this, both MiCA and GENIUS reinforce not only consumer protection, but the sovereignty of state-backed money itself.

The real competition is not between jurisdictions or regulators, but for trusted, open money that can power the next chapter of the digital economy. This outcome demands transatlantic leadership and harmonization, not rivalry.

On August 18, 2025, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker signed Senate
Bill 1797, enacting, in his words, ""first-of-their-kind
safeguards in the Midwest for cryptocurrency and other digital
assets.""1 This Illinois law is the Digital Assets
and Consumer Protection Act (DACPA or the Act), which establishes
an Illinois-state-level regulatory framework for centralized crypto
exchanges that have customers and certain other digital asset
businesses operating in Illinois. DACPA will be administered and
enforced by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional
Regulation (IDFPR).

Highlights of this bill include:

The fact sheet touts that more states are enacting digital asset
regulation, including New York and California.3
Objectively, the enactment of DACPA appears to be politically
motivated, based on statements by Governor Pritzker and other
Illinois politicians in the accompanying press release, such as
this: ""While the Trump Administration is letting crypto bros
write federal policy, Illinois is implementing common-sense
protections for investors and consumers,"" and this: ""At a
time when fraudsters continue to evolve and consumer protections
are being eroded at the federal level, Illinois is sending a clear
message that we won't tolerate taking advantage of our people
and their hard-earned assets.""4

Does Illinois have the resources to enforce DACPA, or even to
process applications to register under the Act? Illinois's
strained resources seem to indicate otherwise.

Regarding the IDFPR, there is no indication that the current
staff has the resources, capabilities, or digital asset industry
domain expertise to administer or enforce DACPA effectively. In
terms of its current limited resources, a review of the enforcement
actions for the Banking Division Orders and Enforcement Actions for
Banks, Trust Companies and Savings Institutions Enforcement Actions
reveals that IDFPR has only brought the following number of actions
in this area in the past five years: 2020, four actions; 2021,
three; 2022, two; 2023, one; and 2024, four.5 Thus far
in 2025, IDFPR has instituted two enforcement actions. Of the 16
actions instituted since 2020, not one of them appears to involve
digital assets.6

Turning to the highlights of DACPA, notably in Section 1-10
regarding applicability, Section 1-10(a) provides that the Act
governs digital asset business activity of a person or entity doing
business in Illinois ""to the extent not preempted by federal
law."" Section 1-10(b)(1)(A) continues to provide that DACPA
does not apply to the extent that the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 governs the activity as a securities transaction and the
activity is regulated by the SEC or the Illinois Secretary of
State. Also, Section 1-10(b)(1)(B) provides that DACPA does not
apply to the extent that the Commodity Exchange Act governs the
activity, and the activity is regulated by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC). Thus, from the start, the applicability
of DACPA is limited by federal preemption, regulation by the SEC,
and regulation by the CFTC. Although Governor Pritzker hasn't
mentioned this, what remains of DACPA might well be preempted by
the so-called ""CLARITY Act"" or by other federal digital
assets legislation pending in Congress.

For the digital assets entities to which DACPA applies, the
scope of the Act is quite broad. Section 1-15 provides
""general powers and duties"" that include the following:
the issuance, revocation, or suspension of registration; to
receive, consider, investigate, and act upon complaints made by any
person related to any digital asset business activity in Illinois;
to subpoena documents and witnesses and compel their production and
attendance; to issue orders; to examine the books and records of
every covered person, entity, affiliate or service provider; to
enforce the provisions of the Act and any state or federal law
applicable to digital asset business activity; to levy fees, fines,
and civil penalties; to conduct hearings; and more.

How will an Illinois state agency with limited and strained
resources attempt to cover the needed resources for implementing
and enforcing DACPA? It appears it will do so by obligating
industry funding. In Section 1-20, DACPA addresses the expenses of
administering this Act. Specifically, it mandates that the expenses
of the Act, including those for investigations and examinations,
will be borne by and assessed against those regulated by DACPA.
Section 1-20 lists the ways that IDFPR may establish fees by rule,
which include registration, examination, and investigation fees. It
is understood that these fees are being imposed to generate revenue
for use in hiring government staff to administer and police
DACPA.

DACPA states requirements for customer protection in Article 5.
These protections include customer disclosures (Section 5-5);
custody and protection of customer assets (Section 5-10);
requirements for covered exchanges (Section 5-15); and additional
requirements. Article 10 then states compliance requirements. These
include policies and procedures (Section 10-10) that cover the
following: a cybersecurity program; a business continuity program;
a disaster recovery program; an anti-fraud program; an anti-money
laundering program; a conflict-of-interest program; and more.
Article 15 provides the requirements for registration under DACPA.
Article 20, addressing supervision, provides for surety bond and
capital and liquidity requirements. Section 20-5 requires a surety
bond or trust account in U.S. dollars in a form and amount
determined by IDFPR and the maintenance at all times of capital and
liquidity in an amount and form that IDPFR determines is sufficient
to ensure the financial integrity of the registrant.

In conclusion, the requirements of DACPA are quite broad and
demanding. Persons conducting digital asset business activity in
Illinois or, wherever located, who engage in or hold themselves out
as engaging in that activity for or with an Illinois resident, must
register with the IDFPR by July 1, 2027, unless exempt. The IDFPR
may, by rule or order, create exemptions to the Act. Applications
for exemption can and should be made by competent legal
counsel.

DACPA regulation already exempts peer-to-peer exchanges or
transfers of digital assets, decentralized exchanges (such as
Uniswap), software development, the issuance of non-fungible
tokens, mining, and validation. Proprietary trading for one's
own account is not considered ""exchange"" and is therefore
outside the scope of the Act. Again, DACPA and other similar state
laws might be preempted by the adoption of the CLARITY Act or other
federal legislation. Until that happens, we stand ready to
interpret the Act, to process registrations under the Act, to seek
exemptions from the Act where appropriate, and to defend businesses
investigated for, or charged with, violating the Act.

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - September 17, 2025) - 01 Quantum Inc. (TSXV: ONE) (OTCQB: OONEF), formerly 01 Communique Laboratory Inc., one of the first-to-market, enterprise level cybersecurity providers for the quantum computing era and qLABS, www.qlabs.tech, a crypto foundation focused on quantum resilience, are pleased to announce the Quantum Crypto Wrapper (QCW) technology designed to address the potential cybersecurity threat from quantum computers to the $3.8 trillion crypto industry. This innovation builds on a combination of ZKP and IronCAP™, 01 Quantum's NIST approved post-quantum cryptography. ZKP is a cryptographic method that allows one party (the prover) to demonstrate to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the fact that the statement is indeed true. This is important for crypto as it allows multiple complicated verifications combined into a single fast and compact verification. This dual-layer approach allows for secure validation of quantum-resistant transactions on existing blockchains, without requiring a new Layer 1 chain or a dedicated validator network.  

According to CoinMarketCap the global crypto market is now valued at $3.8 trillion (including stablecoins) and with quantum-resistant timelines for financial infrastructure being accelerated at regulators, ensures the long-term security of digital assets is becoming an even more critical concern. This is significant as the GENIUS Act passed in July 2025 in the U.S. requires stablecoins to be backed 1-for-1 with cash or short-term debt making stablecoins a major source for U.S. Treasuries.  Although the market has reached significant maturity, it remains exposed to quantum threats due to reliance on classical cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA. 01 Quantum and qLABS are addressing this vulnerability by delivering QCW that integrates seamlessly with existing blockchain infrastructure, improving security without sacrificing interoperability or performance. 

For Technical details refer to the QCW white paper https://qlabs.gitbook.io/quantum-crypto-wrapper-by-01-quantum-inc./.

Technical Highlights 

""Combining years of experience in post-quantum cybersecurity, collaboration with NIST, and commercial software engineering, we are excited providing to qLABS our QCW technology for the crypto industry including stablecoins.  Combining ZKP with enterprise-grade post-quantum cryptography for blockchain security is very novel and secure,"" said Andrew Cheung, CEO of 01 Quantum. ""Our mission is to give the crypto industry the confidence that digital assets can remain secure not just today, but in the quantum era ahead. It is important to understand that encrypted data being harvested today can be stored with the intent to decrypt it once quantum capabilities mature. Without proactive defenses, today's assets could be compromised tomorrow.""

qLABS: Path to Adoption

qLABS, launched in September 2025 under the leadership of Antanas Guoga (Tony G), will spearhead the rollout of this technology across the crypto ecosystem. Its roadmap includes:

""qLABS is not waiting for quantum attacks to arrive, we are preparing the crypto industry now,"" said Tony G, President of qLABS. ""By integrating 01 Quantum's technology into real blockchain infrastructure, we are providing the additional layer of security we feel is necessary to protect the crypto industry from the quantum threat.""

The arrival of Q-Day, the moment quantum computers can break widely used encryption, poses a looming threat to digital security. In anticipation of this, and the growing risk of ""harvest now, decrypt later"" attacks where encrypted data is stockpiled for future quantum decryption, global technology leaders are already adopting post-quantum cryptographic methods. Yet crypto remains largely exposed, with most public blockchains vulnerable to quantum-based key extraction techniques.

As U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in the U.K. for a state visit on Tuesday, Sep. 16, the government announced a “Tech Prosperity Deal” between the two nations.

Both countries will collaborate on research and share resources in three key areas: AI, quantum, and nuclear.

On the AI front, the deal will “drive AI-powered healthcare solutions” by forging transatlantic research partnerships and bring together AI models developed by NASA and the UK Space Agency.

The two countries also plan to establish a taskforce of top researchers to “discover and accelerate breakthroughs in quantum technologies.”

Finally, a nuclear agreement  is intended to make it “quicker for companies to build new nuclear power stations in both countries.”

Despite calls for any transatlantic technology pact to incorporate crypto innovations like stablecoins and tokenization, there was no mention of distributed ledger technology in Tuesday's announcement.

In a letter to Secretary of State Peter Kyle the previous week, stakeholders in the U.K. crypto sector lobbied the government to include DLT as a “core strand” of the deal.

“This partnership offers a unique opportunity for our two nations to set global standards for digital finance, strengthen transatlantic markets, foster interoperability and ensure our firms lead the next wave of innovation,” it stated.

Signatories included The City of London Corporation, The Payments Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, and UK Crypto Business Council.

The omission of crypto in the Tech Prosperity Deal reflects mounting criticism in the U.K. of the government's approach to the sector.

In August, former Chancellor George Osborne warned that the country risked “being completely left behind” by other countries that have forged ahead with dedicated legislation for the sector.

In its defence, the Labour government has signalled its intent to integrate crypto into the U.K.'s financial system with new regulation.

Draft legislation  published earlier this year would establish a clear framework for digital assets and stablecoins. Ultimately, however, success will rest on how the proposed changes are implemented.

One key question is where the U.K.'s crypto regulation will sit within emerging international frameworks.

If the U.K. and the U.S. aligned on key issues, they could set global standards for an important regulatory frontier

However, “without coordinated action,” the letter to the government warned, “U.K. firms could face fragmented regulatory environments, reduced access to deep transatlantic markets, and increasing competitive pressures.”

While the government's initial announcement did not mention crypto, industry representatives cited by  the Financial Times still expect a deal after a “last-minute” push from the crypto sector.

According to the Times, Chancellor Rachel Reeves discussed closer coordination on digital asset regulation with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday.

If it materializes, a transatlantic crypto deal could be announced after Prime Minister Kier Starmer meets with President Trump on Thursday.

Layer-1 network Mavryk said it raised $10 million in a strategic investment led by financial derivatives provider MultiBank Group to expand its real-world asset (RWA) tokenization plans.

Mavryk Network and MultiBank have an existing partnership to tokenize over $10 billion worth of real estate in the United Arab Emirates through the latter's RWA platform. 

The two companies aim to broaden access to premium investments, such as real estate, according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday. 

The initiative is also supported by major digital asset custody provider Fireblocks, which provides the multiparty computation wallets that safeguard the tokenized assets on Mavryk's network. This allows investors to trade and borrow against their real estate-backed tokens without having to manage their own private keys.

The funding round follows the $5.2 million raised by its developers, Mavryk Dynamics, in February.

RWAs tokenization refers to representing ownership of real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, as digital tokens that can be bought and sold on blockchains. 

Amongst others motivations, one of the proposed advantages of tokenization is generating greater liquidity through expanding access to a larger pool of investors. The idea is that a generally illiquid asset class, such as real estate, could benefit significantly from tokenization.

Deloitte has forecast that the global tokenized real estate market could be worth $4 trillion in 10 year's time.

President Donald Trump's top adviser on crypto, David Sacks, is working under a ""special government employee"" status that's meant to be for officials serviing an important but temporary duty with the federal government, and Senator Elizabeth Warren penned a letter with other Democrats in Congress asking him whether he's overstepped that window. 

Such an employee isn't allowed to serve more than 130 days in a year, according to the law, and the Wednesday letter to Sacks asks him to put a number on the days the prominent venture capitalist has worked for Trump in the role as crypto and artificial intelligence czar. Under the rules, any day in which he's done work counts against that 130, though in some agencies, the limit has commonly been governed by a ""good faith"" estimate of how long the official expects to serve.



""If you have worked every business day, your 130th day was July 25, 2025,"" according to the letter signed by Warren and several other members of the Senate and House of Representatives, including Bernie Sanders. The lawmakers called their review of this timeline since the January 20 start of the administration an ""investigation.""



""If you have indeed passed the 130th day mark, you are undermining the careful balance Congress struck in creating the SGE designation. It is only because of your designation as an SGE that you have been able to continue working for and being paid by Craft Ventures during your time in government,"" read the letter.



Trump has used the temporary employment status in a high-profile fashion, also employing Tesla CEO Elon Musk in that capacity. The personnel tool is designed to be used to bring expertise into government without having to clear some of the bureaucratic hoops of typical hiring. Earlier this year, other Democrats in Congress pushed a bill that sought to inhibit such employees from using the role to seek financial gain, and Warren also pursued legislation to limit SGEs.



There have been more than 170 business days since Trump took office. Since then, Sacks has been running the president's aggressive pro-crypto agenda, which has so far celebrated one major new law to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers — leading to a White House signing ceremony that Sacks attended.



He's also acted as the boss of the administration's day-to-day crypto adviser, which had originally been Bo Hines until he left to work for Tether as its top U.S. executive. Patrick Witt replaced Hines as executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, and he told CoinDesk he's still working closely with Sacks.

By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise)

Global markets are treading water as investors wait on the Federal Reserve's latest policy move, coming later today. It's almost a given the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points. Traders will instead focus on Chair Jerome Powell for signs on future policy.

The cryptocurrency market is no different. Over the last 24 hours, the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index is practically unchanged, up just 0.2%, while bitcoin BTC$115,794.21 is around 1% higher. Gold, which surged to a record $3,700 this week, slipped 0.5%. The U.S. dollar index added less than 0.2%.

Equities markets have barely moved as well. U.S. stocks slipped in yesterday's session, while European equities are edging higher. The FTSE All-World Index advanced less than 0.1% today.

That's today. But over a longer period, cryptocurrencies have lagged behind equities.

In the last 30 days, the FTSE All-World Index rose 2.78%, while the CoinDesk 20 added 2.6% and BTC gained 1.6%. The moves suggest caution even ahead of rate cut that would boost the appeal of risk assets.

Investors are currently pricing in six interest rate cuts. Three this year, and three next year. 

“Market expectations are positioned in a Goldilocks range: six cuts represent a middle ground between caution and aggression,” analysts at QCP Capital wrote in a note.

“A deviation in the dot plot, however, would challenge that balance, forcing investors to recalibrate around the risk of tighter-than-expected conditions or a Fed struggling to respond effectively to weaker growth,” the analysts added.

Markets' real test will be Powell's press conference. A balanced message is likely to further support risk assets, while hesitation would force investors to reassess.

Despite the uncertainty, demand for spot crypto ETFs has remained robust. This week, net inflows for spot BTC ETFs are around $550 million, while spot ether ETFs brought in nearly $300 million. Stay alert!

Curve Finance founder Michael Egorov unveiled a proposal on the Curve DAO governance forum that would give the decentralized exchange's token holders a more direct way to earn income.

The protocol, called Yield Basis, aims to distribute sustainable returns to CRV holders who stake tokens to participate in governance votes, receiving veCRV tokens in exchange. The plan moves beyond the occasional airdrops that have defined the platform's token economy to date. 

Under the proposal, $60 million of Curve's crvUSD stablecoin will be minted before Yield Basis starts up. Funds from selling the tokens will support three bitcoin-focused pools; WBTC, cbBTC and tBTC, each capped at $10 million. 

Yield Basis will return between 35% and 65% of its value to veCRV holders, while reserving 25% of Yield Basis tokens for the Curve ecosystem. Voting on the proposal runs from Sept. 17 to Sept. 24.

The protocol is designed to attract institutional and professional traders by offering transparent, sustainable bitcoin yields while avoiding the impermanent loss issues common in automated market makers.

Impermanent loss occurs when the value of assets locked in a liquidity pool changes compared with holding the assets directly, leaving liquidity providers with fewer gains (or greater losses) once they withdraw.

The new protocol comes against a backdrop of financial turbulence for Egorov himself. The Curve founder has suffered several high-profile liquidations in 2024 tied to leveraged CRV purchases.

In June, more than $140 million worth of CRV positions were liquidated after Egorov borrowed heavily against the token to support its price. That episode left Curve with $10 million in bad debt.

Most recently, in December, Egorov was liquidated for 918,830 CRV (about $882,000) after the token dropped 12% in a single day. He later said on X that the position was linked to funds from the uWu hack and represented repayment of a promise by uWu's founder.

CRV rose around 1% in the past 24 hours.

 The largest crypto media outlet in the world is changing its focus, with a view to celebrating the people, projects and philosophies that are changing our collective future. 

At Cointelegraph, we've spent the last 13 years documenting the incredible rise of blockchain, crypto and Web3.

From the days when crypto was discussed in obscure forums to today's global headlines and multibillion dollar innovations, we've reported on the industry without bias or favor.

But as our industry matures, so must the way we cover it.

Today, we're introducing a clear editorial stance designed to celebrate our industry and the values we share with those who participate in it: Skeptical Advocacy.

We believe in the transformative potential of this technology. When used responsibly, blockchain and crypto can empower individuals, reshape economies and drive transparency and innovation across countless industries.

We believe our industry can be a force for good — if guided by prudence, ethics and clarity of purpose.

At the same time, we recognize a hard truth: Technology is neutral, but people are not. 

Crypto has attracted visionaries and opportunists alike. For every breakthrough, there's a bad actor; for every genuine use case, a headline-grabbing scam. That's why we will continue to approach the space with journalistic skepticism, carefully scrutinizing those who build, promote and profit from this technology.

But we are also tired of seeing our industry painted in broad, dismissive strokes by mainstream media and powerful incumbents. Crypto has proved too big to ignore, but too disruptive for comfort.

Digital assets are logical, inevitable and useful. Yet, otherwise-serious media outlets often present them as inherently scandalous and undesirable.

What our industry lacks is a strong and competent media ally. A publication willing to advocate for its promise, to defend its legitimacy and to challenge the narrative when it veers toward pessimism, sensationalism or misinformation.

As of today, that's our role. As the largest crypto-native media platform in the world, we're here to support our industry.

Not blindly, but boldly. Not recklessly, but realistically.

And it begins with celebrating and sharing our cornerstone values:

Pragmatic decentralization

Pragmatic privacy 

Personal sovereignty

Digital ownership rights

When we find people who share these values, we will highlight their innovations. We will offer opportunities and support to the creators, builders and leaders who employ blockchain and Web3 tech for good. We will illustrate how people across the globe are benefiting from countless projects that are building a better future.

Yet we will not shy away from critiquing those who promote schemes that appear to serve a personal interest instead of the wider good. We will document the conflicts of interest; the tokenomics that extract value from retail investors; the charlatans and the grifters.

We will use our unrivaled experience and expertise in this field to fiercely seek out and expose wrongdoing.

And we will fight for a future in which crypto's best values can thrive.

It's skepticism, but with support. Advocacy, but with accountability.

Thank you for being with us on this journey.

 Japan's Metaplanet launched subsidiaries in Miami and Tokyo to grow Bitcoin income and expand domestic crypto media operations. 

Metaplanet, the Japanese hospitality and real estate group turned Bitcoin treasury company, is ramping up its crypto strategy with the launch of two new subsidiaries, one in the US and one in Japan.

In a Wednesday post on X, the Tokyo-based firm announced the establishment of Metaplanet Income Corp., a wholly owned US subsidiary based in Miami with an initial capital of $15 million, according to its disclosure.

The unit will focus on Bitcoin (BTC) income generation and derivatives trading, creating a structural separation between Metaplanet's core BTC holdings and revenue-generating operations. 

The subsidiary will be managed in part by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, alongside Dylan LeClair and Darren Winia. The company also said that the move is expected to have minimal impact on its consolidated financial results for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31.

Back home, Metaplanet also unveiled Bitcoin Japan Inc. to strengthen its domestic Bitcoin-related operations. The entity, based in Tokyo's Roppongi Hills, will oversee media, events and the management of Bitcoin.jp, a recently acquired domain.

The new Tokyo entity will also manage Bitcoin Magazine Japan and the Bitcoin Japan Conference, expanding Metaplanet's reach in domestic crypto media and community engagement. Directors Gerovich and Yoshihisa Ikurumi will lead the initiative.

The twin announcements come as part of the company's Bitcoin income business, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2024. The news also came shortly after the company revealed plans to raise 204.1 billion yen ($1.4 billion) through an international share offering to expand its BTC holdings.

With over 20,136 BTC now on its balance sheet, Metaplanet ranks as the sixth-largest Bitcoin treasury holder globally, trailing only giants like MicroStrategy, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.

The top three public Bitcoin treasury holders are all US-based companies, led by Strategy, which holds a massive 638,985 BTC worth over $74 billion. It's followed by Mara Holdings with 52,477 BTC valued at around $6.1 billion, and XXI in third place, holding 43,514 BTC worth $5.07 billion.

 Bitcoin rose above $117,000 as investors braced for Jerome Powell's post-FOMC speech that could see volatile swings toward key BTC price levels. 

Key takeaways:

Fed interest-rate cut odds for today are now 100%.

BTC price may rise to all-time highs if key resistance level at $118,000 is broken.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a four-week high above $117,000 on Wednesday, as traders expect price swings before and after the US policy decision on interest rate cuts. 

There is a 96% chance of a 25 bps cut at the Wednesday FOMC meeting, with a 4% probability of the rates being reduced by 50 bps, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Polymarket bettors have also locked in a 25 bps decrease at 93% for the FOMC meeting, with odds for a 50 bps reduction at 5%. 

Related: Bitcoin stuck at $116K resistance until ‘decisively reclaimed,' says Bitfinex

Odds from both the CME FedWatch and Polymarket are building for a three-cut path toward the end of the year.

Still, some market commentators say that any volatile price action from interest rate cuts is already priced in.

Traders have now turned their focus to the Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech after the FOMC meeting. Powell, who has been under pressure from President Donald Trump to lower interest rates, previously hinted at interest cuts, saying the prevailing inflation and the labor market situation warranted adjustments.  

Therefore, the market will keenly watch Powell's language at the FOMC news conference to see if there is any shift in tone.

“Markets are locked on the FOMC Wednesday, with a 25 bps cut priced in,” said private wealth manager Swissblock in a Tuesday post on X, adding that traders will be focusing on “Powell's stance under the spotlight for hints.”

Swissblock managers also pointed out that either way, volatility is guaranteed, adding:

Bitcoin analyst AlphaBTC said that BTC price could first rise to $118,000 on Wednesday before retracing after the FOMC decision is confirmed.

Bitcoin must flip resistance at $118,000 into support to continue its uptrend toward all-time highs and eventually into price discovery. 

“Bitcoin keeps slowly grinding higher, now pushing into the 116.5K-118K resistance area,” said crypto analyst Jelle in an X post on Wednesday, adding:

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC price “attacking” the resistance between $117,500 and $118,500, which is a great sign, according to MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe.

#Bitcoin attacking the range resistance pre-FOMC could be a great sign.Quite usually it's just a run before a drop.We'll see.It's going to be fun! pic.twitter.com/27GySz5j7g

Van de Poppe's analysis suggested that if resistance around $118,000 is taken out, it could trigger a run-up move toward the $120,000 and later to the all-time highs at $124,500.

On the downside, a key area of interest lies between $116,800 and $114,500, a range the price has held between Sept. 10 and Tuesday.

Below that, the next move would be a retest of the $112,000 psychological level, which is also the 100-day simple moving average.

 Donald Trump's latest Fed pick cited a “third mandate” for the bank to moderate long-term rates, potentially justifying yield curve control policies, which could boost Bitcoin. 

A “third mandate” from the US Federal Reserve could change long-term monetary policy if actioned, which could be bad news for the dollar but good news for crypto.

The Fed has long been considered to have a dual mandate —  price stability and maximum employment — but President Donald Trump's pick for Fed governor, Stephen Miran, cited a “third mandate” earlier this month, sparking speculation on the future of central bank monetary policy. 

The third mandate is a statutory requirement buried in the Fed's founding documents, which states that the central bank actually requires three objectives: maximum employment, price stability and moderate long-term interest rates.

The Trump administration appears ready to use this forgotten statutory requirement as justification for more aggressive intervention in bond markets, potentially through yield curve control or expanded quantitative easing and money printing, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.

This third goal has been largely ignored for decades, with most considering it a natural byproduct of achieving the first two, but Trump officials are now citing it as legal cover for potential yield curve control policies, where the Fed buys government bonds to target a desired interest rate.

Trump has long advocated for lower rates, calling Fed governor Jerome Powell “too slow” or “too late” in reducing them. 

Related: Crypto markets prepare for Fed rate cut amid governor shakeup

The administration wants to actively suppress long-term interest rates, and potential tools include increased Treasury bill issuance, bond buybacks, quantitative easing or direct yield curve control. 

Lower long-term rates would reduce government borrowing costs as national debt hits a record $37.5 trillion. The administration also wants to stimulate housing markets by bringing down mortgage rates. 

Christian Pusateri, founder of encryption protocol Mind Network, said on Wednesday that the third mandate is “financial repression by another name,” adding that it “looks a lot like” yield curve control.

“The price of money is coming under tighter control because the age-old balance between capital and labor, between debt and GDP, has become unstable,” he said. 

Outspoken BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes also said it was bullish for crypto, suggesting that yield curve control could send Bitcoin to $1 million.

The Past Three Summers Were the Three Hottest on Record

Climate-fueled heat has caused thousands of excess deaths over the past three summers, which were the three hottest on record

By Andrea Thompson edited by Dean Visser

Amanda Montañez; Source: Copernicus Climate Change Service (data)

The Northern Hemisphere's summers of 2023, 2024 and 2025 were the three hottest on record, climate agencies in the European Union and the U.S. have announced. This record summer heat was driven primarily by human-caused climate change, which not only has been raising average global temperatures but also has been fueling more lethal heat waves. A new study released on Wednesday finds that climate change likely tripled the number of heat-related deaths in European cities this summer.

“Many of these [people] would not have died without climate change,” said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London, during a press conference about the finding.

The June-to-August period of 2025 was the third hottest on record, with a global average temperature 0.47 degree Celsius (0.85 degree Fahrenheit) above the 1991–2000 average, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). (The same period in 2023 was the second hottest, and the one in 2024 has remained in first place.) The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also ranked the Northern Hemisphere's latest summer as the third hottest in the agency's 176-year record and measured it as 1.02 degrees C (1.84 degrees F) hotter than the 20th century average.

According to NOAA, the current year to date ranks as the second warmest on record, behind 2024. The early part of 2025 featured a weak La Niña, a climate pattern that includes cooler-than-average waters in the tropical Pacific and tends to cool global temperatures. But La Niña years of the past few decades have been even hotter than years in the 20th century that fell under an El Niño, a pattern that tends to raise global temperatures.

The year 2024 was the first on record to have an average temperature more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above the preindustrial era. Under the Paris climate agreement (from which President Donald Trump has once again moved to withdraw the U.S.), countries agreed to try to limit warming to under 1.5 degrees C and “well below” two degrees C (3.6 degrees F). But though reaching the 1.5 milestone for one year is extremely concerning and a marker of how far the world is from reaching those goals, it does not mean the Paris climate threshold has been breached; the accord considers global average temperatures over many years. On that broader timescale, the world is about 1.2 to 1.3 degrees C (2.2 to 2.3 degrees F) above the preindustrial period because of the greenhouse gases that have poured into the atmosphere since that time.

Last October the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that globally averaged levels of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, had reached a record high of 420 parts per million (ppm) in 2023. CO2 levels in the preindustrial period were around 280 ppm.

All of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred in the past decade, according to C3S, NOAA and NASA data.

Of course, no person lives in averages—they experience weather locally and day-to-day. But the effects of climate change are clear there as well. The new study, led by researchers at Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, combined climate models with temperature and epidemiological data to estimate how many more heat-related deaths climate change caused in Europe over the past summer. They found that in 854 urban areas they examined, 68 percent of the 24,400 estimated heat deaths were attributable to climate change.

And that number is likely conservative because it covers only about 30 percent of Europe's population and does not include other regions. “The specifics will vary wherever you're looking in the world, but the basic point of these studies will always be the same: that we are warming the world through our fossil fuel emissions and other activities and that this is causing people to die,” said Clair Barnes, a climate researcher at Imperial College London, at the press conference. “That's what it boils down to.”

And the proportion of heat deaths attributable to climate change is creeping up, Otto says.

In the U.S., where heat is the deadliest weather-related killer, residents have gone from experiencing an average of two heat waves each summer in the 1960s to more than six today. Those heat waves have also extended from an average of three days to four—and the heat wave season lasts much longer, extending from just more than 20 days in the 1960s to more than 70 now.

This trend is set to persist as society continues to burn fossil fuels: a 2021 study in Science found that even under countries' current greenhouse gas reduction pledges, children born in 2020 will experience seven times as many heat waves over their lifetime as people born in 1960. Those future waves will also last longer and feature ever higher temperatures than today's.

Without more concerted action on the part of governments and companies to rein in emissions, it's only a matter of time before these record-hot summers are pushed lower down the list—making even today's record heat seem comparatively cool in the coming decades.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

People often talk about having “gut feelings,” but new research suggests there may be more to the idiom than we thought. Scientists are finding that specialized cells in our intestines can send signals directly to the brain, potentially influencing appetite and even mood.

Recent studies hint that our microbiomes could play a role in this communication system, though researchers are still trying to understand exactly how these interactions work and what they mean for our health.

Here to walk us through the emerging science of the belly-to-brain connection is Maya Kaelberer, an assistant professor at the University of Arizona in the Department of Physiology.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Maya Kaelberer: It's my pleasure. I'm happy to be here.

Feltman: So you recently co-authored a study that looks at the gut-brain connection a little bit. Could you tell us a little bit about why scientists are interested in that and what we know about it so far?

Kaelberer: Yeah, I mean, I think more than just scientists are interested in it; we have our gut feelings all the time. And so my work is really focused on understanding the biology behind those gut feelings and how is it that our gut can communicate to us. 'Cause we know, right, things like hangry exist. We know that how we feel or what food we eat or even what microbes are there is gonna affect overall how we feel in the world.

Feltman: Mm.

Kaelberer: And so understanding the molecular and cellular and neuronal connections between the gut and the brain is gonna help us better understand, like, this relationship that we have, that we have these gut feelings, right?

Feltman: Yeah.

Kaelberer: We know they're there [laughs].

Feltman: Well, and beyond, you know, hanger, which is obviously a great example, what are some conditions that have been connected to the gut that might surprise people?

Kaelberer: So when I was in my postdoc we discovered that there was this direct connection between these cells in the surface of the gut, we call them neuropod cells, and neurons that communicate directly—they reach directly into the brain. And so we call this as—our “gut sense,” and the number-one question I would always get was: Who cares? Like, what [laughs], you know, what is our gut possibly telling us that our mouth and our nose did not already tell us about the food that we ate?

And so we delved into this a little bit more in some previous publications with regards to sugar sensing, and I use this example 'cause it's really salient in my own life, which is that I like artificial sweetener in my coffee.

Feltman: Mm.

Kaelberer: And I don't like regular sugar because regular sugar just feels heavy to me, and I want that, like, artificial sweetener. It kind of keeps me going. I can be caffeinated. I can be, like, on the go. I'm not gonna, like, sit down and take a nap afterwards. And so we know that these two stimuli feel different in our gut. And what we found is that these neuropod cells are actually distinguishing between the two stimuli, between real sugar and artificial sweetener. And they release different signals, and then the signal for sugar actually drives the animal to consume the sugar over the artificial sweetener.

So now we take it back to my coffee preference, and suddenly, I'm like, “Well, this makes sense. I like the artificial sweetener because I don't want that heaviness.” And that heaviness is telling me that that food was gratifying or that food was satisfying; there was some kind of value associated with that that's gonna help me survive in nature. And so then this is now this communication system of, like, “Oh, our gut sense is telling us something about the food we eat past whether or not it tastes good. It's telling us a little bit about the value of what we're consuming.”

Feltman: So let's get into the latest study. What were you guys looking for, and what did you find?

Kaelberer: Yeah, so the microbiome is everywhere. We're always hearing about how the microbiome affects a lot of our behaviors, and there's all this really cool work that's coming out showing that there are these different species, they can affect your mood, but we don't really know what that connection is. And so when we found that these neuropod cells are responding to nutrients, we thought, “Oh, well, in the gut there's this microbiome population. I wonder if the microbiome is actually signaling via these neuropod cells.”

And so it turns out what we found is they do, hence the study. And they're doing it in this really interesting way. So what they're doing is they're sensing this protein that's on the tail of the bacteria, and this is any bacteria that has a tail—it has to swim around, has a tail—and this protein, so it's pretty widely expressed across all these different microbes. And what [a neuropod cell is] sensing is: it's sensing that protein, and that protein tells the animal when it's being sensed that the animal should eat a little bit less and when the protein isn't there that the animal should eat a little bit more.

And you can think, like, this might be counterintuitive because aren't we against bacteria [laughs], right? Like, it, it infects us all the time. We don't want it to grow. But that's not always true. We want our microbiome to grow. We want it to be healthy. We want it to maintain a good population size because it has all these benefits. And so what we found is that this is actually a circuit, via these neuropod cells, and it's a direct connection that allows the microbiome and the host to somehow communicate about what its food needs are.

Feltman: Very cool. So what do you think the implications of those findings are?

Kaelberer: So I think that the implications of these findings open a lot of possibilities, right? If we know—it's, like, figuring out: What's the language they're using to communicate? And now, once we know what the language they're using is, now you can imagine: “Okay, are there nutrients that affect the signaling pathway? Are there probiotics that influence it more or less? Are there other signals, for instance, from the microbes, not just this tail protein but other things that are actually influencing different types of behavior?”

Like, there are some studies that are looking at social interaction and showing that there's a certain species of microbes that's associated with being more sociable, but we still don't know what that direct pathway is. And so this is just kind of the beginning of, like, well, what is this, this “neurobiotic sense” is what we're calling it, because it's this whole new sense that's all about: How do we communicate with our microbiome, and how does our microbiome communicate with us?

Feltman: So what are your next steps research-wise?

Kaelberer: So research-wise the next steps are—I actually already mentioned them a little bit. We're interested to know how it is that the food that we're eating is being processed by those microbes in order to adjust that signal. So you could imagine, like, a high-fat or a high-sugar diet—I have this pet theory: I think that people with a sweet tooth actually have microbes with a sweet tooth and that there's some kind of communication going on there that's saying, like, “Hey, maybe eat a little more sugar. We want a little more sugar down here.” Or, like, a high-fat diet, this is another, like, thing that we study a lot is: How is it that our diet, or highly processed food, how is this actually influencing that ecosystem that we contain in our gut?

Feltman: How far out do you think we are from being able to take advantage of some of these gut-brain connections by manipulating our microbiome?

Kaelberer: Rachel, that is a great question because we talk a lot about the science, we talk about the initial discoveries. I'm gonna give a small example, which is Ozempic. You've probably heard of Ozempic.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Kaelberer: It's a GLP-1 agonist. GLP-1 is what's called a satiety hormone. This satiety hormone was discovered in animals. And so you think about it: Okay, we discovered it in animals. We tested it, we tested its function and basic research. We moved on into human research. And then the first Ozempic drugs, if I'm getting my dates right, were in the teens, was when they came out. And so now we're talking about, like, 30 years of research that had to go into this really key discovery that was made before we had the implications in human health.

Feltman: Right.

Kaelberer: I don't think it's gonna take that long because there's a lot of other stuff that we've built on.

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Kaelberer: But I think it's important to know, like, all right, you've gotta test the mechanism. We don't just give people anything [laughs], right? We have to go through the process of, like, testing it out, testing what we know about it and then testing, like, are there other drugs, say—so this is another common way to do it—are there other drugs that are already approved in humans that are influencing this new pathway that we discovered and are having this positive effect? And so that pathway is actually a quicker way to get to human implications.

And so one thing that I thought was really cool about the study that we did was that it's an experiment that's, at, at kind of the end, was testing this in what are called germ-free mice. So germ-free mice are mice that have never seen a microbe in their lives. They grow up without bacteria at all. They're completely free of it. And these mice are a little weird; turns out we need them. But what we did is we took these germ-free mice and we tested whether that tail protein, this flagellin signal, had the same effect in these mice. And it did; it actually—it decreased their feeding.

And why do I point that out? It seems like, “So what? Who cares?” Right? But this finding, I think, is actually really interesting because what it implies is that the mouse did not need prior experience in order for this circuit to actually exist. And when that happens, usually what that means is this is because the circuit evolved; we evolved with our microbiomes in order to communicate. This isn't just some kind of reaction that we're learning based on what microbes come into our body.

And so I think understanding that kind of aspect of it puts a different spin on the research 'cause now we're talking about, okay, this is a lifelong interaction that we've had, so now we know we can't just get rid of it, right? You can't just take the microbes out. We actually have to work with the microbes in order to improve health.

Feltman: Yeah.

Kaelberer: As you can probably tell I'm very passionate about the work that I'm doing, and I just think that we're at the forefront of so many really cool discoveries. So I, I always ask, Rachel, and I'm gonna ask you this question: Now that you know what a gut sense is, think about your last meal. How did you feel? How did your gut feel about what you last ate?

Feltman: I think my gut felt pretty good about what I last ate. It was a salad. There was a lot, a lot of variety in there. There was a lot going on. So I don't think my gut felt bad about it [laughs].

Kaelberer: But now you're gonna be thinking about it. Now sometimes I'm like, “Oh, yeah,” like, if I eat a plate of vegetables, I'm like, “Mm.” I can feel—like, it's not as rewarding as cake, right? Like ...

Feltman: Sure, yeah.

Kaelberer: [Laughs] Let's all be honest about that. But I'm like, “Mm.” I feel the satisfaction that my gut is like, “You made a good decision.”

Feltman: [Laughs] I love that. Thanks so much for coming on.

Kaelberer: Of course. Thank you so much.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday to talk about how social media algorithms are shaping the future of language.

Graphene is stronger than steel and a better conductor that copper, making the two-dimensional material of particular interest to scientists.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

First produced in 2004 by scientists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov (who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their efforts in 2010), graphene—a two-dimensional material made of carbon atoms—has since been described as “magic” and a “wonder material” for  being both stronger than steel and a better conductor than copper. Two decades on, graphene is finally finding its way into a variety of industries, and will likely play a central role in future technologies. 

Now, a new paper from scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, India, and the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan show that the wonders of graphene have never ceased. They discovered that when graphene's electron composition is tuned t0 its Dirac point—the moment when a material is neither a metal nor an insulator—the subatomic structure behaves like a quantum fluid. 

In fact, it even approached the properties of a “perfect fluid,” which is when a material exhibits no viscosity. This is closely similar to a quark-gluon plasma, the subatomic primordial soup of the universe that formed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang (and also forms within the bowels of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN).

Perhaps even more surprising is that graphene appeared to flout a well-established rule of physics known as the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of the thermal and electrical conductivity of a metal is proportional to temperature. Instead, they found an inverse relationship that formed a 200-fold deviation from this law. In other words, thermal conductivity increased as electrical conductivity decreased (and vice versa). The results of the study were published in the journal Nature Physics. 

“It is amazing that there is so much to do on just a single layer of graphene even after 20 years of discovery,” Arindam Ghosh, one of the co-authors of the study from IISc, said in a press statement.

Despite its dramatic nature, this breakdown in the Wiedemann–Franz law wasn't totally unexpected. A 2016 study published in the journal Science noted that graphene exhibited this behavior at the Dirac point. This, however, study takes things a bit further, stating that this is the first time that the universally-applicable experimental evaluation of electric conductivity was possible.

“Our experiment addresses the missing piece in the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the unifying concepts in physics,” the authors wrote. 

The researchers now see graphene as a potentially low-cost platform for exploring concepts in high-energy physics and astrophysics, including black-hole thermodynamics and entanglement entropy scaling. Graphene could also become a particularly powerful quantum sensor, as it's capable of detecting extremely weak magnetic fields. 

In other words, some 20 years after its discovery, graphene's full potential still has yet to be fully realized.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","The Rats of New York City Have Developed Their Own Language","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a66109690/nyc-rats-communication/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

With roughly three million rats living in New York City, scientists set out to understand the daily lives—and speech patterns—of these rodent city-dwellers.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Over its 400-year-long history, New York City has collected an assortment of emblems that draw the mind toward the famous metropolis. The “I <3 NY” T-shirt is a big one, and pizza and Broadway aren't far behind. However, almost as long as there's been a New York City (or a New Amsterdam, for that matter), there has been another pseudo-symbol of the city—lots and lots of rats. 

The most modern estimate places NYC's rodent population at about three million—roughly one-third of the city's human population. To understand these whiskered residents a little bit better, scientists from New York City (and also Germany) studied the behavior of the animals using an assortment of digital technologies, including artificial intelligence techniques (for capturing movement patterns), thermal imaging, and ultrasonic audio recordings. 

The goal was to understand the behavior of the New York City rat (Rattus norvegicus) in comparison to the characteristics of rats as reported in broad scientific literature. In a study published on the preprint server bioRxiv, the team reports that the rats modulate their communication (via ultrasonic squeaking) to match the surrounding sonic environment. After meticulously analyzing three NYC ecosystems—sidewalks, city parks, and the subway—the data showed that rats in the subway system communicated more loudly due to the raucous environment. 

“There is an increasing interest in studying animal cognition in natural habitats, especially in light of new AI tools for quantifying behavior,” the authors wrote in the study. “The advent of new tools may make it possible to translate mechanistic biological insights from laboratory based studies to natural habitats where animals live.”

By utilizing a deep neural network to analyze rat vocalizations, accounting for the difference in ambient noise (the subway was around 12 decibels louder than the park, for example), the team found that the NYC rat vocalizations were “consistently shorter duration and lie outside of the historical frequency-duration range” that is typically reported in meta-analyses of brown rats. Speaking with Scientific American, Emily Mackevicius, a co-author of the study from the Basic Research Institute, said that rat vocalizations were particularly attuned to their surrounding environment. 

“There was an ambulance going by, and you could look at that in the spectrogram, and the rat vocalizations were louder than the ambulance,” Mackevicius told Scientific American. “They're just kind of screaming to each other, but we just don't hear it.”

Video of the rats also showed social dynamic trends. Smaller rats (probably juveniles) traveled in groups, likely still learning the foraging ropes. Meanwhile, bigger rats tended to be loners. 

While we typically think of biology as something that occurs in wild spaces, understanding the dynamics of city-dwellers—whether human or rat—will only become more important as  time goes on. After all, an estimated 68 percent of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, and that's all biology. And if the past several centuries have been any indication, it's likely that humans will need to coexist with the wild animals that call those cities home.

Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional1. SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy2. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency (Scn2a+/−). Next, using an adeno-associated virus CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa protects Scn2a+/− mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes.

Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients' past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course1,2,3. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records4,5. However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual's past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M's generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods7 provide insights into Delphi-2M's predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.

The progression of human disease across age is characterized by periods of health, episodes of acute illness and also chronic debilitation, often manifesting as clusters of co-morbidity. Patterns of multimorbidity affect individuals unevenly and have been associated with lifestyle, heritable traits and socioeconomic status1,2,3. Understanding each individual's multi-morbidity risks is important to tailor healthcare decisions, motivate lifestyle changes or direct entrance into screening programs, as is the case for cancer8,9. Critically, health cannot only be understood by the presentation of individual diagnoses but, rather, in the context of an individual's co-morbidities and their evolution over time. While a wide range of prediction algorithms exist for specific diseases, from cardiovascular disease to cancer10,11,12, few algorithms are capable of predicting the full spectrum of human disease, which recognizes more than 1,000 diagnoses at the top level of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) coding system.

Learning and predicting patterns of disease progression is also important in populations that are ageing and that exhibit shifts in their underlying demographic's morbidities. For example, it has been predicted that, globally, the number of cancer diagnoses will increase 77% by 2050 (ref. 13) or that, in the UK, the number of working-age individuals with major illnesses, including depression, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer or dementia, will increase from 3 to 3.7 million by 2040 (ref. 14). Modelling the expected burden of disease is therefore critical for healthcare and economic planning and, moreover, the continual tracking of disease occurrence along with its likely future prevalence within population groups promotes a more informed healthcare system.

Recent developments in AI may help to address some methodological limitations of multi-morbidity modelling, which have so far proved difficult to overcome15. Aside from the great number of diagnoses, these include challenges in modelling temporal dependencies among previous events, the integration of potentially diverse prognostically relevant data and the statistical calibration of predictions. Large language models (LLMs)16,17,18,19—a subfield of AI that enables chatbots such as ChatGPT20,21—model language as a sequence of word fragments (tokens). Generated token by token, the new text is based on all preceding text and, with enough training, the statistical dependencies among these tokens prove sufficient to produce context-aware and even conversational text, which is often indistinguishable from that of a human counterpart.

The analogy between LLMs and disease progression modelling, which also entails recognizing past events and exploiting their mutual dependencies to predict the future sequence of morbidity, has recently inspired a series of new AI models. For example, BERT-based models22,23,24,25 have been developed for specific prediction tasks. Transformer models trained on electronic health records have been used for predicting diagnoses such as pancreatic cancer26, self-harm25 and stroke24, as well as non-clinical parameters such as self-esteem27. However, despite promising proofs of concept4,28,29, the potential for comprehensive and generative multi-morbidity modelling has not yet been fully assessed.

Here we demonstrate that attention-based transformer models, similar to LLMs, can be extended to learn lifetime health trajectories and accurately predict future disease rates for more than 1,000 diseases simultaneously on the basis of previous health diagnoses, lifestyle factors and further informative data. Our extended model, termed Delphi-2M, was trained on data from the UK Biobank, a population-scale research cohort, and validated on Danish population registries. The vocabulary of the model includes ICD-10 top-level diagnostic codes, as well as sex, body mass, smoking, alcohol consumption and death. Delphi provides individual-level predictions of multi-disease incidences and models future health trajectories at any point throughout an individual's life course. Moreover, the internal model of Delphi offers insights into how past data influence the rates of subsequent diseases. We further assess biases and fairness across demographic subgroups and discuss Delphi's potential as a framework for healthcare modelling.

A person's health trajectory can be represented by a sequence of diagnoses using top-level ICD-10 codes recorded at the age of first diagnosis as well as death. Furthermore, ‘no event' padding tokens were randomly added at an average rate of 1 per 5 years to eliminate long intervals without other inputs, which are especially frequent for younger ages and during which the baseline disease risk can change substantially (Extended Data Fig. 1). Together, these data comprise 1,258 distinct states—tokens in LLM terminology. Additional information includes sex, body mass index (BMI) and indicators of smoking and alcohol consumption, which are used as input information but not predicted by the model (Fig. 1a).

Source Data

Training data comprised 402,799 (80%) participants of the UK Biobank recorded before the 1 July 2020. Data for the remaining 100,639 (20%) participants were used for validation and hyperparameter optimization, while all records for 471,057 (94%) participants still alive on 1 July 2020 were used for longitudinal testing up until 1 July 2022 (Fig. 1b). Additional external testing was conducted on the Danish disease registry data, which covered 1.93 million Danish nationals and spanned the period from 1978 to 2018.

To model disease history data, which, in contrast to text, occurs on a continuous time axis, we extended the GPT-2 architecture6 (Fig. 1c). Transformer models map their inputs into an embedding space, where information is successively aggregated to enable autoregressive predictions. The first change therefore replaces GPT's positional encoding, a mapping that identifies each text token's discrete position, with an encoding of continuous age using sine and cosine basis functions16. Standard GPT models only predict the next token using a multinomial probability model. Thus, the second extension is the addition of another output head to also predict the time to the next token using an exponential waiting time model (Methods). Third, GPT's causal attention masks, which ensure that the model accesses only information from past events, are amended to additionally mask tokens recorded at the same time. Padding, lifestyle and sex tokens use a similar encoding but do not enter the likelihoods, as the model is deliberately not trained to predict them.

We term this model Delphi (Delphi large predictive health inference). This architecture enables one to provide the model with a partial health trajectory (prompt in LLM terminology) to calculate the subsequent rate (per day) for each of the 1,256 disease tokens plus death. Furthermore, the next token and the time to this event can be sampled on the basis of these rates. Iteratively, this procedure samples entire health trajectories (Fig. 1d).

A systematic screen of architecture hyperparameters (embedding dimensionality, number of layers, heads) confirms the reported empirical scaling laws30, which state that model performance increases with the number of datapoints and, up to a limit defined by the available data, as the number of parameters increases (Fig. 1e). The screen indicates that, for the UK Biobank dataset, optimal Delphi models have around 2 million parameters. One of the models within the optimal range has an internal embedding dimensionality of 120, 12 layers and 12 heads, amounting to a total of 2.2 million parameters. Results based on this model parameterization are discussed throughout the rest of the paper. We note that qualitatively similar results are obtained from other parameter choices (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).

An ablation analysis shows how Delphi-2M architectural modifications contribute to a better age- and sex-stratified cross-entropy compared with a standard GPT model (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2). A good, albeit slightly inferior, classification performance at different ages may already be achieved by adding regular ‘no event' padding tokens to the input data with GPT models alone. However, a key distinguishing feature of Delphi compared with basic GPT models is its ability to calculate the absolute rates of tokens, which provide consistent estimates of inter-event times (Fig. 1g). This property also implies that the rates may be interpreted as the incidences of tokens.

Delphi-2M's accuracy in predicting diverse disease outcomes in the validation cohort is compared to the sex and age-stratified incidence as an epidemiological baseline. As can be seen in the ten examples shown in Fig. 2a, the incidence curves are very varied, with some diseases, such as chickenpox, peaking in infancy, while others, such as asthma or depression, are relatively flat and with most rising exponentially in old age. Moreover, there are noticeable differences between the sexes, which are obvious for breast cancer but also pronounced for diabetes, depression, acute myocardial infarction and death. Delphi-2M's predictions are updated for each individual when new inputs are recorded. The predictions largely follow the sex- and age-stratified incidence curves but also indicate events or periods when the individual risk remains below or rises above the population average. For some diseases, such as asthma or arthrosis, the spread is narrow, indicating a limited ability to predict beyond the sex- and age-incidence trend. Yet for other diseases, including septicaemia, and also death, the spread is wide, indicating predictable inter-individual differences in disease rates.

Source Data

Delphi's ability to predict the next diagnosis token across the spectrum of human disease is confirmed by the average age-stratified area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), which averages at values of approximately 0.76 in the internal validation data (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2). For 97% of diagnoses, the AUC was greater than 0.5, indicating that the vast majority followed patterns with at least partial predictability. These patterns were found to be true across the different chapters of the ICD-10 spectrum, which define broad groups of disease for both sexes (Fig. 2c,d). Among the most confidently predicted next events is death, with an age-stratified AUC of 0.97 in both sexes. Importantly, calibration analyses in 5-year age brackets show that the predicted rates closely match the observed number of cases, showing that the models' rates of the next tokens are consistently estimated (Extended Data Fig. 3).

Next-event predictions are often the consequence of acute illness or diagnostic refinements that accrue over the course of a few weeks or months, which may be undesirable for prognostication. Delphi-2M's average AUC values decrease from an average of 0.76 to 0.70 after 10 years, indicating that its predictions are also relevant for long-term prognostication (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar results were observed in longitudinal test data, which also show no substantial shift in diagnostic patterns throughout the Biobank's follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 4).

The performance of Delphi was similar to routinely used clinical risk scores for cardiovascular disease and dementia, and better than those used for death. For diabetes, the performance of Delphi was worse compared with the use of a single marker, HbA1c, which is used clinically for risk prediction and diagnosis of diabetes (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 3). This was the case for next-event predictions, as well as prediction horizons up to 24 months. Delphi-2M's AUC values were also generally higher than those of a recent machine learning algorithm that calculates the risks of a similarly broad spectrum of ICD-10 diagnoses using 67 different biomarkers available through the UK Biobank31, even though for many diagnoses, such as diabetes, biomarkers remain indispensable (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4), marking potential for future modifications of Delphi that additionally use data beyond health records (Extended Data Fig. 5). For most cases, Delphi-2M's multi-disease predictions match or exceed current risk models for individual disease outcomes and offer the great advantage of enabling the simultaneous assessment of more than 1,000 diseases and their timing at any given time, while also surpassing multi-disease models in quality.

One of the most promising features of generative models is the ability to sample disease trajectories, conditional on data recorded up to a certain point. This is a property that few conventional epidemiological models possess.

To systematically assess the influence of medical histories on future health, we sampled health trajectories for each participant from the UK Biobank validation cohort on the basis of data available until the age of 60 years (Fig. 3a). This provides the opportunity to compare 63,662 sampled and observed trajectories. When evaluated at the population level, the disease incidences at ages 70–75 years are well recapitulated, showing that the overall distributions are well preserved by iterative sampling (Fig. 3b). This is further confirmed by the cross-entropy loss of sampled trajectories, which is, on average, indistinguishable from the observed data but drops when the preceding disease histories are shuffled between participants (Supplementary Fig. 5b).

a, Schematic of the experiment design. Delphi-2M is used to simulate health trajectories using validation data (n = 63,622 individuals with disease records both before and after 60 years of age) observed until the age of 60. A single trajectory is simulated per individual. Subsequently, simulated trajectories are compared to the observed outcomes for the same person. b, Delphi-2M-modelled disease rates at ages 70–75 years (x axis) compared with observed rates at the same ages (y axis). c, The fraction of correctly predicted diagnoses (y axis) per 1-year age bin as a function of the years after simulation started at age 60 years (x axis).

The box plots show the median (centre line), the first to the third quartile (box limits) and the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles (whiskers).

Source Data

In the first year of sampling, there are on average 17% disease tokens that are correctly predicted, and this drops to less than 14% 20 years later. These figures compare to values of 12–13% of correctly predicted disease tokens using sex and age alone, confirming that the conditional generation helps to make more accurate predictions of future events (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5c,d).

Delphi-2M's ability to simulate differential health outcomes over a decade or more, on the basis of each individual's health history, manifests in a multitude of ways. For example, the changes in disease burden in different population subsets defined by smoking, alcohol consumption or BMI are well predicted (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 6a). Similar findings are observed when the population is stratified by the presence of previous diseases or by estimated disease risks (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Together, these analyses show that Delphi-2M's conditional samples provide meaningful extrapolations for future health courses, which reflect the influence of past health events.

The use of synthetic data has been proposed to help overcome issues with privacy in biomedical modelling if such datasets do not reveal characteristics specific to any one person. Fully synthetic data, which are sampled from birth with randomly assigned sex, reproduce the observed age and sex-specific incidence patterns throughout life (Fig. 3e). Further assessment shows that the generated trajectories do not exhibit any greater similarity to the training data than those from the validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. 6). While partially overlapping disease trajectories may be found in terms of absolute disease tokens, the extent of overlap appears as expected on the basis of the observed incidences and co-morbidity patterns.

To illustrate the use of synthetic data, we trained a version of Delphi-2M exclusively on synthetic data. Notably, when evaluated on the observed validation data, the fully synthetically trained model achieves an age–sex-stratified average AUC of 0.74, which is only three percentage points lower than that of the original Delphi-2M model (Fig. 3f). This confirms that synthetic data preserve much of the information relevant to training Delphi models and may serve as a less privacy-sensitive alternative to personal data.

Insights into how Delphi-2M uses past information to predict future disease rates can be obtained by assessing the structure of the disease embeddings. GPT models linearly map inputs into a lower-dimensional embedding space, in which the temporal sequence of events is iteratively aggregated to produce a state from which predictions of each next token are derived (Fig. 1c). Delphi-2M's specific implementation uses weight tying, which uses the same mapping to project the final embedding state to the token risks, guiding interpretation as the embedding matrix reflects the observed structure of co-morbidity risks.

As shown by the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) representation of Delphi-2M's embedding matrix in Fig. 4a, disease codes cluster closely by the underlying chapter, a property that the model has no direct knowledge of, and that purely reflects co-occurrence patterns in the data. Yet there are also noticeable exceptions, for example, cancers and precancers of the female reproductive tract. Another noteworthy cluster involves the two types of diabetes, retinal disorders and the neuropathies caused by them. Diseases with high acute mortality, such as myocardial infarction or septicaemia, are clustering with death.

Top, the risk of pancreatic cancer immediately before diagnosis at age 68.2 years, which was found to be 19× increased. Bottom, the SHAP estimates of contributions to estimated mortality at age 63.5 years, which was greatly increased, in large part due to the preceding diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. c, The average SHAP effect of each of n = 778 disease tokens with more than 5 occurrences and grouped by chapter (y axis) on the same set of tokens plus death (x axis). The red colours indicate a risk increase, whereas blue indicates a decrease. d, Rate change (SHAP value) of mortality (y axis) as a function of time after diagnosis (x axis) for selected diseases.

Source Data

To gain further insights into how individual tokens influence future risks, shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values measure the influence of each token from the input trajectory on model predictions by a systematic assessment of subsampled data for individual prediction. As illustrated with the example of the proband's partial trajectory shown in Fig. 4b, this analysis reveals that a series of disease diagnoses of the digestive tract (ICD-10 chapter XI) elevated their pancreatic cancer risk 19-fold. The subsequent pancreatic cancer diagnosis in turn increased the rate of mortality almost ten thousandfold.

SHAP analysis of data from 100,639 individuals of the validation cohort reveals the mutual dependencies by which each disease, sex and lifestyle token influences the rate of subsequent disease tokens, similar to hazard ratios in conventional statistical models (Fig. 4c (left) and Extended Data Fig. 7). Effects mostly increase the rates of other diseases and are usually found among diseases of the same ICD-10 chapters, underscoring that the recorded patterns of co-morbidities often cluster within specific ICD-10 disease chapters. Particular clusters spanning entire disease chapters are visible for ICD-10 chapters V (mental disorders) and XV (pregnancy and childbirth). Notably, such patterns often appeared symmetrical, indicating similar predicted effect sizes of one disease token influencing another and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 7). This behaviour can be attributed to the structure of the embedding space, which places temporarily co-occurring diagnoses in local proximity (Extended Data Fig. 8).

The patterns of modelled influences after 10 years are similar to short-term effects, even though the strength of associations is greatly attenuated (Fig. 4c (right)). The cluster relating to diseases of ICD-10 chapter XV (pregnancy and childbirth) within 5 years is entirely absent after 10 years, which is expected given that pregnancy-associated diseases occur within a finite period. However, dependencies among mental disorders remain apparent, similar to the effects of neoplasms on mortality. These observations are noteworthy as the quantification of temporal dependencies on past events poses a particular challenge for conventional epidemiological models, whereas Delphi-2M's GPT model uses attention-based weights, which are updated with every new input, including the ‘no event' paddings.

To further illustrate Delphi-2M's capabilities of modelling temporal dependencies, we note that, for some diseases, such as cancers, the influence on mortality decays with a half-life of several years, reflecting the sustained risks of recurrence or impacts of treatment (Fig. 4d). However, for septicaemia, the influence on mortality is much more short-lived and drops sharply, effectively recovering to values close to the population average. This inference agrees with traditional Nelson–Aalen analyses of the hazard rates (Supplementary Fig. 8f). This behaviour is also reflected by Delphi-2M's attention maps, which show that cancer tokens are attended to for long periods, while those of septicaemia, myocardial infarction and many other diseases tend to be short lived (Supplementary Fig. 8).

To assess whether Delphi-2M's inference generalizes to unseen cohorts, we performed external testing using Danish population registry data. For this purpose, we transferred Delphi-2M with the weights learned from the UK Biobank training and evaluated predictions on the Danish data; no retraining or adjustments have been made. The average AUC when Delphi-2M is applied to Danish data was 0.67 (s.d. 0.09), which is lower than for longitudinal testing on UKB data (0.69, s.d. 0.09). Predictions for different diseases were highly correlated across the datasets (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72–0.80) (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 9). The fact that Delphi-2M can be applied to Danish population data with slightly reduced accuracy indicates that many patterns learned by the model accurately reflect the true evolution of multi-morbidity, while also highlighting the existence of differences within each cohort.

SHAP values indicate the greater influence of diseases on other diseases from the same group. SR, self-reported.

Source Data

A further question is to what extent a model trained on the UK Biobank, which is an epidemiological cohort, generalizes to the general population. The UK Biobank comprises more white British citizens than the general population, and the participants tend to be on average more affluent and educated32. Lower rates of diseases are reported among participants of white ethnicity, and the rate of diagnoses increases with deprivation—trends that are reproduced by Delphi-2M (Extended Data Fig. 9). Further assessments of Delphi-2M's performance in demographic subgroups are provided in the Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11 and Supplementary Table 4.

In the UK Biobank, most individuals have been recruited between the ages of 40 and 70. This creates a selection bias, as no deaths are recorded before recruitment, which has direct implications for the estimated mortality (Fig. 5b). This immortality bias also indirectly affects the incidence of diseases associated with high mortality, such as cancers, as only survivors are included in the UK Biobank. For time-dependent analyses, the jump of mortality to non-zero values at recruitment can also lead to false attribution of the apparent increase to unrelated variables recorded at the time of recruitment. Furthermore, limited follow-up data are currently available for individuals 80 years of age and older. This period is therefore not reliably modelled by Delphi-2M.

UK Biobank's disease data have been collated from self-reports, primary care, hospital admissions, cancer and death registries, each of which contributes characteristic disease tokens: self-reporting and GP records contain mostly common diseases, while data from hospital records include more-aggressive disease tokens, such as myocardial infarction or septicaemia (Fig. 5d). However, the underlying sources were not always available for each participant and time period (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 12). Missingness of a particular data source therefore causes the absence of multiple diagnoses. Such patterns, which reflect only the data-collection process, are also learned by Delphi-2M. The predicted rates of diseases exclusive to hospital records are, on average, ten times higher in individuals with a disease history that includes other hospital records (Fig. 5e,f). Septicaemia, for example, is diagnosed in 93% of cases in a hospital setting and is predicted to occur at 8× greater rates in individuals with any other hospital data. These source effects also explain some of the substructures visible in the UMAP representation of disease embeddings (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 10a–d) and also in the matrix of SHAP effects (Figs. 4c and 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10). While some of these associations may reflect true diagnostic pathways or disease clusters diagnosed in a distinct care setting, it nevertheless appears that some of these associations are artefacts stemming from the incomplete aggregated nature of the UK Biobank's data.

Here we present Delphi-2M—a GPT-based model of multi-disease progression. Delphi-2M extends the GPT large language model to account for the temporal nature of health trajectories. Analogous to LLMs, which learn the grammar and contextual logic of language from large bodies of text, Delphi-2M inferred the patterns of multi-disease progression when trained on data for more than 1,000 diseases and baseline health information recorded in 402,799 UK Biobank participants.

A detailed assessment of Delphi-2M's predictions showed that they consistently recapitulate the patterns of disease occurrence at the population scale as recorded in the UK Biobank. For the majority of diseases, Delphi-2M's multi-disease, continuous-time model predicted future rates at comparable or better accuracy than established single-disease risk models, alternative machine learning frameworks and blood-biomarker-based models. Only a small performance drop was observed when applied to data from Danish disease registries, demonstrating that models are—even without additional finetuning—largely applicable across national healthcare systems.

Delphi-2M is uniquely capable of sampling future disease trajectories, which enables the estimation of cumulative disease burdens over periods of up to 20 years, conditional on previous health information. Note that Delphi's predictions are generally strongly influenced by statistical chance and compatible with a range of outcomes for a given individual. The ability to generate synthetic data may also help create datasets that preserve the statistical co-occurrence patterns without revealing any specific data, which could facilitate the development of further AI models with a decreased risk of revealing personal information.

Delphi-2M offers insights into the modes of disease progression. The ability to cluster disease risks may be useful for genomic association studies that focus on comorbidities or are stratified by the risks derived from health trajectories. Delphi-2M's ability to quantify the temporal influence of previous health data revealed that cancers increase mortality in a sustained manner, while the effects of myocardial infarction or septicaemia regress within 5 years. Similar analyses also revealed clusters of persisting comorbidities, such as mental health conditions. Although Delphi-2M appears to be capable of modelling temporally directed dependencies, we caution against interpreting these as causal relationships that could be exploited to modify future health courses.

There are also several limitations that need to be considered. A detailed analysis of UK Biobank's first occurrence data revealed several biases, reflected by Delphi-2M. In addition to a healthy volunteer bias and participant selection bias before recruitment, the diverse nature of health data sources impacted Delphi's prediction, as UK-Biobank-specific patterns of missingness were exploited to infer disease rates. Furthermore, Delphi-2M predicts different disease rates in subgroups based on ancestry background and deprivation indices, but no observable trend between lifestyle measures and birth year. These findings underscore the need for caution when using AI models for inference and prediction in heterogeneous healthcare datasets, potentially marking them as useful additions to currently used diagnostic pipelines, rather than replacements.

A promising feature of Delphi-2M's implementation is the relative simplicity of incorporating additional data layers, rendered possible by the transformer-based architecture. Immediate refinements of Delphi-2M may incorporate additional lifestyle data, self-reported health status, prescription records and blood tests, all of which are usually available in a general healthcare setting. Further multimodal extensions could include genomic data, richer metabolomic information, diagnostic imaging data or data from wearables that can be added to Delphi-2M's embedding layer, similar to how lifestyle tokens are currently incorporated (Extended Data Fig. 9). Furthermore, while ICD-10 provides a predefined tokenization of diseases, LLMs have been shown to also conceptualize natural language, making it plausible to expect that future models may derive similar meaning directly from free text records, enabling the application of Delphi-like models to unstructured data. Lastly, Delphi-2M itself could serve as an extension to LLMs. Similarly to systems that provide LLMs with query-relevant web search results to reduce hallucinations33, a future healthcare-oriented LLM could invoke a Delphi-based model to improve the numerical accuracy of the generated replies34.

An evident application of Delphi-type models is to support medical decision-making by rationally integrating information from various data modalities, which can be a challenge for healthcare professionals. Potential use cases could include identifying individuals who would benefit most from diagnostic tests or finding individuals with disease risk high enough to include them in screening programs, even if they have not yet met conventional age-based criteria. However, deploying clinical decision support systems requires a regulatory framework, which is still in its infancy for AI in healthcare.

An alternative use of Delphi models would be to inform healthcare providers, insurers and policymakers. Such applications, which inform the provision of healthcare rather than treatment decisions, require less regulation. Delphi's modelling has a resolution of an individual; when such predictions are aggregated, Delphi-type models may provide substantial system-wide modelling benefits, particularly in projecting the expected disease burden at local, regional and national levels, or for specific demographic groups of interest. This could reveal communities with unmet future healthcare needs over the next 1–2 decades and provide an opportunity to adjust the provision of healthcare. Such capabilities appear especially valuable in ageing populations in which healthcare needs are becoming increasingly complex and resource intensive.

These considerations illustrate the wide range of applications of generative models for biomedical research and, ultimately, also for healthcare. With appropriate training and evaluation, future multimodal model extensions may be used for preventive medicine, clinical decision support and healthcare planning. Our model and analyses present a further step towards unlocking the considerable healthcare benefits of the era of AI.

The UK Biobank is a cohort-based prospective study comprising approximately 500,000 individuals from various demographic backgrounds recruited across the UK between 2006 and 2010. At the time of recruitment, individuals were between 37 and 73 years of age35.

The main data source for health-related outcomes is built on the first occurrence data assembled in category 1712 from the UK Biobank. These data include ICD-10 level 3 codes (for example, E11: type 2 diabetes mellitus) for diseases in chapters I–XVII, excluding chapter II (neoplasms), plus death. The data are pre-assembled by UK Biobank and include the first reported occurrence of a disease in the linked primary care data (cat. 3000), inpatient hospital admissions (cat. 2000), death registry (fields 40001 and 40002) or self-reported data through questionnaires (field 20002).

Information on neoplasms was not included in category 1712 by the UK Biobank, and we therefore included the data ourselves through the addition of the linked cancer registry data in fields 40005 and 40006 (subset to the first occurrence and mapped to ICD-10 level 3 codes), which, combined with first occurrence data, gives in total 1,256 distinct diagnoses. A list of all codes used is provided in Supplementary Table 5.

We extract information on the self-reported sex of participants as recorded in field 31 (indicators for female and male), a physical assessment of body mass index at recruitment from field 21001, which we split into three indicators encoding BMI < 22 kg m−2, BMI > 28 kg m−2 and otherwise, as well as smoking behaviour from field 1239 with indicators for smoker (UKB coding: 1), occasionally smoking (2) and never smoker (0) and alcohol intake frequency from field 1558 with indicators for daily (1), moderately (2, 3) and limited (4, 5, 6).

Furthermore, information that we extracted and used for stratification to assess model performance in subgroups but were not part of the data for model training include self-reported ethnic background (field 21000), with participants grouped into five level groups (white, mixed, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, and Chinese) and an index of multiple deprivation as available in field 26410. The index combines information across seven domains, including income, employment derivation, health and disability, education skills and training, barriers to housing and services, living environment and crime.

Moreover, we extract information required for some of the algorithms we compare against. A list of the variables and their codes can be found in Supplementary Table 5.

Exploring comorbidities and health-related factors is uniquely facilitated by Denmark's comprehensive registries, which gather up to 40 years of interconnected data from across the entire population. All used registries are linkable through a unique personal identification number provided in the Central Person Registry along with information on sex and date of birth. Furthermore, we used the Danish National Patient Registry36 (LPR), a nationwide longitudinal register with data on hospital admissions across all of Denmark since 1977, along with the Danish Register of Causes of Death37 since 1970 to extract information on an individual's acquired diagnoses throughout their lifetime. Our current data extract covers information up until around 2019 when reporting to the LPR was updated to LPR3. Furthermore, we restrict our cohort to individuals 50–80 years of age on 1 January 2016, to obtain a similar age range as in the UK Biobank. The 1 January 2016 was chosen as the cut-off point as it is the latest timepoint for which we can guarantee reliable coverage across the entire population over the entire prediction horizon.

To obtain a dataset that resembles the UK Biobank data, we retain only the first occurrence of an individual's diagnosis and transform all codes to ICD-10 level 3 codes. Diagnoses before 1995 are reported in ICD-8 and have been converted to ICD-10 codes using published mappings38. Codes that may be present in the Danish register but were not in the UK Biobank are removed. Information on lifestyle is not available, and indicators for BMI, smoking and alcohol intake have therefore been treated as absent.

The models were trained on UK Biobank data for 402,799 (80%) individuals using data from birth until 30 June 2020. For validation, data contain the remaining 100,639 (20%) individuals for the same period. Internal longitudinal testing was carried out using data for all individuals still alive by the cut-off date (471,057) and evaluated on incidence from 1 July 2021 to 1 July 2022, therefore enforcing a 1 year data gap between predictions and evaluation. Validation assesses how well the model generalized to different individuals from the same cohort. Longitudinal testing investigates whether the model's performance changes over time and if it can be used for prognostic purposes.

External longitudinal testing was conducted on the Danish registries. All individuals residing in Denmark 50–80 years of age on the 1 January 2016 were included. Predictions are based on the available data up to this point and were subsequently evaluated on incidence from 1 January 2017 to 1 of January 2018, similar to the internal longitudinal testing. Data were collected for 1.93 million individuals (51% female and 49% male), with 11.51 million disease tokens recorded between 1978 and 2016. Predictions were evaluated on 0.96 million disease tokens across 796 ICD-10 codes (each with at least 25 cases).

Delphi's architecture is based on GPT-2 (ref. 6), as implemented in https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT. The basic GPT model uses standard transformer blocks with causal self-attention. A standard lookup table embedding layer with positional encoding was used to obtain the embeddings. The embedding and casual self-attention layers are followed by layer normalization and a fully connected feedforward network. Transformer layers, consisting of causal self-attention and feedforward blocks, are repeated multiple times before the final linear projection that yields the logits of the token predictions. The residual connections within a transformer layer are identical to those in the original GPT implementation. Here we also use weight tying of the token embeddings and final layer weights, which has the advantage of reducing the number of parameters and allowing input and output embeddings to be similarly interpreted.

Each datapoint consists of pairs (token, age) recording the token value and the proband's age, measured in days from birth, at which the token was recorded. The token vocabulary consists of n = 1,257 different ICD-10 level 3 disease tokens, plus n = 9 tokens for alcohol, smoking and BMI, each represented by three different levels, as well as n = 2 tokens for sex and n = 1 no-event padding token as well as n = 1 additional, non-informative padding token at the beginning or end of the input sequences.

No-event padding tokens were added to the data with a constant rate of 1 per 5 years by uniformly sampling 20 tokens from the range of (0, 36525) and interleaving those with the data tokens after intersecting with the data range for each person. No-event tokens eliminate long time intervals without tokens, which are typical for younger ages, when people generally have fewer diseases and therefore less medical records. Transformers predict the text token probability distribution only at the time of currently observed tokens; thus, no-event tokens can also be inserted during inference to obtain the predicted disease risk at any given time of interest.

Sex tokens were presented at birth. Smoking, alcohol and lifestyle were recorded at the enrolment into the UK Biobank. As this specific time also coincided with the end of immortal time bias (probands had to be alive when they were recruited), smoking, alcohol and BMI tokens times were randomized by −20 to +40 years from this point in time to break an otherwise confounding correlation leading to a sudden jump in mortality rates (and possibly other diseases with high mortality, such as cancers) associated with the recording of these tokens. This probably also diminishes the true effect of these tokens.

Delphi replaces GPT's positional encoding with an encoding based on the age values. Following the logic frequently used for positional encodings, age is represented by sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, where the lowest frequency is given by 1/365. These functions are subsequently linearly combined by a trainable linear transformation, which enables the model to share the same basis function across multiple encoding dimensions. Another advantage of using age encoding is that Delphi can handle token inputs of arbitrary length, as no parameters are associated with token positions.

Standard causal self-attention enables the GPT model to attend to all preceding tokens. For sequential data, these are found to the left of the token sequence. Yet in the case of time-dependent data, tokens can be recorded at the same time with no specified order. Thus, attention masks were amended to mask positions that occurred at the same time as the predicted token. Non-informative padding tokens were masked for predictions of other tokens.

The input data to Delphi are bivariate pairs (j, t) of the next token class and the time to the next token. Delphi is motivated by the theory of competing exponentials. Let Ti be the waiting times from the current event to one of i = 1, …, n competing events, where n is the number of predictable tokens. Assuming the Ti are each exponentially distributed waiting times with rates λi = exp(logitsi), the next event being j is equivalent to Tj being the first of the competing waiting times, that is, Tj = min Ti, or equivalently j = argmin Ti. It can be shown that the corresponding probability is P(j = argmin Ti) = λj/Σiλi, which is the softmax function over the vector of logits. Conveniently, this definition corresponds to the classical cross-entropy model for classification with λ = exp(logits). Thus, Delphi uses a conventional loss term for token classification:

Furthermore, in the competing exponential model the time to the next event T* = min Tj is also exponentially distributed with rate λ* = Σiλi = Σi exp(logitsi). The loss function of exponential waiting times T between tokens is simply a log-likelihood of the exponential distribution for T*:

These approximations hold as long as the rates λi are constant in time, which is a reasonable assumption over short periods. For this reason, padding tokens were introduced to ensure that waiting times are modelled over a relatively short period, which does not exceed 5 years in expectation. In line with the tie-braking logic used for causal self-attention, co-occurring events were predicted from the last non-co-occurring token each.

The total loss of the model is then given by:

Non-informative padding, as well as sex, alcohol, smoking and BMI, were considered mere input tokens and therefore removed from the loss terms above. This was achieved by setting their logits to -Inf and by evaluating the loss terms only on disease and ‘no event' padding tokens.

The next disease event is obtained through sampling the disease token and the time until the next event. The disease token is sampled from the distribution that originates from the application of the softmax to logits. For the time, samples from all exponential distributions with rates λi are taken, and the minimum is retained. Logits of non-disease tokens (sex, lifestyle) are discarded from the procedure to sample disease events only.

Models were trained by stochastic gradient optimization using the Adam optimizer with standard parameters for 200,000 iterations. The batch size was 128. After 1,000 iterations of warmup, the learning rate was decayed using a cosine scheduler from 6 × 10−4 to 6 × 10−5. 32-bit float precision was used.

In the exponential waiting time definition above, the logits of the model correspond to log-rates of the exponential distribution, λ = exp(logit). For example, probability of an event occurring within a year is given by P(T < 365.25) = 1 − exp(−exp(logit) × 365.25).

For the training set, age- and sex-stratified incidences were calculated in annual age brackets. The observed counts were divided by the number of individuals at risk in each age and sex bracket, which was given by the number of probands for each sex minus the cumulative number of deaths to account for censoring.

Calibration curves were calculated on the basis of predicted incidences. To this end, all cases of a given token accruing in five year age bins were identified. Subsequently, for all other probands, a control datapoint was randomly selected in the same age band. Predictions were evaluated at the preceding token given that the time difference was less than a year. The predicted incidences were then further grouped log-linearly into risk bins from 10–6 to 1, with multiplicative increments of log10(5). The observed annual incidence was then calculated as the average of cases and control in age bins, divided by 5 years. The procedure was separately executed for each sex.

To account for baseline disease risk changes over time, trajectories with disease of interest were stratified into 5 year age brackets from 50 to 80 years, on the basis of the occurrence of the disease of interest. To each bracket, control trajectories of matching age were added. Predicted disease rates were used within each bracket to calculate the AUC, which was then averaged across all brackets with more than two trajectories with the disease of interest. The evaluation was performed separately for different sexes. For some of the analyses, a time gap was used, meaning that for the prediction, only the tokens that were N or more months earlier than the disease of interest were used for the prediction.

To estimate the CI for AUC for individual age and sex brackets, we use DeLong's method, which provides CI mean and variance under the assumption that AUC is normally distributed. As AUC for diseases is calculated as an average of AUC for all brackets, as a linear combination of normal distributions it also is normally distributed with parameters:

where \({\mu }_{i}\) and \({\sigma }_{i}^{2}\) are the mean and variance of AUC for each age and sex bracket, calculated using DeLong's method.

For each disease, we estimated the mean AUC \({\mu }_{s}\) and variance \({\sigma }_{s}^{2}\) for each subgroup using DeLong39 method. Under the null hypothesis that all subgroups have the same true AUC (no bias), any observed differences would be attributable to statistical variance.

We use a two-level testing approach: (1) individual subgroup testing: for each disease–subgroup combination, we calculate standardized residuals by subtracting the weighted mean AUC across all subgroups from the subgroup-specific AUC and dividing by the s.d.:

Under the null hypothesis, these standardized residuals should follow a standard normal distribution. We identify outliers using a two-sided Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold.

(2) Disease-level testing: for each disease, we sum the squared standardized residuals across all subgroups:

Under the null hypothesis, this sum follows a χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to (n − 1), where n is the number of subgroups. We identify diseases with excessive between-subgroup variance using a one-sided Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold.

Owing to limitations of DeLong's method with small sample sizes, in each disease–subgroup combination, we filtered age and sex brackets with fewer than six cases and diseases with less that two brackets remaining after filtering. We also excluded diseases that had fewer than two subgroups presented.

To compare the distribution of annual incidences of model and observed data, a cross-entropy metric was used. Let pi be the annual occurrence of token i in each year. thus, the age- and sex-based entropy across tokens is given H(p,q) = −p × log(q) − (1 − p) × log(1 − q). For low incidences p and q, the latter term is usually small. The cross-entropy is evaluated across all age groups and sexes.

To evaluate the potential of generating disease trajectories, two experiments were conducted using data from the validation cohort. First, trajectories were generated from birth using only sex tokens. This was used to assess whether Delphi-2M recapitulates the overall sex-specific incidence patterns. Second, all available data until the age of 60 were used to simulate subsequent trajectories conditional on the previous health information. A single trajectory was evaluated per proband. Trajectories were truncated after the age of 80 as currently little training data were available beyond this point. Incidence patterns were evaluated as described above.

We trained a family of linear regression models on the task of predicting 5-year disease occurrence. All models were trained on the data available at the time of recruitment to the UK Biobank, using different subsets of the following predictors:

Polygenic risk scores (UKB Category 301)

Biomarkers (as used in the MILTON paper, biomarkers with more than 100,000 missing values in UKB excluded, imputed with MICE)

Overall health rating (UKB field 2178)

Delphi logits for the disease of interest

Moreover, all models had sex and age information included.

To evaluate the performance of the models, we used the same age- and sex-stratified AUC calculation that we used for Delphi performance evaluation. For breast cancer, only female participants were included. For E10 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we masked all other diabetic diseases (E11–E14) from Delphi inputs when computing logits.

To validate the predictions of the model, we also perform a longitudinal test, internally for the UK Biobank data and externally on the Danish health registries. This has two advantages: (1) we can enforce an explicit cut-off and separate data to avoid any potential time-leakage; and (2) we obtain insights into Delphi-2M prognostic capabilities and generalization.

However, as mentioned in the data splits, we use two different cut-off dates between the two data sources, mainly due to differential data availability, the principal setup applies to both in the exact same way.

We collate data up to a specific cut-off date for each individual and use Delphi-2M to predict an individual's future rate across all disease tokens. Building on the exponential waiting time representation, we obtain rates over a 1 year time frame. The preceding year after the cut-off date is discarded to introduce a data gap. Subsequently the incidence in the next year is used for evaluation. Predictions are made for individuals 50–80 years of age.

We build a standard epidemiological baseline based on the sex- and age-stratified population rates. These are based on the Nelson–Aalen estimator40,41, a nonparametric estimator of the cumulative hazard rate, across all diseases. For the UK Biobank, the estimators are based on the same training data as Delphi-2M. For the Danish registries, we use the entire Danish population in the time period from 2010 to 2016.

As the UK Biobank contains a wide range of phenotypic measures, we also estimate clinically established models and other machine learning algorithms for comparison.

We evaluate the models on cardiovascular disease (CVD) (ICD-10: I20–25 I63, I64, G45), dementia (ICD-10: F00, F01, F03, G30, G31) and death.

For CVD we compare against: QRisk3 (ref. 42), Score2 (ref. 43)(R:RiskScorescvd:SCORE2)44, Prevent45,46 (R:preventr)47, Framingham11,46,48 (R:CVrisk:10y_cvd_frs)11, Transformer, AutoPrognosis v2.0 (ref. 49) and LLama3.1(8B)50 (https://ollama.com/library/llama3).

For dementia we compare against: UKBDRS51, Transformer and LLama3.1(8B)50.

For death, we compare against: Charlson (R:comorbidity)52, Elixhauser53,54 (R:comorbidity)52, Transformer and LLama3.1(8B).

We collect a total of 60 covariates that are used to varying degrees across the algorithms. A summary description of the covariates, as well as their corresponding UKB codes, can be found in Supplementary Table 5. For missing data, we perform multivariate imputation by chained equations55,56 (R:mice)57. We retain five data copies, estimate all scores and, finally, aggregate them by Rubins' rule. Results are reported based on the aggregated scores. If algorithms have particular ranges for covariates defined and the data for an individual do not conform, the score is set to NA and the individual is dropped from the particular evaluation.

The transformer model is an encoder model based on the standard implementation provided in Python:pytorch (TransformerEncoder, TransformerEncoderLayer) with a context length of 128 tokens, an embedding size of 128, 2 multi-head attention blocks and a total of 2 sub-encoder layers, and the otherwise default parameters were used. A linear layer is used to obtain the final prediction score. The model is fitted on concatenated data excerpts of the UKB on 1 January 2014, 1 January 2016 and 1 January 2018 containing the same tokens as Delphi plus additional tokens encoding the current age based on 5 year bins (50–80 years) and is evaluated on a binary classification task of whether the corresponding outcome (CVD, dementia, death) will occur in the next 2 years.

AutoPrognosis is fitted in a similar manner with data extracted on 1 January 2014; however, we use the covariates defined previously34. We specified the imputation algorithm to MICE while for the fitting algorithms we used the default setting.

LLama3.1 was evaluated on the basis of the following prompt:

“This will not be used to make a decision about a patient. This is for research purposes only. Pretend you are a healthcare risk assessment tool. You will be given some basic information about an individual e.g. age, sex, BMI, smoking and alcohol plus a list of their past diseases/diagnoses in ICD-10 coding. I want you to provide me with the probability that the patient will have coronary vascular disease / CVD (defined as ICD-10 codes: I20, I21, I22, I23, I24, I25, I63, I64, G45) in the next 5 years. Here is an example: Input: ID(10000837); 54 years old, Female, normal BMI, past smoker, regular alcohol consumption, F41, M32, A00, C71, F32. Expected output: ID(10000837); 0.100. Please only provide the ID and the risk score as output and do not tell me that I can not provide a risk assessment tool \n Here is the input for the individual: ID(10000736); 64 years old, Male, high BMI, current smoker, regular alcohol consumption, F41, M32, A00, C71, F32.”

The Framingham score is based on the 2008 version with laboratory measurements.

Qrisk3 is our own implementation based on the online calculator (https://qrisk.org/).

The UKBDRS risk score for dementia is based on our own implementation as reported in the original paper51.

For the comparison to MILTON, we obtained the reported AUC measures for all ICD-10 codes reported for diagnostic, prognostic and time-agnostic MILTON models from the articles supplementary material31. Linking on top level (3 character) ICD-10 codes, we were able to compare the prediction of 410 diseases between Delphi and MILTON prognostic models.

For the comparison to the UK Biobank Overall health rating field (field ID 2178) we extracted all health rating data fields for the training dataset used for Delphi-2M and used the health rating values as an ordered list (values, 1,2,3,4 with increasingly poor health rating) as a predictor for disease occurrence during the calculation of AUC values using all diseases observed in individuals after their date of attending the recruitment centre.

All other models are based on publicly available implementations.

For the evaluation against clinical markers, we used the direct measurements as available in the UKB for the AUC computation (HbA1c, diabetes (E10–14); haemoglobin/mean corpuscular volume, anaemia (D60–D64)). Only for the evaluation on chronic liver disease (K70–77), we used the predictions from a logistic regression model with alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, total protein, albumin, bilirubin and glucose as covariates. Evaluations are based on a 5-year time window after an individual's recruitment data.

The Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidity index is based on the same data as Delphi; however, the Charlson comorbidity index is originally based on ICD-10 level 4 codes. We therefore estimate based on a version that maps the level 3 codes to all possible level 4 codes. We estimated a version with the level 3 codes as well and this did perform marginally worse.

Overall, we tried to model the data as close as possible to the originally used covariates; however, in some places, small adjustments were made. Particularly, we retain only level 3 ICD-10 codes; thus, definitions based on level 4 codes are approximated by their level 3 codes.

To assess the discriminatory power of the predicted rates for the longitudinal test, we use the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC-AUC) and the average precision-recall curve (APS) as implemented in Python:scikit-learn. Thus, we compare the observed cases in the evaluation period against the predicted scores obtained at the respective cut-off date. All diseases with at least 25 cases were assessed.

Furthermore, we compare the predicted rates from Delphi-2M to the observed incidence to determine the calibration of the predicted rates using Python:scikit-learn. Delphi-2M predicted rates are split into deciles, and for each bin, we compare Delphi-2M's average rate against the observed rate within the bin. We include all diseases with at least 25 cases.

The low-dimensional representation of token space was constructed by applying the UMAP58 dimensionality reduction algorithm to the learned token embeddings for Delphi-2M (1,270 × 120 matrix). The cosine metric was used.

To evaluate the influence of each token in a trajectory on the next predicted token, we adopted the SHAP methodology. Each trajectory from the validation cohort was augmented by masking one or several tokens and then used for prediction. The change of logits after many such augmentations was aggregated by a PartitionExplainer from the SHAP Python package.

The number of augmentations for each trajectory was determined using the PartitionExplainer masking algorithm. When masked, tokens were replaced by a ‘no event' placeholder that was also used during training. Sex tokens, when masked, were replaced with the corresponding token of the opposite sex.

The described procedure was applied to each of 100,639 trajectories in the validation cohort. The predicted token was always the last available token in the trajectory.

To assess the interpretation of the SHAP values, we use a penalized time-dependent Cox model, developed for use with EHR data15, and compare the corresponding hazard estimates to our averaged SHAP values.

To complement the SHAP analysis and the assessment of Delphi-2M's modelling of time-dependent effects, we also performed an evaluation based on the Nelson–Aalen estimator. For a given token, we identify individuals with the token and estimate their corresponding cumulative hazard from the occurrence of the token onwards. Moreover, we randomly select five age–sex-matched individuals for each case and estimate the cumulative hazard in this comparison group. We can then obtain an estimate of the hazard rate by taking the derivative of the cumulative hazard. We apply a Gaussian kernel to acquire a smooth estimate. Subsequently, we can take the ratio of the two hazards and obtain a crude nonparametric estimate for the hazard ratio of the token over time.

The model was trained on simulated trajectories sampled from Delphi-2M. The dataset size was 400,000 trajectories, the same as for the original training set. The trajectories were samples from birth; sex was assigned randomly. No training hyperparameters were changed compared to Delphi-2M.

No novel data were generated for this study. Reproducibility of the method has been confirmed by retraining Delphi-2M using different train-validation splits (n = 4 independent experiments; Supplementary Fig. 1) and testing the trained model using longitudinal UK Biobank data and external data from the Danish National Patient Registry.

a, Boxplots (n = 3 model replicates trained with different seeds) of the average loss (y-axis; lower is better) for Delphi-2M trained with different “no event” padding rates (inverse scale, x-axis). The y-axis shows the average cross-entropy loss, calculated over disease tokens only - that is, without padding tokens, sex and lifestyle tokens. UK Biobank validation data was used to calculate the reported losses. The boxplots feature the median as the center line, the box from the first to the third quartile and the whiskers for 1.5x IQR. b, Average cross-entropy loss, aggregated over 5-year age bins. A higher rate of “no event” tokens lowers the loss, especially for younger ages, during which generally few disease tokens are recorded, prohibiting the model from adjusting predictions for advancing age. c, “No event” token rate estimated by Delphi (y-axis) vs the true rate at which tokens were added to the training data.

General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs)1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting3, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.

Reasoning capability, the cornerstone of human intelligence, enables complex cognitive tasks ranging from mathematical problem-solving to logical deduction and programming. Recent advances in AI have demonstrated that LLMs can exhibit emergent behaviours, including reasoning abilities, when scaled to a sufficient size4,5. However, achieving such capabilities in pre-training typically demands substantial computational resources. In parallel, a complementary line of research has demonstrated that LLMs can be effectively augmented through CoT prompting. This technique, which involves either providing carefully designed few-shot examples or using minimalistic prompts such as “Let's think step by step”3,6, enables models to produce intermediate reasoning steps, thereby substantially enhancing their performance on complex tasks. Similarly, further performance gains have been observed when models learn high-quality, multistep reasoning trajectories during the post-training phase2,7. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches exhibit notable limitations. Their dependence on human-annotated reasoning traces slows scalability and introduces cognitive biases. Furthermore, by constraining models to replicate human thought processes, their performance is inherently capped by the human-provided exemplars, which prevents the exploration of superior, non-human-like reasoning pathways.

To tackle these issues, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs for developing reasoning abilities through self-evolution in a RL framework, with minimal reliance on human labelling efforts. Specifically, we build on DeepSeek-V3 Base8 and use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)9 as our RL framework. The reward signal is only based on the correctness of final predictions against ground-truth answers, without imposing constraints on the reasoning process itself. Notably, we bypass the conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL training. This design choice originates from our hypothesis that human-defined reasoning patterns may limit model exploration, whereas unrestricted RL training can better incentivize the emergence of new reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Through this process, detailed in the next section, our model (referred to as DeepSeek-R1-Zero) naturally developed diverse and sophisticated reasoning behaviours. To solve reasoning problems, the model exhibits a tendency to generate longer responses, incorporating verification, reflection and the exploration of alternative approaches within each response. Although we do not explicitly teach the model how to reason, it successfully learns improved reasoning strategies through RL.

Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates excellent reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as poor readability and language mixing, occasionally combining English and Chinese in a single CoT response. Furthermore, the rule-based RL training stage of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is narrowly focused on reasoning tasks, resulting in limited performance in broader areas such as writing and open-domain question answering. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, a model trained through a multistage learning framework that integrates rejection sampling, RL and supervised fine-tuning, detailed in the ‘DeepSeek-R1' section. This training pipeline enables DeepSeek-R1 to inherit the reasoning capabilities of its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, while aligning model behaviour with human preferences through further non-reasoning data.

To enable broader access to powerful AI at a lower energy cost, we have distilled several smaller models and made them publicly available. These distilled models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, surpassing the performance of their original instruction-tuned counterparts. We believe that these instruction-tuned versions will also greatly contribute to the research community by providing a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms underlying long CoT reasoning models and for promoting the development of more powerful reasoning models. We release DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, data samples and distilled models to the public as described in the ‘Code availability' section.

To implement large-scale RL of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we use a highly efficient RL pipeline. Specifically, we use GRPO9 as our RL algorithm, described in Methods section ‘GRPO'. Furthermore, we use a rule-based reward system to compute accuracy and format rewards, with detailed methodologies outlined in Methods section ‘Reward design'. Furthermore, our high-performance RL infrastructure is described in Supplementary Information, section 2.1, ensuring scalable and efficient training.

Specifically, we apply the RL technique on the DeepSeek-V3 Base to train DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During training, we design a straightforward template to require DeepSeek-R1-Zero to first produce a reasoning process, followed by the final answer. The prompt template is written as below.

“A conversation between User and Assistant. The User asks a question and the Assistant solves it. The Assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the User with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think>...</think> and <answer>...</answer> tags, respectively, that is, <think> reasoning process here </think><answer> answer here </answer>. User: prompt. Assistant:”, in which the prompt is replaced with the specific reasoning question during training. We intentionally limit our constraints to this structural format, avoiding any content-specific biases to ensure that we can accurately observe the natural progression of the model during the RL process.

Figure 1a shows the performance trajectory of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) 2024 benchmark throughout the RL training process, in which the average pass@1 score on AIME 2024 shows a marked increase, jumping from an initial value of 15.6% to 77.9%. Also, by using the self-consistency decoding10, the performance of the model can be further improved, achieving an accuracy of 86.7%. This performance greatly surpasses the average performance across all human competitors of the AIME. Besides the maths competitions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 8, DeepSeek-R1-Zero also achieves remarkable performance in coding competitions and graduate-level biology, physics and chemistry problems. These results underscore the effectiveness of RL in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

a, AIME accuracy of DeepSeek-R1-Zero during training. AIME takes a mathematical problem as input and a number as output, illustrated in Extended Data Table 1. pass@1 and cons@16 are described in Supplementary Information, section 4.1. The baseline is the average score achieved by human participants in the AIME competition. b, The average response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero on the training set during the RL process. DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally learns to solve reasoning tasks with more thinking time. Note that a training step refers to a single policy update operation.

As well as the progressive enhancement of reasoning capabilities during training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero also demonstrates self-evolutionary behaviour with RL training. As shown in Fig. 1b, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits a steady increase in thinking time throughout training, driven only by intrinsic adaptation rather than external modifications. Making use of long CoT, the model progressively refines its reasoning, generating hundreds to thousands of tokens to explore and improve its problem-solving strategies.

The increase in thinking time helps with the autonomous development of sophisticated behaviours. Specifically, DeepSeek-R1-Zero increasingly exhibits advanced reasoning strategies such as reflective reasoning and systematic exploration of alternative solutions provided in Extended Data Fig. 1a, substantially boosting its performance on verifiable tasks such as maths and coding. Notably, during training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits an ‘aha moment', shown in Table 1, characterized by a sudden increase in the use of the word ‘wait' during reflections, provided in Extended Data Fig. 1b. This moment marks a distinct change in reasoning patterns and clearly shows the self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero.

The self-evolution of DeepSeek-R1-Zero underscores the power and beauty of RL: rather than explicitly teaching the model how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies. This serves as a reminder of the potential of RL to unlock higher levels of capabilities in LLMs, paving the way for more autonomous and adaptive models in the future.

Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning capabilities, it faces several issues. DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges such as poor readability and language mixing, as DeepSeek-V3 Base is trained on several languages, especially English and Chinese. To address these issues, we develop DeepSeek-R1, whose pipeline is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the initial stage, we collect thousands of cold-start data that exhibit a conversational, human-aligned thinking process, as detailed in Supplementary Information, section 2.3.2. RL training is then applied with hyperparameters in Methods section ‘Training details of the first RL stage', data details in Supplementary Information, section 2.3.1, to improve the model performance with the conversational thinking process and language consistency. Subsequently, we apply rejection sampling and SFT once more. This stage incorporates both reasoning and non-reasoning datasets into the SFT process, as detailed in Supplementary Information, section 2.3.3, enabling the model to not only excel in reasoning tasks but also demonstrate advanced writing capabilities. To further align the model with human preferences, we implement a secondary RL stage designed to enhance the helpfulness and harmlessness of the model while simultaneously refining its reasoning capabilities. The reward model is described in Methods section ‘Reward design' and RL hyperparameters are in Methods section ‘Training details of the second RL stage'. The total training cost is listed in Supplementary Information, section 2.4.4.

A detailed background on DeepSeek-V3 Base and DeepSeek-V3 is provided in Supplementary Information, section 1.1. The models DeepSeek-R1 Dev1, Dev2 and Dev3 represent intermediate checkpoints in this pipeline.

We evaluate our models on MMLU11, MMLU-Redux12, MMLU-Pro13, DROP14, C-Eval15, IFEval16, FRAMES17, GPQA Diamond18, SimpleQA19, C-SimpleQA20, CLUEWSC21, AlpacaEval 2.0 (ref. 22), Arena-Hard23, SWE-bench Verified24, Aider-Polyglot25, LiveCodeBench26 (2024-08–2025-01), Codeforces27, Chinese National High School Mathematics Olympiad (CNMO 2024)28 and AIME 2024 (ref. 29). The details of these benchmarks are provided in Supplementary Tables 15–29.

Table 2 summarizes the performance of DeepSeek-R1 across several developmental stages, as outlined in Fig. 2. A comparison between DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 Dev1 reveals substantial improvements in instruction-following, as evidenced by higher scores on the IF-Eval and Arena-Hard benchmarks. However, owing to the limited size of the cold-start dataset, Dev1 exhibits a partial degradation in reasoning performance compared with DeepSeek-R1-Zero, most notably on the AIME benchmark. By contrast, DeepSeek-R1 Dev2 demonstrates marked performance enhancements on benchmarks that require advanced reasoning skills, including those focused on code generation, mathematical problem solving and STEM-related tasks. Benchmarks targeting general-purpose tasks, such as AlpacaEval 2.0, show marginal improvement. These results indicate that reasoning-oriented RL considerably enhances reasoning capabilities while exerting limited influence on user-preference-oriented benchmarks.

DeepSeek-R1 Dev3 integrates both reasoning and non-reasoning datasets into the SFT pipeline, thereby enhancing the proficiency of the model in both reasoning and general language-generation tasks. Compared with Dev2, DeepSeek-R1 Dev3 achieves notable performance improvements on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Aider-Polyglot, attributable to the inclusion of large-scale non-reasoning corpora and code-engineering datasets. Finally, comprehensive RL training on DeepSeek-R1 Dev3 using mixed reasoning-focused and general-purpose data produced the final DeepSeek-R1. Marginal improvements occurred in code and mathematics benchmarks, as substantial reasoning-specific RL was done in previous stages. The primary advancements in the final DeepSeek-R1 were in general instruction-following and user-preference benchmarks, with AlpacaEval 2.0 improving by 25% and Arena-Hard by 17%.

We also compare DeepSeek-R1 with other models in Supplementary Information, section 4.2. Model safety evaluations are provided in Supplementary Information, section 4.3. A comprehensive analysis of evaluation is provided in Supplementary Information, section 5, including a comparison with DeepSeek-V3, performance evaluations on both fresh test sets, a breakdown of mathematical capabilities by category and an investigation of test-time scaling behaviour. Supplementary Information, section 6 shows that the strong reasoning capability can be transferred to smaller models.

With the advancement in the reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-R1, we deeply recognize the potential ethical risks. For example, R1 can be subject to jailbreak attacks, leading to the generation of dangerous content such as explosive manufacturing plans, whereas the enhanced reasoning capabilities enable the model to provide plans with better operational feasibility and executability. Besides, a public model is also vulnerable to further fine-tuning that could compromise inherent safety protections.

In Supplementary Information, section 4.3, we present a comprehensive safety report from several perspectives, including performance on open-source and in-house safety evaluation benchmarks, and safety levels across several languages and against jailbreak attacks. These comprehensive safety analyses conclude that the inherent safety level of the DeepSeek-R1 model, compared with other state-of-the-art models, is generally at a moderate level (comparable with GPT-4o (2024-05-13)30). Besides, when coupled with the risk control system, the safety level of the model is increased to a superior standard.

We present DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, which rely on large-scale RL to incentivize model reasoning behaviours. Our results demonstrate that pre-trained checkpoints inherently have substantial potential for complex reasoning tasks. We believe that the key to unlocking this potential lies not in large-scale human annotation but in the provision of hard reasoning questions, a reliable verifier and sufficient computational resources for RL. Sophisticated reasoning behaviours, such as self-verification and reflection, seemed to emerge organically during the RL process.

Even if DeepSeek-R1 achieves frontier results on reasoning benchmarks, it still faces several capability limitations, as outlined below.

At present, the structural output capabilities of DeepSeek-R1 remain suboptimal compared with existing models. Moreover, DeepSeek-R1 cannot make use of tools, such as search engines and calculators, to improve the performance of output. However, as it is not hard to build a RL environment for structure output and tool use, we believe that the issue will be addressed in the next version.

Unlike conventional test-time computation scaling approaches, such as majority voting or Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), DeepSeek-R1 dynamically allocates computational resources during inference according to the complexity of the problem at hand. Specifically, it uses fewer tokens to solve simple tasks but generating more tokens for complex tasks. Nevertheless, there remains room for further optimization in terms of token efficiency, as instances of excessive reasoning—manifested as overthinking—are still observed in response to simpler questions.

DeepSeek-R1 is at present optimized for Chinese and English, which may result in language-mixing issues when handling queries in other languages. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 might use English for reasoning and responses, even if the query is in a language other than English or Chinese. We aim to address this limitation in future updates. The limitation may be related to the base checkpoint, DeepSeek-V3 Base, which mainly uses Chinese and English, so that it can achieve better results with the two languages in reasoning.

When evaluating DeepSeek-R1, we observe that it is sensitive to prompts. Few-shot prompting consistently degrades its performance. Therefore, we recommend that users directly describe the problem and specify the output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.

Owing to the long evaluation times, which affect the efficiency of the RL process, large-scale RL has not been applied extensively in software-engineering tasks. As a result, DeepSeek-R1 has not demonstrated a huge improvement over DeepSeek-V3 on software-engineering benchmarks. Future versions will address this by implementing rejection sampling on software-engineering data or incorporating asynchronous evaluations during the RL process to improve efficiency.

Beyond specific capability limitations, the pure RL methodology itself also presents inherent challenges:

The success of pure RL depends on reliable reward signals. In this study, we ensure reward reliability through a reasoning-domain rule-based reward model. However, such dependable reward models are difficult to construct for certain tasks, such as writing. If the reward signal is assigned by a model instead of predefined rules, it becomes more susceptible to exploitation as training progresses, which means that the policy model may find shortcuts to hack the reward model. Consequently, for complex tasks that cannot be effectively evaluated by a reliable reward model, scaling up pure RL methods remains an open challenge.

In this work, for tasks that cannot obtain a reliable signal, DeepSeek-R1 uses human annotation to create supervised data and only conducts RL for hundreds of steps. We hope that, in the future, a robust reward model can be obtained to address such issues.

With the advent of pure RL methods such as DeepSeek-R1, the future holds immense potential for solving any task that can be effectively evaluated by a verifier, regardless of its complexity for humans. Machines equipped with such advanced RL techniques are poised to surpass human capabilities in these domains, driven by their ability to optimize performance iteratively through trial and error. However, challenges remain for tasks for which constructing a reliable reward model is inherently difficult. In such cases, the lack of a robust feedback mechanism may slow progress, suggesting that future research should focus on developing innovative approaches to define and refine reward structures for these complex, less verifiable problems.

Furthermore, making use of tools during the reasoning process holds notable promise. Whether it is using tools such as compilers or search engines to retrieve or compute necessary information or using external tools such as biological or chemical reagents to validate final results in the real world, this integration of tool-augmented reasoning could greatly enhance the scope and accuracy of machine-driven solutions.

GRPO9 is the RL algorithm that we use to train DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. It was originally proposed to simplify the training process and reduce the resource consumption of proximal policy optimization (PPO)31, which is widely used in the RL stage of LLMs32. The pipeline of GRPO is shown in Extended Data Fig. 2.

For each question q, GRPO samples a group of outputs {o1, o2,…, oG} from the old policy \({\pi }_{{\theta }_{{\rm{old}}}}\) and then optimizes the policy model πθ by maximizing the following objective:

in which πref is a reference policy, ϵ and β are hyperparameters and Ai is the advantage, computed using a group of rewards {r1, r2,…, rG} corresponding to the outputs in each group:

We give a comparison of GRPO and PPO in Supplementary Information, section 1.3.

The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the direction of RL optimization. For DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we use rule-based rewards to deliver precise feedback for data in mathematical, coding and logical reasoning domains. For DeepSeek-R1, we extend this approach by incorporating both rule-based rewards for reasoning-oriented data and model-based rewards for general data, thereby enhancing the adaptability of the learning process across diverse domains.

Our rule-based reward system mainly consists of two types of reward: accuracy rewards and format rewards.

Accuracy rewards evaluate whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of maths problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (for example, within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for code competition prompts, a compiler can be used to evaluate the responses of the model against a suite of predefined test cases, thereby generating objective feedback on correctness.

Format rewards complement the accuracy reward model by enforcing specific formatting requirements. In particular, the model is incentivized to encapsulate its reasoning process within designated tags, specifically <think> and </think>. This ensures that the thought process of the model is explicitly delineated, enhancing interpretability and facilitating subsequent analysis.

The accuracy, reward and format reward are combined with the same weight. Notably, we abstain from applying neural reward models—whether outcome-based or process-based-to reasoning tasks. This decision is predicated on our observation that neural reward models are susceptible to reward hacking during large-scale RL. Moreover, retraining such models necessitates substantial computational resources and introduces further complexity into the training pipeline, thereby complicating the overall optimization process.

For general data, we resort to reward models to capture human preferences in complex and nuanced scenarios. We build on the DeepSeek-V3 pipeline and use a similar distribution of preference pairs and training prompts. For helpfulness, we focus exclusively on the final summary, ensuring that the assessment emphasizes the use and relevance of the response to the user while minimizing interference with the underlying reasoning process. For harmlessness, we evaluate the entire response of the model, including both the reasoning process and the summary, to identify and mitigate any potential risks, biases or harmful content that may arise during the generation process.

For helpful reward model training, we first generate preference pairs by prompting DeepSeek-V3 using the Arena-Hard prompt format, listed in Supplementary Information, section 2.2, for which each pair consists of a user query along with two candidate responses. For each preference pair, we query DeepSeek-V3 four times, randomly assigning the responses as either Response A or Response B to mitigate positional bias. The final preference score is determined by averaging the four independent judgments, retaining only those pairs for which the score difference (Δ) exceeds 1 to ensure meaningful distinctions. Furthermore, to minimize length-related biases, we ensure that the chosen and rejected responses of the whole dataset have comparable lengths. In total, we curated 66,000 data pairs for training the reward model. The prompts used in this dataset are all non-reasoning questions and are sourced either from publicly available open-source datasets or from users who have explicitly consented to share their data for the purpose of model improvement. The architecture of our reward model is consistent with that of DeepSeek-R1, with the addition of a reward head designed to predict scalar preference scores.

The helpful reward models were trained with a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 6 × 10−6 and for a single epoch over the training dataset. The maximum sequence length during training is set to 8,192 tokens, whereas no explicit limit is imposed during reward model inference.

To assess and improve model safety, we curated a dataset of 106,000 prompts with model-generated responses annotated as ‘safe' or ‘unsafe' according to predefined safety guidelines. Unlike the pairwise loss used in the helpfulness reward model, the safety reward model was trained using a pointwise methodology to distinguish between safe and unsafe responses. The training hyperparameters are the same as the helpful reward model.

For general queries, each instance is categorized as belonging to either the safety dataset or the helpfulness dataset. The general reward, Rewardgeneral, assigned to each query corresponds to the respective reward defined in the associated dataset.

To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we set the learning rate to 3 × 10−6, the Kullback–Leibler (KL) coefficient to 0.001 and the sampling temperature to 1 for rollout. For each question, we sample 16 outputs with a maximum length of 32,768 tokens before the 8.2k step and 65,536 tokens afterward. As a result, both the performance and response length of DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibit a substantial jump at the 8.2k step, with training continuing for a total of 10,400 steps, corresponding to 1.6 training epochs. Each training step consists of 32 unique questions, resulting in a training batch size of 512 per step. Every 400 steps, we replace the reference model with the latest policy model. To accelerate training, each rollout generates 8,192 outputs, which are randomly split into 16 minibatches and trained for only a single inner epoch.

In the first stage of RL, we set the learning rate to 3 × 10−6, the KL coefficient to 0.001, the GRPO clip ratio ϵ to 10 and the sampling temperature to 1 for rollout. For each question, we sample 16 outputs with a maximum length of 32,768. Each training step consists of 32 unique questions, resulting in a training batch size of 512 per step. Every 400 steps, we replace the reference model with the latest policy model. To accelerate training, each rollout generates 8,192 outputs, which are randomly split into 16 minibatches and trained for only a single inner epoch. However, to mitigate the issue of language mixing, we introduce a language consistency reward during RL training, which is calculated as the proportion of target language words in the CoT.

Although ablation experiments in Supplementary Information, sction 2.6 show that such alignment results in a slight degradation in the performance of the model, this reward aligns with human preferences, making it more readable. We apply the language consistency reward to both reasoning and non-reasoning data by directly adding it to the final reward.

Note that the clip ratio plays a crucial role in training. A lower value can lead to the truncation of gradients for a large number of tokens, thereby degrading the performance of the model, whereas a higher value may cause instability during training. Details of RL data used in this stage are provided in Supplementary Information, section 2.3.

Specifically, we train the model using a combination of reward signals and diverse prompt distributions. For reasoning data, we follow the methodology outlined in DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which uses rule-based rewards to guide learning in mathematical, coding and logical reasoning domains. During the training process, we observe that CoT often exhibits language mixing, particularly when RL prompts involve several languages. For general data, we use reward models to guide training. Ultimately, the integration of reward signals with diverse data distributions enables us to develop a model that not only excels in reasoning but also assigns priority to helpfulness and harmlessness. Given a batch of data, the reward can be formulated as

in which

The second stage of RL retains most of the parameters from the first stage, with the key difference being a reduced temperature of 0.7, as we find that higher temperatures in this stage lead to incoherent generation. The stage comprises a total of 1,700 training steps, during which general instruction data and preference-based rewards are incorporated exclusively in the final 400 steps. We find that more training steps with the model-based preference reward signal may lead to reward hacking, which is documented in Supplementary Information, section 2.5.

a, Frequency of representative reflective terms in model-generated outputs throughout the training process. Reflective terms—including ‘wait', ‘mistake', ‘however', ‘but', ‘retry', ‘error', ‘verify', ‘wrong', ‘evaluate' and ‘check'—were identified and curated by a panel of three human experts. Each expert independently proposed a set of words indicative of reflective reasoning, which were subsequently consolidated through consensus into a final vocabulary list. b, Frequency of the term ‘wait' in model outputs over the course of training. This term was virtually absent during the initial training stages, appeared sporadically between steps 4,000 and 7,000 and exhibited a marked increase in frequency after step 8,000. These trends suggest the emergence of temporal reasoning or self-monitoring behaviour as training progresses.

In the proposed framework, a LLM is used as a policy model to generate responses {o1, o2,…, oG} conditioned on a given query q. Each response within the group is evaluated by a reward model—either learned (model-based) or manually specified (rule-based)—to assign a scalar reward signal. Subsequently, GRPO computes the relative advantages of each group member based on their assigned rewards. Rather than relying on an explicit value function, as in PPO, GRPO directly estimates advantages from the intra-group reward distribution. The policy parameters are then updated to maximize the expected reward while simultaneously minimizing divergence from a reference policy, typically quantified through the KL divergence. By eliminating the need for a separate value network, GRPO offers a simplified yet effective alternative to traditional actor-critic methods such as PPO.

Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) sustained from contact sports are the largest risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)1,2,3,4. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after death and the events that trigger initial hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposition remain unclear2. Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition2, severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE.

Each year, millions of individuals are exposed to RHIs through contact sports, military service and domestic violence. These RHIs are often non-symptomatic and non-concussive, and can occur thousands of times per year, over the course of decades in some cases. CTE, a progressive tauopathy caused by exposure to RHI1,2, is observed in individuals as young as 17. Risk for CTE in exposed individuals is associated with the number of years of exposure to RHI and the cumulative force of the hits endured3,4. Although much of the current research is focused on severe CTE in older individuals, a recent case series of 152 brains from donors under the age of 30 identified 63 brains with CTE, highlighting that RHI-driven disease is a pressing concern in the young population2. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem through identification of p-tau aggregates in neurons around blood vessels at the depth of the cortical sulcus. Our previous research suggests that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation occurs prior to the deposition of p-tau5. Other work has demonstrated that RHI exposure is associated with astrocytic activation, white matter inflammation and damage, blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, serum protein leakage and increases in vascular density in the CTE brain5,6,7,8,9. These cellular changes occur prior to overt neurodegeneration and are likely to drive many of the early clinical impairments that are not explained by the occurrence and extent of p-tau pathology. However, studies examining the full extent of these cellular phenotypes have been limited. A detailed characterization of the early cellular changes in young RHI-exposed athletes is necessary to understand the pathogenic mechanisms in CTE and to identify novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets relevant to early disease stages.

To identify the earliest RHI-driven changes, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using autopsy-confirmed frozen human brain tissue from 28 young individuals. Eight non-RHI-exposed controls, 9 RHI-exposed individuals without CTE pathology (RHI-only) and 11 RHI-exposed individuals with diagnosed CTE stage 1 or 2 (CTE) were included (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Of the individuals with RHI exposure, all but one individual played American football (hereafter referred to as football). The remaining individual played soccer (Supplementary Table 2). CTE diagnosis was performed by a neuropathologist and based on the presence of CTE pathognomonic p-tau lesions10 (Fig. 1b). Grey matter sulcus from the dorsolateral frontal cortex, one of the first brain regions affected in CTE, was processed for snRNA-seq (Fig. 1a). After quality control and filtering, 170,717 nuclei of sufficient quality were clustered into 31 initial clusters and labelled on the basis of their expression of known cell-type markers11,12 (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a–n). All major cell types were identified. Compositional analysis with scCODA demonstrated no significant differences in cell-type abundance across pathological groups13 (Fig. 1d–f and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Out of all major cell types, minimal RHI-associated changes were observed in oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocytes precursor cells (Extended Data Fig. 2b–i), probably resulting from the grey matter focus of the current study. We thus elected to focus further analyses on microglia, astrocytes, endothelial cells and neurons, consistent with previous studies5,7,8,14.

On the basis of previously demonstrated involvement of microglial inflammation in CTE and its important role in neurodegeneration, we examined changes in microglial gene expression5. Analysis of 6,863 microglial cells revealed 11 unique clusters (Fig. 2a). The microglia cluster size is consistent with other published studies and believed to be appropriately powered11. Cluster 10 contained 263 cells and expressed the perivascular macrophage genes CD163, F13A1 and LYVE1, and cluster 6 was composed of 108 cells that expressed the peripheral monocyte genes PTPRC, LYZ and CR1 as previously observed11,15,16 (Fig. 2b).

Clusters 0, 2, 3 and 9 expressed the classical microglial homeostatic genes CX3CR1, P2RY12 and NAV2, and were labelled as homeostatic microglia. Homeostatic clusters were significantly enriched for nuclei from control individuals compared with RHI-only or CTE individuals, but there was no significant difference between RHI-only and CTE individuals (control versus RHI-only: P = 0.048; control versus CTE: P = 0.047; RHI-only versus CTE: P > 0.99; Extended Data Fig. 3a). Homeostatic microglial proportion decreased with increasing years of football play (P = 0.004, β = −12.79). Cluster 7 highly expressed CD83, CCL3 and HSP90AA1, reminiscent of a possible pro-resolving phenotype that was recently identified in Alzheimer's disease17. Cluster 4 had the highest differential gene expression of AIF1 (encoding IBA1) across clusters and was characterized by expression of the iron-associated genes FTL and FTH (also known as FTH1), and ribosome-associated genes such as RPS24 and RPS11 (Fig. 2b).

The proportion of microglial subpopulations found in RHI-only and CTE individuals were significantly different from controls, with the emergence of clusters 1, 5 and 8 in RHI-only and CTE individuals (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). For simplicity, these clusters were labelled RHI microglia (RHIM) 1 to 3. We performed gene module analysis with hdWGCNA and Celda to identify co-expression of possible cellular pathways across subclusters and linear mixed modelling statistical analysis to compare Celda gene module expression (Fig. 2d–l, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 1–3). The full list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene modules can be found in Supplementary Tables 9 and 17. The expression of homeostasis-associated gene modules was significantly decreased in RHIM2 and RHIM3 (Fig. 2g).

Cluster 5, RHIM1, expressed neuronal-associated genes such as GRID2, GRIK2 and GRIA4, with top identified Gene Ontology (GO) terms including ‘synapse organization' (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3g). Previous work has found that satellite microglia (microglia that closely contact neurons) increase in number following TBI and modulate neuronal firing activity18.

Cluster 1, RHIM2, was nearly evenly enriched for RHI and CTE samples (50% versus 46%, respectively), whereas cluster 8, RHIM3, were mostly enriched for CTE samples (83%). Transcriptionally, RHIM2 and RHIM3 were similar, displaying features of an inflammatory microglial phenotype with expression of SPP1, HIF1A, TLR2, IL1B and CTSB (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). SPP1 has been described as a general marker of inflammatory or activated microglia, and has a potential role in synaptic engulfment in Alzheimer's disease models19. SPP1 has also been described as an opsin for extracellular debris20,21. hdWGCNA module analyses identified gene sets that were enriched in RHIM2 and RHIM3 that were strongly associated with immune signalling (Fig. 2e,f). Further GO analysis of RHIM2 and RHIM3 DEGs identified ‘cytokine signalling in the immune system', ‘positive regulation of immune response' and ‘vesicle mediated transport' (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Celda gene module analysis demonstrated an increase in inflammation, hypoxia and metabolic response in RHIM2 and RHIM3 compared with homeostasis clusters (Fig. 2h–l), providing orthogonal validation of GO and DEG analyses.

Some key differences were noted between RHIM2 and RHIM3. RHIM2 expressed C1QA, C1QB, C1QC and CAMK2D, which encode the components and downstream effector of the C1q complement cascade that is known to drive aberrant synaptic engulfment in the neurodegenerative brain22 (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3f). Gene module analysis further highlighted an increase in complement response in RHIM2 compared with homeostatic microglia (Fig. 2h). RHIM3 was characterized by upregulation of HIF1A and VEGFA, two central mediators of hypoxia, suggesting a potential response to or initiation of hypoxic conditions following RHI (Extended Data Fig. 3f). HIF1A also acts as a transcriptional regulator of many downstream inflammatory genes, and analysis of the transcriptional regulatory networks enriched in each cluster showed that RHIM3 expressed many genes regulated by HIF1A23 (Extended Data Fig. 3h).

To validate the reduction in the homeostatic microglial population, IBA1 and P2RY12 were co-immunolabelled and quantified in the sulcus of 35 individuals with 0 to 25 years of football play with or without CTE. Microglia were divided according to high or low P2RY12 expression. Homeostatic microglial densities (P2RY12hiIBA1+) were significantly decreased with increasing years of football play (P < 0.001; Fig. 2m,n). Concurrently, non-homeostatic microglia (P2YR12lowIBA1+) cells were positively correlated with increasing years of football play (P < 0.001; Extended Data Fig. 3k,o). Mirroring the snRNA-seq results, CTE status was not significantly associated with homeostatic microglial densities when years of exposure were accounted for.

To verify the presence of RHIM2 and RHIM3 cells and their relationship to pathology, we performed in situ hybridization to label microglia that express the RHIM2 and RHIM3 marker genes SPP1 and HIF1A (Fig. 2o). P2RY12 was used as a marker for microglia as AIF1 (encoding IBA1) exhibits low expression at the mRNA level, as evidenced in a previous study23 and the present snRNA-seq data. We quantified SPP1-expressing and HIF1A-expressing (SPP1+HIF1A+) microglia across 21 individuals with 2–25 years of football play with and without CTE (Fig. 2p,q). The number of SPP1+HIF1A+ microglia in the cortical sulcus increased significantly with increasing years of football play (P = 0.028; Fig. 2p). There was no association between SPP1+HIF1A+ microglia in the nearby cortical crest, suggesting a regional specificity of this inflammatory phenotype (P = 0.53; Extended Data Fig. 3l). We determined the layer specificity of SPP1+HIF1A+ microglia, separating superficial and deep layers of the cortical sulcus. The number of SPP1+HIF1A+ microglia increased in both superficial layers 2–3 (P = 0.039) and deeper layers 4–6 (P = 0.026) (Extended Data Fig. 3m,n). This suggests that although the microglial inflammation is specific to the sulcus, there was no layer-wise specificity of this phenotype. Additionally, microglia increased expression of SPP1 with increasing years of football play (P = 0.035; Fig. 2q). CTE status (P = 0.34) and tau burden (P = 0.12) did not associate with the prevalence of SPP1+HIF1A+ microglia.

Next, we sought to compare our microglial populations to those described in published datasets; notably, Sun et al.23 published a dataset with more than 100,000 microglia from more than 400 individuals. First, we performed Jaccard similarity scoring and confirmed significant correlation of the RHIM2 and RHIM3 clusters with inflammatory, stress, phagocytic and glycolysis-associated gene sets23 (Extended Data Fig. 3i,j). Next, we projected our data onto the dataset and performed bootstrapping to predict labels and confidence scores to better analyse the consistency of subtypes (Extended Data Fig. 5). Overall, we observed significant similarity between select subpopulations, further validating our subtypes.

Overall, these results suggest that RHI exposure induces an increase in neuronal surveillance and inflammatory microglial transcriptomic states before the onset of CTE. Inflammatory microglia are localized specifically at the sulcus in RHI-exposed individuals. These microglia may be involved in the initiation and maintenance of neuronal dysfunction, inflammation and angiogenic processes that are present in CTE.

Astrocytes have a key role in brain homeostasis in tasks such as neuronal and BBB maintenance and become reactive following RHI exposure and in neurodegenerative disease14,24. We identified four subtypes of astrocytes, Astro1–Astro4, based on stratification of pathological group identity, DEG analysis and gene module analysis (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Figs. 5–7 and Supplementary Tables 10 and 19). Each subtype was also confirmed to be expressed in the cortical grey matter (Extended Data Fig. 6i). Although past work has suggested the importance of astrocytes in CTE, we observed a limited astrocytic response, with only one subtype being enriched for individuals with RHI (Astro3). Genes and gene modules that were upregulated in Astro3 were associated with astrocyte reactivity (CHI3L1, CD44, CLU and BCL6), inflammation (IL6R and IL1R1) and angiogenesis (HIF1A, NRP1 and ANGPTL4) (Extended Data Fig. 6h). These findings suggest that although there is pronounced astrogliosis associated with end-stage CTE pathology, astrocytes might have a more subtle role in early disease.

Next, owing to the key involvement of vascular dysfunction in CTE, we characterized the vascular response to RHI exposure8,9 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). We used known cell-type markers and comparison with published dataset markers to identify 1,762 endothelial cells, 913 pericytes, 487 fibroblasts and 651 vascular smooth muscle cells25 (Extended Data Fig. 7b,c,e). Of these cell types, only fibroblasts displayed significant changes in total proportion across pathological groups, decreasing from controls to RHI (P = 0.048) and CTE (P = 0.027), with loss associated with years of football play (Extended Data Fig. 7d,f). Endothelial cells were further labelled for arterial, venous and capillary cells by comparing expressed genes with published datasets25 (Extended Data Fig. 7c,e). Capillary cells were then labelled Cap1–Cap4. Cap3 and Cap4 (Seurat Cluster 5; Extended Data Fig. 7b,c) exhibited a slightly different transcriptomic profile with higher expression of collagen-associated genes and showed overlap in expression of pericyte genes, thereby representing a potential transitional cell state but with greatest fidelity to endothelial cell expression (Extended Data Fig. 7c,e).

The proportion of endothelial cell subtypes differed significantly between RHI and control individuals and trended towards a difference between control and CTE individuals (Fig. 3a,b). No difference was observed between RHI and CTE individuals (Fig. 3b). Two populations of capillary cells, Cap2 (P = 0.0043) and Cap4 (P = 0.0046) were enriched for RHI and CTE samples (Extended Data Fig. 7h). The Cap2 cell fraction also increased with increasing years of football play (P = 0.014; Extended Data Fig. 7j). No differences were observed in total capillary cells in RHI and CTE compared with controls (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Several canonical angiogenesis-associated genes such as HIF1A, ANGPT2, ANGPTL4, STAT3, CAMK2D and NFKBID were significantly upregulated in Cap2 and Cap4, suggesting that capillary cells in RHI-exposed groups may be responding to a local hypoxic environment (Fig. 3c,d). Three major complement regulatory genes—CD59, CD55 and CD46—which inhibit complement-mediated cell lysis, were upregulated indicating a potential response to locally increased levels of complement (Fig. 3c). Expression of the vascular adhesion and transmigration-associated genes ICAM1, ICAM2, PECAM1 and CD99 was increased in Cap2 and Cap4, indicating an increased potential for entry of monocytes, T cells, neutrophils or other peripheral cell types across the endothelium (Fig. 3c). Cap4 also exhibited high expression of collagen genes (Fig. 3c). We performed module co-expression analysis using Celda and hdWGCNA to identify co-expressed genes and possible cellular pathways across endothelial subsets (Supplementary Figs. 8–10). Statistical linear mixed modelling demonstrated that modules related to immune signalling, angiogenesis, response to growth factors and collagen were significantly upregulated in Cap2 and Cap4 subsets (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 11 and 18). hdWGCNA also identified enrichment of collagen-associated genes in Cap4 as additional validation (Supplementary Table 18c and Supplementary Fig. 9, blue module). GO analysis identified VEGFA signalling, cytokine signalling and vasculature development as significantly upregulated terms in RHI-exposed endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 7i). We identified ITGAV as an endothelial gene that was significantly increased in Cap2 cells and in RHI compared with control and CTE samples (Fig. 3e). To confirm its expression in the tissue, we performed in situ hybridization paired with GLUT1 immunohistochemistry to label vessels, and found an increase in the fraction of vessels expressing ITGAV with increasing years of football play (P = 0.027; Fig. 3f,g). Together, these data show that capillary cells undergo significant upregulation of angiogenesis and inflammation-associated genes along with an increase in basement membrane components, identifying pathways that may underlie the known microvascular dysfunction after RHI and in CTE8,9.

Next, owing to the known dysfunction and degeneration of neurons and synaptic dysfunction following head trauma and in neurodegenerative disease, we examined neurons, labelling subclusters using known layer-specific markers12,26,27,28,29,30,31 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8). Forty-seven per cent of excitatory neuron DEGs were shared across RHI and CTE when compared with control, and only 6% were different between RHI and CTE, suggesting that the greatest changes in excitatory neuronal transcriptional profiles occur with initial exposure to RHI (Fig. 4b). Comparison of gene expression in RHI and CTE with controls and GO analysis of total neuronal population and layer-specific DEGs showed enrichment of ‘modulation of chemical synapses' and ‘cell–cell adhesion' processes in both analyses (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 9b). Genes associated with synaptic transmission such as SYN3, SNAP91, NRG1, HSP12A1 (a member of the Hsp70 gene family), and genes encoding matrix binding proteins such as CNTN5 and CLSTN2 were upregulated across several excitatory neuron layers. There were 40% fewer layer-specific DEGs in inhibitory neurons than in excitatory neurons, with only 184 DEGs specific to RHI-exposed groups compared with controls. GO analysis of inhibitory neuron layer-specific DEGs showed common upregulation of synapse-associated genes such as SYN3 and SYN2 across layers and downregulation of GABA receptor gene GABRA1 (Extended Data Fig. 9c).

Since neurodegenerative processes and exposure to head trauma can be associated with neuronal loss, we investigated layer-specific cell composition in individuals with RHI and CTE compared with controls. No pathological group enrichment was found in inhibitory neurons (Extended Data Fig. 9e,f). However, differential abundance analysis of excitatory layer 2/3 CUX2+LAMP5+ neurons demonstrated a significant decrease in individuals with a history of RHI, regardless of CTE status (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 9d). These results were confirmed via multinomial Dirichlet multinomial regression to account for the compositional nature of snRNA-seq data13. RHI exposure individuals had an average of 56% fewer CUX2+LAMP5+ neurons than age-matched unexposed controls. When measured by proportion of total neurons, loss of CUX2+LAMP5+ neurons were also observed when comparing RHI (P = 0.0045) and CTE (P = 0.0269) individuals with controls (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Neuronal loss was associated with the number of years of playing football, or in the few cases with other types of contact sports play, total years of RHI exposure, independent of age at death (P < 0.001; Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 10a).

To determine the spatial localization of the neuronal loss and validate the snRNA-seq results, we performed quantitative histology with RNAScope in situ hybridization using the excitatory layer 2/3 neuron markers CUX2 and LAMP5. CUX2+LAMP5+ neuronal density at the sulcus was negatively associated with years of football play (P = 0.007, β = −4.92) and highest level of football played (P = 0.033, β = −25.34) (Fig. 4e,g and Extended Data Fig. 10b). CUX2+LAMP5+ cell density was significantly lower at the depth of the cortical sulcus compared with the nearby gyral crest, consistent with RHI-specific damage and CTE pathology32 (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). CUX2+LAMP5+ cell densities at the crest were not associated with years of play, demonstrating a regional specificity of neuronal cell loss to the sulcus (P = 0.686; Extended Data Fig. 10e). CUX2+LAMP5− (putatively CUX2+COL5A2+) neurons were found intermixed with CUX2+LAMP5+ neurons throughout layers 2–4 and are putatively exposed to similar levels of mechanical forces due to adjacent anatomical location. However, neuronal loss was observed to be specific to CUX2+LAMP5+ excitatory neurons across in situ and snRNA-seq experiments, suggesting a specific susceptibility of this population to RHI exposure (Extended Data Fig. 10f).

To further validate the association between years of football play and neuronal loss, we determined total neuronal densities using Nissl staining of 86 young individuals with 0–28 years of football play. Individuals were grouped by 0, 1–4, 5–14 and 15 or more years of football play based on previously defined thresholds for CTE risk3. Layer 2/3 sulcal neuronal density significantly decreased with increased binned years of football play, independent of age at death (P = 0.028, β = −13.09; Fig. 4h,i). No association was found between years of football play and neuronal densities in deeper layers 4–6 (P = 0.554) or in layer 2/3 (0.571) in the crest (Extended Data Fig. 10g,h,k,l).

As p-tau deposition has been shown to associate with neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease, we compared neuronal densities with p-tau pathology in adjacent sections. We found no association between neuronal loss and p-tau deposition, suggesting that neuronal loss occurs prior to and independent of pathologic protein deposition in early stages of disease (in situ hybridization: P = 0.387; Nissl staining: P = 0.825; Extended Data Fig. 10i,j).

Microglia contribute and respond to neuronal loss33. To investigate potential relationships between the observed neuronal loss and loss of microglial homeostasis, layer-wise homeostatic microglial populations (P2RY12hiIBA1+) from adjacent histological sections were compared to neuronal densities. Neuronal densities were significantly positively associated with homeostatic microglial populations in layers 2/3 (P = 0.047, β = 0.126; Extended Data Fig. 3p). By contrast, in layer 4–6 neuronal densities were not associated with homeostatic microglia populations (P = 0.105; Extended Data Fig. 3p), suggesting that loss of microglial homeostasis may be specifically localized to regions of neuronal loss.

Overall, these results provide evidence that exposure to RHI alone may drive significant neuronal loss and dysfunction, which may help explain early symptom onset in young athletes without the presence of significant p-tau pathology. Additionally, the relationship between neuronal loss and loss of microglial homeostasis point to potential mechanisms of or responses to neuronal loss.

To identify signalling pathways that may be involved in the cellular response to RHI exposure and CTE pathology, we performed ligand–receptor pair analysis using MultiNicheNet34. Two comparisons were run: RHI was compared with control (Fig. 5a, labelled RHI) to examine signalling occurring in the context of head trauma; and CTE was compared with RHI (Fig. 5a, labelled CTE) to investigate what signalling might be involved in the deposition of p-tau. In RHI-exposed individuals, microglial TGFB1 was identified as an important ligand, which signals to endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons and other microglia through the TGFB1 receptors ITGAV, TGFBR2, TGFBR3 and TGFBR1. SIGLEC9 and SPP1 were also identified as major signalling hubs in RHI compared with control, implicating the RHIM2/3 phenotype in RHI-associated signalling. In CTE compared with RHI, the top microglial signalling pathways identified also included TGFB1 signalling and WNT2B and HLA-DRA signalling to astrocyte, microglia, endothelial cells and excitatory neurons. TGFB1 signalling has previously been implicated in the activation of neuroinflammation and induction of neuronal cell death in mild TBI35. Additionally, TGFB1 is involved with the fibrogenic response to mechanical stretch stimulus through ITGAV activation on endothelial cells and angiogenic responses through TGFBR2 signalling36,37.

We performed in situ hybridization analysis to label TGFB1 in microglia, as well as TGFBR2 and ITGAV, which encode two of the receptors identified in endothelial cells ligand–receptor pair analysis (Fig. 5b). We hypothesized that TGFB1+ microglia would increase in proximity to ITGAV+TGFBR2+ vessels to facilitate signalling. The prevalence of TGFB1-expressing microglia did not increase with the level of exposure (P = 0.493) or with CTE status (P = 0.493), however, we found an increase in ITGAV+TGFBR2+ vessels with increasing years of football play and with CTE status (P = 0.047) (Fig. 5c–e). Additionally, there was an increase in TGFB1+ microglia within 25 μm of ITGAV+TGFBR2+ vessels in CTE individuals compared with RHI-exposed individuals without CTE (Fig. 5f). The increase in microglia–endothelial cell pairs is likely to be driven by an increase in endothelial ITGAV and TGFBR2 expression as opposed to an increase in TGFB1+ microglia, concurring with data from the microglia and endothelial sections. We then compared the prevalence of ITGAV+TGFBR2+ vessels to CUX2+LAMP5+ neuronal populations in adjacent sections to identify potential relationships between the identified signalling pathway and the observed neuronal loss. We found that with decreasing neuronal populations in the grey matter sulcus, there was an increase in ITGAV+TGFBR2+ vessels (P = 0.010) (Fig. 5g). Overall, these findings identify a possible signalling pathway in the microglia–endothelial cell cross talk that may be implicated in the early pathological cascade of CTE pathology.

Here we utilize a combination of snRNA-seq, multiplex in situ hybridization and immunohistological analyses to describe and validate a unique dataset of young individuals with exposure to RHI. We describe distinct microglial and endothelial subsets that emerge following RHI and persist with CTE, correlate with years of contact sport play and associate with neuronal loss. Additionally, we observed a sulcus-specific loss of cortical layer 2/3 neurons that correlated with exposure to RHI prior to p-tau deposition. Finally, we identify a possible TGFβ signalling cascade between microglia and endothelial that might drive early pathogenesis.

Microglial, astrocytic and endothelial cell transcriptomic subtypes have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases and in severe traumatic brain injury, however to our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate such changes in a cohort of young individuals with exposure to repeated non-concussive head impacts. Of note, hypoxia-associated changes are present across these three cell types, suggesting an important role for vascular dysfunction and bolstering previous evidence of vascular remodelling in CTE. Forces from head trauma disproportionately affect blood vessels, causing a lasting endothelial response that affects BBB integrity and oxygen delivery in affected regions32. Activated endothelium, local hypoxia and a breached BBB may trigger a feedback loop, activating astrocytes and microglia with each head impact. Repeated blows to the head in short succession are likely to reactivate an already inflamed system, disallowing sufficient time for full repair, and preventing a return to homeostasis. This is substantiated by the increased microglial activation that is observed decades after retirement from contact sports and is found to correlate with the number of years of RHI exposure in this study and others5. Through this repetitive reactivation, the inflammatory response becomes self-sustaining and chronic, the mechanisms of which remain unclear. Another potential mechanism identified in this study included increased collagen expression in endothelial cells, a potential indicator of an early endothelial fibrotic response. The TGFB1–ITGAV/TGFBR2 signalling between microglia and endothelial cells that we identified through ligand–receptor analysis may represent a potential signalling pathway for the observed endothelial activation.

We observed an approximately 56% decrease in superficial layer 2/3 excitatory neurons in RHI-exposed individuals at the depths of the cortical sulci, the region known to sustain the most mechanical force upon head trauma, and the region of initial p-tau accumulation in CTE32. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate such a substantial loss of a specific neuronal subtype in young individuals driven solely by RHI exposure. This is especially concerning considering that several of the observed individuals had no neuropathologic protein deposition, suggesting that neurodegeneration might begin sooner than CTE onset. Recent studies have demonstrated cortical thinning in frontal regions of high school football players, and cortical thinning and neuronal loss in post-mortem individuals with CTE38,39. Neuronal loss might explain symptoms of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, the clinical criteria for antemortem CTE diagnosis, in young athletes2,40,41. Layer 2/3 neurons make cortico-cortical connections and, in the frontal cortex, are associated with depressive behaviours and moderation of stress42. Notably, layer 2/3 neurons have been shown to be vulnerable in other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders and are susceptible to p-tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease12,27. Therefore, one may speculate that superficial layer 2/3 excitatory neurons are highly susceptible to damage regardless of source and our data captured the loss across a range of RHI doses. Vulnerability has been hypothesized to be caused by the longer projections being more susceptible to trauma-related diffuse axonal injury or the overall higher metabolic demand of these cells, however the exact mechanisms driving this susceptibility have yet to be explained. Although RHI damage is driving the early neuronal loss, it is likely that as p-tau deposition becomes more severe, neuronal death and dysfunction will become more related to pathogenic protein accumulation.

One limitation of our study is the small amount of tissue in each sample. CTE is an inherently patchy disease, which is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of a pathognomonic CTE lesion consisting of a focus of perivascular p-tau accumulation at the depth of the cortical sulcus. It is therefore possible that sampling may have missed regions of important cellular responses. Future studies of RHI-exposed individuals should aim to sample from multiple areas of the brain to improve detection of cellular responses. Similarly, owing to the limited availability of donated samples from individuals under the age of 50, the current sample size is not as large as those in other recent snRNA-seq studies that might have 100 or more cases. However, as long as expression differences are robust and consistent, as observed in this study, disease-specific effects can be identified with smaller sample sizes43. However, follow-up studies to increase the sample size could help identify additional cellular heterogeneity and enhance the resolution of more subtle changes. Finally, owing to the inherent difficulties in acquiring non-disease, non-RHI-exposed post-mortem samples from young humans, some control cases included in the Nissl quantification were from female donors, which may complicate direct comparisons with samples from male athletes. However, we found no statistical correlation between sex and neuronal density.

These results highlight the growing concerns linked to long-term RHI exposure from contact sports. The data presented here provide direct evidence demonstrating that RHI-driven cellular perturbations occur prior to the development of CTE and can be observed in young individuals, many of whom exhibit no obvious brain pathology. Novel biomarkers and therapeutic interventions will be vital in identifying the early changes observed in contact sport athletes prior to developing neurodegeneration.

Brain tissue was obtained from the CTE and the National Center for PTSD Brain Banks. Identical intake and tissue processing procedures occur with both brain banks. Four controls included in Nissl quantification were provided by the Iowa Neuropathology Resource Laboratory. Neuropathological examination was performed by board certified neuropathologists as described previously10,44. Diagnosis of CTE was determined using published consensus criteria10,44. Demographics such as athletic history, military history, traumatic brain injury history, and RHI history were queried during telephone interview with next of kin as detailed previously10,44. Institutional review board approval for brain donation and informed consent for research was obtained through the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease and CTE Center, Human Subjects Institutional Review Board of the Boston University School of Medicine, and VA Boston Healthcare System (Boston, MA). Individuals were included in the snRNA-seq and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) experiments based on frozen tissue availability, quality (RNA integrity number (RIN) > 4) and diagnosis. Those used for immunohistochemistry were included based on the same criteria except frozen tissue availability and RIN. Exclusion criteria included neuropathological diagnosis other than CTE, moderate to severe traumatic brain injury directly prior to death, age of death greater than 51 or less than 25. Control cases did not have exposure to any RHI, were negative for any neurodegenerative disease, and did not carry any diagnosis of a neuropsychological disorder.

Fresh frozen brain tissue was collected from the dorsolateral frontal cortex of each donor at the depth of the cortical sulcus. Visual delineation of grey and white matter was used to collect 50 mg of grey matter tissue. Tissue was processed and cleaned of white matter prior to homogenization at two levels. First, when removing samples from frozen coronal slabs, the unbiased technician visually inspected and avoided white matter that could be adjacent to target grey matter. Second, immediately before tissue homogenization, a second technician inspects the tissue and removes any remaining white matter. This preparation allows for a highly specific grey matter enrichment. Nuclei isolation and sorting were performed on two donor samples per day, randomizing for diagnosis and age. Tissue was kept on ice throughout nuclei isolation. Tissue was homogenized and lysed in NST Buffer with DAPI (146 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM CaCl2, 21 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% NP-40, 40 U ml−1 Protector RNase Inhibitor and DAPI) and snipped with scissors on ice for 10 min. Debris was removed using a 70-μm filter. Cells were spun down and resuspended in nuclei storage buffer (2% BSA, 400 U ml−1 Protector RNase Inhibitor) to reach a concentration of 500–1,000 nuclei per μl. Nuclei were purified for DAPI-positive cells with a FACS Aria flow cytometer to remove debris and processed using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagents Kit V2 (10x Genomics) to create cDNA libraries. Samples were pooled in two batches sequenced with Azenta to a read depth of 30,000 reads per cell on an Illumina NovaSeq.

CellRanger v.6.0.1 was used to align reads to the GRCH38 reference and generate filtered count matrices containing 233,555 cells across all samples. The runCellQC function in the singleCellTK R package was used to generate quality control metrics and doublet calls45,46. Contamination from ambient RNA was identified using decontx using the full raw matrix as the ‘background' for each sample47. Nuclei were removed if they had ambient RNA contamination fraction greater than 0.3, mitochondrial or ribosomal percentage greater than 5%, total counts less than 750, or genes detected less than 500. The data were not down sampled to maximize capture of rare populations. The Seurat workflow within the singleCellTK package was used for clustering starting with the decontaminated counts from decontx48. In brief, the data were normalized and scaled using runSeuratNormalizeData and runSeuratScaleData. Highly variable genes were identified using runSeuratFindHVG with the method vst. Principal components were determined using runSeuratPCA. UMAP dimensionality reduction was calculated using runSeuratUMAP. Clusters across all cell types were identified using the runSeuratFindClusters function at a resolution of 0.3. After initial clustering all the cells, clusters that were predominantly doublets (>50%) were removed and produced the final dataset of 170,717 nuclei (Extended Data Fig. 1h–k). Associations with post-mortem interval (PMI), age at death and sequencing batch were performed using Pearson's correlation analysis in R (Supplementary Fig. 4). Age at death was associated with only excitatory neuron L5_FEZF2_PCP4_RPRM and inhibitory neuron PVALB_SCUBE_PTPRK proportions. Therefore, age was not included in regressions performed with sequencing data. PMI correlated with only one microglial subtype (RHIM1), perivascular macrophages, an excitatory neuron subtype (L2_4CUX2_COL5A2) and several oligodendrocyte subtypes. Sequencing batch was associated with one cluster of OPCs and was therefore not included in analyses.

All GO analysis was performed using MetaScape default settings49. DEG lists for all comparisons available in Supplementary Tables 6–16.

Cell-type markers verified by previous human snRNA-seq studies were used to identify clusters that belonged to individual cell types (Extended Data Fig. 1m,n). Cell types were subsetted out using subsetSCEColData and reclustered by the same Seurat method described above with the addition of running Harmony to account for sample-to-sample variability50. Clusters expressing high levels of >1 cell-type marker were removed. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons identified from the full dataset were clustered together to determine neuronal subtypes. Four clusters (1, 2, 19 and 21) were found to express low levels of neuronal genes and astrocytic genes (SLC1A2 and SLC1A3), and were single-batch enriched (80–90%) therefore these clusters were not included in downstream analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8a–d).

Gene co-expression modules were identified using Celda51. Celda utilized Bayesian hierarchical linear mixed effects models to identify modules of genes that are expressed together. A workflow overview can be found in Extended Data Fig. 4. Celda was run on cellular subtypes to determine module scores on a cell-wise basis and plotted across cellular subtypes. Statistical analysis of module enrichment was performed using a linear mixed effects model using sample ID as a covariate. For microglia, cell subtypes were compared to homeostatic microglia as a baseline, for endothelial cells Cap1 was used, for astrocytes Astro1 (homeostatic astrocytes) were used as a baseline. Celda module analysis was plotted as Violin plots as these types of plots demonstrate statistical differences and also allow for visualization of the variance within the data (Supplementary Figs. 1, 7, 8). Additionally, to help further validate findings, radar plots for each Celda module were also provided to help visualize module distribution among all groups (Supplementary Figs. 3, 5 and 10).

hdWGCNA (v.0.4.5) was also run to validate gene co-expression modules in astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells. The hdWGCNA workflow was run with default parameters except min_cells was set to 25 and k was set to 10 for the metacells analysis performed by the MetacellsByGroups function. Additionally, minModuleSize was set to 25 in the ConstructNetwork function for astrocytes and microglia. Radar plots were provided to demonstrate cell-type distribution. Metascape49 was used to generate GO analyses for Fig. 2f. Statistics for GO were generated with GSEA and single-tailed hypergeometric test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction.

hdWGCNA and Celda Modules were compared against each other for further validation. All major modules of interest could be observed in both module analyses (Supplementary Figs. 2c, 6d and 9d). The discrepancy between module numbers with hdWGCNA and Celda was the result of how each technique process data. Celda clusters every gene into a module, in contrast to hdWGCNA that does not. Celda also captures modules that are broadly expressed across many clusters rather than modules only expressed in small numbers of clusters. Biological function of each module was assessed with the EnrichR package to validate functional significance. Finally, in order to efficiently run hdWCGNA on single cell data, a prior step must be performed that reduces the cells to ‘metacells'. According the hdWGCNA tutorial, “metacell aggregation approach does not yield good results for extremely underrepresented cell types”, which probably also contributes to the reduced module number. Although module numbers may differ, important modules of interest were preserved through both datasets.

All module genes and statistical analysis can be viewed in Supplementary Tables 17–19, analysis code is available on GitHub at www.github.com/morganebutler/singleCellScripts.

The Sun et al. dataset23 was downloaded from https://compbio.mit.edu/microglia_states/. Another Sun et al.25 dataset was downloaded at http://compbio.mit.edu/scADbbb/. For the microglia, bootstrapping was performed by randomly sampling 80% of the Sun dataset with replacement for 50 iterations. For each iteration, FindTransferAnchors from the Seurat package was used to project the current microglia dataset onto the Sun UMAP space, and MapQuery to predict microglia labels. Label calls were recorded for each iteration and the label consistency was reported as the percentage of iterations the same label was called in Extended Data Fig. 5d,e.

For Visium projection of astrocyte subtype genes, publicly available Visium data from human cortex (Adult Human Brain 1) were downloaded from the 10x Genomics website. The Seurat function AddModuleScore was used to create a per-spot score for astrocyte subtype gene expression (significantly upregulated genes in each subtype). Plots were created with SpatialFeaturePlot and displayed in Extended Data Fig. 6i.

Ligand–receptor pair analysis was performed using MultiNicheNet, an adaptation of nichenet that allows for comparison across more than two condition groups. In brief, this method uses known datasets of ligand–receptor pairs and their downstream targets to identify potentially upregulated cell signalling pathways across cell types accounting for differential expression of genes across groups. MultiNicheNet also uses prioritization of top ligand–receptor pairs to help identify signalling pathways of interest. Contrasts for differential gene expression were set as RHI versus control, and CTE versus RHI to determine RHI and CTE-specific signalling pathways. Finalized cell-type objects were combined and run through the MultiNicheNet pipeline with the exclusion of T cells due to low cell numbers. Analysis was performed without alteration to publicly available code, save for the contrasts used.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was sectioned and labelled as described52. In brief, 10-μm sections were allowed to dry, baked, dewaxed and rehydrated prior to antibody labelling. For immunofluorescent staining, epitope retrieval was performed using a pH 6 or pH 9 buffer and boiling for 15 min in the microwave. Sections were blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 3% donkey serum and primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 4) were conjugated for 1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were conjugated for 30 min, and Opal TSA dyes were incubated for 10 min. Slides were coverslipped with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) and imaged at 20× or 40× on a Vectra Polaris whole-slide scanner with the appropriate filters. Images were spectrally unmixed using inForm software prior to image analysis. For Nissl staining, sections were hydrated and stained in 0.01% thionin for 20–40 s and dehydrated back to xylene before coverslipping in Permount mounting media and imaging on an Aperio GT450 scanner at 40×. As formalin-fixed histologic tissue was more readily available than frozen samples, more samples could be utilized for immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization experiments. A full list of samples that were included in each immunohistochemistry experiment is shown in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

Tissue was embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature medium (Sakura Tissue-Tek) and was brought to cryostat temperature (−20 °C) before cutting. Chuck temperature was raised to −12°/−10 °C for optimal cutting conditions. Tissue was sectioned at 16 µm thickness onto Fisher SuperFrost slides. Direction of tissue orientation relative to the depth of the cortical sulcus was randomized across samples. Sections were fixed in cold 4 °C 10% neutral buffered formalin for 60 min and dehydrated in 50%, 70%, 100% and 100% ethanol for 5 min each at room temperature. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was performed using RNAScope kits (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) (Supplementary Table 5) optimized on the Leica BOND Rx automated slide staining system. Slides were pretreated with protease for 15 min. Opal TSA dyes were used for visualization at a concentration of 1:300–1:500. A positive and negative control probe was run for each block before staining with targeted probes. For immunohistochemical codetection of p-tau and GLUT1, sections were run through the RNAScope protocol as described and then manually stained with the AT8 or GLUT1 antibody (Supplementary Table 4) with the immunohistochemical protocol described in ‘Histological analysis' without the antigen retrieval. Samples included in each smFISH experiment are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Not all samples were used across every smFISH experiment due to exhaustion of sample blocks.

Analysis of fluorescent RNAScope fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in Indica Labs HALO using the FISH v.3.2.3 algorithm or the FISH-IF v.2.2.5 algorithm. Thresholds for FISH probe positivity for was set manually for each probe (HIF1A, SPP1, P2RY12, ITGAV, TGFB1, TGFBR2, LAMP5 and CUX2) and kept consistent across samples. It should be noted that SPP1 is not exclusively expressed by microglia, and DEG analysis demonstrated that only oligodendrocytes showed elevated expression of SPP1 in our dataset (Supplementary Table 6b). However, colocalization with microglia markers allows for a microglia-specific count of SPP1 activity. Gene expression was determined by the ‘probe cell intensity' in HALO because this measure is agnostic to manual single copy intensity settings. The background on GLUT1 staining in FISH sections was variable due to protease treatment from RNAScope and thresholds were manually adjusted to remove background staining. Vessel proximity analysis was performed by evaluating TGFB1+P2RY12+ cells and GLUT1+ITGAV+TGFBR2+ cells and using the ‘proximity analysis' algorithm in the HALO spatial analysis settings. The number of unique marker-positive microglia/vessel pairs within 25 µm were evaluated. Density heat maps for CUX2+LAMP5+ staining were created using the ‘density heatmap' function within HALO spatial analysis. Depiction of how the sulcus and crest were annotated can be found in Extended Data Fig. 10d. To validate consistency between image analyses methods and snRNA-seq results, seven samples that were included in both RNAScope and snRNA-seq methods were compared and cellular proportions of CUX2+LAMP5+ neurons significantly correlated (P = 0.02; Extended Data Fig. 10c).

Analysis of immunohistochemistry protein staining was performed using the HALO Object Colocalization v.2.1.4 and HighPlex v.4.3.2 algorithm. Microglial P2RY12 was assessed by DAPI+IBA1+ nuclei and P2RY12hi/low thresholds were set manually. High P2RY12 was defined as having at least 70% of the nucleus stained, low P2RY12 was defined as less than 70% of the nucleus stained as demonstrated visually in Fig. 2n. Only 5.4% of all IBA1+ or P2RY12+ cells were P2RY12+IBA1−, suggesting that 94.6% of labelled microglia were assessed. IBA1+P2RY12− cells may have been captured in our P2RY12low categorization, however previous studies have shown that these cells are low in abundance and likely represent infiltrating macrophages which have been shown to be present mainly at lesioned vessels in CTE which are also sparse in our cohort53,54.

Analysis of Nissl staining was performed using the HALO Nuclei Segmentation AI algorithm. Neurons were selected for training based on previously published criteria55. In brief, the classifier was given examples of brain parenchyma annotated for neurons which were considered cells with a Nissl-positive cytoplasm and a visible nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Nissl+ densities across batches were not significantly different and statistical tests of Nissl densities were corrected for staining batch. For FISH and Nissl sections, the depth of the cortical sulcus was defined and annotated as the bottom third of a gyral crest and sulcus pair. Layer 2/3 and layers 4–6 were annotated using layer-specific FISH markers or for Nissl by an expert observer.

The following code and software was used for the analyses: CellRanger v.6.0.1 was used to align reads to the GRCH38 reference and generate filtered count matrices. All other analyses were performed in R v.4.2.1 and Python v.3.10.12 using standard functions unless otherwise stated. Specific versions of packages used are listed in available GitHub code. The following packages were used: CellRanger v.6.0.1, singleCellTK v.2.8.0, Seurat v.4.3.0, scater v.1.24.0, harmony v.0.1.1, RColorBrewer v.1.1.3, ComplexHeatmap v.2.14.0, ArchR v.1.0.2, muscat v.1.12.1, readr v.2.1.4, ggplot2 v.3.4.2, ggsignif v.0.6.4, ggpubr v.0.6.0, magrittr v.2.0.3, scCoda v.0.1.9 Python package, celda v.1.19.1 and hdWGCNA v.0.4.5.

HALO v.3.6.4134.193, HALO AI v.3.6.4134, HALO Object Colocalization v.2.1.4 algorithm and FISH v.3.2.3 algorithm were used to analyse the histological and Nissl images. InForm v.2.5.1 was used to spectrally unmix fluorescent in situ hybridization images.

The research has included local researchers through the research process and is locally relevant with collaborators. All roles and responsibilities were agreed amongst collaborators ahead of the research. The research was not severely restricted in the setting of researchers. The study was approved by the Institutional review board through the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease and CTE Center, Human Subjects Institutional Review Board of the Boston University School of Medicine, VA Bedford Healthcare System, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Iowa Neuropathology Resource Laboratory. The research did not result in stigmatization, incrimination, discrimination, or risk to donors or research staff. No materials have been transferred out of the country. Local and regional research relevant to the study has been included in the citations.

Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10, SPSS v.29 and R (v.4.2.1) packages ggsignif, muscat, scater, and the Python (v.3.10.12) package scCoda. Dirichlet multinomial regression was used to test for cell type and excitatory neuron cell-type enrichment using the scCoda v.0.1.9 Python package13. Celda module expression was evaluated using linear mixed effects modelling, accounting for individual sample differences. Comparisons of cell-type proportions across the three pathological groups were performed using ANOVA with Bonferroni correction, Brown Forsyth with Dunnett post-hoc test, or chi-squared test as indicated in figure legends. Comparison across control and RHI-exposed groups was performed with a t-test with Welch correction or Mann–Whitney U-test, as indicated in the figure legends. Bar plots denote error with s.e.m. Scatter plots denote error with a grey outline of the 95% confidence interval. Evaluation of in situ hybridization analysis was performed using linear regression. P-tau burden was normalized using log10 transformation of positive area density. Nissl+ neuron count comparisons to years of exposure were assessed using linear regression and correcting for age at death and staining batch. Jaccard similarity scoring was performed using the GeneOverlap package by comparing lists of DEGs. All DEGs were filtered by a log2-transformed fold change of 0.15 and false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05. Chi-squared tests for cellular abundance were performed using the base R chisq.tst function. GO analysis P values were acquired through MetaScape analysis. GO statistics were calculated with GSEA and single-tailed hypergeometric test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction. Years of football play was used as a variable for exposure throughout the text instead of total years of play (which includes exposure from all sports) played because it was a more consistent predictor of cellular changes.

snRNA-seq tissue isolation was performed once per each individual. Reproducibility was assessed through comparison to other published datasets23,25. As detailed in Extended Data Figs. 3, 5 and 7, there was significant overlap between our subtypes and other previously published subtypes, highlighting that our results are highly reproducible. For all histological antibody, Nissl and in situ hybridization staining, individual cases were stained and analysed once per each experiment. Histologic methods were validated and optimized prior to the start of the experiment to ensure proper labelling and accurate downstream analyses as discussed in the previous sections.

As a negative charge carrier, the hydride ion (H−) is more energetic, polarizable and reactive than cations1. An H−-mediated electrochemical process is fundamentally different from existing systems and enables the development of innovative electrochemical devices, such as rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, electrolysis cells and gas separation membranes2. Here we developed a core-shell hydride 3CeH3@BaH2, which exhibits fast H− conduction at ambient temperature and becomes a superionic conductor above 60 °C. This hydride allows us to construct an all-solid-state rechargeable H− battery CeH2|3CeH3@BaH2|NaAlH4, which operates at ambient conditions using NaAlH4 and CeH2 as cathode and anode materials, respectively. This battery has an initial specific capacity of 984 mAh g−1 and retains 402 mAh g−1 after 20 cycles. Using hydrogen as charge carriers can avoid the formation of detrimental metal dendrites, in principle, which creates new research avenues for clean energy storage and conversion.

a, Hydrogen contents of the samples. *The hydrogen contents were determined by acidolysis of MHx using a hydrochloric acid solution. b, XRD patterns of the as-prepared BaH2 and CeH3. Black ticks, CeH3; red ticks, BaH2. c, XRD patterns of the nCeH3-BaH2 (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) samples. A certain amount (50% (V/V)) of silicon powder was added into the samples as an internal standard to accurately identify the phases of the mixtures. The main phase of all the nCeH3-BaH2 samples is the cubic CeH3 \(({Fm}\overline{3}m)\). The phase of BaH2 is not obvious even in the samples with higher BaH2 contents. d, XRD patterns of the 3CeH3-BaH2 samples ball milled for different time. As the milling time increases, the BaH2 phase weakens and disappears, while the crystalline phase of CeH3 retains. e, Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of BaH2, CeH3 and 3CeH3-BaH2 samples. The vibration bands centred at 1170 and 915 cm−1 are corresponding to Ce-H bonds and the bands centred at 1075 and 775 cm−1 belong to BaH2. After ball milling, the signals of BaH2 preserve. Noted that DRIFT is a surface sensitive technique. Although the molar ratio of BaH2 accounts only for 1/4 of the sample, the signal of Ba-H is relatively strong, indicating that BaH2 could be enriched on the surface of the material.

Source Data

a,b, SEM images of the ball milled 3CeH3-BaH2 and CeH3 samples, respectively. The 3CeH3-BaH2 sample has a larger particle size, mainly in the rage from 0.5 to 1 μm. The particle size of the ball milled CeH3 is smaller, mainly in 0.2 to 0.6 μm. c, SEM image and corresponding EDS mapping of the 3CeH3-BaH2 sample. The green and red dots represent cerium and barium, respectively. In the micrometre scale, Ba and Ce are uniformly distributed. d, HRTEM images of the 3CeH3-BaH2 sample. Red parallel lines mark the observed crystal plane spacings. These crystal plane data match well with CeH3 crystals \(({Fm}\overline{3}m)\), no crystallines related to BaH2 (Pnma) can been found. e, TEM image of the 3CeH3@BaH2 sample and its corresponding SAED pattern. The diffraction pattern corresponds to the CeH3 crystal, and the innermost ring belongs to the CeH3 (111) plane. No crystalline BaH2 was detectable (if there exists BaH2 crystal in the particle, the innermost ring radius of the diffraction pattern should be much smaller because the crystal plane spacing of orthorhombic BaH2 is larger than 0.32 nm). f, TEM and EELS mapping of the 3CeH3@BaH2 sample. The upper-left image shows the microscopic image of the particle edge, and the green box shows the scanning area. Other figures show the corresponding distribution of Ba and Ce elements. It is evident that particles with core-shell structures are clustered together.

a, Structure model of CeH3 (111)/BaH2 (010) heterojunction and the partial density of states (PDOS) of BaH2 (010) and CeH3 (111). The average bond lengths of Ba-H in BaH2, Ce-H in CeH3, and the Ba-H and Ce-H bonds at the interface are 2.77, 2.36, 2.61 and 2.49 Å, respectively. b, Charge density difference (Δρ) and planar-averaged along the z-axis for the CeH3-BaH2 heterojunctions, showing electron accumulation (yellow) and depletion (blue) across the interface. c, PDOS of the CeH3 (111) slab calculated with PBE + U, showing states near the Fermi level with a small band gap of ~0.12 eV. d, PDOS of the BaH2 (010) slab calculated with HSE06. This slab has a band gap of 3.27 eV that is slightly lower than the value (3.85 eV) of bulk material. These findings indicate an interfacial electron transfer from BaH2 to CeH3.

Source Data

a, XPS spectra of the Ce 3 d for various samples. b, XPS spectra of the Ba 3d5/2 for various samples. Ba of the sample prepared by hand mixing (denoted by 3CeH3-BaH2-HM) and the neat BaH2 sample have a lower binding energy, while the binding energies of post-ball milled samples are higher. This implies that Ba atoms transfer more electrons to H atoms at the interface of the BaH2/CeH3 heterojunction of the ball milled sample. Little variation was observed for Ce among all the samples. c, Ce L3-edge XANES spectra of various samples. d, Ba L3-edge XANES spectra of various samples. Ba of 3CeH3@BaH2 has a higher peak intensity than neat BaH2 and 3CeH3-BaH2-HM samples, showing it is in a higher oxidative state. This is consistent with the XPS results. Ce, on the other hand, does not show remarked difference among the samples.

Source Data

a, The EIS plots at 180, 200 and 220 °C. The inset is the EIS plot and the equivalent circuit of the 3CeH3@BaH2 at 20 °C. Rbulk, resistance of bulk; Rgb, resistance of grain boundary. b, σi, σe, and ti of the nCeH3-BaH2 samples with different ratios at 20 °C. The 3:1 sample has a high ionic conductivity and the highest transfer number. c, The LSV curve of the 3CeH3@BaH2 sample in H2 (black line) and Ar (blue line) atmospheres (1.0 bar) at room temperature. Its electrochemical window is around 1.0 V. d, Arrhenius plot for the ionic conductivity of the 3CeH3@BaH2. Diffusion barrier was derived from the fitted line.

Source Data

The tests were conducted at current densities of 1.3 and 2.7 mA cm−2, respectively.

Source Data

a, The rate capability of the hydride ion battery. Because of substantial capacity fading during the first few cycles, data collection commenced from the tenth cycle. b, Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the CeH2 | 3CeH3@BaH2 | NaAlH4 battery at different sweep rates. There are obvious oxidation and reduction peaks in the CV curves, and the peak positions correspond to the highest rates of charge and discharge processes. The areas belonging to the positive and negative currents are nearly the same, indicating reversibility of the electrode reactions. c, Logarithm peak current (i) versus logarithm sweep rate (v) plots to determine the b-value of redox peaks. The b values of three redox peaks were calculated to be 0.610, 0.533, and 0.508, respectively, suggesting that this battery mainly follows a diffusion-dominated process36.

Source Data

The peaks of the anode (CeH2) shifted significantly to higher angles after discharge, indicating an increase in hydrogen content in Ce hydride; after recharge, asymmetric peaks with a trend of moving towards smaller angles were observed, indicating a decrease in hydrogen content.

The iPhone 17 Pro felt like a brick. I had just gotten used to the featherweight feel of Apple's new iPhone Air after several days of use, but it was time to switch to the iPhone 17 Pro. Suddenly, I didn't want to let the Air go.

It's amazing how a couple of grams and a slimmer profile can drastically change the feel of a phone. There isn't much to grab on the edges, but the Air's design is whimsical and somewhat paradoxical. It feels like a twig that can snap in a heartbeat, but the sturdy titanium frame dispels any notion of fragility.

I was prepared to hate the iPhone Air. Why make a thin phone with lackluster battery life? A single-camera system for $999? After spending some time with it, I'm pleasantly surprised. I still don't think most people should buy it—it's for early adopters who want to experience Apple's thinnest iPhone to date—but it's a promising blueprint of what's to come.

The iPhone Air is just 5.6 millimeters thick and 165 grams; contrast that with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a smaller screen yet weighs 206 grams and is 8.75 mm thick. It's a palpable difference. Initially, you might feel like the lighter weight makes the Air seem “cheap,” but that notion quickly disappears. This phone feels strong, durable, and rigid.

I watched Apple perform a bend test on the iPhone Air, and it was able to withstand more than 130 pounds of force with no damage. I gave it a good bend test myself, but it didn't flex. We'll need to see how this phone performs in the hands of a wider audience, but I think you can put your pitchforks away—no #bendgate here. This durability stems from the use of titanium for the frame, along with Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2 protecting the display, and Ceramic Shield 1 layered over the back. Apple says this mixture makes the Air more durable than any prior iPhone.

I can't imagine buying this ultrathin phone and putting a case on it, but I didn't mind Apple's bumper case. The phone still feels light and thin, but the slightly thicker edges of the bumper make it easier to grasp. Annoyingly, despite using a horizontal camera bar like Google's Pixel phones, the camera still sticks out enough that the Air rocks on a table when you tap a corner—a small nitpick.

The 6.5-inch OLED screen once again feels improbable in this thin and light design. It's just unusual to hold such a large screen and not find it heavy. The display now gets brighter, and I had no issues reading it in direct sunlight on clear, sunny days in California and New York. The inclusion of a 120-Hz screen refresh rate on a non-Pro iPhone is long overdue, and it helps this phone feel even more lively.

It's not wrong to say that the Air's thin and light design is pretty much all it has going for it, but that quality shouldn't be undervalued. Using this phone has genuinely been a treat over the usual bulky handsets that come my way. However, just how much you're able to enjoy it depends on what kind of battery life you're used to.

Apple is not using a silicon-carbon battery in the iPhone Air, despite rumors leading up to the September event. Instead, there's a high-density traditional lithium-ion battery, along with a raft of optimizations in iOS 26, the A19 Pro chipset, a new power-efficient C1X modem, and a fresh internal design. All this to say: The battery life of the iPhone Air is better than I expected.

The Air was generally able to last a full day with average use for me. I hit around five hours of screen-on time with around 18 percent left by 10:30 pm. This worked for me, but my expectations were also very low. I had to baby the battery so much on the last ultrathin phone I tested, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and I was surprised to find that this was not the case with the Air.

Heavy users will undoubtedly need to top up this phone during the day. On one travel day, I took the phone off the charger at 5:30 am and used it extensively for navigation, music streaming, phone calls, and Instagram Reeling, and I hit 2 percent by 4:30 pm. If that sounds like a very normal day for you, you'll most certainly feel the limits of this phone's battery life. For the most part, I didn't feel as battery anxious as with Samsung's thin phone.

I also tested Apple's iPhone Air MagSafe Battery, and it's nice that it snugly fits the Air's body, but it awkwardly has to sit horizontally on other iPhone models. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver a full charge. It took around an hour and 20 minutes to completely deplete the thing, returning 68 percent to the Air from 0 percent.

The Apple-designed C1X modem is supposedly 30 percent more energy-efficient than the modem on the iPhone 16 Pro, but how does this new chip affect connectivity? You don't get millimeter-wave 5G support—that's the ultrafast flavor of 5G you'll find in some locations, like dense urban areas, airports, and stadiums. That means the iPhone Air is limited to sub-6 5G, which is what you connect to most of the time, but it's not as speedy as mmWave. It's a little bizarre to spend $999 on a phone and not get both versions of 5G, considering that's just about standard today, but the omission wasn't noticeable in my day-to-day use.

I didn't run into any connectivity issues. In my internet speed tests, the C1X modem delivered download and upload speeds that were sometimes faster than the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

What's not so great are thermals. Apple spent a great deal of time talking about the new vapor chamber cooling system on the iPhone 17 Pro models, but you'll find none of that here. Perform any intensive tasks on the iPhone Air, and the area around the camera module will feel very hot. I didn't deal with any thermal issues during normal use because most of what I do on my phone doesn't require immense processing. But my benchmark testing delivered interesting results.

The lesser A19 inside the iPhone 17 scored higher in benchmark tests and didn't run as hot as the A19 Pro in the iPhone Air. Mind you, all of these iPhones still got hot, but the iPhone 17 Pro's heat was spread out, so it didn't feel as though one spot was very hot. The other two devices had hot spots, but I measured 110 degrees on the iPhone 17—matching the Pro Max—and 115 degrees on the Air after about an hour of Assassin's Creed Mirage. That extra heat throttled performance a tiny bit, making the game a little more stuttery than on the Pro Max. Another Geekbench test also showed the Air scoring lower than the iPhone 17.

However, Assassin's Creed Mirage performed significantly worse on the iPhone 17 at max graphical settings. It had far more stutters and, dare I say, was a little too annoying to call playable. So while the Air may get hotter and fall behind in some benchmarks, the reality is nuanced. The faster CPU cache, 12 GB of RAM, and other enhancements in the A19 Pro deliver a decent performance boost over the iPhone 17.

Most people aren't going to notice any of this because the A19 and A19 Pro are plenty powerful to handle most apps and games with ease. However, folks who play games with demanding graphics will probably want to look to the iPhone 17 Pro models for the best graphical experience (they also have the best battery life, allowing for longer play times).

The biggest problem with the iPhone Air is its lone 48-MP camera. It feels extremely limiting. Even Samsung was able to stuff an extra ultrawide on the similarly thin Galaxy S25 Edge. In some low-light shots, I found that the iPhone 17's main camera delivered sharper images than the Air sometimes, too. (The sensor on the Air is the same as on the iPhone 17.) While the iPhone 17 can enjoy macro photography, the iPhone Air can't get as close to subjects. You can snap some great photos with the Air—the upgraded 24-MP selfie camera (binned to 18 MP) is nice—but the camera is just not a focal point.

The Air does have the new square-shaped selfie sensor, which lets you hold the phone in portrait orientation and snap photos in either portrait or landscape without changing your grip! Annoyingly, when you manually tap the landscape button to take a landscape selfie, it turns off Center Stage (the auto-zoom-out and auto-rotate). However, when you leave the camera instance and wait a few minutes, Center Stage should turn back on automatically the next time you launch the camera.

As usual, video quality on the iPhone Air remains excellent. I shot several comparison video clips with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and the iPhones routinely came out on top, whether it was the iPhone Air or the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Dual Capture is another fun new addition that lets you capture video with the front and rear camera simultaneously, and while Samsung has had this feature for years, the video quality is so much better on the iPhone.

The iPhone Air's performance was better than expected, but the asking price is too high. Most people will be better served by the iPhone 17, which has a better balance of power, battery life, and a more versatile camera system. For anyone who wants a thicker phone with better battery life, well, Apple has given you exactly that in the form of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. (Also, why does the iPhone Air still only support USB 2 data transfer speeds?)

The Air showcases just what Apple is capable of when it controls the chips, hardware, and software, in a thin and light design that might be a bedrock for a potential folding iPhone. I don't doubt that there will be a demographic of people who don't take many photos or don't need heaps of battery life that will enjoy the thin and lightweight iPhone Air, much like the devoted group that loved the iPhone Mini. We'll have to wait and see if the Air sticks around, or if it will shortly be replaced by (a folding) something else.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Inside Trumpworld's Reality Distortion Field","https://www.wired.com/story/inside-trumpworlds-reality-distortion-field/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:04:00 GMT","

Before a suspect was even in custody, Trumpworld was on a wartime footing.

Charlie Kirk had been fatally shot. Graphic video of the assassination hit terminal velocity online. Several sources of mine were close friends of Kirk, and when I spoke to them last week, it was clear this incident had changed the level of aggression with which they were willing to pursue a crackdown on their boss's perceived enemies.

“I think we want to confront violent left wing rhetoric. We want PEACE, and unity,” one adviser to President Donald Trump told me in a text message.

But, they continued, “If this is an organized group—which it seems?—then this is going to be a wake up call like people have never seen.” This person then speculated about an antifa cell in, of all places, central Utah. Other sources suggested that a band of transgender militants plotted the attack. (There is no indication that any organized group or cell planned the attack, with charging documents filed Tuesday indicating it was a lone shooter.)

It turned out that the nihilistic and highly online references inscribed on bullets investigators found near the crime scene weren't, despite garbled early reporting, so cut-and-dried as to spell out a clear motive for Kirk's murder.

Republicans kept running with one anyway.

In the week since Kirk's death, mourning over his shocking loss has metastasized into an unprecedented mobilization effort among the MAGA base, focused on a few main fronts. There is the successful push for firings of regular civilians over the tone and content of their social media posts about Kirk's death. There is a pendulum swing toward something approaching cancel culture and actual, government-backed censorship on big social media platforms. And then there are the preexisting priorities of the Trump administration.

“They killed Charlie Kirk—the least that we can do is go through a legal process and redistrict Indiana into a nine-to-zero map,” representative Jim Banks of Indiana told Politico at a Republican confab over the weekend, pushing for more partisan gerrymandering.

There was talk of unity from some, but the more dominant tone was expressed by Vice President JD Vance when he hosted Kirk's podcast. “There is no unity with people who scream at children over their parents' politics. There is no unity with someone who lies about what Charlie Kirk said in order to excuse his murder,” he said. “There is no unity with someone who harasses an innocent family the day after the father of that family lost a dear friend. There is no unity with the people who celebrate Charlie Kirk's assassination.”

Elon Musk, on his long road back to regaining favor with the administration, went even further. Appearing remotely at a far-right rally in London on Saturday, he declared “The left are the party of murder.”

As time went on, there appeared to be only one source of true unity: Agreement between the ultra MAGA and Silicon Valley wings of the party over who the they responsible for Kirk's murder really is.

It's anyone Republican leaders want it to be.

According to one expert, that's the entire point: Trumpworld and its Republican allies, from influencers to tech overlords, have started to become the digital equivalent of high on their own supply.

“Since 2020, quite clearly you've seen a media ecosystem that exists to reinforce and to mobilize the base around ideas that they consider to be advantageous for their political movement,” says Renee DiResta, a Georgetown University associate research professor specializing in conspiracy theories, terrorism, and state-sponsored information warfare. “And so the content creators, and the influencers, and the media outlets that reinforce those ideas are the ones that form a political machine,” DiResta adds, working “in tandem to create a self-reinforcing feedback loop.”

Already, Americans are getting fired over their social media posts about the Kirk shooting, and there's no special reason to think the campaign will end soon, or stop there.

“There's a lot that I think is gonna come from this,” a Republican member of Congress close to President Trump tells me.

Almost immediately after the shooting, Republicans were both publicly and privately connecting the successful attempt on Kirk's life to the two unsuccessful ones on Trump's life last summer. No evidence anyone has made public supports such a claim. But sources of mine, including a second Trump adviser who was close to Kirk, were too overcome with emotion and too fed up with their political opposition to care all that much about the actual motivation of Kirk's killer.

“This is on them,” the second Trump adviser told me. “As were the two attempts on Trump's life.”

Of course, there is no organized “them” at play here beyond the broadest definition of the left. There is no evidence of an armed antifa cell in Utah, and none that Kirk's killing was related to a presidential assassination plot. But when I sent new information about the shooter to my Trump sources—who, granted, were in grief and shock—that conflicted with their priors, they did not respond.

“President Trump is right—for years, radical leftists have slandered their political opponents as Nazis and fascists, inspiring left-wing violence like the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk,” Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, told me on Tuesday.

As of now, the evidence is something of a Rorschach test. Robinson's mother told investigators he was beginning to “lean more to the left—becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented,” according to the indictment filed by the Utah County attorney general in the state's Fourth Judicial District Court Tuesday. When asked by his roommate why he allegedly shot Kirk in a text exchange included in the indictment, Robinson replied, “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out,” according to the indictment. Leaked messages from a Discord in which Robinson was allegedly active, obtained by the journalist Ken Klippenstein, appear to complicate the picture, though, and no evidence that has been made public directly links the alleged killer to a specific political ideology.

It's not a coincidence that ideological enemies of the broader conservative movement have been the targets of the mass firing push by Trump supporters. Americans working in education, health care, and government in particular have been targeted, and the right-wing news site Breitbart specifically mentioned those three categories in a post on X.

“This isn't ‘cancel culture,'” the post reads. “It's self defense. A nation that empowers the deranged and the depraved is a nation marching toward ruin.”

The longer-term focus from the White House, the lawmaker close to Trump tells me, won't be limited to just one social media site, such as Bluesky, where scores of posts were compiled and cataloged by the since-offline site “Expose Charlie's Murderers,” as WIRED reported. Trumpworld wants to come for them all.

“You're going to continue to see this: Whether it's Meta, Reddit, Bluesky, Roblox—all of 'em that are actually taking down any content that's literally calling for more violence and/or recirculating that horrifying video,” the lawmaker told me. They also mentioned Discord as a target for the administration, alleging without evidence that the attack was “coordinated” there. (“These were communications between the suspect's roommate and a friend after the shooting, where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere,” Discord VP of trust and safety Jud Hoffman said in a statement last Friday.)

Fighting against the perception of hypocrisy around cancel culture has already become a focal point of the right wing's spin.

“There is a big difference between the left canceling people and the right canceling people,” conservative influencer Matt Walsh tweeted over the weekend. “The left cancels you for saying things that are true. To the extent that the right cancels you, it is for saying things that are abhorrent and sick. A pretty important distinction.”

For DiResta, the pendulum swinging from maximum free speech and minimum content moderation to something approaching the very thing Republicans once opposed makes sense from the perspective of being caught in a conspiratorial information bubble.

“Their opinions on content moderation, for example—redefining labeling and fact-checking as censorship—were always part of a political project to advantage their movement when viewed through that lens,” she says. “It makes sense that now they would be in favor of more censorship—I should say, more actual censorship, because in this particular case, what you're seeing is sitting agents of the government calling for the suppression of speech.”

Some officials in the Trump administration have gone beyond calls for Americans to be banned from social media or be fired from their jobs.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy on paper and unofficial “prime minister” of Trumpworld, went as far as to call for RICO or conspiracy against the United States charges for those “fomenting riots, that are doxing, that are trying to inspire terrorism, or committing wanton acts of violence.” In remarks on Fox News over the weekend, Miller promised that “the power of law enforcement, under President Trump's leadership, will be used to find you, will be used to take away your money, take away your power, and, if you've broken the law, to take away your freedom.”

By Monday, Miller was on Kirk's podcast describing, in his uniquely dystopian way, a “vast domestic terror movement” and promising to use the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to “identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks” in Kirk's name. There is no evidence the movement he describes exists.

This type of rhetoric—a push for a no-holds-barred crackdown with the full force of the federal government—was shared by high-profile figures on the tech right such as Musk and Curtis Yarvin, who tweeted, “The firings are just the beginning!”

“This is really the moment they can claim persecution again,” a source in the tech and crypto space tells me, having seen both on- and offline how their colleagues have radicalized over the past half decade. “Everything has to have some sort of conspiracy tie-in. Nothing can be simple, it has to tie into some broader narrative … This has to be indicative of an underground transgender terrorist network, as opposed to [anything else].”

Whether they believe any of this or not, my source says, is immaterial.

“I don't know,” they say, “whether they believe what they're saying, or if they just think it'll get them the attention they want.”

For now, it might be both.

At first glance, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max seem like a drastic upgrade over their predecessors. They have a fantastic new look—one that adds more character with a two-tone design highlighting the blend of the aluminum chassis and glass. The “Camera Plateau,” as Apple calls it, elongates the camera module and gives it a more balanced appearance and feel. (Although I have to say, Google did it first.)

The specs might not read as revolutionary on paper: a bigger battery, a brighter screen, better performance, and a new telephoto zoom camera. There's no singular feature that'll make you go, “Wow!” But when you actually experience these individual improvements, they combine to become more than the sum of their parts. There are no major AI features being shoved down your throat (for various reasons). It's a better iPhone in every way.

The Cosmic Orange color was calling my name, but alas, Apple provided me with the Silver iPhone 17 Pro Max and Deep Blue iPhone 17 Pro. I switched to these phones after using the iPhone Air for several days, and I yelled, “Holy crap,” after picking them up. They are heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro models, and they feel like bricks compared to the thin and light Air.

I like the Camera Plateau. The two-tone separation of glass and aluminum just makes it more visually interesting. You might say, “It's just a phone,” but when a gadget looks and feels great, it makes using it all the more enjoyable, and I think Apple has done a nice job here. The phone also no longer rocks on a table as much as before, so, yay!

Apple switched from titanium to aluminum to make these chunky phones lighter, but the material change also improves thermal conductivity. Talking about heat dissipation isn't sexy (it is hot), but it's a key improvement in the new iPhones. When you're playing a graphically intensive game, your iPhone will start to get very hot as the processor does its job. At a certain point, if things get too hot, the processor starts to throttle itself so it doesn't overheat, but it means your performance suffers, resulting in stuttering and skips in your gameplay. With the iPhone 17 Pro models, Apple is finally using a vapor chamber cooling system to help dissipate heat.

Several Android phones have long used vapor chamber cooling systems, so the technology isn't new. There's literally one droplet of water in the iPhone, turning to vapor as it absorbs heat and spreads it across the back of the phone, then phasing back into water as it cools down. This system should bring several benefits: better sustained performance over a period of time, and a phone that doesn't get too hot in one awkward spot.

This rang true in my tests. I played one of the most demanding games on the iPhone right now—Assassin's Creed Mirage—and performance was significantly smoother than when I played it on the iPhone 16 Pro last year. The iPhone 17 Pro still got hot, but the heat was spread out over the entire back of the phone, so it didn't feel as uncomfortable to hold while gaming (unlike the iPhone 17 and Air). I maxed out the graphical settings, and the frames per second were noticeably more stable, and I rarely saw stutters at all.

Apple's more powerful A19 Pro chipset has a lot to do with this as well. Keep in mind that performance is slightly better than the A19 Pro inside the iPhone Air, which lacks a graphics core. When I played Mirage on the Air, the phone got hotter in specific areas and wasn't fun to hold. I saw more stutters during prolonged gameplay, though the game was still playable. I also tried it out on the A19-powered iPhone 17, but it stuttered so often at max graphics that I had to stop. All this to say, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are the most powerful smartphones around. The benchmark scores blew everything else out of the water.

The second major highlight is the beefier batteries. Scour phone forums over the last decade and you'll find hundreds of posts asking why phones aren't a little thicker to accommodate a bigger battery. Well, Apple did exactly that. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are thicker and have the highest battery life claims from Apple to date: 33 hours of video playback on the Pro and 39 hours on the Pro Max.

In real-world testing, I haven't worried about battery life on either of these phones. I'm using the Pro Max right now, which has more than 5 hours of screen-on time (SoT) and 55 percent left in the tank. I hit nearly seven hours of SoT on the iPhone 17 Pro, and it still had 30 percent left. Much will depend on what you're doing—hours of gaming will deplete the cell much faster—but I think there's a good chance you might not have to charge your iPhone every single day anymore, especially with the Pro Max.

The rest of the hardware has been excellent. The displays get super bright for easy viewing in sunny conditions, they recharge fairly quickly with the right adapter, and these remain the only iPhone models with USB 3 data transfer speeds. The two Pro models are nearly indentical in features and specs, outside of size (and battery life): The iPhone 17 Pro has a 6.3-inch screen, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch panel. The latter is harder to wield, but it does have one extra perk: You can upgrade to 2 terabytes of internal storage.

I feel comfortable saying that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are the current smartphone camera kings, at least in the US. (I haven't compared them with many of the crazy 1-inch cameras from Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Huawei.) I trotted around New York City with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in tow and compared photos and videos in various environments.

Unsurprisingly, the results across all of these phones aren't drastically different. There are moments when a competing phone outperforms the iPhone (usually, the Pixel 10 Pro). But by and large, I found the iPhone's photos a hair sharper than its peers, though it didn't always handle challenging situations the best or nail skin tones perfectly.

I very much enjoy the new 4X optical zoom camera, and the optical-like quality when you bump up to 8X zoom. It might not always best Google's telephoto camera, but it certainly can impress. The 18-MP selfies on the new iPhones are sharper than ever and competitive, though I still prefer my skin tone rendered on the Pixel. In some low-light scenes, the shadows feel like they've been lifted a bit too much, whereas the Pixel 10 Pro XL had nicer contrast. These iPhones also still have trouble with Portrait mode in low light, a feat the Pixel handles without much issue.

But a big part of what makes these iPhone cameras so excellent is video performance, which is unparalleled. They have superior stabilization over the competition, whether it's with the front or rear cameras. Switching between lenses during recording is smooth and seamless, and low-light video quality is far less grainy. Google is able to come close with its cloud-processing Video Boost technology (not always), but you have to enable this, and also wait for the cloud to deliver your processed footage, which could take hours.

Take Dual Capture, a new feature on these new models. You can shoot with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, something you've been able to do with third-party apps before. Samsung has offered this feature on its Galaxy phones for years. But when I tested it, the Galaxy S25 Edge's low-light video footage in Dual Recording mode looked awful next to Dual Capture on the iPhone 17 Pro. Sometimes, it pays to be second.

I do want to highlight the square-shaped camera sensor for the 24-MP selfie camera (binned to 18 MP). It's standard on all the new iPhone 17 models, and it lets you grip your iPhone sturdily in portrait orientation, but capture selfies or shoot videos in portrait or landscape orientation. It's genius, and something I hope every phone maker copies in the next year. No need to awkwardly shift your grip and risk dropping the phone.

That's the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. No one with an iPhone 15 and newer needs to upgrade (iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 owners might be fine if your device is performing OK, but the switch to USB-C might be warranted). Better heat management delivers better sustained performance. Better battery life means less charging, maximizing your battery health. And the improved cameras keep it at the top of the smartphone camera rankings. What's not to love? And I didn't even have to say “Apple Intelligence” once.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Is Bananas for Google Gemini's AI Image Generator","https://www.wired.com/story/jensen-huang-has-gone-nano-bananas/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 13:53:12 GMT","

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is in London, standing in front of a room full of journalists, outing himself as a huge fan of Gemini's Nano Banana. “How could anyone not love Nano Banana? I mean Nano Banana, how good is that? Tell me it's not true!” He addresses the room. No one responds. “Tell me it's not true! It's so good. I was just talking to Demis [Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind] yesterday and I said ‘How about that Nano Banana! How good is that?'”

It looks like lots of people agree with him: The popularity of the Nano Banana AI image generator—which launched in August and allows users to make precise edits to AI images while preserving the quality of faces, animals, or other objects in the background—caused a 300 million–image surge for Gemini in the first few days of September, according to a post on X by Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Google Gemini.

Huang, whose company was among a cohort of big US technology companies to announce investments in data centers, supercomputers, and AI research in the UK on Tuesday, is on a high. Speaking ahead of a white-tie event with UK prime minister Keir Starmer (where he plans to wear custom black leather tails), he's boisterously optimistic about the future of AI in the UK, saying the country is “too humble” about the country's potential for AI advancements.

He cites the UK's pedigree in themes as wide as the industrial revolution, steam trains, DeepMind (now owned by Google), and university researchers, as well as other tangential skills. “No one fries food better than you do,” he quips. “Your tea is good. You're great. Come on!”

Nvidia announced a $683 million equity investment in data center builder Nscale this week, a move that—alongside investments from OpenAI and Microsoft—has propelled the company to the epicenter of this AI push in the UK. Huang estimates that Nscale will generate more than $68 billion in revenue over six years. “I'll go on record to say I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him,” he says, referring to Nscale CEO Josh Payne.

“As AI services get deployed—I'm sure that all of you use it. I use it every day, and it's improved my learning, my thinking. It's helped me access information, access knowledge a lot more efficiently. It helps me write, helps me think, it helps me formulate ideas. So my experience with AI is likely going to be everybody's experience. I have the benefit of using all the AI—how good is that?”

The leather-jacket-wearing billionaire, who previously told WIRED that he uses AI agents in his personal life, has expanded on how he uses AI (that's not Nano Banana) for most daily things, including his public speeches and research.

“I really like using an AI word processor because it remembers me and knows what I'm going to talk about. I could describe the different circumstance that I'm in, and yet it still knows that I'm Jensen, just in a different circumstance,” Huang explains. “In that way it could reshape what I'm doing and be helpful. It's a thinking partner, it's truly terrific, and it saves me a ton of time. Frankly, I think the quality of work is better.”

His favorite one to use “depends on what I'm doing,” he says. “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I'm doing something where it's a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it's very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT,” Huang says.

“When I am doing something serious, I will give the same prompt to all of them, and then I ask them to, because it's research oriented, critique each other's work. Then I take the best one.”

In the end though, all topics lead back to Nano Banana. “AI should be democratized for everyone. There should be no person who is left behind, it's not sensible to me that someone should be left behind on electricity or the internet of the next level of technology,” he says.

“AI is the single greatest opportunity for us to close the technology divide,” says Huang. “This technology is so easy to use—who doesn't know how to use Nano?”

Located 700 meters underground near the city of Jiangmen in southern China, a giant sphere—35 meters in diameter and filled with more than 20,000 tons of liquid—has just started a mission that will last for decades. This is Juno, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, a new, large-scale experiment studying some of the most mysterious and elusive particles known to science.

Neutrinos are the most abundant particles in the universe with mass. They are fundamental particles, meaning they don't break down into smaller constituent parts, which makes them very small and very light. They also have zero electrical charge; they are neutral—hence their name. All of this means that they very often don't interact with other matter they come into contact with, and can pass right through it without affecting it, making them difficult to observe. It's for this reason that they're sometimes referred to as “ghost particles.”

They also have the ability to shift (or “oscillate”) between three different forms, also known as “flavors”: electron, mu, and tau. (Note that electron-flavored neutrinos are different from electrons; the latter are a different type of fundamental particle, with a negative charge.)

The fact that neutrinos oscillate was proven by the physicists Takaaki Kajita and Arthur Bruce McDonald. In two separate experiments, they observed that electron-flavored neutrinos oscillate into mu- and tau-flavored neutrinos. As a result they demonstrated that these particles have mass, and that the mass of each flavor is different. For this, they won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015.

An explainer on neutrino oscillations from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

But an important yet still unknown fact is how these masses are ordered—which of the three flavors has the greatest mass, and which the least. If physicists had a better understanding of neutrino mass, this could help better describe the behavior and evolution of the universe. This is where Juno comes in.

Neutrinos can't be seen with conventional particle detectors. Instead, scientists have to look for the rare signs of them interacting with other matter—and this is what Juno's giant sphere is for. Called a scintillator, it's filled with a sensitive internal liquid made up of a solvent and two fluorescent compounds. If a neutrino passing through this matter interacts with it, it will produce a flash of light. Surrounding the liquid is a massive stainless steel lattice that supports a vast array of highly sensitive light sensors, called photomultiplier tubes, capable of detecting even a single photon produced by an interaction between a neutrino and the liquid, and converting it into a measurable electrical signal.

“The Juno experiment picks up the legacy of its predecessors, with the difference that it is much larger,” says Gioacchino Ranucci, deputy head of the experiment and the former head of Borexino, another neutrino-hunting experiment. One of the main features of Juno, Ranucci explains, is that Juno can “see” both neutrinos and their antimatter counterpart: antineutrinos. The former are typically produced in Earth's atmosphere or by the decay of radioactive materials in Earth's crust, or else arrive from outer space—coming from stars, black holes, supernovae, or even the Big Bang. Antineutrinos, however, are artificially produced, in this case by two nuclear power plants located near the detector.

“As they propagate, neutrinos and antineutrinos continue to oscillate, transforming into each other,” Ranucci says. Juno will be able to capture all of these signals, he explains, showing how they oscillate, “with a precision never before achieved.”

Juno's primary goal is to find a solution to the neutrino mass-ordering problem. It's known that the electron-flavored neutrino weighs less than the mu-flavored neutrino, but it's not yet understood whether the third neutrino flavor, tau, weighs more than the other two (in which case, we would speak of a direct hierarchy) or not (in which case, an inverse hierarchy). By measuring, in very high resolution, the energy spectrum of antineutrinos from the reactors, Juno aims to show whether the hierarchy is normal or inverse. The collaboration expects that after about six years of data collection, it should have something approaching a statistically significant finding in answer to the question.

But that's not all that's in store for the experiment. At a still later stage, it could help solve an even deeper mystery concerning the so-called Majorana neutrino—a theorized particle that has never been observed. (Majorana particles are particles that are simultaneously also their own antiparticles; a Majorana neutrino is therefore both a neutrino and its antineutrino.) Being able to understand whether or not neutrinos are Majorana particles would possibly mean getting to the bottom of one of the most complex questions in modern physics, namely why more matter is observed in the universe than antimatter, for which there is still no complete, coherent, and definitive explanation.

A technology leap comparable to the jump from vacuum tubes to integrated circuits has been achieved with the delivery of the first full-stack quantum computer built using a standard silicon CMOS chip fabrication process.

Quantum Motion (QM), maker of the computer, announced Monday that the hardware, which uses mass-manufacturable 300mm silicon CMOS wafer technology, has been deployed at the UKRI National Quantum Computing Centre in London.

A “full stack” computer includes the quantum processing unit (QPU), control electronics for managing qubit operations, a software stack, and a user interface.

The system also has a data-center-friendly footprint of just three 19-inch server racks.

“This is quantum computing's silicon moment,” QM's CEO James Palles-Dimmock said in a statement. “Today's announcement demonstrates you can build a robust, functional quantum computer using the world's most scalable technology, with the ability to be mass-produced.”

The company explained that its QPU is based on a scalable tile architecture that integrates all the necessary compute, readout, and control elements into a dense array that can be repeatedly printed onto a chip, enabling future expansion to millions of qubits per QPU. A qubit is roughly the quantum equivalent of a “bit” in the digital world.

“With the delivery of this system, Quantum Motion is on track to bring commercially useful quantum computers to market this decade,” QM's President and Chief Commercial Officer, Hugo Saleh, said in a statement. “It's a customer, user, and developer first approach — using standard CMOS, the basis for all modern technology, from mobile phones to AI GPUs, to deliver the revolutionary next inflection point in computing.”

Quantum Motion's achievement is yet another click forward in the introduction of quantum as a computer “on a chip,” observed Roger A. Grimes, author of “Cryptography Apocalypse: Preparing for the Day When Quantum Computing Breaks Today's Crypto.”

“It continues to take quantum computers and other devices from the realm of big, specialized computers that cost tens of millions and have to be run and maintained by a bunch of high-paid scientists and researchers, and puts it closer into the hands of someone who just wants a computer and not to spend most of their time babysitting for the right conditions,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The delivery of a full-stack quantum computer built using a standard silicon CMOS chip fabrication process is a monumental milestone for the quantum industry,” added Ensar Seker, CISO of SOCRadar, a threat intelligence company in Newark, Del.

“It signifies a critical convergence of quantum mechanics and classical semiconductor engineering, essentially opening the door to scalable, manufacturable quantum computing using the same infrastructure that underpins modern digital electronics,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Silicon-based quantum architectures are particularly compelling because they leverage decades of investment in CMOS manufacturing, supply chain maturity, and quality control,” he said. “This contrasts with other technologies like superconducting qubits or trapped ions, which typically require highly specialized environments, exotic materials, and custom fabrication processes that are harder to scale and integrate with existing systems.”

Up to now, silicon-based quantum computer development has lagged behind superconducting and atom-based technologies, but Quantum Motion is changing that narrative. “I think that we're finally seeing that solid-state quantum technologies are catching up to the announcements from the superconducting and atomic platforms,” said Prineha Narang, a professor of physical sciences and of electrical and computer engineering at UCLA.

“This is another way to go at it, and it's a scalable way,” she told TechNewsWorld.

Quantum Motion's system uses spin qubits, which store and manipulate information using the spin of electrons. “Silicon spin qubits are generally behind in development compared to superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and neutral atom qubit modalities,” explained Sam Lucero, an independent strategy and research consultant in Phoenix.

“This announcement marks the first full implementation of a silicon spin qubit computer that I'm aware of, which is notable as a signpost of this modality's progress,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“Since there is no performance data, it's not clear how this machine will compare to other available platforms at the moment, but I'd expect it to be fairly rudimentary in comparison,” he said.

He acknowledged that QM's technology could potentially scale much better than superconducting and trapped ion systems. “You could have millions of qubits on a single chip, avoiding the need for complex networking,” he explained, “but there are those who think networking will be unavoidable, and those in the industry who think it will be a real barrier to the full realization of quantum computing.”

“Both networking and scaling up are still in early stages, though, so it's not clear which, either, or if both will succeed,” he added.

Yuval Boger, chief commercial officer at QuEra Computing, a builder of quantum computers using neutral atoms, in Boston, noted that there are several promising approaches to building a quantum computer, and Quantum Motion's silicon path is certainly one of them. “In my mind, many of these different approaches are worth exploring, since it's still too early to know which will scale most effectively,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This announcement shows growing recognition that quantum computing is coming, and that the potential value is substantial,” he said. “However, error correction, system reliability, and manufacturability determine timelines to commercialization.”

Austin Bosarge, co-founder and chief corporate officer and head of federal at QuSecure, a maker of quantum-safe security solutions, in San Mateo, Calif., agreed that error correction is a big problem for quantum computers.

“Turning large numbers of noisy, unstable qubits into a small number of reliable and fault-tolerant logical qubits requires significant resources,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Although that problem is still being addressed, this announcement shows real progress on the scalability side.”

In addition to error correction, he noted that quantum systems still require advanced cryogenics, complex control electronics, and precise calibration. “These technical demands create engineering and cost barriers that must be overcome before quantum computing becomes commercially viable at scale.”

However, Bosarge continued, the real concern is not about the availability of general-purpose quantum machines. The issue is the timeline for when quantum computers will be capable of breaking encryption.

“Industry forecasts suggest that by the year 2029, the probability of a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will be high enough that organizations must adopt quantum-safe encryption in advance,” he said.

“A cryptographically relevant system is generally defined as one with about 4,000 error-corrected qubits,” he explained. “The announcement from Quantum Motion shows that these kinds of systems may now be manufactured in standard chip foundries. That lowers the barrier to scale and increases the urgency of preparing digital infrastructure.”

“Quantum computers are scaling up rapidly, but are not yet to the point where we know how to build cryptographically relevant quantum computers; but that day will come, because the technology is proven, and it is now just an engineering problem,” added Tim Hollebeek, vice president of industry standards at DigiCert, a global digital security company.

“Advances like [Quantum Motion's], that integrate quantum computing elements into standard chip-building processes, continue to bring us one step closer to their eventual existence,” he told TechNewsWorld.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

by Todd Bishop on Sep 17, 2025 at 6:25 amSeptember 17, 2025 at 9:52 am

Amazon this morning unveiled a new wave of agentic AI tools designed to act as proactive partners for the independent sellers who generate more than 60% of its online retail sales. 

The upgrades to Amazon's Seller Assistant and Creative Studio promise to automate everything from monitoring inventory to producing polished ad campaigns. Amazon says they're meant to further empower the businesses that operate on its 25-year-old third-party marketplace.

Amazon's partnership with those sellers has turned into “probably the most compelling and substantial collaboration in the history of retail,” CEO Andy Jassy told the crowd during a Tuesday appearance at the company's Accelerate seller conference in Seattle.

Some sellers see a more complicated reality, where the benefits of access to Amazon's giant marketplace come with rising costs, restrictive policies, and a sense of unequal treatment, as reflected in independent surveys from analysts, vendors, and consulting firms. 

Meanwhile, an ongoing FTC antitrust case alleges that Amazon has illegally leveraged its power over third-party sellers through a variety of practices that the company strongly denies. 

Bloomberg News reported last week that the FTC is separately looking into new questions about whether Google and Amazon gave sufficient disclosures about pricing for search ads that, in the case of Amazon's marketplace, are heavily used by sellers to promote listings.

Those larger issues form a complex yet largely unstated backdrop for Amazon's annual seller conference. Accelerate is taking place this week at the Seattle Convention Center, a few blocks from Amazon's Seattle headquarters, drawing sellers from across the country and the world.

As with much of the tech industry right now, AI is front-and-center at this year's conference. It's part of Amazon's companywide effort to demonstrate leadership in a field where it has sometimes been seen as playing catch-up to OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others.

Amazon says its existing generative AI technologies have been used by 1.3 million sellers. They include tools that automatically generate product listings from a photo or short description, suggest attributes and keywords to include in listings, and draft ad copy, for example.

The new agentic AI tools go beyond those capabilities to serve as broader assistants — in some cases acting proactively, with the seller's permission, according to the company. 

The additions to the Creative Studio, for example, aim to give sellers a built-in creative partner that can research products and audiences, brainstorm concepts, draft storyboards, and generate full video and display ad campaigns from start to finish.

“So rather than clicking a button, you're actually able to have a natural-language conversation with a creative partner that is working with you to help you achieve your goals,” said Jay Richman, vice president of creative products and technology for Amazon Ads, in an interview.

Features of the upgraded Seller Assistant include the ability to actively monitor inventory levels, flag potential compliance or account-health issues, and anticipate shifts in product demand — even generating specific recommendations on pricing, promotions, or restocking. 

With a seller's approval, the tool can then take action by preparing shipments, scheduling replenishment, or adjusting listings directly through Amazon's systems.

Amazon says it's powering the new tools with its Nova AI foundation model and Anthropic's Claude 4 in conjunction with its deep knowledge of shopping, successful seller approaches. 

That broad intelligence is then combined with real-time context about each seller's specific situation and history on the platform — such as inventory levels, seasonal patterns, and promotions, plus the ability to act directly through Amazon's internal systems and APIs.

“So it's not just some generalized knowledge or generalized capability from all the history. It is tailored to their specific situation,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of selling partner services, in an interview about the new tools at the conference this week. 

For example, the tools could create tailored recommendations for a holiday-driven business on exactly how many units to send into Fulfillment by Amazon — and then, if approved, schedule and facilitate the shipments, all the way down to creating the shipping labels.

Amazon's access to confidential merchant data on its e-commerce platform has been a sticking point in other situations, giving rise to accusations that people inside the company have mined individual seller information to launch competing products. Amazon has repeatedly denied these allegations.

With the new AI tools, Mehta said, the company has been careful not to train its models with seller-specific data, ensuring that no confidential information informs its recommendations to a competing seller. Instead, Amazon aggregates broad trends and insights, and combines them with the seller's own context, while keeping that seller's information siloed.

“That's really important for privacy,” Mehta added, noting that no one would want their personal data used to give a competitor an advantage. The goal, he said, is to build trust so that sellers are comfortable letting the AI act on their behalf with their permission. 

The broader financial stakes are huge for Amazon and sellers. 

All of which makes it all the more remarkable that this part of Amazon's business almost never happened. Addressing sellers Tuesday afternoon in an appearance with Mehta on stage, Jassy said the decision to allow independent sellers into Amazon's online store caused “quite an animated debate” inside the company when it was first considered 25 years ago. 

Amazon executives were unsure at the time that third-party merchants could live up to its brand and customer service standards. But ultimately, he said, after weeks of deliberation, they decided that more sellers would mean better selection and lower prices for customers.

“What we're doing together is very unusual,” Jassy said, predicting that the new wave of AI tools are going to make the collaboration even more successful. “I still think it's very early days.”

Justin Farris, a longtime product leader at Zillow and GitLab, joined Seattle startup Read AI as vice president of product. 

Farris spent more than five years in a similar role at GitLab, the publicly traded DevOps company, and was director of product development at Zillow. 

Founded in 2021, Read AI got its start with a meeting notetaker and has added various other enterprise productivity tools. It raised a $50 million Series B round last year.

In a press release, Farris called Read AI the “Cursor for productivity.”

“Just as GitLab is the go-to place for the entire software development process, Read AI is the go-to place where work comes together,” he said. “I saw first-hand what's happening in the developer tools space, and see even larger opportunities in the productivity and AI assistant category.”

Read AI on Wednesday rolled out a new “Agentic Workflow Suite.” The company is led by David Shim, who won CEO of the Year honors at the GeekWire Awards in May. 

— Lisa Gurry is stepping down from Seattle health data startup Truveta. 

Gurry spent more than 23 years at Microsoft before helping launch Truveta as its chief marketing officer in 2020. She later served as chief operating officer and chief growth officer. 

“I embraced my role as the only female co-founder and worked hard to create a successful company and a positive experience for all Truvetans,” Gurry wrote on LinkedIn.

Gurry said that she is “so excited for my next grand adventure” but didn't reveal more details. 

Truveta reached unicorn status earlier this year after raising $320 million. The company aims to aggregate medical records data from partner institutions to link treatments with outcomes and underlying health. It is led by CEO Terry Myerson, a former Microsoft executive vice president.

— Hossein Nowbar, chief legal officer at Microsoft, is stepping down after nearly three decades at the Redmond tech giant.

Nowbar graduated from the University of Washington in 1993, worked at Davis Wright Tremaine for four years, and then joined Microsoft in 1997. 

He was named chief legal officer in 2023.

“I helped clear antitrust hurdles for transformative acquisitions like Nuance and Activision Blizzard King, supported product and service launches that reshaped the way we work, and introduced the Customer Copyright Commitment to help our customers realize the promise of AI,” Nowbar wrote on LinkedIn.

Nowbar didn't share details of his next gig. Jonathan Palmer, a corporate vice president and 15-year veteran of Microsoft, will serve as the company's new chief legal officer.

— Edwin Miller, CEO of Seattle-based Marchex, is stepping down after two years leading the publicly traded call and conversation analytics company. Marchex also announced a series of other exec changes:

Miller will serve as a senior advisor to Russell Horowitz, chairman at Marchex. 

— Bridget Frey, a longtime leader at Seattle-based Redfin, is taking on the chief data officer role at Rocket after the mortgage giant completed its acquisition of Redfin in July.

Frey, who joined Redfin in 2011, will continue her role as chief technology officer at Redfin, where she helped launch the machine learning team.

“With Bridget guiding our combined data vision, we are set up to create a homeownership experience that feels genuinely connected end-to-end,” Rocket CTO Shawn Malhotra said on LinkedIn.

— Amazon Web Services has brought on two senior executives, according to a report from Business Insider. 

— Ty Wolfe-Jones joined Seattle-based EV charging startup Juicer Energy as head of operations. Wolfe-Jones was a director at Assurance, a COO at Wrench, and manager at both DoorDash and Uber. 

Juicer, led by OfferUp co-founder Nick Huzar, recently started rolling out its EV charging infrastructure at apartment buildings and other properties. 

“It is rare that you find big, real-world, ‘right now' problems being dealt with in truly innovative ways, and with such a strong team,” Wolfe-Jones said in a statement. “So when you do, you have to jump at it.”

— Bryan Copley, a Seattle-based entrepreneur and founder of real estate data startup CityBldr, joined Blue Fern Development as chief product officer. Blue Fern, a Redmond, Wash.-based real estate development and construction firm, acquired CityBldr, according to Copley. 

“I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work with the team to pioneer combined learning in real estate development, fusing AI insights and human judgment to unlock greater productivity, which from this point forward will be measured in more homes,” he said on LinkedIn.

— Sarah Strobhar joined Seattle startup Upbound as chief revenue officer. Strobhar spent more than five years at AWS as a go-to-market leader and was also head of sales at Onera. 

Founded in 2017, Upbound helps enterprise customers streamline their infrastructure workflow in the cloud. The company, founded and led by Bassam Tabbara, raised $60 million in 2021.

— Jennifer Adair, a longtime researcher at Seattle-based cancer center Fred Hutch, joined the UMass Chan Medical School as a professor and vice chair in the new Department of Genetic and Cellular Medicine. Adair spent 17 years at Fred Hutch, where she helped lead work on gene therapies at the Adair Lab. She was also an associate professor at Fred Hutch and a research associate professor at the University of Washington.

— Pablo Brown-Rodriguez, a former general manager at Amazon Health, launched a new Seattle-based firm called Operative Partners that acquires and leads mid-market healthcare businesses. “The goal is to find a great healthcare business and protect legacy, culture, and people with a long-term, operator-led approach,” he wrote on LinkedIn.

Waymo has struck a deal with ride-hailing company Lyft to launch a robotaxi service in Nashville in 2026.

The company said Wednesday it will begin testing its fleet of all-electric and autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in the Nashville area in the coming months and will open up the service to the public next year.

The partnership agreement announced Wednesday comes as Waymo ramps up its robotaxi expansion from its initial commercial market of Phoenix to Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The Alphabet-owned company has previously announced plans to bring its robotaxis to Miami, Washington D.C., Dallas, and Denver.

The deal also illustrates Waymo's desire to move beyond being a sole operator and towards being an autonomous vehicle technology provider. Earlier this year, Waymo launched a robotaxi service with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. Under that arrangement, Waymo is responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain aspects of rider support, while Uber manages fleet services such as vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot operations through a company called Moove Cars.

Waymo's arrangement with Lyft in Nashville is similar. Lyft will also handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, infrastructure, and depot operations through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive. Lyft said it's investing in a purpose-built AV facility to support the fleet. 

The Waymo-Lyft partnership in Nashville has one key difference from the company's relationship with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In Nashville, robotaxi customers will be able to access robotaxis in two ways. Users will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also dispatch its autonomous vehicles for matched rides on the Lyft app.

That's unlike its partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. In those cities, all potential customers have to use the Uber app in hopes of being matched with a robot, not a human driver.

Lyft and Waymo have partnered before, although never at scale. In 2019, Waymo linked up with Lyft to bring a handful of self-driving vehicles onto the ride-hailing network in Phoenix as the company ramped up its commercial robotaxi service.

Amazon announced on Wednesday that it's introducing an always-on AI agent that will help sellers on its platform run their businesses. The company is updating Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, to help handle tasks on the seller's behalf. 

“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a press release. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.”

Seller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says.

For example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations.

Seller Assistant continuously monitors a seller's account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Additionally, it can automatically ensure that all of a seller's products meet compliance requirements in every country they're selling in.

Agent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients. On Tuesday, Google released a new payments protocol for agentic transactions, although Amazon was not named as a partner.

Amazon also announced that it's bringing agentic AI to advertising, allowing sellers to develop ads through conversational prompts. 

Today's announcement marks the latest AI tools that Amazon has rolled out for third-party sellers on its platform. Other tools include a video generator for ads and a generative AI tool that helps merchants improve their product listings.

Icarus Robotics cofounders Ethan Barajas and Jamie Palmer spent hours interviewing astronauts about what it was like working in space as they homed in on their startup idea. Their big takeaway: the work was often more cargo logistics than cutting-edge science. 

“We're Amazon warehouse workers with PhDs,” one astronaut said. If an experiment takes two hours on station, the person continued, the first ninety minutes are spent just moving around cargo and preparing tools.

It's a dismal waste of top talent. “These astronauts that are trained for two years, that come from some of the craziest military backgrounds and some of the smartest, most trained people on Earth, spend 14 days unpacking, repacking those back, just moving them around,” Barajas said.

The logistical burden is tied to cargo resupply. Every 60 days or so, roughly three-and-a-half tons of cargo arrive at the International Space Station, and all of it must be unpacked and stowed.

Barajas and Palmer, who met at the Entrepreneurs First organization, knew there had to be a better way. Their pitch: use intelligent, dexterous robots to take over these time-sucking chores. But they're not starting with humanoid robots. Instead, Icarus is taking an iterative approach and starting with a simpler, fan-propelled robot with two robot arms outfitted with jaw grippers.

Icarus just raised a $6.1 million seed round led by Soma Capital and Xtal, with participation from Nebular and Massive Tech Ventures to get there.

The look of the first robot is a function of the tasks it will do: unpacking and stowing cargo. Palmer, who brings brings the robotics expertise to the enterprise, said that when you move to bimanual manipulation, or the coordinated use of two robotic arms at once, you can get around 80% of the needed dexterity with simple jaw grippers as with a complex anthropomorphic hand.

  

A lot of the science experiments astronauts perform on the ISS are also fairly simple in practice, like swapping out cartridges, which is another area a robotic labor force could come in handy.

The team recently performed a terrestrial long-distance teleoperation demo with a bimanual jaw gripper system, unzipping a real ISS cargo bag, unpacking it, and zipping it back up again. “We were able to demonstrate that you don't need to go the whole way to hands to get meaningful dexterity at a long distance,” Palmer said.

Next up is flight testing. Icarus plans to conduct a parabolic-flight campaign in the new year, followed by a one-year demonstration on the ISS via Voyager Space, operator of the commercial Bishop airlock. The plan is to spend a year de-risking the full suite of cargo bag operations, then step into finer-grained tasks related to station maintenance, like filter and seal inspections.

The robots will be teleoperated at first, and Palmer said the ISS is one of the few work sites where you can justify having someone “behind the wheel” of the robot at all times. “The labor arbitrage margin is so big” that Icarus can have a skilled, high-paid robotic operator for a year, he said.

Icarus' longe term plan is to build autonomy and general-purpose capability via “embodied AI.” It mirrors what's happening in terrestrial general purpose robotics on the ground, adjusted for the physics of microgravity. This means collecting data in microgravity with a human in the loop and turning that dataset into the foundational models for on orbit robotics. 

From there, Icarus aims to roll out partial autonomy where a human select “higher-level primitives,” a set of commands that's simplified into intelligent commands like “open the bag” or “unstow the items.”

Ultimately, the goal is full autonomy for deep space locales where teleoperation isn't viable, to complement human space activity.

“We don't want to remove the astronauts,” said Barajas, who brings the space experience, having landed his first NASA internship at just 17 years old. “We want to augment them. We want to make the short time that they have on station as profitable and as research heavy as possible.”

As robots increasingly enter human spaces, robotics companies will need to think about safety differently than they did when robots were largely siloed from their human counterparts.  

Sonair thinks its sensors can help robotics companies reach their safety goals — with a solution that is both better and cheaper than popular LIDAR technology.  

The Oslo, Norway-based company built an ADAR (acoustic detection and ranging) sensor for robots that uses high frequency sound. These sensors send out ultrasound waves and capture how the sound echoes back. These signals give robots a three-dimensional view of their surroundings. 

This data complements a robot's other sensors and cameras to give the robot's operating system a clearer picture of the environment.  

“Perception for a human — what we're using the most is our eyes, but we're also using other senses to perceive our environment, our ears and our brain to interpret all our senses,” said Sonair co-founder and CEO Knut Sandven in an interview with TechCrunch. “The same is for robots or autonomous machines. They're using cameras. Cameras are really great to understand the environment, but they're not good for reliably detecting objects under all circumstances.” 

Sonair is designed to help fill those gaps — especially for depth perception. Traditionally, robotics companies turn to LIDAR sensors, which send out beams of light and measure how they bounce back, to gather that information. Sandven said Sonair's sensors are a better option because they can capture more comprehensive data.  

“LIDAR is like swiping a laser pointer,” Sandven said. “[But] if you shout out in a room, you will fill the room with sound. We will fill the room with sound.” 

The sensor's output is structured in a standard industry format, Sandven said, so it's designed to work alongside a variety of different robotic hardware and software.  

The company released its sensor earlier this year and has since seen strong demand from the robotics field, with multiple companies planning to incorporate Sonair's sensors into their next robot models, Sandven said.  

Sonair has also seen demand from the industrial safety sector. Sandven said companies are using the sensors to detect when people enter areas with heavy machinery so the machines can be shut off automatically before an accident happens.  

Now, Sonair is looking to scale up adoption of its tech and just raised a $6 million round to do so. The round included new and returning investors Scale Capital, Norway's state-backed Investinor, and ProVenture, among others.  

Sandven said that investors who are active in the robotics space immediately understood the problem that the company is looking to solve. This isn't surprising as safety will likely become a major concern as robots start interacting with humans more — not unlike the safety conversations that emerged in the early days of the self-driving car industry.  

Fady Saad, a general partner, at robotics-focused Cybernetix Ventures, which is not an investor in Sonair, recently told TechCrunch that potential safety concerns were one of the reasons he doesn't expect people to want humanoid robots in their home anytime soon.  

The “kind of dirty secret of humanoids at homes s there's a lot of safety, lots of security, lots of concerns,” Saad told TechCrunch in August. “If this thing falls on pets or kids, it will hurt them, right? This is just one aspect of a big hurdle that no one is paying attention to, or very few people are paying attention to.” 

Sandven said Sonair doesn't currently have direct competition for its sonar-based sensors, but that could change as more companies try to find safety solutions for robots.  

“My goal is to have this technology in all robots, like you have with cameras,” Sandven said. “If we talk again this time next year, we will have a pretty good indication whether that is the direction we are heading.”

Lovable has quickly become one of the most talked-about startups of the year, breaking records and making headlines as one of the fastest-growing software companies in history. To mark the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch, co-founder and CEO Anton Osika will take the Disrupt Stage to discuss Lovable and the Future of Consumer Tech. Join us at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, alongside 10,000+ founders, investors, and tech leaders shaping what's next.

Lovable lets anyone create apps and websites simply by talking to AI. Its mission: empower the 99% of people who can't code to turn their ideas into software. The momentum has been staggering. Lovable reached $100 million ARR in under a year, raised a $200 million Series A at a $1.8 billion valuation led by Accel, and has been fielding unsolicited investor offers that push its valuation toward $4 billion. As TechCrunch recently reported, investors are “loving Lovable” — and it's easy to see why.

A physicist-turned-entrepreneur, Osika co-founded Lovable after earlier roles as co-founder of Depict.ai, Founding Engineer at Sana, and a particle physicist at CERN. Based in Stockholm, he's built Lovable into a global story at lightning speed, blending technical depth with a consumer-first vision. In this session, he'll share what it takes to build a brand that not only scales in a competitive market but also navigates the cultural conversations that come with such rapid success.

Lovable's rise isn't just a startup story — it's a blueprint for the next wave of consumer tech. Osika's journey offers rare insight into how to scale at breakneck speed, balance investor pressure with product focus, and carve out a category others have long ignored. For anyone building consumer experiences, this will be a masterclass.

Catch Anton Osika on the Disrupt Stage this October and see how Lovable is redefining consumer tech. Secure your pass today and save up to $668 before Regular Bird rates end September 26.

Google announced on Wednesday that it's updating the Discover page in its flagship Search app to allow you to follow specific publishers and creators to surface more content from those you like. 

The update follows a feature Google rolled out last month, allowing users to pick their choice of news sites and blogs for the Top Stories section in search results.

In the weeks ahead, Google says people will also start to see different types of content on Discover, including articles, YouTube Shorts, and posts from X and Instagram from creators and publishers across the web. Moving forward, Google will add more types of sources to this mix, it said.

With these moves, Google is trying to give users more control over their content, while also expanding its Discover page to include a wider variety of sources.

It is not clear what Google's criteria are for creator content to show up on the Discover page, however. (A response to a question about this was not provided ahead of publication.) 

To use the feature, when you see content from a particular publisher or creator, you can tap their name to view all their content on one page and opt to follow them. Google said it will show more content from sources you follow.

These announcements have come at a time when publishers are seeing their traffic plummet because of Google's AI search. The search giant even launched a product called Offerwall to let publishers earn revenue from sources other than ads.

> Combine the task with something you enjoy. You know what makes cleaning out the garage a lot better? Some good tunes.This motivational advice is deeply misguided. These are very clear examples of ""dopamine stacking"". The idea is that by combining a stimulating activity (eg watching show/music) with a motivation-requiring activity (eg working out/cleaning) you can get an initial boost in motivation to accomplish the hard task. It works (initially) because the stimulating task (show/music) is giving you a dopamine increase which feels like motivation to complete the hard task. The problem is that if you repeat this behavior with any consistency, your dopamine system quickly adjusts the high activity-combo level of dopamine as a new baseline. Soon not even the dopamine you get from the combination is sufficient to motivate you to accomplish the task. At this point people often seek another short lived dopamine-increasing stimulus to combine into the mix.You can see this pattern in people who exercise only with some combination of pre-workout, caffeine, music, phone scrolling.The off-ramp is learning how to derive dopamine (aka ""motivation"") from the actual activity itself.further reading:

So, just start liking the things you don't like? Sure, ideally that's the solution you want, but it's not exactly actionable advice.

reply

Listening to music or a podcast while you work or exercise is a completely normal, non-dopamine stacking, thing to do. In the past, before radio and recorded music, people daydreamed or sang to accomplish the same goal.

As for muscle, a pound only burns 11 calories/day. You'd have to gain 20 lbs of muscle, basically become a bodybuilder, just to offset a KitKat. The math is pretty depressing.

reply

My disagreement is that I think exercise should not primarily be about calories - it should be about fitness. And almost all of the fitness gains from exercise persist even if you replace the calories with a donut.Exercising for 30min and then relacing those spent calories with donuts is FAR better than not exercising and forgoing those extra calories.

Any ways, a lot of studies have shown your body has a variety of methods that attempt to counteract excess calories burned, like reduction in non-exercise activity thermogenesis.

He casts a wide net with a Psychology Today level concept, and he builds an audience of people that can't separate the lazy conclusions he makes from the objectively true but elementary facts he bases them on.Look at the comments, where people are accusing each other of being dopamine hijacked because they eat and read at the same time. Give me a break. Your reward system is not a fragile thing that is easily broken. The actual causes of dopamine hijacking are things like spending all day playing video games, not having a coffee before working out.

1) reward/incentive/expected good feelings2) effort/displeasure of doing the thing and the resultOne way to increase #1 is to make it more socially involved. If you're working on a project solitarily, start going to events and talking about it with people, or write about it online. Humans are massively socially motivated.For #2, one way to address this is with emotional processing. Often something is unpleasant because it reminds of something we didn't like from the past. So really digesting those emotions can allow the expected displeasure to fade because we kind of integrate it into our brains/bodies. But the key for this is that it has to be emotional processing, not intellectual processing.

Sure, don't think of the pain, but you could ended up stuck in daydreaming about the perfect future where you're healthier, stronger, happier, etc. You can trigger executive dysfunction (mental freeze) either way.

Doing hard things is hard, and that means I won't be thinking about the other stuff I have to do. I'm more apt to miss a text from my family when I'm running or writing a document than when I'm vibe coding, because the effort is all-encompassing. Subconsciously, that's stressful, so I steer away from it.Habits help here, because with enough repetition, I learn that it's OK to disappear for an hour to do the thing. But the real issue is getting the meta-organization of my life right enough that I'm not scared to shut down my ambient executive function for that hour. This shows up as both ""I'm too busy to do the hard thing"" and ""I'm too tired to do the hard thing.""Slowing down isn't the answer, but it's been pretty transformative to notice that that's what I'm worried about.

For $100 million I would probably just learn to put on the scuba gear but for instance my mind would go to ""I should make my own scuba gear"".

I think it's probably related to a shorter attention span so I'm working on that.

A popular example would be sports if you're not very fit. You would obviously have tangible health benefits if you did it, you may look more attractive, you may have more energy both physically and mentally. But since you're a couch potatoe sports is demanding, exhausting and sucks. Would you do more sports it would suck less or you might even find it enjoyable, but you don't and that's where you are.This puts you in the weird spot of wanting a thing but not wanting to do what would get you there, even if the reasons you don't want to do it would vanish if you did it.You can only really overcome this mentally, e.g. by priming yourself in certain ways, or by creating situations where you don't have a choice, because others rely on you, etc.

Can AI create a life form? These “generative” genomes are a start

Artificial intelligence can draw cat pictures and write emails. Now the same technology can compose a working genome.

A research team in California says it used AI to propose new genetic codes for viruses—and managed to get several of these viruses to replicate and kill bacteria.

The scientists, based at Stanford University and the nonprofit Arc Institute, both in Palo Alto, say the germs with AI-written DNA represent the “the first generative design of complete genomes.”

The work, described in a preprint paper, has the potential to create new treatments and accelerate research into artificially engineered cells. It is also an “impressive first step” toward AI-designed life forms, says Jef Boeke, a biologist at NYU Langone Health, who was provided an advance copy of the paper by MIT Technology Review.  

Boeke says the AI's performance was surprisingly good and that its ideas were unexpected. “They saw viruses with new genes, with truncated genes, and even different gene orders and arrangements,” he says.

This is not yet AI-designed life, however. That's because viruses are not alive. They're more like renegade bits of genetic code with relatively puny, simple genomes. 

AI automation throughout the drug development pipeline is opening up the possibility of faster, cheaper pharmaceuticals.

In the new work, researchers at the Arc Institute sought to develop variants of a bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacteria—called phiX174, which has only 11 genes and about 5,000 DNA letters.

To do so, they used two versions of an AI called Evo, which works on the same principles as large language models like ChatGPT. Instead of feeding them textbooks and blog posts to learn from, the scientists trained the models on the genomes of about 2 million other bacteriophage viruses.

But would the genomes proposed by the AI make any sense? To find out, the California researchers chemically printed 302 of the genome designs as DNA strands and then mixed those with E. coli bacteria.

That led to a profound “AI is here” moment when, one night, the scientists saw plaques of dead bacteria in their petri dishes. They later took microscope pictures of the tiny viral particles, which look like fuzzy dots.

“That was pretty striking, just actually seeing, like, this AI-generated sphere,” says Brian Hie, who leads the lab at the Arc Institute where the work was carried out.

Overall, 16 of the 302 designs ended up working—that is, the computer-designed phage started to replicate, eventually bursting through the bacteria and killing them.

J. Craig Venter, who created some of the first organisms with lab-made DNA nearly two decades ago, says the AI methods look to him like “just a faster version of trial-and-error experiments.”

For instance, when a team he led managed to create a bacterium with a lab-printed genome in 2008, it was after a long hit-or-miss process of testing out different genes. “We did the manual AI version—combing through the literature, taking what was known,” he says. 

But speed is exactly why people are betting AI will transform biology. The new methods already claimed a Nobel Prize in 2024 for predicting protein shapes. And investors are staking billions that AI can find new drugs. This week a Boston company, Lila, raised $235 million to build automated labs run by artificial intelligence.

Computer-designed viruses could also find commercial uses. For instance, doctors have sometimes tried “phage therapy” to treat patients with serious bacterial infections. Similar tests are underway to cure cabbage of black rot, also caused by bacteria.

“There is definitely a lot of potential for this technology,” says Samuel King, the student who spearheaded the project in Hei's lab. He notes that most gene therapy uses viruses to shuttle genes into patients' bodies, and AI might develop more effective ones.

The Stanford researchers say they purposely haven't taught their AI about viruses that can infect people. But this type of technology does create the risk that other scientists—out of curiosity, good intentions, or malice—could turn the methods on human pathogens, exploring new dimensions of lethality.

“One area where I urge extreme caution is any viral enhancement research, especially when it's random so you don't know what you are getting,” says Venter. “If someone did this with smallpox or anthrax, I would have grave concerns.”

Whether an AI can generate a bona fide genome for a larger organism remains an open question. For instance, E. coli has about a thousand times more DNA code than phiX174 does. “The complexity would rocket from staggering to … way way more than the number of subatomic particles in the universe,” says Boeke.

Also, there's still no easy way to test AI designs for larger genomes. While some viruses can “boot up” from just a DNA strand, that's not the case with a bacterium, a mammoth, or a human. Scientists would instead have to gradually change an existing cell with genetic engineering—a still laborious process.

Despite that, Jason Kelly, the CEO of Ginkgo Bioworks, a cell-engineering company in Boston, says exactly such an effort is needed. He believes it could be carried out in “automated” laboratories where genomes get proposed and tested and the results are fed back to AI for further improvement.

 “This would be a nation-scale scientific milestone, as cells are the building blocks of all life,” says Kelly. “The US should make sure we get to it first.” 

The embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

They're turning their backs on a technology thought to have saved millions of lives—with the potential to save many more.

Her computations allow physicians to more quickly diagnose and treat life-threatening genetic diseases.

Forget the glorious successes of past breakthroughs—the real justification for research investment is what we get for our money. Here's what economists say.

MIT Technology Review Explains: Let our writers untangle the complex, messy world of technology to help you understand what's coming next. You can read more from the series here.

Given the draconian cuts to US federal funding for science, including the administration's proposal to reduce the 2026 budgets of the National Institutes of Health by 40% and the National Science Foundation by 57%, it's worth asking some hard-nosed money questions: How much should we be spending on R&D? How much value do we get out of such investments, anyway? To answer that, it's important to look at both successful returns and investments that went nowhere.

Every year, we recognize extraordinary young researchers on our Innovators Under 35 list. Recent honorees told us how they're faring under the new administration.

Sure, it's easy to argue for the importance of spending on science by pointing out that many of today's most useful technologies had their origins in government-funded R&D. The internet, CRISPR, GPS—the list goes on and on. All true. But this argument ignores all the technologies that received millions in government funding and haven't gone anywhere—at least not yet. We still don't have DNA computers or molecular electronics. Never mind the favorite examples cited by contrarian politicians of seemingly silly or frivolous science projects (think shrimp on treadmills).

While cherry-picking success stories help illustrate the glories of innovation and the role of science in creating technologies that have changed our lives, it provides little guidance for how much we should spend in the future—and where the money should go.

A far more useful approach to quantifying the value of R&D is to look at its return on investment (ROI). A favorite metric for stock pickers and PowerPoint-wielding venture capitalists, ROI weighs benefits versus costs. If applied broadly to the nation's R&D funding, the same kind of thinking could help account for both the big wins and all the money spent on research that never got out of the lab.

The problem is that it's notoriously difficult to calculate returns for science funding—the payoffs can take years to appear and often take a circuitous route, so the eventual rewards are distant from the original funding. (Who could have predicted Uber as an outcome of GPS? For that matter, who could have predicted that the invention of ultra-precise atomic clocks in the late 1940s and 1950s would eventually make GPS possible?) And forget trying to track the costs of countless failures or apparent dead ends.

But in several recent papers, economists have approached the problem in clever new ways, and though they ask slightly different questions, their conclusions share a bottom line: R&D is, in fact, one of the better long-term investments that the government can make.

This story is part of MIT Technology Review's ""America Undone” series, examining how the foundations of US success in science and innovation are currently under threat. You can read the rest here.

That might not seem very surprising. We've long thought that innovation and scientific advances are key to our prosperity. But the new studies provide much-needed details, supplying systematic and rigorous evidence for the impact that R&D funding, including public investment in basic science, has on overall economic growth.

And the magnitude of the benefits is surprising.

In “A Calculation of the Social Returns to Innovation,” Benjamin Jones, an economist at Northwestern University, and Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist and former US Treasury secretary, calculate the effects of the nation's total R&D spending on gross domestic product and our overall standard of living. They're taking on the big picture, and it's ambitious because there are so many variables. But they are able to come up with a convincing range of estimates for the returns, all of them impressive.

On the conservative end of their estimates, says Jones, investing $1 in R&D yields about $5 in returns—defined in this case as additional GDP per person (basically, how much richer we become). Change some of the assumptions—for example, by attempting to account for the value of better medicines and improved health care, which aren't fully captured in GDP—and you get even larger payoffs.

While the $5 return is at the low end of their estimates, it's still “a remarkably good investment,” Jones says. “There aren't many where you put in $1 and get $5 back.""

That's the return for the nation's overall R&D funding. But what do we get for government-funded R&D in particular? Andrew Fieldhouse, an economist at Texas A&M, and Karel Mertens at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas looked specifically at how changes in public R&D spending affect the total factor productivity (TFP) of businesses. A favorite metric of economists, TFP is driven by new technologies and innovative business know-how—not by adding more workers or machines—and is the main driver of the nation's prosperity over the long term.

The economists tracked changes in R&D spending at five major US science funding agencies over many decades to see how the shifts eventually affected private-sector productivity. They found that the government was getting a huge bang for its nondefense R&D buck.

Artificial intelligence could put us on the path to a booming economic future, but getting there will take some serious course corrections.

The benefits begin kicking in after around five to 10 years and often have a long-lasting impact on the economy. Nondefense public R&D funding has been responsible for 20% to 25% of all private-sector productivity growth in the country since World War II, according to the economists. It's an astonishing number, given that the government invests relatively little in nondefense R&D. For example, its spending on infrastructure, another contributor to productivity growth, has been far greater over those years.

The large impact of public R&D investments also provides insight into one of America's most troubling economic mysteries: the slowdown in productivity growth that began in the 1970s, which has roiled the country's politics as many people face stunted living standards and limited financial prospects. Their research, says Fieldhouse, suggests that as much as a quarter of that slowdown was caused by a decline in public R&D funding that happened roughly over the same time.

After reaching a high of 1.86% of GDP in 1964, federal R&D spending began dropping. Starting in the early 1970s, TFP growth also began to decline, from above 2% a year in the late 1960s to somewhere around 1% since the 1970s (with the exception of a rise during the late 1990s), roughly tracking the spending declines with a lag of a few years.

If in fact the productivity slowdown was at least partially caused by a drop in public R&D spending, it's evidence that we would be far richer today if we had kept up a higher level of science investment. And it also flags the dangers of today's proposed cuts. “Based on our research,” says Fieldhouse, “I think it's unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there's going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable.”

Though the Trump administration's proposed 2026 budget would slash science budgets to an unusual degree, public funding of R&D has actually been in slow decline for decades. Federal funding of science is at its lowest rate in the last 70 years, accounting for only around 0.6% of GDP.

Even as public funding has dropped, business R&D investments have steadily risen. Today businesses spend far more than the government; in 2023, companies invested about $700 billion in R&D while the US government spent $172 billion, according to data from the NSF's statistical agency. You might think, Good—let companies do research. It's more efficient. It's more focused. Keep the government out of it.

But there is a big problem with that argument. Publicly funded research, it turns out, tends to lead to relatively more productivity growth over time because it skews more toward fundamental science than the applied work typically done by companies.

In a new working paper called “Public R&D Spillovers and Productivity Growth,” Arnaud Dyèvre, an assistant professor at of economics at HEC Paris, documents the broad and often large impacts of so-called knowledge spillovers—the benefits that flow to others from work done by the original research group. Dyèvre found that the spillovers of public-funded R&D have three times more impact on productivity growth across businesses and industries than those from private R&D funding.

The findings are preliminary, and Dyèvre is still updating the research—much of which he did as a postdoc at MIT—but he says it does suggest that the US “is underinvesting in fundamental R&D,” which is heavily funded by the government. “I wouldn't be able to tell you exactly which percentage of R&D in the US needs to be funded by the government or what percent needs to be funded by the private sector. We need both,” he says. But, he adds, “the empirical evidence” suggests that “we're out of balance.”

Getting the balance of funding for fundamental science and applied research right is just one of the big questions that remain around R&D funding. In mid-July, Open Philanthropy and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, both nonprofit organizations, jointly announced that they planned to fund a five-year “pop-up journal” that would attempt to answer many of the questions still swirling around how to define and optimize the ROI of research funding.

“There is a lot of evidence consistent with a really high return to R&D, which suggests we should do more of it,” says Matt Clancy, a senior program officer at Open Philanthropy. “But when you ask me how much more, I don't have a good answer. And when you ask me what types of R&D should get more funding, we don't have a good answer.”

Pondering such questions should keep innovation economists busy for the next several years. But there is another mystifying piece of the puzzle, says Northwestern's Jones. If the returns on R&D investments are so high—the kind that most venture capitalists or investors would gladly take—why isn't the government spending more?

""I think it's unambiguously clear that if you actually slash the budget of the NIH by 40%, if you slash the NSF budget by 50%, there's going to be a deceleration in US productivity growth over the next seven to 10 years that will be measurable.""

Jones, who served as a senior economic advisor in the Obama administration, says discussions over R&D budgets in Washington are often “a war of anecdotes.” Science advocates cite the great breakthroughs that resulted from earlier government funding, while budget hawks point to seemingly ludicrous projects or spectacular failures. Both have plenty of ammunition. “People go back and forth,” says Jones, “and it doesn't really lead to anywhere.”

The policy gridlock is rooted in in the very nature of fundamental research. Today's science will lead to great advances. And there will be countless failures; a lot of money will be wasted on fruitless experiments. The problem, of course, is that when you're deciding to fund new projects, it's impossible to predict which the outcome will be, even in the case of odd, seemingly silly science. Guessing just what research will or will not lead to the next great breakthrough is a fool's errand.

Take the cuts in the administration's proposed fiscal 2026 budget for the NSF, a leading funder of basic science. The administration's summary begins with the assertion that its NSF budget “is prioritizing investments that complement private-sector R&D and offer strong potential to drive economic growth and strengthen U.S. technological leadership.” So far, so good. It cites the government's commitment to AI and quantum information science. But dig deeper and you will see the contradictions in the numbers.

Not only is NSF's overall budget cut by 57%, but funding for physical sciences like chemistry and materials research—fields critical to advancing AI and quantum computers—has also been blown apart. Funding for the NSF's mathematical and physical sciences program was reduced by 67%. The directorate for computer and information science and engineering fared little better; its research funding was cut by 66%.

There is a great deal of hope among many in the science community that Congress, when it passes the actual 2026 budget, will at least partially reverse these cuts. We'll see. But even if it does, why attack R&D funding in the first place? It's impossible to answer that without plunging into the messy depths of today's chaotic politics. And it is equally hard to know whether the recent evidence gathered by academic economists on the strong returns to R&D investments will matter when it comes to partisan policymaking.

But at least those defending the value of public funding now have a far more productive way to make their argument, rather than simply touting past breakthroughs. Even for fiscal hawks and those pronouncing concerns about budget deficits, the recent work provides a compelling and simple conclusion: More public funding for basic science is a sound investment that makes us more prosperous. 

It's the most transparent estimate yet from one of the big AI companies, and a long-awaited peek behind the curtain for researchers.

The embryos were created in 1994, while the expectant father was still a toddler, and donated via a Christian “embryo adoption” agency.

Turns out an iPhone can be too thin and too light—maybe. That's what I realized as I picked up the iPhone Air off the ground and inspected it for damage.

Moments earlier, Apple's thinnest iPhone ever—a 5.6mm glass and titanium metal sandwich that makes the previous thinnest iPhone, the 6.9mm iPhone 6, look fat by comparison—had flown out of my hands and fallen onto its screen, just as I pulled it out of my pocket.

The good news is that the iPhone Air was largely undamaged. There were a few very minor scuffs on the corners, but the 6.5-inch display was scratch-free. On the one hand, the accidental durability test showed me just how tough the iPhone Air is. But on the other hand, I regret not protecting it in the bumper, clear case, or crossbody strap that Apple also included with the loaner phone. As I walked to the subway station, I attached the new MagSafe Battery pack to the iPhone Air and nodded at how the accessory gave it a little more heft for a better grip. The iPhone Air needed recharging, anyway. Its battery was down to 17% after a day of normal usage.

iPhone Air

Apple's thinnest phone ever is a marvel of engineering, but it comes with tradeoffs to the camera and battery life that may not be acceptable for everyone.

Pros

Cons

There's no dispute that the iPhone Air is a marvel of engineering. Nearly all screen and battery, the device, which starts at $999, feels like the closest thing to holding a sheet of glass in your hand. Without a case or battery pack, it's so thin and slippery that I didn't foresee it soaring through the air like a frisbee. It's not the best value iPhone in Apple's new lineup; that's the iPhone 17, which starts at $799. And it's not the most feature-packed and powerful; that's the iPhone 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max, which start at $1,099 and $1,199, respectively. The iPhone Air is Apple's latest stab at a different class of smartphone—it previously tried a Mini and Plus-sized iPhone—but this time with more of the company's classic design appeal front and center.

After a week of testing the whole family of new iPhones, I remain drawn to the iPhone Air the most, even with its compromises to the camera and battery life. It's so damn hard to resist. The big question is whether or not consumers will buy skinny phones. The iPhone Mini and iPhone Plus each lasted only a few years before being discontinued. Will the iPhone Air suffer the same fate?

You really have to hold the iPhone Air in your own hands to believe that it's a real, fully functional phone and not a dummy unit like the ones you may find at a retail store. While not the lightest iPhone that Apple has ever made, the iPhone Air holds that distinction compared to the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros. With its weight distributed across its skinny footprint, the phone feels smaller than it actually is. I prefer my phone in the 6.1 to 6.3-inch screen range, so that I can comfortably use it with one hand and fit it into my pants pocket without it popping out. I can still do both with the iPhone Air and its 6.5-inch display. I get the appeal for the massive 6.9-inch screen on the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but that's too much of a tank for me.

I already told you how scratch and crack-resistant the iPhone Air is thanks to its Ceramic Shield 2 glass front and Ceramic Shield glass back. But what about bendability? The iPhone 6 attracted the wrong kind of attention when people found it could easily bend. You don't need to worry about bendgate 2.0 because the titanium frame is incredibly strong. Apple encouraged me to try to bend it in half with as much force as I could. I could see the iPhone Air bow, but it always reverted back to its shape. After the original bendgate over a decade ago, I'm glad Apple is so confident in the iPhone Air's rigidity.

The thinness does come at the expense of a few features missing from the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros (at least for the U.S. models). You only get a mono speaker, though I found it to be loud and clear, just not as full as stereo speakers. There's also no mmWave 5G, which I personally don't care for since I've never once experienced the blistering fast cellular connectivity since it launched half a decade ago.

I love tech specs as much as any other gearhead, but I couldn't rattle the display specs for the iPhone Air off the top of my head without looking at Apple's product page. The quality of the screens in premium smartphones peaked years ago. They're plenty bright, high-res, and vibrant enough. As far as I can tell, the iPhone Air has the same display specs as the iPhone 17 and 17 Pros.

I really have no complaints about the Super Retina XDR display. It's got great viewing angles, especially outdoors when it can hit a peak brightness of 3,000 nits; colors look rich and blacks are inky thanks to OLED; and the new anti-glare coating really does reduce reflections. And just like the family of iPhone 17 devices, the screen supports up to 120Hz refresh rates, or what Apple calls “ProMotion” and has an always-on screen. The Dynamic Island sits a little lower than on other iPhones, but other than that, this is as good as a screen gets on a phone.

You'd think that such a skinny phone would come with major compromises to performance, right? That wasn't the case in my testing. Apple could have easily used a less powerful chip, but it decided to stuff an A19 Pro chip inside and let it rip. That's the same desktop-level chip inside the iPhone 17 Pros with a 6-core CPU. The only difference between the A19 Pro chips in the iPhone Air versus the 17 Pros is that there's one fewer GPU core, five instead of six.

As expected, the A19 Pro chip is insanely powerful and smokes the best Android phones powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets. Do you need all this power if you're only doing basic phone things like browsing the web, sending messages, checking emails, watching videos, and taking photos? Not at all. But if you play 3D games or do anything that may make use of the new neural accelerators that are baked into the GPU, then you'll appreciate the headroom. Apple Intelligence still mostly stinks, but that may not be the case starting next year if Apple gets its AI plans back on track, so the performance could come in clutch very soon.

I don't think many iPhone Air users will push the performance too hard; get a 17 Pro if you want the best performance and, most importantly, sustained performance, thanks to the vapor chamber cooling that keeps the 17 Pros from getting hot enough to fry eggs.

On the topic of cooling, the iPhone Air's thin chassis means there's less room for heat dissipation. Apple cleverly moved the A19 Pro and all of the core components into the oval-shaped “plateau” that also houses the single-rear camera, but that doesn't completely alleviate the iPhone Air from getting warm. It never got hot, but I noticed the area just below the plateau could get toasty when I was playing Genshin Impact or doing anything more graphics-intensive, like a long FaceTime call with my girlfriend. Something to watch out for if you pick up an iPhone Air is potential throttling. Every once in a while, apps would freeze and become unresponsive. I especially noticed this when using GPU-heavy apps or trying to multitask (i.e. watching a video in picture-in-picture mode while using another app like Messages). I tried troubleshooting the anecdotal latency with Apple—buttons could become untappable or scrolling with lag just a sec or two—but in the end, it's hard to know if I got a lemon review unit or it's just bugginess in iOS 26. It's possible it may be the buggy new software; I've been experiencing similar random Liquid Glass sluggishness within apps on my updated iPhone 16 Pro. I wouldn't say there's any major throttling to worry about, but I am hoping responsiveness stabilizes soon. (Or maybe, I really did get a lemon review unit.)

I'm a big camera guy, so it was an adjustment going from the triple-lens camera on my iPhone 16 Pro to the single-lens shooter on the iPhone Air. (I'll get to the new Center Stage selfie camera in a moment.) The rear camera is a 48-megapixel image sensor that's the same one inside the iPhone 17's main “wide” camera. Apple calls it a Fusion camera because, by default, it creates 24-megapixel photos taken from the information of the 48-megapixel sensor. The Fusion camera also has multiple virtual lenses that provide more focal lengths (26mm, 28mm, 35mm, and 52mm, aka 2x optical-quality zoom) to frame shots. It's a solid single camera with good sharpness and wide dynamic range.

Frankly, the photos look great if you're just posting them to social media or sending them in a messaging app, which is what 99% of people do. There were times when I missed the ultrawide and telephoto lenses on my iPhone 16 Pro, but I found the 2x optical-quality zoom more than sufficient for most photos and videos I take. Still, it's hard to give Apple a pass for a single-lens camera when Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge has an additional ultrawide while still being a thin 5.8mm phone.

The real star of the show is the 18-megapixel Center Stage camera on the front. This new square image sensor solves one of the biggest problems with using a modern (read: big) phone for taking selfies: doing finger gymnastics to hold an iPhone up and then tapping the shutter button without dropping it. The Center Stage camera lets you take horizontal selfies while holding the iPhone Air vertically or vertical photos while holding the phone horizontally. The variable orientation not only means it's easier to hold your phone while taking selfies, but aligns your eyes closer to the center of the screen instead of to the side in photos. All my selfies look so much better because of this. The feature also works for video. Everybody that I've talked to has been very excited for the Center Stage camera over any increased sharpness to the rear cameras. Additionally, a new Dual Capture lets you record video from both the rear camera and the selfie camera (in a picture-in-picture format). It's useful for reaction videos where you want to capture the moment, but also how you were feeling as it happened. Third-party apps like Filmic Pro have been able to do this, but now it's built into the Camera app. I have a feeling it's going to be very popular and more so than recording spatial video or turning on action or cinematic mode.

The elephant in the iPhone Air room is none other than battery life. Super-thin phones simply have less physical space to fit the kinds of big lithium-ion battery cells to get extraordinary battery life. If you want the longest battery life, you really gotta go with the iPhone 17 Pros. Apple advertises up to 33 hours of video playback on the 17 Pro and up to 39 hours on the 17 Pro Max. The iPhone 17 comes in third with up to 30 hours of video playback.

In comparison, the iPhone Air is advertised with up to 27 hours of video playback. Although I didn't do any battery rundown tests with a video playing continuously to confirm that number, I do own an iPhone 16 Pro, which gets the same 27 hours of video playback. Similarly, the iPhone 16 Plus is advertised with the same video playback hours. With the identical hours for video playback, I expected the iPhone Air to last about the same. In my totally unscientific daily testing, I would say the iPhone Air has good battery life, but my iPhone 16 Pro still had more juice by the end of the day. Is it deal-breaking, poor battery life like many people have been fearing? Absolutely not. On one light day, I made it through 13 hours on a single charge and still had 15% left. I popped on the $99 iPhone Air MagSafe Battery pack, and any shred of battery anxiety disappeared after it recharged past 20%, which is what iPhones consider low power.

Of course, I wish the iPhone Air had longer battery life, and of course, I wish that Apple had made the phone another millimeter or two thicker to fit a bigger battery. Or hell, nix the Camera Control to fit more battery. But for a first-gen model in this new Air class, the battery is fine. Most people are perfectly fine topping off their phones midday at home or at work. And most people are okay with carrying a portable battery for charging up their phone or wireless earbuds. Apple has optimized hard for “all-day” battery life, from the custom and power-efficient A19 Pro chip to the C1X modem to the N1 chip (for Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Threads connectivity) to supporting only eSIM. It's very clear that Apple engineered the iPhone Air with battery life top of mind. But physics is physics, and while the MagSafe Battery pack is a serviceable way to extend the iPhone Air's battery life, people are always gonna demand more. The original MacBook Air had terrible battery life, and then it became best-in-class within a few generations. I can't see battery life for the iPhone Air going anywhere but up in future models.

Whether it's the right iPhone for you or not, I believe the iPhone Air is here to stay. Bulbous “plateau” aside, it feels like the smartphone that Apple has been trying to make since Steve Jobs changed everything with the original iPhone—a pane of glass that you manipulate with touch. It's, dare I say, in Apple parlance “magical” even when I know the iPhone 17 gets you more bang for your buck and the iPhone 17 Pros have no compromises at the expense of thicker and heavier designs with higher price tags. Much like the MacBook Air, I can't help but love that the iPhone Air weighs and feels like almost nothing. I've been an iPhone Pro user since the 11 Pro, and I haven't had to decide between a Pro-level iPhone and any other model. But I'm seriously leaning toward the iPhone Air, especially in Space Black, which makes the profile appear even thinner. (No offense to Sky Blue fans, but the color just doesn't do anything for me.) It's the new aspirational iPhone, not the people's choice or professional device.

If nothing else, and the iPhone Air doesn't connect with consumers and ends up going the way of the dodo like the iPhone Mini and Plus, the compact design could be a glimpse of the long-rumored, book-style foldable iPhone that may come out next year, according to the latest reports. If I put two iPhone Airs side by side and squint, I could see a foldable similar to the excellent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, but running iOS and with all the Apple features that you can't get on Android or elsewhere. Or maybe the iPhone Air is a testbed for miniaturizing components into a smart glasses form factor.

Reviews for the Apple Watch SE 3, Series 11, and Ultra 3 came out today. I'm in the process of reviewing them. I only have two wrists, and there are three Apple Watches to review—so yeah. Besides, I need to collect more health data before I feel comfortable giving my definitive take. If you're reading reviews and asking yourself whether or not you should get any of the new models when they become available this Friday, Sept. 19, maybe I can help you make a decision.

As I said in my hands-on with the Apple Watches after the Awe Jawdropping event last week, Apple's trio of new smartwatches are a relatively straightforward refresh. All three models are available in GPS-only or GPS + cellular models, come with 5G connectivity (for cellular models), have S10 chipsets, and include 64GB of internal storage.

Get the Apple Watch SE 3 if you don't need the latest and greatest that Apple has to offer in a wrist computer and only need the basics like excellent health and fitness tracking, an always-on display for telling the time (finally), and you don't want to pay too much. The Watch SE 3 is a terrific value starting at $250. The SE 3 gets up to 18 hours of battery life with a single charge.

Get the Apple Watch Series 11 if you want some more bells and whistles like slightly larger and brighter displays, a slightly thinner design, ECG, blood oxygen tracking (via the iPhone app), and a more advanced optical heart rate sensor for more accurate health and fitness tracking. The Series 11 also comes in titanium finishes, whereas the SE 3 is available only with aluminum cases. The Series 11 gets longer battery life compared to the SE 3—up to 24 hours with a single charge.

The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is the most feature-packed smartwatch that Apple sells. It's got everything the Series 11 has, plus an even bigger display, satellite connectivity (emergency SOS and messages), and the longest battery of any Apple Watch at up to 42 hours with a single charge.

That all sounds self-explanatory—options for good, better, and best—but what if you already own an Apple Watch? Should you upgrade beyond getting longer battery life? Because let's be real, if you've had your Apple Watch for even a year and you're consistently using it to track workouts, the battery is dying at a faster rate than if you're just using it to tell the time and get notifications. Also, the batteries in Apple Watches aren't going to last forever; they'll inevitably go kaput one day or just not hold as long a charge with time.

If you're in that boat, you really have to ask yourself: Do you care about hypertension notifications and the new Sleep Score?

Hypertension, also known commonly as chronic high blood pressure, is a life-threatening condition that can oftentimes cause heart attacks or damage your organs. It's called the “silent killer” because you typically won't see symptoms. That's where hypertension notifications come in. The feature received FDA clearance on Monday and will be made available in over 150 countries. The Series 11 and Ultra 3 can send hypertension notifications using data collected from their optical heart sensors, which is then processed through a “machine learning-based algorithm” designed from studies that included over 100,000 participants, according to Apple. “Apple Watch looks at your heart data and searches for patterns associated with hypertension,” reads the hypertension notifications setup screen within the Health app. The Apple Watch is not measuring blood pressure; it's merely looking for the patterns that may match with hypertension victims.

Setting up hypertension notifications is simple enough, but it's not something you'll be able to fire up on command on your Apple Watch. “The algorithm works passively in the background reviewing data over 30-day periods, and will notify users if it detects consistent signs of hypertension,” Apple states in a press release. Basically, if you're 22 years or older and you're not pregnant, there's no reason not to turn it on. Ideally, you'll never get a hypertension notification, which would indicate you're a healthy human and have nothing to worry about. But if you do, at the very least you can take some preventive care if it's not yet serious. The notifications could potentially save your life.

The other big Apple Watch feature that Apple announced last week is Sleep Score. This is a feature for all three of the new Apple Watches, including the SE 3. For me, it's a big finally moment, as I've long found the sleep tracking on Apple Watches to be lacking compared to wearables made by other companies. Similar to the Activity Rings, Sleep Score is a way to measure three sleeping metrics: duration, bedtime, and interruptions. These three pieces of data are represented in a ring or “donut” as Apple told me (see photo at the very top), and they appear thicker or thinner based on how you achieve each one. You're then assigned a score and one of five classifications (very low, low, OK, high, and excellent). The idea is that, at a glance, you can quickly see how well you slept and potentially make changes to improve any of the three metrics. In a way, it's almost like gamifying sleep by guilting you into improving your Sleep Score and then maintaining it.

I've been an insomniac for the past year and, admittedly, my Sleep Score has been ranking “low” the past week. Has the Sleep Score made me feel ashamed that I have not corrected my sleep? 100%. But I'm also very good at ignoring it, even when I know I have sleeping problems. Of course, that's just me; I also ignore my Activity Rings more than I should and don't stand when my Apple Watch tells me to. Just a few minutes before writing this, I saw the notification and just blew it off! Setting my own bad habits aside, Sleep Score is thoughtfully designed.

Now, back to the question of whether you should buy any of the new Apple Watches for these two features. If you want the latest and greatest Apple Watches, then by all means. But there's really good news! If you own a Watch Series 6 or later, SE 2, or Ultra and later, you get Sleep Score for free in the just-released watchOS 26. If you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or later, or an Ultra 2 (sorry, OG Ultra owners), you get hypertension notifications for free in the same software update. So check your Apple Watch model and think a little bit about whether these features appeal to you or not. You may be able to save a few hundred bucks just by downloading the new update.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","China Just Fired Its Latest Shot in the Chip Wars — and Nvidia Took the Hit","https://gizmodo.com/china-bans-nvidias-ai-chips-2000659928","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:20:08 GMT","

Nvidia just can't seem to catch a break.

After beating a ban on China sales imposed by the Trump administration, the tech giant is now facing a ban on its products by Chinese regulators.

Chinese internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered top Chinese tech companies like Bytedance and Alibaba to end their testing and orders of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chips, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Nvidia unveiled the RTX Pro 6000D chip, a lower tech chip designed just to be sold in China under compliance with American export control rules, earlier this year. The chips were initially designed to fill the void left by the then-banned H20 chips, another lower tech China-only chip. The H20s were recently reapproved for sale by the U.S. but orders have not yet begun shipping out. China is also advocating for the U.S. government to approve the sale of higher tech Blackwell chips to China.

The move comes as the latest breaking point of a fraying relationship between China and Nvidia.

Last month, Chinese authorities started questioning and cautioning industry titans like Tencent over their purchases of Nvidia's H20 chips, according to Reuters.

“We can only be in service of a market if a country wants us to be,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at a press conference on Wednesday in response to a question about the China CAC. “I'm disappointed with what I see but they have larger agendas to work out between China and the United States. And I'm patient about it. We'll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.”

Nvidia has been caught up in the middle of a trade storm between the two countries.

The Biden administration was first to enforce export restrictions on Nvidia chips sold to China, in an effort to curb the entry of high-tech chips into China off of national security and competitive fears. The restrictions expanded for a while before they were relaxed again under Trump after Beijing landed a big blow to domestic AI confidence earlier this year with DeepSeek's R1, an AI model that rivaled the best of American companies offerings using lower cost chips, inadvertently showing Americans that Chinese innovation did not require the top Nvidia chips.

The trade dispute has since gone beyond just chips to include discussions over TikTok and rare earth metals, of which China controls roughly 90% of the world's supply.

China's AI industry was largely dependent on American chipmaker Nvidia's chips but that might all be changing soon. After Trump's blanket ban earlier this year choked off the Chinese industry from access to Nvidia chips, Chinese chip development has ramped up. China chip stocks have experienced a major boom so big that the Beijing-based company Cambricon had to warn investors recently.

“The message is now loud and clear,” an unnamed Chinese tech executive told the FT. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it's all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Although no chip, Chinese-made or otherwise, has been considered up to par with Nvidia's offerings, the Financial Times article paints a different picture.

After talking to top Chinese tech companies Huawei, Cambricon, Alibaba, and Baidu about their chip development, Beijing has concluded that Chinese AI processors are now comparable or even better than the downgraded Nvidia products that are allowed into China, according to the FT, citing a person with knowledge of the matter.

The Chinese chip industry is having a good day. Alibaba shares rose after the company secured a prominent Chinese customer, state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom, for its new AI chips. Baidu's shares in Hong Kong jumped by the most they have in more than three years after analysts voiced confidence in the search engine operator's chip venture.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Disney and Webtoon's Partnership Is Leading to a Massive New Comics App","https://gizmodo.com/disney-webtoon-digital-comics-app-marvel-unlimited-2000659079","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:36:06 GMT","

Last month, Webtoon announced a major new deal with Disney to bring a litany of original licensed stories and past comics from across a whole host of past Disney-branded comics, including the Marvel Comics library, to the scrolling format that has made Webtoon a significant force in the comics space. Today, however, the two companies confirmed that those plans are actually much, much bigger.

Today Webtoon Entertainment confirmed that Disney would be acquiring a 2% equity interest in the company as part of a non-binding term sheet that will also see the two companies develop a brand new digital comics platform that will be home to “current comic book runs and include decades of past comics from across Disney's portfolio, including Marvel, Star Wars, 20th Century Studios, and more,” according to a press release.

The new, currently unnamed platform will host over 35,000 comics and is framed in the announcement as “an expansion upon Marvel Unlimited.” It's currently unclear whether or not the new platform, which will be operated by Webtoon, will be set up to replace Marvel Unlimited, the publisher's digital comics platform and subscription service that first launched in 2007. That said, further information provided by the companies says that the new platform will “provide decades of iconic comics for current Marvel Unlimited subscribers and bring in even more fans to experience storytelling from across the Disney portfolio along with a selection of Webtoon Original stories,” suggesting that the Unlimited subscription will continue to exist in some capacity alongside the new platform.

Subscribers to Disney+ will also be able to read a curated selection of comics in the new app as part of the streaming service's perks program, and the new app is described as including “a mix of vertical and traditional formats” across its library of archived comics, current runs, and original content made by Disney and Webtoon, similar to how Marvel Unlimited currently includes scrolling-format exclusive series as part of its Infinity Comics line as well as standard digital comic formats. The new platform will also feature select translations of material for Korean and Japanese audiences.

The news comes in the wake of last August's announcement that Webtoon will bring a selection of recent Marvel Comics output to its own service in the next few years, including the latest volume of Amazing Spider-Man, the 2015 revival of Marvel's Star Wars ongoing, Jonathan Hickman's 2012 Avengers run, and the 2021 Alien series, alongside a new adaptation of the 2016 Liz Braswell novel, As Old As Time: A Twisted Tale.

“With a new platform that will combine our product and technical expertise with Disney's full comic catalog, we're giving new and longtime fans all over the world a new way to discover these legendary characters and stories,” Junkoo Kim, Webtoon Entertainment's CEO, said in a provided statement. “Disney's extraordinary storytelling legacy is second to none, and we're honored to work with them to build the future of digital comics. This is a powerful next step for our growing global business, and a strong foundation for even greater collaboration with Disney in the years ahead.”

The news of Disney and Webtoon's partnership comes at an interesting time for digital comics, as the industry has seen a collapse into siloed, publisher-specific services in the wake of Amazon's disastrous handling of Comixology, leading to the marketplace's shuttering and folding into the retailer's Kindle service in 2023. The union between one of the biggest studios in the world and one of the biggest digital comics platforms around will certainly raise some eyebrows.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Jack Black and Paul Rudd's Meta ‘Anaconda' Trailer Goes Full ‘Tropic Thunder'","https://gizmodo.com/anaconda-reboot-trailer-paul-rudd-jack-black-2000659945","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:00:33 GMT","

Sony Pictures Entertainment finally released the official trailer for a new Anaconda remake, starring Paul Rudd and Jack Black, transforming the creature feature into a full-on comedy.

The first time we heard of an Anaconda remake was last December. In it, Rudd and Black essentially gave us a vibe check that their remake of the film would lean heavily into the campy nature of the 1997 flick starring Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, and Jon Voight. Before that, all we knew about the plot was that it would be a “reimagined comedy” about “a group of friends facing midlife crises who are remaking their favorite movie from their youth.” And sure enough, that's what the two-and-a-half-minute trailer gave us in all its Black and Rudd glory.

In the trailer, we see Black, in no uncertain terms, walk into Rudd's house in a huff, saying, “Let's reboot Anaconda.” Contrary to other reboots of '80s and '90s films, Rudd and Black's premise is a sort of fake reboot within a reboot. If you smell toast, please take a moment to compose yourself. True to form, we jump to Rudd and Black assembling a crew on a boat just like in the OG film. The only problem is how they're going to go about funding their passion project. They settle on shooting it “indie style,” producing the film by staging its events with a professional snake handler and your garden-variety anaconda, who they promptly kill on set by accident.

All of these comedies of errors lead to their crew traipsing in the jungle for another snake and getting more than they bargained for when a big-ass anaconda shows up. Naturally, a movie trailer rendition of Sir Mix-A-Lot's chorus to “Baby Got Back” is spliced throughout the trailer, making it only a matter of time before its next trailer features Nicki Minaj's version.

Directed by Tom Gormican (The Incredible Weight of Massive Talent), Anaconda also stars Thandiwe Newton, Steve Zahn, Daniela Melchior, and Selton Mello. Given Hollywood's recent rollout of remakes of classics like Ice Cube's infamously weird War of the Worlds, it's at least admirable and honestly pretty charming that the Anaconda reboot is taking a kind of Tropic Thunder approach to the movie that's sure to get butts in seats out of genuine and morbid curiosity to see if the film didn't give away all of its best comedic bits in the trailer.

Folks won't have long to wait and find out whether the reboot comedy Anaconda sticks its landing because it's set to release in theaters this Christmas.

In recent years, legislation aimed at restricting access to online porn sites has become more and more popular in conservative states, but in Michigan, lawmakers have just introduced a bill that would ban all online pornography, full stop.

The legislation, which offers a deeply draconian perspective on human sexuality, was introduced on Sept. 11th, and its primary sponsor is Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford). The “Anticorruption of Public Morals Act,” which sounds like a bill whose name (and contents) were sourced from the 1930s, would ban all “pornographic material.” What does that mean? According to the bill text, it means “content, digital, streamed, or otherwise distributed on the internet, the primary purpose of which is to sexually arouse or gratify, including videos, erotica, magazines, stories, manga, material generated by artificial intelligence, live feeds, or sound clips.”

That, uh, sure sounds like a lot. Additionally, the bill would also define “any depiction or description of trans people as pornographic,” which means that such depictions would also be banned, 404 Media writes. Indeed, while the bill text does not include any specific mentions of trans people as a group, it does include a stipulation that would ban the following category of media: “a depiction, description, or simulation, whether real, animated, digitally generated, written, or auditory, that includes a disconnection between biology and gender by an individual of biological sex imitating, depicting, or representing himself or herself to be of the other biological sex by means of a combination of attire, cosmetology, or prosthetics, or as having a reproductive nature contrary to the individual's biological sex.”

The bill's top sponsor, Schriver, claims this is all about defending children. “These measures defend children, safeguard our communities, and put families first,” Schriver recently wrote on X. “Obscene and harmful content online threatens Michigan families, especially children.”

Pornography is obviously a complicated subject with a twisty, not altogether politically neat history, and there are plenty of nuanced conversations to be had about it. One thing's for sure: an outright ban on it isn't nuanced, nor does it allow for any conversation at all.

Gizmodo reached out to Schriver's office for comment and will update this story if he responds.

While, in earlier times, third-wave feminists were the ones advocating for an abolition of the porn industry, in recent times, conservatives have led the charge, albeit for an entirely different set of reasons. Earlier this year, rightwing Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which would have effectively criminalized all pornography nationwide. Not much has happened with the bill since it was introduced and referred to a Senate committee. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which many believe has acted as a kind of rightwing policy bible for the Trump administration, has also advocated for criminalizing all pornography.

This could be bad news for Nvidia.

The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the country's top internet regulator, has reportedly banned its biggest tech companies, including ByteDance and Alibaba, from buying Nvidia's AI chips. According to the Financial Times, the CAC said that these institutions should stop testing the new RTX Pro 6000D and cancel their orders, even though several companies had already indicated their interest in purchasing tens of thousands of these GPUs, which were set to replace the H20 after it was banned (but before it was unbanned again). This goes against the initial reports that reception for the more affordable AI China-specific GPU was lukewarm — instead, it turns out that the central government was blocking the purchase of these graphics cards. This new ban comes just weeks after companies were directed to stop ordering Nvidia H20 chips, too.

Beijing reportedly believes that homegrown AI chip makers, like Huawei and Cambricon, now produce chips that have comparable performance to Nvidia's China-only products. And although Team Green might still have an advantage with its software stack, other Chinese tech giants like Tencent are pushing to build their own infrastructure to replace that. Because of these developments, China's chip makers are ramping production in anticipation of the glut of orders coming from companies that need AI chips but can't purchase Nvidia products.

When approached for comment, Nvidia directed us to remarks made by CEO Jensen Huang in London on Wednesday morning. ""We can only be in service of a market if the country wants us to be,"" adding, ""I'm disappointed with what I see. But they have larger agendas to work out, between China and the US, and I'm understanding of that. We are patient about it. We'll continue to be supportive of the Chinese government and Chinese companies as they wish.” Huang told reporters in London on Wednesday that he hopes to discuss Nvidia's ability to do business in China with President Trump during the latter's state visit to the UK.

This news comes soon after the country accused Nvidia of breaking its anti-monopoly law, with the chipmaker facing fines of up to 10% of its China revenue. However, some also believe that Beijing is making these moves to get a more favorable deal from the U.S. in trade negotiations, especially as export approval for its Blackwell-based B30 chips, which perform up to 80% of its latest products, is still up in the air.

On the other hand, some Chinese industry leaders believe that this move is part of the central government's effort to break free from American technology and boost its homegrown semiconductor industry. “The message is now loud and clear,” one executive told the Financial Times. “Earlier, people had hopes of renewed Nvidia supply if the geopolitical situation improves. Now it's all hands on deck to build the domestic system.”

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have unveiled a new approach to chipmaking that uses lasers with a 6.5nm ~ 6.7nm wavelength — also known as Soft X-rays — that could increase the resolution of lithography tools to 5nm and below, reports Cosmos, citing a paper published in Nature. 

The scientists call their method 'beyond-EUV' — suggesting that their technology could replace industry-standard EUV lithography — but the researchers admit they are currently years away from building even an experimental B-EUV tool.

The most advanced chips nowadays are made using EUV lithography, which operates at a wavelength of 13.5 nm and can produce features as small as 13nm (Low-NA EUV of 0.33 numerical aperture), 8nm (High-NA EUV of 0.55 NA), or even 4nm ~ 5nm (Hyper-NA EUV on 0.7 – 0.75 NA) at the cost of extreme complexity of the lithography systems that have very advanced optics that cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 

By using a shorter wavelength, researchers from Johns Hopkins University can get an intrinsic resolution boost even with lenses with moderate NA. However, they face many challenges with B-EUV. 

Firstly, B‑EUV light sources are not yet ready. Various researchers have tried multiple methods of generating 6.7 nm wavelength radiation (e.g., gadolinium laser-produced plasma), but there is no industry-standard approach. Secondly, these shorter wavelengths — due to their high photon energy — interact poorly with traditional photoresist materials used in chipmaking. Thirdly, because 6.5nm ~ 6.7nm wavelength light is absorbed rather than reflected by pretty much everything, multilayer-coated mirrors for this type of radiation haven't been produced before.

Finally, these lithography tools must be designed from scratch, and currently, there is no ecosystem to support the designs with components and consumables. To sum up, building a B-EUV machine (or Soft X-ray machine?) requires breakthroughs in light sources, projection mirrors, resists, and even consumables like pellicles or photomasks.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University, led by Professor Michael Tsapatsis, explored how certain metals can improve the interaction between B-EUV (around 6 nm wavelength) light and resist materials used in chipmaking (i.e., they did not work on other challenges associated with Soft X-rays).

The team discovered that metals like zinc are able to absorb B-EUV light and emit electrons, which then trigger chemical reactions in organic compounds called imidazoles. These reactions make it possible to etch very fine patterns onto semiconductor wafers. 

Interestingly, while zinc performs poorly with traditional 13.5nm EUV light, it becomes highly effective at shorter wavelengths, highlighting how important it is to match the material with the right wavelength. 

To apply these metal–organic compounds to silicon wafers, the researchers developed a technique called chemical liquid deposition (CLD). This method creates thin, mirror-like layers of a material called aZIF (amorphous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks), growing at a rate of 1nm per second. CLD also allows for fast testing of different metal–imidazole combinations, making it easier to discover the best pairings for different lithography wavelengths. While zinc is well suited for B-EUV, the team noted that other metals might perform better at different wavelengths, offering flexibility for future chipmaking technologies.

This approach gives manufacturers a toolbox of at least 10 metal elements and hundreds of organic ligands to create custom resists tailored to specific lithography platforms, the researchers disclosed.

Although the researchers did not solve the full stack of B-EUV challenges (e.g., source power, masks), they advanced one of the most critical bottlenecks: finding resist materials that can work with 6nm wavelength light. They created the CLD process to apply thin, uniform films of amorphous zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (aZIFs) onto silicon wafers. They experimentally showed that certain metals (like zinc) can absorb Soft X-ray light and emit electrons that trigger chemical reactions in imidazole-based resists.

There are plenty of challenges to be solved with B-EUV, and the technology doesn't have a clear path to the mass market. However, the CLD process can be used pretty widely, both in semiconductor and non-semiconductor applications.

Contract prices jump by up to 20% as AI build-outs drive aggressive cloud procurement and tip the balance of supply.

Contract prices for both NAND and DRAM have jumped by an estimated 15-20% in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to numbers published by DigiTimes on September 17, an off-season surge the publication ties directly to AI infrastructure build-outs and supply tightness.

“Supply shortages led to aggressive procurement from cloud service providers, with high-stack 3D NAND products nearly sold out,” writes DigiTimes, adding that, “3D NAND… has attracted strong priority purchasing interest from CSP customers,” citing demand for faster read speed and larger die capacities. This is a stark difference from the normal Q4 pattern, when component prices typically drift lower.

There are signs that the supply side is tightening. TrendForce says SanDisk pushed for a roughly 10% NAND hike in September, while Micron temporarily suspended DRAM and NAND price quotations to reassess allocations after customer forecasts pointed to shortages. The firm also flags a structural shortage in nearline HDDs that is forcing hyperscalers to accelerate plans for QLC SSD deployments in 2026.

DigiTimes goes further, saying Samsung's next-gen V9 NAND for 2026 is “nearly sold out”, with cloud customers locking in capacity early due to its improved density and cost advantages. A separate TrendForce brief from this week, however, says Samsung has delayed V9 QLC to the first half of 2026, which suggests customers may be reserving capacity ahead of firm volume timing. Either way, it's clear to see that cloud buyers are aggressively securing supply well into the future.

This could easily have a knock-on effect on consumer prices. If hyperscalers are absorbing more wafers for enterprise SSDs while DRAM makers prioritize server parts and HBM, retail pricing is going to lose some of its slack. TrendForce has already warned that legacy DRAM types remain under the most pressure as capacity is reallocated, and if cloud orders continue to rise, the familiar winter bargains on NVMe drives could be thinner than expected.

One tell that money is switching hands is controller specialist Phison's record August figures. It reported a revenue of NT$5.934 billion, up 23% year over year. That's a dramatic jump from last year's weak base. The company has attributed the strength to non-consumer demand and closer tie-ups with NAND makers, which fits the broader theme of data-center-led flash tightness.

The bottom line is that multiple data points now converge on a common theme: AI is rewriting cloud storage hierarchy while HDD supply is constrained and flash makers have more pricing power than they usually do in the year's final quarter. If you're planning an upgrade, watch retail memory prices closely and move quickly when a good price pops up, because it probably won't stick around for long.

28nm today, 7nm tomorrow?

SMIC, the largest foundry in China, is test-driving one of China's first domestic immersion DUV lithography tools, reports Financial Times. The system was developed by Shanghai Yuliangsheng Technology Co., which is linked to Huawei's SiCarrier, and is believed to be a significant part of China's effort to become self-sufficient in wafer fab equipment.

SMIC's test platform from Yuliangsheng involves a DUV machine that uses immersion lithography and is reportedly designed for 28nm-class fabrication technologies, though it could be used for 7nm or even 5nm production nodes by applying multipatterning. The Yuliangsheng tool is mostly made from components sourced within China, although some parts are still imported. The company is actively working to localize the entire supply chain. Once that is achieved (though it is unclear when), it would allow China to operate outside the influence of the U.S. or European export policies in this segment of chip production.

If the description of the tool by Financial Times is accurate, then the Yuliangsheng immersion DUV system currently being tested by SMIC resembles ASML's Twinscan NXT:1950i from 2008, which was designed for 32nm-class process technology in one exposure. The unit featured optics with 1.35 numerical aperture, a 2.5nm overlay, a 38nm resolution, and could be used for making chips on a 22nm-class fabrication node. While theoretically the NXT:1950i could be used to make chips on 7nm and 5nm-class nodes, ASML has developed NXT:2000i for such fabrication technologies, which is generations ahead of the NXT:1950i.

It is unclear whether the Yuliangsheng tool is being tested within SMIC's production flow (i.e., they are producing actual chips or patterns) or if the company is just beginning to test the scanner and has merely reached first light on the wafer or first patterning milestones (a more likely scenario). If it is the latter, then the scanner is years away from mass-producing actual chips. Indeed, the goal is reportedly to integrate domestic immersion DUV lithography machines into production lines starting in 2027, after their qualification. Before that, SMIC will continue to rely on tools from ASML.

It should be noted that while SMIC (and probably Yuliangsheng) believes that it is possible to build chips on 7nm and 5nm-class process technologies on the same tools that are used for 28nm-class production nodes, it remains to be seen whether this is possible without a dramatic improvement of a 28nm-class tool when it comes to overlay performance, precision, control, and complexity. Essentially, after the existing tool matures and gets inserted into SMIC's 28nm flow in 2027, it will take Yuliangsheng years to jump to 16nm and then to 7nm fabrication nodes with a significantly redesigned scanner, so do not expect SMIC's sub-10nm fabrication processes on domestic lithography systems earlier than in 2030.

The tool is codenamed 'Mount Everest,' after the world's tallest mountain, perhaps highlighting the importance of the project. Interestingly, but SiCarrier also tends to call its WFE projects after mountains, which perhaps proves that SiCarrier and Shanghai Yuliangsheng Technology Co. are not only affiliated (SiCarrier is reportedly an investor of Yuliangsheng), but likely belong to the same group working on the same goal. It is noteworthy that Shanghai Yuliangsheng Technology Co. is already known to the U.S. Department of Commerce, which put it into its Entity List in late 2024.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), in addition to climacteric syndrome, has a significant impact on the quality of life in menopausal women. Lifestyle modifications should not be overlooked and should be accompanied by pharmacologic measures in the management of this syndrome.

Menopause affects approximately 14 million women in France alone. Between 20% and 25% of patients experience severe menopause-related symptoms, which significantly impact their quality of life. In France, GSM affects 25%-70% of women during perimenopause or menopause and can be highly debilitating.

Therefore, it is essential to know how to raise the issue and actively look for improvements in the quality of life of these women. In France, 48% of women younger than 50 years consider it difficult to talk about menopause, whether within their relationship or with their healthcare professional, and 34% of women aged 45-54 years said in 2019 that there was not enough information on this subject.

GSM is a term used to define a compilation of signs and symptoms arising from decreased estrogenic stimulation of the vulvovaginal and lower urinary tract. The main signs and symptoms of GSM include burning, irritation, vulvovaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms such as urgency, dysuria, or recurrent urinary tract infection.

Labial atrophy, vaginal introitus narrowing, and clitoral atrophy may also be observed.

Sexual symptoms, including introital dyspareunia and reduced libido (often related to pain), can significantly affect a patient's ability to achieve sexual satisfaction.

A study conducted in Spain found that 75% of women with GSM reported that their symptoms affected their ability to experience sexual pleasure, and 66% noted an impact on sexual spontaneity.

Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and incontinence. Urinary tract infections occur more often.

The main risk factors recognized to be associated with GSM, besides menopause itself, are the absence of vaginal childbirth, alcohol abuse, bilateral oophorectomy, decreased frequency and sexual abstinence, cigarette smoking, nonmenopausal hypoestrogenism, lack of exercise, (premature) ovarian failure, and cancer treatments via pelvic irradiation, chemotherapy, and endocrine agents.

The female genital and lower urinary tracts share a common embryologic origin and express estrogen receptors. Consequently, these tissues are affected by estrogen deficiency during menopause. Estrogen receptor activation stimulates the production of collagen, hyaluronic acid, and elastin, which are essential for maintaining vaginal mucosal health. Reduced levels of these proteins lead to thinning of the vaginal epithelium, resulting in irritation, pruritus, and mucosal sensitivity. Muscle atrophy impairs the contractile function of the bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor muscles. Loss of tissue elasticity contributes to vaginal dryness and deterioration of the genital tract integrity. 

These changes are also accompanied by an increase in vaginal pH and alterations in the vaginal microbiota, notably a decrease in lactobacilli. The vaginal microbiota plays a key role in preventing colonization by pathogens, including those responsible for sexually transmitted infections and urinary tract infections. A microbiota rich in Lactobacillus species is essential for maintaining vaginal health, whereas a lack of these bacteria is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and symptoms such as vaginal dryness.

Each symptom alone may indicate a specific diagnosis; however, in women undergoing menopause or perimenopause, it is important to consider the overall pattern of symptoms and rule out other potential causes of these symptoms. Isolated urinary symptoms should prompt a targeted evaluation of the urinary tract, including urinalysis with dipstick, urine culture, and ultrasound, to identify causes such as polyps or bladder cancer. Sexual symptoms, including reduced libido or dyspareunia, require assessment of the patient's emotional and relational well-being, along with screening for depression or intimate partner violence. Similarly, genital symptoms appearing alone may reflect various gynecologic conditions, including infections, pelvic organ prolapse, and vulvar lichen sclerosus.

The therapeutic goal for GSM is to relieve symptoms by restoring vulvovaginal comfort, improving urinary function, and supporting sexual health. Lifestyle measures, such as stopping tobacco use and maintaining regular sexual activity, when possible, may help in reducing symptoms.

Local nonhormonal treatments are the first-line treatment for GSM, a chronic condition affecting vulvovaginal and urinary health in postmenopausal women. Options include water-, oil-, or hyaluronic acid-based lubricants and vaginal moisturizers, with hyaluronic acid especially useful for genital xerosis.

The French National College of Gynecologists and Obstetricians and GEMVi, a multidisciplinary study group on menopause and hormonal aging, recommend nonhormonal lubricants and vaginal moisturizers as first-line treatments.

The recommendation emphasizes that management must be individualized and should consider symptom severity, quality-of-life impact, and patient preference.

However, nonhormonal treatments are insufficient in a significant number of patients. Local hormonal treatment can then be considered the treatment of choice. Options include vaginal estrogen in the form of suppositories, rings, or creams, which restore vaginal pH, epithelial integrity, and microbiota balance. Dehydroepiandrosterone suppositories are also effective for vulvovaginitis and dyspareunia.

Systemic hormonal treatment may be required in selected cases. Tibolone has beneficial effects on the vagina and bladder. Ospemifene is particularly indicated for the treatment of severe dyspareunia and vaginal dryness.

CO₂ laser treatment is a nonhormonal alternative that has shown effectiveness, particularly for vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms. Treatment restores vaginal epithelium, microbiota, and pelvic vascularization.

GSM affects most postmenopausal women but remains undertreated despite the availability of effective treatments. General practitioners play a key role in the detection of this condition, and early management can improve symptoms and quality of life.

Christos Evangelou, MSc, PhD

 September 17, 2025  

The Female Asian Nonsmoker Screening Study (FANSS) showed a 1.3% lung cancer detection rate among 1000 Asian women with no smoking history.

The findings of FANSS, the largest lung cancer screening program involving a nonsmoking population in the US, were presented at World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC) 2025.

Presenter Elaine Shum, MD, of NYU Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York City, said the 1.3% detection rate in a population excluded from current guidelines raises questions about expanding screening criteria.

Shum noted, during her talk, that lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with incidence expected to continue rising over the next years. Based on the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), current guidelines in the US recommend low-dose CT screening only to individuals with current or former history of heavy smoking.

Shum explained that the research team chose to focus specifically on Asian nonsmoking women because this population faces a disproportionately high risk for lung cancer.

“As a thoracic medical oncologist in New York City, we have a fair amount of Asian patients, and unfortunately, the majority of them with lung cancer have no smoking history and were initially presenting with stage IV disease,” Shum said during an interview with Medscape Medical News.

Previous research has shown that 57% of Asian American women who have lung cancer have never smoked compared with about 15% of all other American women. Shum explained that the reasons behind the higher incidence of lung cancer among Asian women with no smoking history are unknown.

“Going back to the literature, it is well-recognized that Asian women with no smoking history are identified as having higher incidences of lung cancer, particularly associated with driver mutations, for unclear reasons; we felt that starting by screening this population made the most sense at the time,” Shum stated in her interview.

Regarding the potential reasons why Asian women with no smoking history are at a higher incidence of lung cancer, Shum said, “It is not simply a question of heredity, but there is another genetic component to this story that is not yet well-defined.”

The FANSS was designed as a pilot trial to assess the feasibility of lung cancer screening in Asian women with no smoking history. The study enrolled women aged 40-74 years who identified as being of Asian descent and never smoked (defined as fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime). In the interview, Shum explained that the study did not require additional risk factors such as family history of lung cancer, making it a relatively unselected population compared with other screening studies.

One thousand of the 1041 participants who consented to the study completed baseline low-dose CT scans. The median age was 55.9 years, with the majority (84.7%) identifying as Chinese, followed by other East Asian (5.4%), Southeast Asian (4.6%), and South Asian (3.2%) populations. Only 29.7% of the participants reported a family history of lung cancer.

The baseline low-dose CT screening revealed a lung cancer detection rate of 1.3% (13 out of 1000 participants). All detected cancers were adenocarcinomas, which, according to Shum, are the kinds of cancers expected to be seen in never smokers. Most (69.2%) cancers were diagnosed at stage IA, 15.4% at stage IIB, and 15.4% at stage IIIB or IIIC.

During her talk, Shum emphasized that all 13 lung cancers harbored driver mutations: 12 had EGFR mutations (seven with L858R, five with exon 19 deletions) and two had HER2 exon 20 insertions. One participant had two separate primary lung adenocarcinomas with different EGFR mutations.

The Lung-RADS distribution showed that 38.8% of lesions were Lung-RADS 1, 52.1% Lung-RADS 2, 4.1% Lung-RADS 3, and 2.8% Lung-RADS 4. A positive screen was defined as Lung-RADS 3 or 4, occurring in 6.9% (69 of 1000) of participants.

The study also revealed differences in the characteristics of ground-glass nodules, especially in the Lung-RADS 2 group. The screening study detected 142 ground-glass nodules across different Lung-RADS categories, with 67 measuring ≤ 5 mm in the Lung-RADS 2 category, 44 measuring > 5-9 mm, and 11 measuring ≥ 10 mm.

Shum and her colleagues are collecting information about place of birth and time in the US of the study participants to determine if there may be differences in their screening results between participants based on these factors.

To put the FANSS findings into context, Shum compared the 1.3% detection rate in FANSS with those of three previous screening studies involving high-risk individuals: the NLST study involving individuals who have smoked at least 30 pack years and, if former, quit in the previous 15 years; the European NELSON trial involving current smokers; and the TALENT study from Taiwan, which screened Asian men and women who never smoked but had additional risk factors. Detection rates were 1.1% in the NLST trial, 0.9% in the NELSON trial, and 1.5% in the TALENT study.

“While our study is smaller in scale compared to NLST and TALENT, it still represents the largest known lung cancer screening study in the US performed only in a nonsmoking population,” Shum noted in the interview. “In comparison to the lung cancer detection rate in NLST, it is eye-opening to see a rate that is numerically higher than what was observed in a population with a heavy smoking history.”

However, David Baldwin, MD, of Nottingham University Hospitals, who served as discussant for the session, emphasized the need for caution when comparing the FANSS findings to those of the NLST trial.

“In NLST, almost all the overdiagnoses were in the previous pathological type of bronchoalveolar carcinoma, which are mostly sub-solid nodules,” he said in an interview.

According to Shum, the results of FANSS suggest that the development of specific screening and management guidelines for a nonsmoking population compared to a population with a smoking history is necessary.

However, Baldwin noted that for screening to be clinically useful, studies are needed to assess whether early detection will result in a reduction in mortality.

“The issue is whether the cancers detected are those that are responsible for mortality or not; they are all early stage, sub-solid, and mostly EGFR-driven, which have a much better prognosis,” he said in the interview.

During his talk, Baldwin emphasized the need for a better understanding of how to assess lung cancer mortality risk, identify which cancers cause high mortality, learn more about cancer biology, and understand the relationship between early detection and life-years gained.

In the interview, Shum commented on their next steps, noting that “FANSS has demonstrated it is feasible to perform low-dose CTs in a nonsmoking population, and we are excited to expand this concept to other nonsmoking populations as we try to define other high-risk groups.” She added that they are actively developing a larger multicenter study with the goal of generating evidence to inform national screening guidelines that will include a nonsmoking population.

“We have not yet looked at other high groups of nonsmokers, but this would be the plan in our multi-site study,” Shum noted, adding that there is a study that will be looking at those with a family history and screening those family members for lung cancer.

Shum said within the FANSS dataset, she and her colleagues are continuing to work on processing cell-free DNA blood samples and applying artificial intelligence and radiomic technology to the CT scans.

The FANSS was funded by private philanthropy, NYU Lung Cancer Center, Delfi Diagnostics, and the EGFR Resisters Distinguished Young Investigator Research Award. Shum reported financial relationships with AstraZeneca, Blueprint Medicines, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead, Regeneron (honoraria), and Delfi Diagnostics (research funding paid to institution). Baldwin reported financial relationships with AstraZeneca, MSD, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Roche (honoraria).

Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with healthier periodontal conditions, with 112 of 195 participants showing high adherence. Low Mediterranean diet adherence and increased red meat consumption were independently linked to more severe periodontitis and blood markers of inflammation.

“This study shows that low adherence to Mediterranean diet and higher red meat consumption may be associated with severity of periodontal disease. Studies with a larger sample size are needed to further clarify the current findings,” wrote the authors of the study.

The study was led by Giuseppe Mainas, Periodontology Unit, Centre for Host Microbiome Interactions, Faculty of Dentistry, Oral & Craniofacial Sciences, King's College London, London, England. It was published online in the Journal of Periodontology.

According to the authors, the cross-sectional design of the study prevents assessment of causality and allows only for associations to be determined. The relatively small sample size may have resulted in statistical underpower when adjusting for multiple variables. Additionally, while food frequency questionnaires are considered a gold standard for dietary assessment, they may be limited in estimating exact portion sizes and could be subject to recall and social desirability biases.

The study received partial funding through a pump priming grant from the Faculty of Dental Surgery, The Royal College of Surgeons of England, and the British Society of Periodontology in 2024.

Conference MDAngle offers personal perspectives from conference attendees, showcasing their anticipation, quick takeaways, and insights into how the presented research will affect their patients.

The 2025 ECTRIMS meeting will be held from September 24-26 in Barcelona, Spain, and will cover a broad range of topics on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Key topics will include global diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, the role of genetics, novel monoclonal antibodies and CAR T-cell treatments, as well as trial design in MS. The meeting will also highlight presentations on the real-world data on DMTs for RRMS, risk management and treatment de-escalation strategies, and advances in the use of artificial intelligence in MS.

Devon S. Conway, MD, MSAssociate Professor, Department of Neurology, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio“The conferences also often have some real-world data, which is really helpful because clinical trial populations tend to be somewhat distilled. And, when we look at these real-world studies, we can get a better idea of how these drugs are working for our patients with RRMS that we see in clinic, patients who maybe are a little bit older or who have comorbidities.”

Jiwon Oh, MD, PhDAssociate Professor, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, University of Toronto; Medical Director, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, BARLO MS Centre, St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada“One of the things I'm really looking forward to hearing about are results from recent clinical trials of a number of novel disease-modifying treatments in MS. Specifically, in the late-breaking session there will be a number of interesting presentations.”

ECTRIMS 2025: Anticipating Key Data on DMTs in RRMS Dr Conway notes that there is considerable anticipation for the ECTRIMS 2025 conference, with expectations for new long-term safety data on B-cell depleting therapies and updated real-world evidence, including on ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and ozanimod. He is also hopeful for interim results from significant studies on treatments like tolebrutinib and fenebrutinib. The conference is likely to feature new insights into novel approaches such as CAR T therapy for MS, making it an exciting event for the community.

Coming soon: Dr Oh highlights new data and progress regarding DMTs for RRMS immediately following ECTRIMS 2025.

Coming soon: Reflections from Dr Oh on how new data on DMTs from ECTRIMS 2025 will affect her patients with RRMS.

GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs protect against diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes that can lead to sight loss, suggests new research being presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) in Vienna, Austria (15-19 September) and published in the journal Pharmaceutics.

GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide are widely used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. They do this by mimicking the action of GLP-1, a hormone that helps the body make more insulin when needed, slows down digestion, curbs appetite, and increases feelings of fullness.

Many tissues around the body have GLP-1 receptors (proteins that respond to the hormone) and recent research has suggested the drugs also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.

For example, some studies have indicated they reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. More than 90% of people with type 1 diabetes and 50-60% of those with type 2 diabetes develop this condition, in which high blood sugar levels damage blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

Diabetic retinopathy represents a major public health challenge. Globally, it is projected that over 191 million people will be affected by it by 2030, with around 56 million experiencing vision-threatening stages of the disease. These statistics underscore the critical need for effective screening, early detection, and, crucially, more effective treatments.""

Ioanna Anastasiou, Study Lead, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens

It is thought that much of the damage to the retina is done by free radicals, molecules that can damage cells and are produced in higher numbers when blood sugar is high. The theory is that GLP-1 drugs protect the retina by increasing levels of antioxidants, compounds that neutralise free radicals.

However, other studies have suggested that GLP-1 drugs increase the risk of diabetic retinopathy or exacerbate it in those who already have it. 

To provide some clarity, Dr Anastasiou and colleagues carried out a detailed study of the effect of GLP-1 drugs on retinal cells in diabetes-like conditions. 

For the lab-based study, human retinal endothelial cells were treated with a range of different concentrations of semaglutide. The cells were kept in media with high glucose levels and oxidative stress (in which there are more free radicals than antioxidants) for 24 hours.

They were then put through a series of tests. The results showed that the cells that were treated with semaglutide were up to twice as likely to still be alive than cells that were untreated. They also had larger stores of energy.

Three markers of oxidative stress in diabetic retinopathy were markedly lower in the treated cells: levels of apoptosis (a form of cell death) decreased from approximately 50% in untreated cells to about 10% in semaglutide-treated cells; the production of mitochondrial superoxide (a free radical) decreased from about 90% to about 10%; and the accumulation of harmful compounds called advanced glycation end-products also fell substantially.

Further analysis showed that genes involved in the production of antioxidants were upregulated, or more active, in the treated cells, compared with the untreated cells. This result – and the enhanced survival – indicate that semaglutide was repairing damage to the cells, says Dr Anastasiou.

Looked at as a whole, the results indicate that GLP-1 receptor agonists enhance retinal cells' defences against damage in diabetes-like conditions.

Dr Anastasiou explains: ""In experiments in the lab, GLP-1-receptor agonists exerted powerful antioxidant effects which protected retinal cells against the type of damage that can occur in diabetes.

""Our study did not find that these drugs harmed the retinal cells in any way – instead, it suggests that GLP1-receptor agonists protect against diabetic retinopathy, particularly in the early stages.

""Excitingly, these drugs may be able to repair damage that has already been done and so improve sight.

""Clinical trials are now needed to confirm these protective effects in patients and explore whether GLP-1 receptor agonists can slow, or even halt, the progression of this vision-robbing condition.""

By linking wearable data with pregnancy hormones, researchers show how everyday devices could one day help detect risks like miscarriage or preterm birth long before symptoms appear.

Study: Association between wearable sensor signals and expected hormonal changes in pregnancy. Image credit: Taras Grebinets/Shutterstock.com

A recent study in eBioMedicine investigated the effectiveness of wearable sensors in tracking physiological and behavioral changes during pregnancy and assessing their association with pregnancy-related hormonal fluctuations.

Pregnancy complications, including miscarriage and preterm birth, remain serious threats to both maternal and fetal health. In the U.S., adverse pregnancy outcomes are increasing, and disparities in maternal mortality persist between White and non-White women. These trends highlight the urgent need for better ways to monitor and address pregnancy risks.

Early detection of complications could enable timely clinical interventions and reduce adverse outcomes. Researchers are exploring digital health technologies and artificial intelligence to meet this need to track maternal and fetal health. Yet, these approaches are still in the early stages and require validation in larger, more diverse populations.

Pregnancy hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone (P), oestrogens like oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2), and oestriol (E3), relaxin, prolactin, human placental lactogen, oxytocin, and cortisol (C), are essential for supporting and maintaining a healthy, full-term pregnancy. Their levels naturally fluctuate at specific stages throughout gestation.

Many pregnant women experience difficulties in accessing healthcare, which could be attributed to geographic limitations and socioeconomic disparities. In addition, many working mothers, despite not having financial difficulties, also experience challenges in attending regular prenatal appointments due to lack of paid leave, employment demands, and childcare responsibilities. Many of these difficulties could be addressed through remote monitoring and mobile health technology.

Previous research has confirmed that remote monitoring and mobile health have enhanced patient empowerment and home pregnancy care, effectively reducing pregnancy stress. However, further research is needed better to understand the impact of remote monitoring on health outcomes.

The current observational study obtained data collected in PowerMom, a bilingual digital research platform that allows participants to remotely self-assess and report survey data. It also enables real-world data collection by integrating digital health technologies, such as wearable sensors. Wearable sensor data were analyzed from three months before pregnancy to six months after the baby's delivery.

Participants who were pregnant or within eight weeks postpartum, 16 years or older, living in the US or its territories, and had access to devices supporting the PowerMom application were recruited. The selected participants shared their wearable sensor data collected in the PowerMom mobile research platform using the MyDataHelps™ application. Furthermore, they provided demographic information and completed a “Health and History” survey detailing their health status.

During the study period, participants completed a biweekly “Health and Well-being” survey and a bimonthly “Pregnancy Support” survey. Any participants with incomplete or missing data, as well as fraudulent accounts, were excluded.

Since resting heart rate (RHR) changes are associated with expected pregnancy-related hormone changes, multivariable linear regression was used to model the expected RHR curve in live birth pregnancies using the expected hormone curves.

Out of 5612 participants, whose average age was 31.1 years, enrolled in the PowerMom study, only 697 agreed to share data. Only 108, 108, and 56 participants provided sufficient RHR, number of daily steps (STEPS), and total minutes of daily sleep (SLEEP) data, respectively, during their pregnancy. For the main analysis, 99 live birth pregnancies were included for RHR and steps, and 54 for sleep, while the adverse outcome group was very small (9 for RHR and steps, 2 for sleep).

On average, participants with RHR wearable data were older than the overall cohort. The average duration of pregnancy for enrolled participants was 276.2 days, and for RHR participants, it was 275.2 days.

No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of access to maternity care between enrolled and RHR participants. Notably, no significant difference was observed in the RHR, STEPS, and SLEEP subsets among participants. Most participants who shared wearable data had singleton pregnancies, except for two candidates. Approximately 93% of the cohort had live birth pregnancies, while 6.9% indicated pregnancy loss, either miscarriage or stillbirth.

In the first trimester of the pregnancy, the average RHR decreased compared to pre-pregnancy levels in week 1, followed by an increase until week 5. After week 5, the decrease reached a minimum around week 9; subsequently, RHR increased during the second and third trimesters.

RHR peaks approximately 8–9 weeks before delivery and then steadily declines up to delivery. After the baby's delivery, RHR decreases below pre-pregnancy levels and stabilizes about 6 months post-delivery.

The number of steps decreased throughout the pregnancy compared to pre-pregnancy levels. Although the number of daily steps improved post-delivery, it remained below pre-pregnancy levels even 6 months postpartum.

An increase in total sleep minutes of almost 40 minutes compared to pre-pregnancy levels was observed after week 5, peaking between weeks 8 and 9. However, sleep duration decreased in the second and third trimesters and dropped sharply after delivery (about 50 minutes below baseline), before partially recovering. It remained about 20 minutes below the pre-pregnancy levels even after 6 months postpartum.

RHR curves were positively correlated with E1, E2, E3, P, and C, while negatively correlated with hCG. In regression modelling, however, only E1 and cortisol showed positive coefficients, while E2, E3, P, and hCG showed negative associations, indicating that regression analyses can reveal more nuanced hormone effects than simple correlations. SLEEP presented mild negative correlations with E1, E2, E3, P, and C, and was positively correlated with hCG. In contrast, STEPS curves exhibited a mild negative correlation with E1, E2, E3, P, and C.

In line with previous research, RHR was highly correlated with hormone changes. Multivariable linear regression modeling revealed a high coefficient of determination for the RHR curve, indicating a close relationship between pregnancy hormones and the RHR signal. During the second and third trimesters, the increase in RHR was likely induced by the hormones E1, E2, E3, P, and C. Since the length of pregnancy varied, this model failed to capture the decrease in RHR around the 31st and 32nd week of the pregnancy.

A robust correlation was observed between RHR fluctuations and pregnancy-induced hormonal changes. For pregnancies ending in miscarriage or stillbirth, RHR patterns differ from live birth pregnancies. Still, these findings are preliminary because of the very small sample size (n=9) and should be considered an exploratory feasibility assessment rather than a definitive conclusion.

The current study highlighted the potential of wearable sensors in monitoring maternal health throughout the pregnancy and postpartum. However, the findings of this study must be validated in the future using a larger cohort of diverse ethnicities. These studies must consider additional parameters influencing RHR, such as age and body mass index (BMI).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","A new tool in the fight against obesity: Orforglipron's substantial weight loss results","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/A-new-tool-in-the-fight-against-obesity-Orforgliprons-substantial-weight-loss-results.aspx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:05:00 GMT","

New research presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, Austria (Sept 15-19) and simultaneously published in NEJM shows that daily treatment with the new once-daily GLP-1 agonist orforglipron results in substantial weight loss in people living with obesity who do not have type 2 diabetes.

The study is by Dr Sean Wharton, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada and Wharton Weight Management Clinic, Burlington, ON, Canada, and colleagues. The study is sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of orforglipron. 

Orforglipron is a small-molecule, oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. In this phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind trial, the authors examined the safety and efficacy of once-daily orforglipron at doses of 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg, as compared with placebo (assigned in a 3:3:3:4 ratio) as an adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity for 72 weeks. All the patients had obesity but not diabetes. The primary end point was the percent change in body weight from baseline to week 72.

A total of 3127 patients in 9 countries / jurisdictions (USA, China, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Taiwan) underwent randomisation. The mean relative change in body weight from baseline to week 72 was −7.5% with 6 mg of orforglipron, −8.4% with 12 mg of orforglipron, and −11.2% with 36 mg of orforglipron, as compared with −2.1% with placebo.

Among the patients in the orforglipron 36 mg group, 54.6% had reduction of 10% or more of body weight, 36.0% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a reduction of 20% or more, as compared with 12.9%, 5.9%, and 2.8% of the patients, respectively, in the placebo group.

Other outcomes such as waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly improved with orforglipron treatment (see table 3 full paper). Adverse events (see table 4) resulted in treatment discontinuation in 5.3% to 10.3% of the patients in the orforglipron groups and in 2.7% of those in the placebo group.

The most common adverse events with orforglipron were gastrointestinal effects, which were mostly mild to moderate, consistent with the GLP-1 class of medications.

The authors note that the use of medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide) are reported to result in mean weight reductions of approximately 15% to above 20% and have shown additional health benefits, including decreased cardiovascular risk. However, most available GLP-1 based medications are administered as a subcutaneous injection, which may limit treatment initiation and adherence.

The authors say: ""After 72 weeks of treatment, all the patients in the three orforglipron groups had a significant and clinically meaningful dose-dependent reduction in body weight. The patients who received the highest dose of orforglipron had an average 11.2% weight reduction; more than one third had a reduction of at least 15%, and nearly one fifth had a reduction of at least 20%.""

They added, ""All measured cardiometabolic levels improved with orforglipron treatment as compared with placebo… A weight reduction of 10% or more is a recognised therapeutic threshold, one that has been linked to meaningful cardiometabolic benefits. In our current trial, patients who received orforglipron had a mean weight reduction of as much as 11.2%, and such reductions were associated with improvements in levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as blood fats, blood sugar profiles, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein – a marker of systemic inflammation.""

The authors note the trial's limitations include the lack of comparison with currently approved obesity-management medications, the use of cutoffs for BMI inclusion criteria that have been developed in White populations and that exclude patients with lower BMI values who may also have adiposity-related risks, and the increasing availability of obesity-management medications, which could have an effect on treatment adherence and efficacy results. The strengths of the trial include a highly diverse, large population from nine countries and jurisdictions on four continents, including more than 35% enrolment of men.

They concluded, ""In patients with obesity, the use of orforglipron resulted in statistically and clinically significant weight reductions and an adverse-event profile that was consistent with findings regarding other GLP-1 receptor agonists.""

Dr Wharton added, ""This could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups who are currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications.""

Orforglipron is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other similar agencies worldwide.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New research reassures on opioid use during pregnancy and child development","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/New-research-reassures-on-opioid-use-during-pregnancy-and-child-development.aspx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:19:00 GMT","

An Indiana University study brings a comprehensive new perspective to a growing body of evidence suggesting that mild to moderate use of prescribed opioid pain medications during pregnancy does not cause an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.

The study explores documented associations between prescribed opioid pain medications during pregnancy and the increased risk for the two neurodevelopmental disorders. It concludes that other factors, rather than fetal exposure to opioid pain medications, may explain the increased risk for autism and ADHD in the children of individuals who received opioid prescriptions during pregnancy.

This study ""helps provide more information to pregnant individuals and their physicians who are trying to make complex decisions about how to best manage pain during pregnancy,"" said first author Emma Cleary, a graduate student in the lab of the study's co-principal investigator, Professor Brian D'Onofrio in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.

While they are not able to rule out small increased risks for autism and ADHD with high amounts of exposure, which were rare in our data, the results suggest that there is no causal effect of prescribed opioid analgesics on the risk for these two common neurodevelopmental disorders.""

Emma Cleary, Study First Author and Graduate Student, Indiana University

The study's findings further suggest, as co-author Ayesha Sujan, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine, noted, ""that the observed associations between prenatal exposure to opioid analgesics and two major neurodevelopmental disorders-autism and ADHD-are largely driven by factors leading up to opioid analgesic use rather than the opioid exposure itself.""

The study drew on the extensive data from Swedish population-based registers, including more than 1.2 million births in Sweden from 2007 to 2018, when analyzing the risk of ASD, among whom 4.4% were exposed to prescribed opioid medications during pregnancy. Analyses of ADHD risk included more than 900,000 births from 2007 to 2015.

The researchers estimated risks based on the dose range and duration of cumulative exposure during pregnancy. By analyzing the data from a variety of perspectives, the study also accounted for a range of possible confounding factors. When comparing children exposed to opioid medication to unexposed children, results suggested an increased risk with higher doses, similar to what was observed in previous studies.

However, when they statistically adjusted for factors such as parental age and psychiatric conditions, and used a narrower set of comparison groups to account for shared characteristics between the groups, the observed risks decreased. Notably, when comparing exposed children to unexposed children whose birthing parent had been prescribed opioids in the year before conception but not during pregnancy, the increased risk for autism and ADHD in the exposed children was markedly diminished.

Similarly, the risk for these neurodevelopmental conditions disappeared when comparing differentially exposed siblings. These designs provide a strong test of the causal effects of these medications because they enabled the researchers to hold constant some of the shared characteristics of individuals who are prescribed opioids around the time of pregnancy and the genetic and environmental factors common to siblings.

The study, titled ""Prescribed opioid analgesic use in pregnancy and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children: A retrospective study in Sweden,"" was published on September 16 in the journal PLOS Medicine.

As Cleary explained, ""The way we take our findings together, is that yes, initially, we observe this increased risk for high dose and low doses. But as we increase our adjustment for various sources of potential bias, adjusting for proxies of socio-economic status, mental health history of parents, characteristics of the pregnancy, diagnoses of painful conditions, previous opioid pain medication use, and genetics and environmental factors in the sibling comparisons, we're able to account for many of these things that potentially could confound our associations.

Cleary added, ""And when doing so, the risks that we initially observe go away. As previous studies have explored, these background characteristics would make you both more likely to be exposed to prescribed opioids and increase risk of ASD and ADHD.""

One of the study's innovative features was the use of text-mining algorithms, a novel technique previously used by some of the authors to study ADHD medication use but not yet applied to prescribed opioid use. This technique enabled the researchers to take into account the written instructions on each prescription and thereby consider the possible variations in how patients actually took the medications.

""With these pharmacy-based dispensations,"" said Cleary, ""there's always some uncertainty, but with text-mining of the 'as needed dosages' or prescriptions with a range, such as 1-3 pills a day, we were able to test different possible versions of exposure – and across those analyses we found converging results.""

The study also entailed work across several fields and disciplines. As D'Onofrio added, ""This is a great example of how collaborations among researchers, clinicians, and data engineers can leverage large datasets to help answer key clinical questions, especially when it is not feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials.""

The findings ultimately provide greater clarity for those seeking to treat pain during pregnancy insofar as they suggest that opioid pain medication does not cause substantially increased risk of autism and ADHD. Yet, the findings also beg the question: What are the underlying causes of increased risk for autism and ADHD in this group of children, and how can they be addressed?

""We need more explanation,"" said Cleary. ""It could be the pain and underlying pathophysiological processes, it could be genetics. But people who may be more likely to be prescribed an opioid may also need more support to help manage symptoms throughout their pregnancy.""

More research is needed to explain the workings of these factors. And yet, as her co-author Sujan added, ""the results elucidate the critical need to provide pregnant individuals experiencing pain with psychosocial support and evidence-based pain management tools, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New EASD guideline combines clinical standards with lived experience","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/New-EASD-guideline-combines-clinical-standards-with-lived-experience.aspx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 07:11:00 GMT","

The guideline was developed in line with internationally recognized standards, including the GRADE methodology and the RIGHT reporting statement, and reflects the EASD's newly established Standard Operating Procedures for guideline development.

Importantly, people with lived experience of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were active members of the Guideline Development Panel from the outset. Their contributions helped shape the clinical questions, interpretation of evidence, and formulation of recommendations, ensuring that the final guideline is firmly grounded in the real-world needs and priorities of adults with diabetes.

The publication of this first EASD guideline is a landmark moment for our Association and for the international diabetes community. Assessing and managing diabetes distress is as vital as assessing and managing glucose levels – and it is this recognition that makes the present guideline so important for both clinical practice and future research to improve the lives of people with diabetes.""

Apostolos Tsapas, Professor, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki

Tsapas is also the Chair of the EASD Guidelines Oversight Committee.

Recognising the emotional burden of diabetes as a critical component of care, the guideline provides Good Practice Statements for routine assessment of diabetes distress and evidence-based recommendations for its management.

The launch of this guideline marks a turning point in recognising and addressing the emotional challenges of living with diabetes. Although major advances in treatment and technology have transformed care, many people continue to experience significant emotional and psychological burden in managing the relentless demands of the condition.

Professor Richard Holt, University of Southampton & University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom and Co-Chair of the Guideline Development Panel, said: ""We are proud that the EASD has chosen diabetes distress for its first-ever evidence-based clinical guideline. This decision affirms the importance of emotional health alongside physical health for people with diabetes.""

Professor Jane Speight, The Australian Centre for Behavioural Research in Diabetes, Diabetes Victoria and Deakin University in Australia and Co-Chair of the Guideline Development Panel, said: ""We hope that this guideline will empower healthcare professionals to routinely assess and address the emotional burden of living with diabetes, ultimately improving outcomes for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes across Europe and beyond.""

Professor Chantal Mathieu, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium and President of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, added: ""Despite huge advances in therapies and technologies, the emotional burden of diabetes has not diminished – and for many, it has increased. This guideline recognises that reality, reminding us that good diabetes care must address both glucose levels and the lived experience of managing the condition. I am immensely proud to present this first EASD clinical guideline, which reflects the best available evidence and the hard work of many colleagues. It is a milestone in ensuring that emotional well-being becomes a core part of diabetes care.""

Successful implementation of the guideline will require training, system-level support, and integration into routine care. The EASD plans to support dissemination through peer-reviewed publication, open-access availability, and plain-language summaries designed for accessibility by people living with diabetes and the wider public.

The publication of this first guideline not only addresses an urgent and unmet need in diabetes care but also establishes a framework for future EASD guidelines. The Association is committed to publishing further clinical guidelines, thereby continuing to strengthen the evidence base for person-centred diabetes care.

A simple blood test for p-tau217, when combined with confirmatory brain scans or CSF analysis, could transform early Alzheimer's detection and cut the burden of invasive procedures.

In a recent study published in JAMA Neurology, an international team of researchers evaluated whether plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) could classify amyloid β (Aβ) status in cognitively unimpaired adults as a stand-alone test and in a two-step workflow with confirmatory positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing.

Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60% to 70% of the world's 55 million dementia cases, placing a substantial burden on patients, families, healthcare systems, and memory clinics that rely on resource-intensive scans or lumbar punctures for diagnosis. Blood-based biomarkers offer access through a simple blood draw, eliminating the need for a hospital visit. Aβ plaques and tau tangles emerge years before symptoms, so detecting pathology in cognitively unimpaired adults could improve outcomes. Plasma p-tau217 appears promising; however, screening must strike a balance between accuracy, cost, and burden by age. Further research is needed to define blood-first workflows and thresholds for screening.

This cross-sectional cohort analysis pooled data from 12 cohorts in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Canada. Cognitively unimpaired adults provided plasma for immunoassay measurement of p-tau217; a subset also underwent mass spectrometry of the %p-tau217 ratio for comparison. Aβ status was determined using CSF biomarkers or amyloid PET. PET data were harmonized to the Centiloid scale, and a Centiloid threshold greater than 25 or a positive visual read defined Aβ positivity. Within cohorts, plasma p-tau217 values were also log-transformed, standardized, and modeled in logistic regression with age to estimate the probability of Aβ positivity.

Cut points for plasma p-tau217 were selected in a training split targeting 95% specificity, then evaluated in held-out data to estimate positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and the proportion of Aβ-positive cases detected. Uncertainty was quantified with bootstrap resampling. Investigators compared a plasma-only strategy with a two-step strategy that confirmed plasma-positive cases by CSF or PET. Recruitment simulations estimated the numbers initially screened, the confirmatory tests required, and the participants enrolled to obtain 100 Aβ-positive individuals under various plasma:CSF:PET cost ratios. Analyses evaluated performance by method and age, and assessed alternative PET thresholds to examine the trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity.

Among 2916 cognitively unimpaired adults from 12 cohorts, 33.3% were amyloid positive by either CSF or PET. Women comprised 57.2% of the sample, and 38.1% carried at least one apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE ε4) allele. Using a p-tau217 threshold chosen for 95% specificity and modeling age as a covariate, stand-alone blood testing achieved 81% overall accuracy and a PPV of 79% for classifying amyloid status defined by CSF or PET. At this 95% specificity operating point, the blood test identified about 46% of true amyloid-positive cases, reflecting the challenge of lower prevalence and lower pathology burden in unimpaired populations. More stringent cutoffs further increased PPV but reduced sensitivity, consistent with the expected trade-off.

To raise certainty without sacrificing detection, a two-step workflow was evaluated: individuals positive on plasma proceeded to a confirmatory CSF or PET test. This two-step approach increased PPV to ~91% when CSF confirmed plasma positives against PET as the reference, and up to ~99% when PET confirmed plasma positives against CSF as the reference, and substantially reduced false positives compared with plasma alone. Because CSF markers become abnormal earlier than PET, CSF identified more true positives, whereas PET delivered higher PPV, reflecting different disease phases captured by each modality.

Recruitment simulations translated these metrics into operational impact for a hypothetical trial needing 100 amyloid-positive participants. Compared with imaging alone, using plasma first significantly reduced confirmatory procedures: approximately 139 PET scans were needed after plasma prescreening, versus 536 when PET alone was used; plasma followed by CSF required approximately 124 lumbar punctures. Although this two-step approach reduced false positives and raised PPV, it also detected fewer true positives than using CSF or PET alone, illustrating the deliberate trade-off between certainty and sensitivity. 

In sensitivity analyses, using a more sensitive plasma threshold only when a confirmatory CSF or PET test follows increased the proportion of positives selected while preserving high PPV at the end of the two-step pathway. These differences imply sizable savings in scanner time, radiotracer exposure, and participant burden.

Head-to-head analyses indicated that mass spectrometry of the %p-tau217 ratio provided higher overall accuracy and detected more amyloid-positive cases than immunoassays, while PPVs were similar. Performance varied with age, as PPV rose from approximately 38% in individuals younger than 60 years to approximately 93% in those 80 years or older, whereas the NPV value declined with age, a pattern driven by changes in amyloid prevalence.

Sensitivity analyses supported robustness. Alternate Centiloid thresholds for PET shifted accuracy and PPV in expected directions, and restricting to a single immunoassay platform improved accuracy and detection rates, while leaving PPV essentially unchanged. Collectively, the results show that a blood-first strategy can effectively triage who needs confirmatory testing, striking a practical balance between scale and certainty for the identification of preclinical Alzheimer's disease.

Plasma p-tau217 offers a practical, minimally burdensome entry point for identifying preclinical Alzheimer's disease in cognitively unimpaired adults. As a stand-alone test, it delivers moderate accuracy; pairing plasma screening with confirmatory CSF or PET testing raises PPV, sharply reduces false positives, and optimizes use of invasive or high-cost procedures. Mass spectrometry yields higher accuracy than immunoassays but may be less scalable; standardization and quality control can narrow this gap.

Programs should select thresholds and workflows based on setting, age mix, and intervention risk. Adopting blood-first workflows can accelerate trials and, as therapies expand, support safe, equitable early access to disease-modifying care.

A team of researchers, led by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute), explored the cellular and molecular interactions revealing how lymph nodes play a crucial role in the fight against chronic infection and cancer.

The research, published across two papers in Nature Immunology, showed that lymph nodes provide the right environment for stem-like T cells, an important type of immune cell, to survive, multiply and produce killer cells that can fight cancer or viruses. In other immune organs, such as the spleen, these cells don't develop or proliferate as effectively, making lymph nodes essential for a strong immune response and successful immunotherapy.

The University of Melbourne's Professor Axel Kallies, Laboratory Head at the Doherty Institute and senior author of both papers, said the findings have important implications for cancer therapy.

Lymph nodes aren't just passive waiting rooms for immune cells, they actively train and educate T cells, and send them off to do their job.""

Axel Kallies, Professor, Laboratory Head, Doherty Institute

""Our research suggests that removing lymph nodes during cancer surgery, a common practice to prevent tumour spread, may inadvertently reduce the effectiveness of treatments, such as checkpoint blockade and CAR T cell therapies. Preserving lymph nodes could strengthen immune responses and increase the effectiveness of immunotherapy.""

This work may also help explain why some patients respond better to immunotherapy than others. The state and function of lymph nodes influence how well the immune system can produce cancer-fighting T cells, directly impacting the success of immunotherapy.

The University of Melbourne's Dr Carlson Tsui, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Doherty Institute and first author of one of the papers, said the findings could help to develop new strategies to make immunotherapy more effective.

""Our research identifies molecular signals that are involved in the regulation of stem-like cells and in their capacity to produce effective killer cells. These findings could guide the development and refinement of immune-based treatments for cancer and chronic infection,"" said Dr Tsui.

""Furthermore, our research shows that rather than only focusing on the tumour itself, therapies should also be designed to preserve and enhance lymph node function. By targeting these critical immune hubs, we could boost the body's natural ability to fight cancer, increase the effectiveness of existing immunotherapies and help more patients respond to treatment.""

Together, the two peer-reviewed papers provide a deeper understanding of how lymph nodes shape immune responses. While they are based on work with animal models, they will guide future treatment strategies for chronic infection and cancer treatment.

Professor Shahneen Sandhu, Research Lead for the Melanoma Medical Oncology Service at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, commented on the clinical implications of this work.

""While this research was done in the laboratory with pre-clinical models, we're excited to study these findings in clinical samples from patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors, as part of an ongoing Melanoma Research Victoria collaboration with Professor Kallies,"" Professor Sandhu said.

""Combining clinical and preclinical studies will help us translate these discoveries from bench to bedside and back, ultimately improving outcomes for cancer patients.""

An artificial neuron made of conductive plastics that can perform advanced functions similar to those of biological nerve cells has been demonstrated by researchers at Linköping University, Sweden. The results, published in Science Advances, pave the way for a new generation of body-integrated sensors, medical implants, and robotics.

Mimicking the behaviour of biological neurons has long been a major goal in so-called neuromorphic engineering. Traditional silicon-based electronics fall short because they don't speak the same language as the nerve cells in our body."" 

Simone Fabiano, professor of materials science at Linköping University, LiU

Instead of relying on rigid silicon, Simone Fabiano's team at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at LiU works with a class of soft, flexible materials called conjugated polymers that can transport both ions and electrons. This dual capability allows them to interface more closely with biological systems.

In an article published in Science Advances, Simone Fabiano's research group has shown that their artificial neurons can perform a type of information processing observed in our nervous system. This function means the neuron activates only when one input is present and another is absent. It is called anticoincidence detection and is a core principle in tasks like tactile sensing.

""We can imagine using these devices to add a sense of touch in prosthetics or robotics. They show that organic electronics are not just softer alternatives to silicon, but can enable new kinds of neural computing that connect biology with electronics,"" says Simone Fabiano.

In parallel with developing advanced functionality, his research group has also worked to simplify the basic structure of these artificial neurons.

In early 2023, the researchers at Campus Norrköping succeeded in creating artificial nerve cells that reproduced 15 of the 22 key properties of biological neurons. However, those plastic nerve cells relied on many different components, which limited their practical use.

Now, in a study published in Nature Communications, the team has further refined the technology. They have reduced the artificial nerve cell to just a single organic electrochemical transistor, while still reproducing as many as 17 neural properties. This artificial neuron is not only highly functional but also extremely compact, comparable in size to a human nerve cell.

""This is one of the simplest and most biologically relevant artificial neurons made to date. It opens the door to integrating synthetic neurons directly with living tissue or soft robots,"" says Simone Fabiano.

The research was mainly supported by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the European Research Council, the Swedish Research Council, and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research and through the Swedish Government Strategic Research Area in Materials Science on Advanced Functional Materials (AFM) at Linköping University.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study highlights critical mental health risk for eczema patients","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/New-research-connects-eczema-severity-stigma-and-suicidal-ideation.aspx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 04:22:00 GMT","

A new international study presented today at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress 2025 reveals that adults with atopic eczema (AE) are significantly more likely to experience suicidal thoughts, with researchers uncovering the key factors driving this elevated risk.

As one of the largest global investigations to examine the link between AE and suicidal ideation, the ""Scars of Life"" study surveyed 30,801 adults across 27 countries in 2024. Among them, 15,223 were adults with physician-confirmed current AE, while 7,968 adults without AE served as controls. 

Participants with current AE were grouped by age of AE onset – childhood, adolescence, or adulthood – and completed a detailed online questionnaire capturing sociodemographic information, self-reported suicidal ideation, severity of itch and skin pain, AE severity, and experiences of skin-related stigmatization.

The results showed that 13.2% of adults with AE reported suicidal ideation, compared with 8.5% of adults without AE. All AE subgroups – whether the condition began in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood – had higher odds of suicidal ideation than controls, highlighting the widespread mental health burden of the condition.

Atopic eczema, a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting more than 200 million people worldwide, is characterized by recurring episodes of dry, itchy and inflamed skin. Beyond the physical symptoms, its impact on mental health is increasingly recognized, with many experiencing anxiety, depression, and social stigma, alongside the daily challenges of managing their condition.

Importantly, the study identified several factors strongly associated with suicidal ideation in adults with AE. Younger adults, particularly those under 30, were more likely to report suicidal thoughts (OR=1.6), as were individuals with obesity (OR=1.29).

Clinical features also played a major role: moderate-to-severe AE doubled the odds of suicidal ideation (OR=2.01), while pruritus (itching), skin pain, and high overall symptom intensity were all significantly associated with increased risk.

Psychosocial and sleep factors further contributed to risk. Adults with suicidal thoughts reported higher levels of stigmatization and more prevalent sleep disorders, with mixed insomnia – difficulty falling and staying asleep – notably linked to suicidal ideation (OR=1.78).

Dr Delphine Kerob, one of the lead researchers, commented, ""These findings reveal a critical insight from our large-scale study, which seeks to uncover the hidden, long-term impact of living with common inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic eczema.""

""The results highlight that the effects of atopic eczema are more than skin deep, with suicidal thoughts representing a serious and frequent concern that is often overlooked by healthcare professionals,"" she continued.

By identifying the main risk factors behind suicidal ideation in this population, we hope this study will help healthcare professionals better recognize and address these challenges, supporting patients' overall well-being more effectively.""

Dr. Delphine Kerob, Consultant Dermatologist, Saint Louis Hospital

Discussing the next steps for research, Dr Kerob said, ""Looking ahead, we are investigating why suicidal ideation occurs at different rates across countries, which may reflect important cultural differences. At the same time, ongoing analyses from the ""Scars of Life"" study are enhancing our understanding of what happens beneath the surface in patients with atopic eczema.""

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified a novel way brown fat - an energy-burning form of fat - can rev the body's metabolic engine, consuming cellular fuel and producing heat in a way that improves metabolic health. The study, in mice, reveals new avenues to exploit brown fat to treat metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and obesity.

The study is published Sept. 17 in Nature.

Brown fat is known for its ability to turn energy (calories) from food into heat. In contrast, white fat stores energy for later use while muscle makes energy immediately available to do work. Brown fat's heat production helps the body stay warm in cold temperatures, and exposure to cold can increase brown fat stores. Researchers have proposed that activating brown fat could support weight-loss efforts by boosting calorie burn.

The pathway we've identified could provide opportunities to target the energy expenditure side of the weight loss equation, potentially making it easier for the body to burn more energy by helping brown fat produce more heat. Boosting this kind of metabolic process could support weight loss or weight control in a way that is perhaps easier to maintain over time than traditional dieting and exercise. It's a process that basically wastes energy - increasing resting energy expenditure - but that's a good thing if you're trying to lose weight.""

Irfan Lodhi, PhD, senior author, professor of medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism & Lipid Research, WashU Medicine

The traditional understanding of brown fat's heat production involves mitochondria -power plants within the body's cells. Scientists have long known that mitochondria in brown fat have a method of disengaging from fuel production and instead producing heat, via a molecule called uncoupling protein 1. Yet they have also known that mice with brown fat that lack uncoupling protein 1 are still able to burn energy and produce heat, pointing to the existence of back-up burners in cells.

The new study implicates cellular parts called peroxisomes as important alternative heat producers in brown fat. Peroxisomes are small compartments in cells involved in processing fat molecules. When exposed to cold, peroxisomes in brown fat increase in number, the researchers found. This increase is even more dramatic in mice whose mitochondria are deficient in uncoupling protein 1, suggesting that peroxisomes may be able to compensate if mitochondria lose their heat-production ability.

Lodhi and his colleagues discovered that peroxisomes consume fuel and produce heat in a metabolic process that centers on a key protein in these cell parts called acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Mice missing ACOX2 in brown fat lost some ability to tolerate cold, showing lower body temperatures after exposure to cold compared with typical mice. In addition, compared with typical mice, their tissues did not make good use of the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin, and they were more prone to obesity when fed high-fat diets.

In contrast, mice genetically engineered to make unusually high amounts of ACOX2 in brown fat showed increased heat production, better cold tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and weight control when fed the same high-fat diet.

Using a fluorescent heat sensor they developed, the researchers found that when ACOX2 metabolized certain fatty acids, brown fat cells got hotter. They also used an infrared thermal imaging camera to show that mice lacking ACOX2 produced less heat in their brown fat.

While human bodies can manufacture these fatty acids, the molecules also are found in dairy products and human breast milk and are made by certain gut microbes. Lodhi said this raises the possibility that a dietary intervention based on these fatty acids - such as a food, probiotic or ""nutraceutical"" intervention - could boost this heat-production pathway and the beneficial effects it appears to have. He and his colleagues also are investigating possible drug compounds that could activate ACOX2 directly.

""While our studies are in mice, there is evidence to suggest this pathway is relevant in people,"" Lodhi said. ""Prior studies have found that individuals with higher levels of these fatty acids tend to have lower body mass indices. But since correlation is not causation, our long-term goal is to test whether dietary or other therapeutic interventions that increase levels of these fatty acids or that increase activity of ACOX2 could be helpful in dialing up this heat production pathway in peroxisomes and helping people lose weight and improve their metabolic health.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Deep learning algorithm uses mammograms and age for heart disease prediction","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250917/Deep-learning-algorithm-uses-mammograms-and-age-for-heart-disease-prediction.aspx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 04:49:00 GMT","

A new machine learning model developed by The George Institute for Global Health can successfully predict heart disease risk in women by analyzing mammograms. The findings were published today in Heart, the official journal of the British Cardiovascular Society.

Developed in collaboration with the University of New South Wales and University of Sydney, this is the first deep learning algorithm based on only mammographic features and age to predict major cardiac events with comparable accuracy to traditional cardiovascular risk calculators.

Associate Professor Clare Arnott, Global Director of the Cardiovascular Program at The George Institute said that new ways to identify women at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were needed, given that many women are not accessing or being offered CV risk screening in the community.

""It's a common misconception that CVD predominantly affects men, resulting in underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the condition in women. By integrating CV risk screening with breast screening through the use of mammograms - something many women already engage with at a stage in life when their cardiovascular risk increases - we can identify and potentially prevent two major causes of illness and death at the same time.""

The model was designed and validated using routine mammograms from over 49,000 women in metropolitan and rural areas of Victoria, Australia, linked to individual hospital and death records. Researchers then compared the model to traditional models that require multiple data points based on known CV risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol.

""We found that our model performed just as well without the need for extensive clinical and medical data,"" said A/Prof Arnott.

Previous research to date has focused on certain mammographic features such as breast arterial calcification (BAC), which has been found to be associated with cardiovascular risk in some populations. Relying on BAC alone, however, has limitations. For example, BAC is less accurate at predicting CVD risk in older women.

Our model is the first to use a range of features from mammographic images combined simply with age - a key advantage of this approach being that it doesn't require additional history taking or medical record data, making it less resource intensive to implement, but still highly accurate.""

Clare Arnott, Global Director, Cardiovascular Program, The George Institute

Globally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women, amounting to around 9 million deaths annually, or approximately one third of all deaths in women. Despite the high burden of disease, multiple studies internationally have shown that cardiovascular disease symptoms and risk factors are under-considered in women, leading to fewer diagnostic tests, specialist referrals and prescriptions in women compared to men.

Conversely, mammography-based screening programs have engaged women very effectively in some countries, with more than 67% of women in the United States and the United Kingdom participating in screening mammography.

Dr Jennifer Barraclough, Research Fellow at The George Institute, said that leveraging an existing risk screening process already widely utilized by women, means this model could serve as a cardiovascular risk prediction tool for women in diverse communities across Australia and around the world. 

""We hope this technology will one day provide greater, and more equitable access to screening in rural areas, as many women already benefit from mobile mammography units free of charge,"" she said.

""We have shown the potential of this innovative new screening tool, so we now look forward to testing the model in additional, diverse, populations and understanding potential barriers to its implementation.""

INTEGRA Biosciences is part of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a scheme that provides independent assessment and approval of companies' carbon-reduction targets according to 3 scopes. The latest report shows that INTEGRA has already reduced its scope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (from the production of purchased energy) emissions by 57 percent - well ahead of schedule - and is on track to achieve all of its ambitious green goals.

Reductions in INTEGRA's scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2021 to 2024.

INTEGRA corporate emissions reduction targets were approved by the SBTi in 2023, and the 2024 annual report detailing INTEGRA's progress towards its targets has recently been released by the myclimate foundation. The results show that INTEGRA reduced its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 57 percent between 2021 and 2024, surpassing the target that the company originally set for 2031. It's also on track to reach its scope 3 target - for all other indirect emissions within the supply chain, both upstream and downstream - having already reduced these emissions by 28 percent by the end of 2024.

However, this good news won't stop INTEGRA from implementing additional measures to further reduce its environmental impact! The company's remaining emissions hotspots are product materials and transport, and INTEGRA is already working on many more green initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.

Modern lifestyles and dietary changes have significantly increased the consumption of high-fat foods, contributing to a steep rise in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, a high-fat diet (HFD) is linked to cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration and has been shown to worsen the pathology of Alzheimer's disease-a progressive neurodegenerative condition-in mouse models. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive.

Autophagy, a crucial cellular recycling process, helps maintain neuronal health. Recent studies have shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. But is autophagy linked to HFD-induced cognitive deficits?

To address this question, researchers from Chiba University, Japan, examined the effects of the HFD on autophagy and memory formation using Drosophila, the humble fruit fly, as a model system. Rodent studies have focused mainly on specific regions of the brain, leaving the broader impact of HFDs on the nervous system unexplored. To bridge this gap, the researchers used Drosophila, given its ease of genetic manipulation, short lifespan, conserved metabolic and neural pathways with mammals, and well-validated memory assessments.

Associate Professor Ayako Tonoki and her team, including doctoral students Tong Yue, Minrui Jiang, and Kotomi Onuki from the Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, along with Professor Motoyuki Itoh from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Japan, recently published their findings in Volume 21, Issue 8 of the journal PLOS Genetics on August 18, 2025. ""Our findings suggest that diet-induced cognitive decline is not irreversible and may be improved by lifestyle interventions that promote autophagy, such as exercise or intermittent fasting. This research may raise public awareness about the cognitive risks of HFD and provide new insights into potential preventive strategies against metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders,"" explains Dr. Tonoki.

The researchers maintained the flies on a normal diet or an HFD for seven days and examined their lipid-triacylglycerol (TAG) and circulating glucose levels. Notably, HFD-fed flies had significantly higher levels of TAG and glucose as well as higher intestinal lipid accumulation, suggesting that HFD altered glucose and lipid metabolism.

Next, the researchers examined the effects of HFD on memory formation by conditioning the flies to various odors and assessing their short-term (3 minutes following exposure), intermediate-term (3 hours following exposure), and long-term (24 hours following exposure) memory (STM, ITM, and LTM, respectively). Specific odor tubes were paired with an electric shock apparatus for behavioral reinforcement. Notably, HFD-fed flies exhibited impaired ITM and LTM, while STM remained unaffected.

To elucidate the role of autophagy in HFD-induced memory impairment, the researchers quantified the levels of autophagy-related proteins. They found that the levels of Ref(2)p-a protein normally degraded by autophagy-were significantly increased in HFD-fed flies. At the same time, the Atg8a-II/I ratio, a marker of autophagosome (recycling vesicles) formation, was markedly lower, indicating autophagic dysfunction. Further, temporary suppression of the autophagy protein Atg1 in adult neurons selectively reduced ITM without affecting STM, consistent with the effects observed under HFD feeding, suggesting that a temporary reduction in neuronal autophagic activity during adulthood is sufficient to cause memory decline. Conversely, boosting autophagy by overexpressing Atg1, suppressing the autophagy inhibitor Rubicon, or treating with the autophagy inducer rapamycin ameliorated memory deficits in HFD-fed flies. These findings suggest that HFD-induced memory deficits can be reversed by enhancing autophagic activity.

To better understand how HFD disrupts autophagy, the researchers examined the final stage of autophagy-the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes into autolysosomes, where cellular contents are degraded and recycled. Notably, HFD-fed flies showed abundant autophagosomes and lysosomes, but no change in autolysosome numbers, indicating that the HFD-induced impairment in autophagy was likely due to the defective fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Interestingly, gene expression analysis revealed that lysosome signaling-related genes were significantly downregulated in HFD-fed flies. Finally, inhibition of lysosomal function markedly reduced ITM.

Overall, these findings provide novel insights into how HFD induces memory deficits through autophagic and lysosomal impairment. Addressing the cognitive risks associated with HFD can aid in the early prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

Dr. Tonoki concludes by saying, ""This research advances our understanding of how dietary habits influence brain health. Our findings may also accelerate the identification of autophagy-enhancing interventions-including specific nutrients and therapeutic agents-to combat diet-induced cognitive decline and preserve cognition in the aging population.""

LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON: Weah follows in dad's footsteps, scores at Bernabeu

Tim Weah made U.S. soccer history on Tuesday, but it wasn't enough for Marseille, which lost at 10-man Real Madrid, 2-1, in the UEFA Champions League in Spain.

Weah, who connected for his first goal in the UCL, followed in the footsteps of his father, former Liberian international George Weah. His father tallied for Paris Saint-Germain in a 2-1 win over Real at Bernabeu in the 1994 UCL semifinals.

The B.W. Gottschee product also became the second U.S. men's national team player to score at the stadium. USMNT teammate Christian Pulisic was the first, recording a goal for A.C. Milan in 2023.

It was also the first goal from one of the 11 American players participating in this year's Champions League.

“In a hundred years, I didn't believe I'd play here,” Tim Weah said. “I grew up in Rosedale [Queens, N.Y. neighborhood], playing on a small turf pitch. Coming here was definitely a dream come true. I'm definitely humbled, I'm so glad to be in my position.”

Tim Weah lifted the French club into the lead in the 22nd minute off Mason Greenwood's inteception, run and eventual feed in the penalty area, past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

French international Kylian Mbappe converted a pair of penalty kicks for the Spanish side in its comeback.

Real Madrid played the final 18 minutes of the match with 10 men after Dan Carvajal was sent off after headbutting Marseille goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli.

Chelsea open their Champions League campaign with a difficult visit to the Allianz Arena with Bayern Munich the hosts on match day one. 

Vincent Kompany's side will have a familiar look to it with a front three featuring a Premier League all-stars line-up which is enough to trouble any team and the main reason why the Bundesliga champions have already scored 14 goals in three league games so far this season.

Enzo Maresca will need to have his side at its organised best to keep them at bay. 

Max Eberl, Bayern's sporting director, has been speaking ahead of the first game of the European season and is expecting the blockbuster fixture to live up to expectations. 

“I'm really excited about Wednesday's match,” the 51-year-old told Bild. “I think Chelsea deserved to win the final, with their incredible energy. They haven't gotten any worse since then. On the contrary, they will of course have become even more stable. But this energy is precisely our game, too. That's why I believe a very, very exciting, high-quality match awaits us on Wednesday.” 

Eberl, in typically German fashion, has given Chelsea a back-handed compliment by addressing the stability that Maresca has brought to Stamford Bridge. Despite being criticised on several occasions, the Italian still delivered two major trophies and Champions League football providing a great base to build from this season. With the addition of players like Joao Pedro, Liam Delap and Alejandro Garnacho, there is also a different look to the forward line.

The Chelsea boss spoke after the 2-2 draw with Brentford at the weekend and gave an update on some of these players who is facing a race against time to be fit to face Bayern, as reported by the club's official website. 

“We planned 45 minutes for Wes because he was a long time out. We planned not all the game for Jorrel, because I've said many times that when you've just arrived from another country you need time to adapt,” explained Maresca.

“Facundo joined us two weeks ago, physically also he is not 100 per cent. We needed to manage different situations, like Estevao [Willian] had to miss out. Joao Pedro also was not 100 per cent, but he did the effort to play part of the game. Cole (Palmer) was not fit to play from the start. That's from the medical staff, from the player. 

“When we take a decision about an injured player it's always from all of us. When Cole is fit we are all very happy. I have said many times that with Cole in the team we are a much better team.”

A win, and confidence will be high that Enzo Maresca could inspire another European triumph, defeat and they will be up against it already.

FIFA has unveiled a landmark $355 million payout to clubs worldwide under its expanded Club Benefits Programme (CBP) for the 2026 World Cup, a move designed to reward teams for their crucial role in nurturing and releasing players for national duty.

The announcement, made on Tuesday, represents a nearly 70% increase from the $209 million distributed after the 2022 Qatar tournament and marks the first time clubs will receive compensation not only for the finals but also for players released during World Cup qualifiers.




This expanded CBP stems from a 2023 memorandum of understanding between FIFA and the European Club Association (ECA), strengthening collaboration and creating a more equitable framework for global football.

Historically, the CBP has recognized clubs' contributions since its inception in 2010, distributing funds to 440 teams across 51 FIFA member associations after the 2022 World Cup.




With the 2026 qualifiers now included, thousands more clubs stand to benefit, reflecting FIFA's push for inclusivity and acknowledgment of development pathways.

Compensation is calculated on a per-player, per-day basis, covering time away with national teams, including preparation periods, and extending to players registered in the two years prior to the tournament.

Clubs also receive payments if a player named to a final squad is replaced due to injury before the first match.

While exact per-day figures for 2026 remain undisclosed, the structure mirrors the 2022 formula, ensuring broad support for clubs globally.




FIFA President Gianni Infantino hailed the programme as a “financial recognition of the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament.”

ECA Chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi emphasized that clubs are central to national team success, calling the initiative “innovative” and a vital acknowledgment of football's development chain from grassroots to elite competition.

The 2026 tournament, set for June 11 to July 19 across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will feature 48 teams – up from 32 – playing 104 matches across 16 venues.

This unprecedented expansion increases the number of participating clubs and players, amplifying the CBP's reach and reinforcing FIFA's commitment to balancing the demands of club and international football.

By distributing funds to a wider pool of clubs, FIFA aims to address fixture congestion, player welfare, and revenue sharing, particularly in a post-pandemic era where balancing club and country commitments remains a critical challenge.","{'href': 'https://www.dailysabah.com', 'title': 'Daily Sabah'}","soccer"

September 17 – FIFA has allocated $355 million to clubs releasing players for the 2026 World Cup and for the first time will pay clubs for releasing players for World Cup qualifiers.

For the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA distributed $209 million amongst 440 clubs for players released to the 32 competing nations.

While the $144 million increase in payments in 2026 is a significant 70% increase in payments to clubs, the money has to go a lot further and is not an increase of 70% for clubs releasing players for the finals. In 2026 the number of nations at the finals has increased from 32 to 48 while close to 200 nations will have competed in qualifiers.

FIFA has given no indication as to how the money will be split between clubs globally.

“The enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026 is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

While being trumpeted by Infantino as “a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition” of the World Cup, there will still be a huge financial contribution made by the world's biggest clubs to provide their players that will not come close to being met by FIFA's projected record breaking $10 billion+ revenue take.

For the Qatar 2022 World Cup, compensation for clubs saw $10,000 paid for each one of the days the relevant player remained with his national team during the World Cup and the official preparation period. The compensation was paid to all clubs for whom the player had played in the two years prior to the World Cup 2022.

The club compensation agreement was launched in 2010 as part of an agreement between Sepp Blatter's FIFA and the European Club Association. It was extended in 2015 to cover both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and again in 2023 to cover 2026.

“At ECA we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme. It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA's Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game,” said ECA chairman Nasser Al-Khelaïfi.

“Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football and this initiative recognises every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games. We look forward to continuing to work closely with FIFA, and the global football community, to ensure we keep driving growth and development of international football.”

What is currently unknown is whether Al-Khelaifi – who is by far the most compromised executive in global football with his club, confederation, media, national and ECA positions – has actually done a good deal for the clubs or actually just agreed a sweet deal for FIFA and his own ambitions.

In 2022 Manchester City topped the list of FIFA payments to clubs who released players for the tournament in Qatar, receiving almost $4.6 million – eclipsing the entire amount sent to the whole continent of Africa which had five national teams at the tournament.

 

English clubs received more than those in any other country – $37.7 million – while the $158.9 million total handed over to European teams accounted for 76% of the overall sum distributed.

The Premier League spent more money than the rest of the top five leagues put together with every chance that more was spent than the entirety of the continent. 

Despite UEFA's best attempts, the various TV deals and exposure of the Premier League across the world makes it the biggest and most accessible league on the planet. The knock-on effect is that commercial, sponsorship, marketing and merchandise revenue has also gone through the roof allowing clubs to spend more than ever before.

The Club World Cup gave Chelsea the chance to earn an extra £100m or so with FIFA president Gianni Infantino announcing another increased revenue stream for those who fill their squads with the best international players with the enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026. 

“It is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,"" the former UEFA chief said in a statement, via Reuters. 

“A record USD 355 million (£260m) will be distributed to clubs for the release of their players, and this reinforces our solid collaboration with the European Club Association and clubs worldwide as we all look forward to a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition of the FIFA World Cup next year.” This figure is up from £153m from Qatar 2022 with a 70% increase showing the ever-increasing influence of the biggest club sides. 

Paris Saint Germain's Nasser Al-Khelaifi who is also chairman of the European Clubs Association explained their role in negotiating an increased compensation for clubs whose players will be representing their respective countries in the Americas: ""At ECA we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme.

The added bonus is, even if players are called up by their country but don't see any game time, the clubs that they play for will still be compensated accordingly. How much will each club get? Each player called up counts, however, in 2020, there were 440 represented. Which means there won't quite be enough to fund a summer transfer splurge despite Chelsea and Arsenal having as many as 18 players and Tottenham having 23 who could be called up.

International Football

When the first 2026 World Cup ticket lottery opened last week, Nick, a longtime soccer fan in Colorado, had a plan. Like many others across North America, to double his family's chances in the random draw, he and his wife both signed up for FIFA IDs and entered. Then, via social media, they learned of a little-known rule that has sparked confusion as the Sept. 19 application deadline nears: “entries are limited to only one (1) entry per household.”

The restriction exists on Page 3 of the lottery's “official rules,” and within the answer to Question 7 of a general ticketing FAQ on FIFA's website. It was not, however, communicated to media or fans prior to the opening of this first sales phase, the “Visa Presale Draw,” last Wednesday.

So it startled some fans whose spouses, parents, children or roommates had applied.

Some were especially spooked by a portion of the FAQ that reads: “If FIFA identifies multiple registrations originating from the same household, it reserves the right to disqualify those entries and prevent the associated individuals from being selected in the draw.”

The revelation triggered flurries of questions on Reddit, TikTok, Instagram and elsewhere. As millions of applications rolled in — FIFA said there were over 1.5 million in the first 24 hours, and demand was “extraordinary!” — fans worried that their attempts to increase their lottery odds might backfire.

“Everybody wants to maximize their opportunities,” said Jason Daley, a longtime fan who runs The World Cup Guide, “but nobody wants to risk their entire application being ignored.”

Nick — who spoke on the condition that The Athletic only publish his first name, so that the interview wouldn't impact him professionally — said that he and his wife decided to delete one of their two entries.

Zara Pira, a fan in Toronto, told her apartment roommate to withdraw an entry because she was worried they'd both be disqualified. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” she said. “I don't want to get stuck in this limbo and lose my chances.”

None of them, though, had seen any guidance from FIFA. A FIFA spokesman, when asked last week by The Athletic whether a husband and wife who applied would both be disqualified, did not provide a definitive answer.

Another FIFA spokesperson eventually told Travel Futbol Fan, a content creator who's been explaining World Cup ticket intricacies to his TikTok followers, that households who'd submitted multiple applications didn't need to take any action, but FIFA would only consider the first application.

On Tuesday, a third spokesman then told The Athletic that, in the days after the application window closes on Sept. 19, FIFA employees and other humans will manually check entries tied to the same home address as another entry. If they determine the two entrants are spouses or partners, the second application will be scrubbed, and the first will remain valid.

In other cases, specific details — such as credit cards, names and contact information — will be “taken into consideration,” the spokesman said, “and fans should not be concerned.”

When asked whether unrelated roommates, such as Pira and her friend, were allowed to apply separately, the spokesman confirmed that they can.

When asked about multigenerational households, though, and the precise line between permissible and impermissible, he could not give a conclusive answer. Much of this, he admitted, is “complex,” with many “different nuances.”

Ticket limits have become commonplace at major sporting events as a means to shut out scalpers and broaden access. The 2024 Paris Olympics, for example, capped purchases at four tickets per person for high-demand events and six per person for other events. At the 2018 men's World Cup, according to FIFA, a given household could buy up to four tickets per match and 28 across the entire tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, the household caps were six per match and 60 overall.

“Household limits have been introduced to ensure fair and equitable ticket access for all fans,” the FIFA spokesman said.

For the 2026 World Cup, an expanded 48-team tournament set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, FIFA lowered the cap back to four per household per match, and 40 tickets per household across all 104 games.

The spokesman said that data from the 2018 and 2022 tournaments — where the average number of tickets purchased per order (per match) was 2.2 and 2.8, respectively — “came into play as they were determining the specific rules and conditions for this tournament.”

The cap, though, has become a hurdle for families of five or more, and for larger groups hoping to attend games together. (There are 11.7 million households of five or more in the U.S. alone, according to the Census Bureau's 2024 Current Population Survey.)

When asked about options for large families or groups, the FIFA spokesman mentioned hospitality packages. (The cheapest package for the cheapest group-stage game costs $1,400 per person.)

Separately, in theory, families could buy additional tickets, beyond the four-per-match limit, on unauthorized resale sites like StubHub. But it's unclear if they'd be able to sit together, and FIFA, in the past, has warned fans to “be wary of unofficial ticketing sites claiming to be already selling tickets.”

On FIFA's official resale platform, household limits will apply, though it's unclear how they'll be enforced in later phases.

It's also unclear how, exactly, FIFA will distinguish between roommates and spouses who have different last names and different credit cards.

Amid the uncertainty, Daley said he got many questions from friends, readers and others about what, exactly, was permissible as the presale draw opened. There were people wondering if they could apply twice with the same card. There were people wondering whether sons, daughters and parents could apply, essentially on their behalf. “There's definitely high interest in trying to maximize opportunities,” he said.

Initially, he didn't have clear answers to those questions. He scrutinized the information available and didn't see any reason two spouses couldn't both apply. FIFA's “Visa Presale Draw Explainer” video on YouTube noted that “households can purchase up to four tickets per a match,” but said nothing about a limit on applications. FIFA officials had not mentioned the application limit during an hour-long Zoom call with reporters the week prior. There was nothing in the “Visa Presale Draw” section or “Sales Restrictions” section of a World Cup customer support website.

Then, when the application phase opened last Wednesday, attention turned to the long wait times and error messages that plagued the rollout.

It wasn't until the following day that a significant number of applicants began to discover the one-per-household limit and question FIFA.

“I think most people are fine with one entry per household,” Daley said. “But — just tell them. I think that's where the frustration came from.”

Nick, who was feeling pessimistic about his chances of being selected for a ticket-buying opportunity in this first phase, agreed. “I'm not really stressed out about it,” he said. “I'm just kind of annoyed with the lack of clarity.”

After the Sept. 19 deadline for applications, FIFA will complete its “data cleansing” or “data scrubbing” process. With the help of technology, it will weed out bots and other improper entries. It will then select applicants at random and begin notifying some on Sept. 29 that they have an opportunity to purchase tickets on specific dates, in specific time slots, starting Oct. 1.

It's unclear how many people will be chosen in this first lottery phase. Soon after it concludes on Oct. 21, there will be a second lottery phase similar to the first — but with no stipulation that entrants must have a Visa credit card, debit card or reloadable prepaid card.

Advertisement

The second phase will be open to people who entered this first lottery, whether or not they were chosen and purchased tickets, FIFA has said. The official rules state: “A person entering the Presale Draw also may enter any other random selection draw separately offered by FIFA subsequent to this Presale Draw.”

After the second phase, and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw places teams into groups and host cities, there will be a third lottery phase, during which ticket buyers can select specific matchups. There will then be a “first-come, first-served” phase or “last-minute sales” phase in the spring. FIFA will also operate a resale platform where fans can buy tickets on the secondary market at uncapped prices.

The four-per-household-per-match and 40-per-household limits will apply across all phases — meaning, for example, that if someone purchases four tickets to a given group-stage match next month, they cannot purchase four more tickets to that same match next spring.

Spanish government officials have suggested they could pull their national team out of the 2026 World Cup.

World football's biggest tournament will take place once again next summer in Canada, Mexico and the United States, the first time the competition has been hosted by three different nations.

European champions Spain are the bookmakers' early favourites to win and are on course to book their place at the tournament, having taken two wins from two at the start of qualifying.

But there are now suggestions Luis de la Fuente's side could withdraw from the World Cup in protest if Israel also qualify for the tournament.

Advert

Israel are currently third in their qualifying group but have a real chance of securing at least a play-off spot. They are currently six points behind group leaders Norway but level on points with second place Italy, with three games remaining.

Only the group winner qualifies for the World Cup automatically, with second place potentially securing a play-off spot depending on results in other groups.

Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel to be excluded from international sports competitions over its actions in Gaza.

Advert

Earlier this week, Sanchez said Israel should be treated in the same way as Russia, which was banned from international competition by FIFA and UEFA following its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022.

""Israel cannot continue to use any international platform to whitewash its image,"" Sanchez told representatives of his Socialist Workers' Party.

A United Nations (UN) commission of inquiry said on Tuesday that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts, as defined under international law, have been carried out by Israel in Gaza.

The ongoing conflict was triggered by Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 people and saw 251 people taken hostage.

Advert

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,964 Palestinians, according to figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry - whose figures are viewed as reliable by the UN.

Israel's foreign ministry has categorically rejected the UN report as ""distorted and false"", while its Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called Sanchez ""a disgrace"" over his comments.

A spokesperson for the Socialist Group in Spanish Congress, Patxi Lopez, has suggested the Spanish government could vote to boycott the next World Cup if Israel qualify and are allowed to compete.

Advert

It comes after Spanish broadcaster RTVE threatened to boycott next year's Eurovision Song Contest if Israel competes, following similar announcements in the Netherlands, Ireland, Slovenia and Iceland.

Echoing Sanchez's comments, Lopez called on sports associations to ""exclude"" Israel from competitions, as was done with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

When asked if Spain would withdraw if Israel were allowed to compete at the World Cup, Lopez said (via COPE) ""we'll consider it later"" and that a request could be made ""at the appropriate time"" if no action is taken against Israel.

Spanish government spokesperson and Minister of Sports, Pilar Alegria, has also called for Israel to be excluded from international competitions in light of the worsening situation in Gaza.

Advert

""Sport is not, and cannot be, an island independent of what happens in the real world, especially when that real world tells us that human rights are being destroyed,"" she said.

FIFA and UEFA are yet to publicly respond to Sanchez, Lopez and Alegria's comments.

The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) has announced a groundbreaking move to honor the vital role of clubs across the world for nurturing talents with a huge 70% increment in its Club Benefit Programme.

On Tuesday, 16, 2025, FIFA injected a record £260 million ($355 million) into the coffers of football clubs worldwide. This increased payout marks a rise from the £153 million ($209 million) distributed during the 2022 Qatar World Cup cycle.This amount will for the first time be giving to teams that are releasing players not only for the finals but also for the demanding qualifiers leading to the expanded 48-team 2026 tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. FIFA announces changes to international football calendar With this initiative, FIFA has demonstrated a commitment to globalizing the sport.Smaller clubs, particularly those outside Europe, often incur losses due to limited compensation, and this adjustment seeks to correct those imbalances.

""Details on the distribution model will be released soon, including eligibility criteria and application deadlines,"" part of the statement read.ALL/JEMeanwhile, watch as Ghanaians debate the performance of Black Stars coach Otto Addo

The Premier League spent more money than the rest of the top five leagues put together with every chance that more was spent than the entirety of the continent. 

Despite UEFA's best attempts, the various TV deals and exposure of the Premier League across the world makes it the biggest and most accessible league on the planet. The knock-on effect is that commercial, sponsorship, marketing and merchandise revenue has also gone through the roof allowing clubs to spend more than ever before.

The Club World Cup gave Chelsea the chance to earn an extra £100m or so with FIFA president Gianni Infantino announcing another increased revenue stream for those who fill their squads with the best international players with the enhanced edition of the FIFA Club Benefits Programme for the FIFA World Cup 2026. 

“It is going a step further by recognising financially the huge contribution that so many clubs and their players around the world make to the staging of both the qualifiers and the final tournament,"" the former UEFA chief said in a statement, via Reuters. 

“A record USD 355 million (£260m) will be distributed to clubs for the release of their players, and this reinforces our solid collaboration with the European Club Association and clubs worldwide as we all look forward to a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition of the FIFA World Cup next year.” This figure is up from £153m from Qatar 2022 with a 70% increase showing the ever-increasing influence of the biggest club sides. 

Paris Saint Germain's Nasser Al-Khelaifi who is also chairman of the European Clubs Association explained their role in negotiating an increased compensation for clubs whose players will be representing their respective countries in the Americas: ""At ECA we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme.

“It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA's Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game. 

""Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football and this initiative recognises every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games. We look forward to continuing to work closely with FIFA, and the global football community, to ensure we keep driving growth and development of international football."" 

The added bonus is, even if players are called up by their country but don't see any game time, the clubs that they play for will still be compensated accordingly. How much will each club get? Each player called up counts, however, in 2020, there were 440 represented. Which means there won't quite be enough to fund a summer transfer splurge despite Chelsea and Arsenal having as many as 18 players and Tottenham having 23 who could be called up.

Contributor.

Ecuador finished second in South American FIFA 2026 World Cup qualifying after defeating World champion Argentina 1-0 in the final round of matches. Can Ecuador be considered a candidate for World Cup glory next summer?

Last week Ecuador finished off an impressive qualifying campaign by defeating FIFA 2022 World Cup winners Argentina. The result meant Ecuador completed qualifying with just two defeats in 18 games.

The game against Argentina took place in the capital city, Quito. It had a party atmosphere. The home fans celebrated Ecuador returning to the FIFA World Cup before the match even started, and the result seemed secondary to the festivities. Star player Moisés Caicedo hugged and kissed his mother on the side of the pitch just before kick-off.

The occasion felt more like a ceremonial friendly than the last official game of qualifying. Yet, as is always the case in South American games, the intensity on the pitch was as high as ever. Ecuador took the game to the visiting world champion and registered a famous 1-0 win to end qualifying on a high. Enner Valencia scored a penalty deep into first half stoppage time.

Lionel Messi didn't play for Argentina because he completed a full 90 minutes for his country a few days earlier. Messi scored two goals against Venezuela in that match, and was rested by Scaloni for the Ecuador fixture. Both Ecuador and Argentina made some changes to the usual starting teams because both had already qualified for the World Cup ahead of this game.

Lionel Messi and Argentina have won every trophy they have competed for under manager Lionel Scaloni, and the 2022 champion won South American 2026 qualifying at a canter. However Ecuador finishing in second ahead of the chasing pack was just as impressive, especially considering the nation had to start qualifying on -3 points for a prior rule infringement.

‘La Tri' came from three points behind the likes of Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay but finished a point ahead of all of them.

Ecuador finished second mainly thanks to an incredible defensive record across 18 qualifying matches. The team conceded just five goals in the entire campaign. This included four clean sheets in the final four qualifying games, and a host of rather boring but undoubtedly effective 0-0 draws.

Ecuador was not prolific going forward but did what it needed to do to qualify comfortably and had a goal difference of +9. Lots of excitement surrounds the nation ahead of next summer's tournament as its squad boasts some incredible young talent.

Club World Cup winner Moisés Caicedo is 23 years old but he has proved himself as one of the top midfielders in the Premier League. Meanwhile his club and international teammate Kendry Páez has gone on loan to Strasbourg in France for more regular first-team football, but he only turned 18 this year and remains a key player for Ecuador.

Ecuador has talent that might come of age in 2030 or 2034, and yet this group of players has already qualified for the 2026 tournament with flying colors. The stars of tomorrow are hungry to make their mark today.

Gonzalo Plata, who is 24, has been in fine form for Brazilian league leader Flamengo this year and striker Kevin Rodriguez registered an assist for Union Saint-Gilloise in the UEFA Champions League this week. Rodriguez is a big, physical striker who turned 25 this year.

At the back, Champions League winning PSG centre-back Willian Pacho and new Arsenal signing Piero Hincapié are both just 23 years of age. This will be Ecuador's fifth ever visit to a World Cup finals, and the team has never progressed past the round of 16 before. Could that change in 2026? Perhaps they could go even further, as this is undoubtedly the best squad that Ecuador has ever had.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","soccer"

Diego Simeone freely admitted that he felt an overriding sense of relief after Atletico Madrid picked up their first win of the new Liga season on Saturday. As the Rojiblancos boss admitted after the 2-0 victory over Villarreal, ""It wasn't just another day, after only two points from three matches.""

Of course, while attention has now switched to Atleti's Champions League opener against Liverpool at Anfield, speculation over Simeone's future is unlikely to die down anytime soon. His status as a club legend is already set in stone but there has been a gradual erosion of his influence at the Metropolitano over the past year or so.

A second successive summer spending spree has also ramped up the pressure on Simeone to deliver to win a first major trophy since the sensational 2020-21 Liga title triumph. In that context, this feels like a make-or-break campaign for the club's iconic coach.

But if he were to stand down at some point between now and next season, who could possibly fill the void? According to Simeone's former assistant coach German Burgos, there's only one possible choice. ""Fernando Torres,"" the Argentine told MARCA only last week, ""he's ready to do it.""

That may seem like a bold claim, given Torres has yet to manage at the very highest level, but the former Spain striker is held in the highest esteem at Atleti - and not just because of his past exploits as a player...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The most tantalising fixture on matchday one of the new Champions League season comes from the Allianz Arena, where kings of Germany Bayern Munich play host to Club World Cup winners Chelsea. These two teams have history - this will be the Blues' first trip back to Bavaria since lifting their first European Cup there in 2012 - but there is an extremely contemporary entity now linking them.

At the back end of the summer transfer window just gone, Bayern were desperately scouring Europe for a versatile attacker to strengthen their forward line. They had swung and missed on Nick Woltemade, who was signed by Newcastle after giving in to Stuttgart's hefty demands. 

The search for an alternative led them to Nicolas Jackson, who had been thrust into Chelsea's 'bomb squad' over the summer. This was despite him performing admirably over his two seasons in the first team and emerging as one of their most reliable sources of goals.

At the end of an on-again off-again saga, Jackson signed for Bayern on an initial loan with conditions to make the move permanent later down the line. Though he is still technically an employee of Chelsea, he is eligible to face his parent side on Wednesday due to UEFA rules - a wrinkle that has been to the detriment of the west Londoners before. 

Jackson may not publicly be out for revenge and is said to be grateful that he had the opportunity to represent a club of such stature, but he nevertheless has the chance to stick two fingers up at the regime who sent him packing at the first sign of trouble.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 It has been a testing 2025 so far for Shang Juncheng, but the #NextGenATP star did not disappoint upon returning to action in front of his home fans at the Chengdu Open. 

 The 20-year-old Shang held off Zizou Bergs for a 6-1, 5-7, 6-4 victory on Wednesday at the ATP 250 where he lifted the trophy a year ago. Shang, who did not compete from January until late July due to a foot injury on which he underwent surgery in March, dug deep to hold off the World No. 46 Bergs and register his first match win since his return to action. 

The defending champion is BACK 👑

 The lefty saved six of seven break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats, during a gutsy performance in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Bergs. When a break up in the third set, Shang crucially rallied from 0/40 to hold serve for 5-3, and he held to love in his next service game to clinch his triumph. 

 At the venue where he became the first Chinese player to win an ATP Tour title on home soil a year ago, Shang did not show much visible emotion upon closing out his win nor while embracing Bergs at the net. Yet he later wore a beaming smile throughout the on-court interview that followed his hard-earned win. 

 A competitor at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Shang remains 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, although he could rise as high as eighth by successfully defending his Chengdu crown. His next test at the hard-court event in Sichuan province is a second-round meeting with fourth seed Brandon Nakashima. 

 Another Chinese #NextGenATP wild card, Zhou Yi, also enjoyed a memorable start to his Chengdu campaign by upsetting World No. 34 Cameron Norrie. The 20-year-old Zhou saved a match point when serving at 4-5, 30/40 in the third set before prevailing 6-7(3), 6-4, 7-6(2) for the biggest win his career by PIF ATP Ranking. His next opponent will be Christopher O'Connell, after the Australian downed Quentin Halys 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-4. 

 Marcos Giron also secured a second-round spots on Day 1 in Chengdu. Giron eased past his fellow American Ethan Quinn 7-5, 6-4 and will next face eighth seed Lorenzo Sonego or Juan Manuel Cerundolo.

It is safe to say Joao Fonseca will never forget 16 September 2025.

Before the start of the Laver Cup, the #NextGenATP Brazilian star has already experienced a memorable moment. The 19-year-old met Roger Federer on Tuesday.

“My hands are sweating because I'm going to meet Roger,” Fonseca said in a Laver Cup video.

Milestone Moment 🤩#LaverCup | #JaoFonseca | @rogerfederer pic.twitter.com/yAI4fCTy38

Shortly thereafter, the 103-time tour-level titlist arrived to chat with the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion.

“Finally! Nice to meet you, it's a pleasure,” Federer said. “Congratulations on everything so far, yeah. Well done on a great career so far.”

“They told me like 10 minutes ago, ‘You're going to meet Roger',” Fonseca told Federer, showing the Swiss his sweaty palms.

The ATP has today announced the appointment of Eno Polo as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO), effective immediately.

Polo brings extensive global leadership experience across sport, fashion, and consumer industries. Since 2021, he has served as a Player Representative on the ATP Board of Directors, a role that has provided him with a deep understanding of the ATP's operations, stakeholder landscape, and long-term strategic priorities. This experience positions him uniquely to step into the CEO role with immediate impact and continuity.

As CEO, Polo will oversee the ATP's global operations and continue to drive OneVision – a transformative plan designed to grow the sport, elevate fan engagement, and deliver long-term value for players, tournaments, and partners across the Tour.

“Eno is a dynamic and accomplished leader who understands both the commercial landscape and the intricacies of professional tennis,” said Andrea Gaudenzi, ATP Chairman. “His tenure on the ATP Board has given him direct insight into the sport's challenges and opportunities. This is an exciting time for tennis, with significant opportunities ahead amid a changing landscape. We are delighted to welcome Eno as CEO as we continue to advance the sport through our OneVision strategy.”

“Tennis is at a transformative moment as a global sport and business. The opportunity that lies ahead is immense,” said Eno Polo. “Having had the privilege of working closely with players and tournaments, I know the power of collaboration. It's an honour to step into this role as ATP CEO and help lead the organisation in its next phase of growth.”



A former professional tennis player, Polo was born and raised in Kenya and represented the Kenyan national team in Davis Cup competition, before embarking on an international business career. He has since held senior leadership roles at Nike, Juventus F.C., Havaianas, Global Brands Group and LeDap, among others.

Polo succeeds Massimo Calvelli, who stepped down as CEO in June 2025 following more than five years of leadership. He will be based at the ATP's London office.

Italy became the first nation to reach the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals in Shenzhen after Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Jasmine Paolini each won three-set matches against China on Tuesday.

Defending champion Italy became the first nation to reach the semifinals of this year's Billie Jean King Cup with a 2-0 win over host China on Tuesday in Shenzhen.

Italy rallied in both singles matches to clinch the tie.

Cocciaretto rallies twice to give Italy the lead

In the opener, China's Yue Yuan, ranked No. 102, thrilled the home crowd by taking the first set 6-4 and building a 5-2 lead in the second. But Elisabetta Cocciaretto fought back, winning five straight games to steal the set 7-5.

Yuan again surged ahead in the third, breaking twice for a 4-0 lead and later going up 5-2. Cocciaretto, ranked No. 91, responded once more, drawing level at 5-all before breaking again and holding serve to close out a 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 victory in 2 hours, 52 minutes. The win put Italy up 1-0.

Paolini rallies to clinch tie for Italy

In the second singles match, China's Wang Xinyu, ranked No. 34, broke Jasmine Paolini in the eighth game to take the opening set 6-4.

Wang secured another break in the second and served at 5-3, but Paolini, the World No. 8, turned the match around. She broke back, forced a tiebreak and took the set to keep Italy's semifinal hopes alive.

With momentum on her side, Paolini broke early in the third set for a 2-0 lead. Wang responded by winning four straight games to go up 4-2, but Paolini answered with a run of her own, sweeping the final four games to close out a 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 victory. The win secured Italy's place in the semifinals.

Next up

Italy will face the winner of Wednesday's quarterfinal between five-time champion Spain and Ukraine, which is seeking its first title in the competition. On Thursday, Kazakhstan meets the United States and Great Britain faces Japan in the remaining quarterfinals.

A new addition to the CX family brings precise targeting, great feel and an eye-catching cosmetic.ByJon LeveyPublished Sep 17, 2025 copy_link

Published Sep 17, 2025

The CX 200 18x20 shares the same specs as the current CX 200, only with a denser string pattern. Like the other CX updates, string spacing has been widened in the center of the string bed (dubbed Powergrid Stringtech+) to give it enhanced spin potential and power. The hoop also now has more of a box shape at the 2 and 10 o'clock positions to improve the racquet's stability and increase frame stiffness through the face and throat. The greater composure at contact makes for more accurate ball striking. A new vibration dampening material (Vibroshield) has been inserted at 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the face and in the throat area of the frame for a more comfortable feel at contact. This limited edition comes in a throwback cosmetic that pays homage to the classic Dunlop Max 200G.What WorksThe trappings of 18x20 string pattern frames—heightened control, dependable response, connected feedback—are less appealing in today's game where power and spin have become the big dogs of performance. However, while perhaps less in vogue, there's still a segment of players who prefer more refined, predictable racquets that set the stage for varied shot-making and tactics. Which is the playability you get with this new addition to Dunlop's CX franchise—and the retro graphics and detailing will turn a few heads while doing.As with the other 200s in the CX franchise—Dunlop's control series—the 200 (18x20) doesn't wow with power, which could be generously described as adequate. It's larger hitting surface and thicker beam make it friendlier than the CX 200 Tour—the other member of the family with an 18x20 pattern—but it's still for players who either crave total command over their shots, or have the mechanics and swing speed to generate most of their own pace.

The CX 200 (18x20) has colors and graphics that pay tribute to the brand's famed Max 200G

Fortunately, the racquet's weight distribution, slim profile and feathery swingweight are assets in that pursuit. Leaning into ground strokes and serves with full, fast cuts can result in authoritative shots that keep opponents on their heels. What's more, the pace can be directed into tight windows as the frame's control is first-rate. It allows users to go for their shots without much fear that the racquet will steer them wrong.Like power, spin is mostly dependent on player skill. The updated Power Grid configuration widens the spacing of the cross strings to help the cause, but it's still an 18x20. The tight pattern is capable of putting rotation on the ball, only it won't add much to what you currently bring to the court. On the plus side, it stands out when flattening out passing shots and short ball put-aways.The clean, borderline classic feel at impact from the medium-firm beam is also a real draw. Even with a full bed of polyester (Dunlop Explosive 17g) strung in the upper 40s, contact it's comfortable and arm-friendly. A thin, rubber material (Flex Booster) has been added to the handle to help in this regard, and it seems to do the trick. Yet there's plenty of ball connection to produce a delicate drop shot or gauge the distance on a block lob. Imperfect strikes above the sweet spot drew occasional twisting and a noticeable power outage, but there was little harshness or discomfort. And stability on the whole was surprisingly good for a racquet with its mass distribution.

The combination of the 18x20 string pattern in a 98 square-inch head fills a gap in the Dunlop lineup

The response, control and smooth handling all add up to solid net play. The racquet volleys so capably that it encourages more forays into the forecourt to finish points. As with ground strokes, you do need competent footwork and weight transfer to hit a penetrating volley when pace isn't supplied by the passing shot. With those basics in place, there's no problem punching a shot into the open court. When subtlety is desired, the flex is just enough to suck the life out of passes for a drop volley or finesse a tricky half volley from off the shoe-tops.What Needs WorkThe CX 200's head-light balance and low swingweight help get the tip around quickly, but it also brings a lack of inherent muscle. At times the racquet can feel overwhelmed by heavy incoming traffic. Similarly, it seems like you need to work harder for your desired results. Players accustomed to the boost a stiffer, more powerful frame provides their shots could be a little underwhelmed by this racquet's mph potential.If you're looking for a heftier feel, added pop and more sturdiness against pace, the frame's specs make it ripe for customization. The static weight is fairly lean, and the balance and swingweight make additional mass quite manageable. Some lead around the hoop would help bolster the frame's stability and give it some extra plow-through. It won't transform the racquet into a rocket launcher, but if that's what you're after chances are this wouldn't make your demo list in the first place.

(My job) is just to give them energy,” Borg reflected in his final press conference with the team. “They know exactly how to play, what they should do. But for me, as a captain, (I) give energy to these guys…“It's unbelievable. I'm very happy, because it's my last year Laver Cup, and for me to have this team, it's beautiful. Very nice.”📲 🖥️ Watch the 2025 Laver Cup beginning Friday, September 19, on the Tennis Channel app

Cadillac boss on Colton Herta's F1 ambitions - F1 Beyond The Grid Podcast

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Valtteri Bottas was linked to a seat at Alpine before signing for Cadillac.

Flavio Briatore says there was “never really a discussion” around Valtteri Bottas racing for Alpine in the future, following confirmation of the Finn's deal with new F1 team Cadillac.

Alpine are one of four outfits – alongside Red Bull, Mercedes and Racing Bulls – yet to confirm their full 2026 driver line-ups, with Pierre Gasly recently signing a contract extension but no word yet on who his team mate will be next year or beyond.

Given Franco Colapinto's challenges since replacing Jack Doohan earlier in the season, two drivers who had been linked to Alpine were current Mercedes reserve Bottas, and Sergio Perez – both left without seats at the end of last year.

However, while he admitted to speaking with “a lot of people” over the summer, Alpine Executive Advisor Briatore has insisted that the multiple race winners were never seriously in the frame for a seat at his squad.

Asked if he saw Bottas and Perez as options, before the pair signed for Cadillac, Briatore replied: “No, really. I talked with a lot of people. I talked with Bottas. We talked with Toto [Wolff, Mercedes boss] as well at the time. But really, there was never a discussion for Bottas to drive for Alpine.

“I think Alpine helped Bottas a little bit to sign the contract with Cadillac. We did some marketing. I like Valtteri because he's a super driver. He was unlucky to be in Mercedes at the same time as Lewis [Hamilton], when Lewis was really at the peak of his driving.

“We have a different idea, but it's nice to have Valtteri back. It's nice to have a driver back with a lot of experience, but I'm looking for something else.”

Briatore, speaking in the team bosses' press conference at the Dutch Grand Prix, also shared his thoughts on Colapinto's future – and what he needs to see from the Argentinian youngster if he is to secure his place beyond 2025.

“I think I see everything already,” said Briatore. “I don't need to see anything anymore. It's difficult. For this driver, it's very difficult to cope with this car. These cars are very, very heavy, very quick.

“For a young driver to [be] put in F1, maybe it was not the timing to have Franco in F1. Maybe he needs another year or two to be part of F1. I know that, in the end, what is important is the result.

“Franco tries very hard. He tries very hard with the engineers to please them in everything, but it's not what I expect from Colapinto.”

That said, Briatore went on to praise Colapinto for delivering “probably his strongest” race of the season at Zandvoort, after the F2 race winner narrowly missed out on a points finish.

Cadillac boss on Colton Herta's F1 ambitions - F1 Beyond The Grid Podcast

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

Baku is one of the trickiest circuits on the F1 calendar, punishing the smallest mistakes with its unforgiving walls – so which drivers and teams are poised to master it?

After the roar of Monza, Formula 1 returns to the streets of Baku – a venue where sheer speed meets tight walls. With unforgiving corners and high risk, high reward overtaking zones, Azerbaijan presents both similarity and stark contrast to the Temple of Speed.

So, who's equipped to thrive in F1 Fantasy? The Baku City Circuit presents one of the most unpredictable challenges of the year, with its mix of low-speed corners and one of the longest straights in F1. Our F1 Fantasy Strategist takes stock of the most reliable and opportunistic assets that could shape your fantasy score this weekend.

It's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Be sure to join the Street Showdown for a two-race mini league across Azerbaijan and Singapore too. There are exciting new prizes on offer, including an Red Bull replica drivers race suit! Keep your eyes peeled for exciting mini leagues opening later in the F1 Fantasy season too, providing you with even more opportunities to play and win.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

With Baku's combination of high speeds and tight walls (especially through the castle section), patience and timing are everything. Overtaking opportunities down the kilometre-long main straight can shuffle the order quickly, while Safety Cars are always a factor – making reliable drivers and strong constructors even more crucial.

Catch up on the Italian Grand Prix highlights below and keep reading for more tips. Remember to lock in your teams before the Qualifying starts on Saturday, September 20 at 1600 local time (1200 UTC).

Lando Norris is not a pick for the risk-averse F1 Fantasy manager.

The McLaren racer has two retirements (Montreal and Zandvoort) in the last seven races, but has also banked scores of 30+ fantasy points in each of the other five – no other driver has more than four in that period.

The nine-time race winner drove from P15 to P4 in 2024, on his way to a 38-point performance and the fastest lap last time out in Baku.

Norris leads all drivers with the highest number of fastest laps (six) in 2025, worth 10 points in F1 Fantasy. If you're confident Norris can win in Baku, he represents an incredibly high points ceiling.

It's hard to ignore the rich vein of form Alex Albon is currently in.

The Thai driver secured his fifth-consecutive double-digit F1 Fantasy score on his way to P7 in Monza – his 11th points finish in 16 races this season for the Grove-based team.

Since Silverstone, Albon has been the fifth-highest scoring driver in F1 Fantasy, averaging 16.0 points and outscoring the likes of more expensive assets Charles Leclerc ($23.3m) and Lewis Hamilton ($23.2m) during that time.

If Williams can deliver more straight-line performance in Baku, Albon will be worth owning this weekend.

Oliver Bearman continues to deliver as a consistent beacon of F1 Fantasy production in 2025.

Fascinatingly, the British driver stood in at Baku for former Haas stalwart Kevin Magnussen in 2024, recording six overtakes and finishing P10 in only his second Formula 1 race at the time.

This year, the rookie leads all drivers in overtakes per race (4.4) and is second for positions gained per race (3.8).

Baku is a track that presents several excellent overtaking opportunities, which makes Bearman worthy of serious consideration at this circuit.

Isack Hadjar is back on the Strategist's watchlist for another week after recent strong results for Racing Bulls.

Over the last three races, the French driver averages 16.3 fantasy points – the sixth-best average on the grid in that window.

He has been the best-value asset in the game from Hungary onwards, recording 3.09 points for every $1 million spent, and could still rise $0.6m in value even if he received the dreaded -20 point penalty for a DNF.

Hadjar's friendly price point also facilitates upgrades to other parts of your team. If you're targeting premium assets in Baku such as McLaren and Ferrari, Hadjar helps enable that.

Pierre Gasly has had something of an underwhelming season in 2025 and has been in the F1 Fantasy wilderness as a result – but this could change in Azerbaijan.

The 29-year-old secured P3 and P5 results in 2021 and 2022 respectively, which may provide a much-needed confidence boost to his chances this weekend.

The Alpine racer has hit the $4.5m price floor, meaning he can go no lower in value and is a safe pair of hands around a track that has claimed many driver retirements over the years.

Gasly has four double-digit F1 Fantasy scores to his name this season, so the potential to score well is certainly there.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Charles Leclerc

McLaren are unstoppable right now in F1 Fantasy – there is no other way to put it.

After a below-average 52 points in Zandvoort, the Woking-based team bounced back in Monza to record their fifth score of 90+ points in the last six race weekends.

Surprisingly, McLaren leaned heavily on their success in the pit box. After a slow start to the season for scoring points from fast pit stops (the team only scored 15 points once in the first 13 races in this scoring category), McLaren have since recorded 25-point pit stop bonuses in two of the last three race weekends.

It's impossible to ignore McLaren as a consistent source of points and Baku will be no different.

Red Bull have flown under the radar as an F1 Fantasy asset lately, but they might have turned a corner in Monza.

Max Verstappen recorded his third win of the season, which contributed to the team's best score in F1 Fantasy since they last set foot in Italy (Imola 2025 – 71 points).

Over the last five races, Red Bull also lead all teams for fast pit stop points, averaging 12.4 per race in that span.

Verstappen has finished on the podium twice in his last three visits to Baku and Red Bull have won three of the last four Grands Prix in Azerbaijan. If Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda look competitive in practice, Red Bull could be a convincing differential option this weekend.

Other constructors to monitor: Ferrari, Williams

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the early sessions to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

In this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

Six months before their first race, the new Cadillac Formula 1 Team is already moving fast. The drivers have been signed, the car is being developed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and engineers are running simulations to prepare for Grand Prix racing.

Leading Cadillac to the Formula 1 grid is Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, who knows how to launch a brand-new team. He did it in 2010 with Virgin Racing, which raced at the back of the grid and was graced by the talent of the late Jules Bianchi.

And in this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells pod host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

He explains why Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are the perfect drivers for the team, and why he admires Cadillac reserve driver Colton Herta for swapping IndyCar for a shot at racing in F1.

In recent months, studios have started to sue AI companies that allow users to generate images and videos of copyrighted characters. They characterize the alleged theft of their content as an existential threat to Hollywood. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Universal Pictures have sued a Chinese artificial intelligence image and video generator for copyright infringement, opening another front in a high-stakes battle involving the use of movies and TV shows owned by major studios to teach AI systems.


	The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday in California federal court, accuses MiniMax of building its business by plundering the studios' intellectual property. Its service, Hailuo AI, allows users to generate content of iconic copyrighted characters.




	The studios characterize MiniMax's alleged infringement as an existential threat. Given the rapid advancement of AI technology, it's “only a matter of time until Hailuo AI can generate unauthorized, infringing videos” that are “substantially longer, and even eventually the same duration as a movie or television program,” the lawsuit says.

	For years, AI companies have been training their technology on data scraped across the internet without compensating creators. It's led to lawsuits from authors, record labels, news organizations, artists and studios, which contend that some AI tools erode demand for their content.


	Earlier this month, Warner Bros. Discovery joined Disney and Universal in suing Midjourney for allegedly training its AI system on its movies and TV shows. By their thinking, the AI company is a free-rider plagiarizing their content.

	











	In a statement, Motion Picture Association CEO Charles Rivkin said AI companies will be “held accountable for infringing on the rights of American creators wherever they are located.” He added, “We remain concerned that copyright infringement, left unchecked, threatens the entire American motion picture industry.”


	MiniMax markets its Hailuo AI as a “Hollywood studio in your pocket” and uses studios' characters in promotional materials, the lawsuit says.


	When prompted with Darth Vader, the service returns an image of the character with a Minimax watermark, according to the complaint. It can also generate videos of characters seen across Disney, Warner Bros. and Universal movies and TV shows, including Minions, Guardians of the Galaxy and Superman, the lawsuit claims. 


	The only way MiniMax's technology would be able do so, the studios allege, is if the company trained its AI system on their intellectual property.


	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including disgorgement of profits, and a court order barring MiniMax from continuing to exploit studios' works.

A father and son join a group of itinerant ravers in the deserts of Morocco in Laxe's techno-tracked drama about the end of the world. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Spain has selected Oliver Laxe‘s Sirat, a near-future drama about the end of the world set to a thumping techno soundtrack, as its contender for the 2026 Oscars in the best international feature category.


	The drama follows a father and son who hook up with a group of itinerant ravers in the deserts of Morocco. What starts as a search for the family's lost daughter becomes something else when the world outside — as reported in static-heavy radio broadcasts — appears to collapse, leaving the group with only themselves to confront the threatening world around them.

	Laxe's fourth film premiered in Cannes, where it was a critical breakout, and won the jury prize. In her review for The Hollywood Reporter, Lovia Gyarke called it “an energizing film — a project determined to wake us up.”

Sirat was picked from a shortlist of three finalists, which also included Carla Simón's Romería and Deaf by Eva Libertad. 


	Produced by Movistar Plus+ in collaboration with Pedro Almodóvar's production company El Deseo, Filmes da Ermida, Uri Films, and 4a4 Productions, Sirat is being sold internationally by The Match Factory. Neon has domestic rights. 


	Spain is among the most successful countries at the Oscars, with a total of 20 nominations and four wins — for Begin the Beguine in 1983, Belle Époque in 1994, Almodóvar's All About My Mother in 2000 and The Sea Inside in 2005 — all taking the Academy Award in the best international feature category. The last Spanish Oscar nominee in the category was J. A. Bayona's Society of the Snow in 2024. 

	











	The Academy will announce the first shortlist of 15 films in contention for the 2026 best international feature Oscar on Dec. 16, 2025. The final nominations will be announced on Jan. 22, 2026. The 98th Academy Awards Ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on March 15, 2026.

The 'Columbus' and 'After Yang' helmer directs a Black List screenplay in this film also featuring Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Kevin Kline.


							By 

	Richard Lawson



A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is, unfortunately, the kind of movie in which a doting boyfriend tells his girlfriend that he has made reservations at “your favorite restaurant,” as if that is a way that couples speak to each other in real life. Most of us who are actually alive would, y'know, instead say the name of the restaurant; such is the shorthand understanding that passes between two people who have known each other for some time. But this film is not interested in such credibility. 


	In that dopey beau's defense, he is mostly a fantastical re-creation of a memory. Sarah (Margot Robbie) has traveled back into her past to revisit this scene, a prelude to a breakup, among other painful or otherwise illuminating moments that have come to define her guarded, pessimistic view on relationships. She's on her quest alongside David (Colin Farrell), a lonely sad sack she met at a wedding and gave a gentle kiss-off after a mild flirtation. But destiny and a magical GPS system have reunited them on a road trip of the soul, on which boy and girl will reconcile themselves with their hang-ups and traumas and, just maybe, learn to love one another.

The Bottom Line

	
	A magical mystery tour, with greeting-card sentiment.
	



Release Date: Friday, September 19Cast: Colin Farrell, Margot Robbie, Lily Rabe, Hamish Linklater, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Kevin KlineDirector: KogonadaScreenwriter: Seth Reiss

									Rated R,
								1 hour 39 minutes			






	Yes, I did say magical GPS, just one of many twee devices used in director Kogonada's cloying act of whimsy. A Big Bold Beautiful Journey first existed as a buzzed-about Black List screenplay by Seth Reiss before becoming a rare non-franchise studio film to actually make it to production. Pairing indie darling Kogonada (Columbus, After Yang) with white-hot, potentially commercial material indeed seemed like a big, bold, beautiful idea. What a shame that what resulted is such plasticky schmaltz, a movie that could easily have been based on a once-trendy inspirational Instagram account, Rupi Kaur meets Dallas Clayton by way of a Claritin ad. 

	










			Related Video		







	Kogonada fills the film with saturated colors, favoring the primary standbys of fire-engine red, raincoat yellow and mailbox blue. There is plenty of green, too, with sweeping vistas of California's rolling hills before it all turns brown for the year. At least, the movie was filmed in California. For all I know, A Big Bold Beautiful Journey actually takes place on the Holodeck of the Starship Enterprise, so phony is everything contained within it. 


	Perhaps most ersatz of all are the film's emotional and psychological insights, puddle-deep ponderings of regret and grief and that reliable old friend of the screenwriter: fear of commitment. A Big Bold Beautiful Journey could be read as a neat distillation of all the necessary conversations that couples must have before they get serious, an unpacking of failed relationships, family issues, bad habits, nagging insecurities. Knowing all that, David and Sarah must then decide if they have it in themselves to take the leap. That was a great idea when Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did it, less so in this wholly generic take on the same themes. 


	The enchanted satnav system directs Sarah and David to various doors dotted along their circuitous route toward healing. One door leads David back to high school, where he relives his agony over a girl in his school play. It's fun to see Farrell doing a few bits of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, but other than that, I'm not sure what we glean from this experience other than a reminder that teen heartbreak is formative but no fun. Another door leads Sarah back to the time of her mother's death; there she rather swiftly processes the guilt she feels for being unavailable at the time, too busy carrying on an affair with a professor. 

	











	A few more Pensieve memories — sorry, door memories — are accessed, all meant to give us a picture of the particular wounds and neuroses that make up these characters. They don't feel terribly particular at all, though — not in Reiss' bland dialogue nor in Robbie and Farrell's wanly appealing, indistinct performances. It's all very easy, ideas of problems rather than actual problems. True ugliness, true complication are nowhere to be found in Kogonada's finger-paint-hued fable.


	There is a nice concept buried underneath the tidy cutesiness, a generous encouragement to not let all of life's baggage get so heavy that it halts forward momentum. Perhaps the real-world analog of a wizard's Waze is simply talk therapy, a slightly less bold or beautiful journey, though it can be a big one. Any film that urges people to see their foibles and worries as dynamic parts of themselves rather than unmoveable millstones is probably putting a healthy enough message into the world. But it might be nice if traditional monogamous couplehood wasn't fixed as the one true goal of such crucial work, as it is in A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. Sometimes it's good, and necessary, to open that door just for your own sake.

Three ‘RHOSLC' OGs dish on the upcoming drama and surreal fanfare around the show, while the series showrunner and a Bravo exec explain why the franchise is such a hit — and if Jen Shah or Monica Garcia will ever return to the cast.

[This story contains spoilers from The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City‘s season six premiere.]


	Heading into their sixth season, the team behind The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City knows there's pressure to deliver another compelling installment.




	But after losing one cast member in 2023 to prison time for partaking in a telemarketing scam and forfeiting another housewife a year later for her role in an Instagram troll account, it's safe to say the Salt Lake City housewives can bounce back from any and all setbacks.

	With no shortage of marital issues, conflict amongst the group, and viral upon viral moments (“Receipts! Proof! Timelines! Screenshots!” or “Rumors and nastiness,” to name a few), there's something about RHOSLC that stands out from other shows in the Bravo franchise. Showrunner Lori Gordon and Noah Samton, svp of unscripted production for NBCUniversal, believe that special ingredient is the women.

	











	“They're the perfect combination of drama, humor and personal story. They check every box that you want from a housewife,” Samton tells The Hollywood Reporter, while Gordon adds, “I don't think it's any coincidence that five of the original women are [still] on the show.” 


	With five OGs from the founding cast that was assembled in 2020 still in tact heading into season six, the women of Salt Lake City understand what's expected as housewives. Where the cast of the Beverly Hills cycle is often criticized for shielding pieces of their lives from cameras, or the New York City reboot was slammed for manufacturing storylines, Mary Cosby says the housewives of Salt Lake City have an undeniable “authenticity” factor that resonates with viewers.

	











	“We, as a cast, have grown into that area where we are all coming from an authentic place,” Cosby explains. “We're being real, and it's hard to achieve that, but we mastered being able to be our true selves, and we carry all this drama every single year.” 


	In separate conversations edited together below, Gordon and Samton dish on what sets Salt Lake City apart from the rest of the Real Housewives franchise and address rumors of ex-castmates Jen Shah and Monica Garcia ever returning to the series in the future, while Cosby, Heather Gay and Meredith Marks reflect on the season six premiere and how their cast will continue raise the bar.


	***


The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City has emerged as a juggernaut of the Real Housewives franchise. What do you credit to Salt Lake City's swift rise?


LORI GORDON (SHOWRUNNER) It's the women. They're always very authentic and very open in what's really going on in their lives. This season, Whitney [Rose] was very forthcoming with the failure of the business venture that her and her husband delved into. There's Mary and her son, which is a continuous story and battle for them, to this day as we speak, that she is constantly working on and being open about. It's a very hard subject. She's not like, “Oh, everything's great.” She knows it's an uphill battle for him; he falls back into delving into drinking and drugs, and then he is good for a few months. She's really embracing the reality of what that situation looks like for people, which I think is important and relatable. Nobody wants to tune in on a show and think, one stint in rehab and your kid's fine. And really all of them, whether it's business, accusations of lawsuits, rumors about their marriages, getting their kids to college — it's all relatable. One of them always seems to be tapping into something for the audience every season. [Writer's note: Lori Gordon's interview was conducted before TMZ reported on Robert Jr. Cosby's alleged arrest.]

	











NOAH SAMTON (SVP OF UNSCRIPTED PRODUCTION, NBCUNIVERSAL) They're the perfect combination of drama, humor and personal story. They check every box you want from a housewife. There's a really powerful storyline this coming season with Bronwyn [Newport] and what she's going through with her family, not to mention what she's shown with her daughter, Gwen, and the challenges she faced having her at such a young age in this shadow of the Mormon Church and pressure that put on her. They're just so open and willing to share about themselves, and yet at the same time, they are some of the funniest housewives on Bravo. 


As three of the five original cast members still on the series, Mary, Heather and Meredith, what has it been like watching the success and reach of RHOSLC continue to grow year after year? 


MARY COSBY Wow, it's been a journey. Surreal. It's unbelievable, but at the same time, it's kind of become a way of life. It's part of who I am now.


HEATHER GAY Can you believe it? I's obviously changed my entire life. And more than that, it's changed my entire perspective. At a time of my life where I really thought I was being put out to pasture, this whole second chapter has opened up, and it's only that much more fun because I'm sharing it with these women. If I had won the lottery, it would not be the same experience; it wouldn't have changed my life as much. My life has been changed by money and fame as much as it has been changed by my unique relationship with these women.

	











MEREDITH MARKS It's pretty wild, because I do think the chips were a bit stacked against us. Early on, we were kind of discarded as, “Oh, it's Salt Lake City.” We're not New York, we're not Beverly Hills, we're not Miami. I think a lot of people were like, “How's this gonna be so great?” So to be in the place we're in is very validating, and feels great.


A unique element about RHOSLC is the component of Mormonism. Before Salt Lake City, there was Sister Wives, and now we have The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives. What has it been like to see this rise of Mormons taking over reality TV, especially for you, Heather, as someone who has opened up about your story with the Church?


SAMTON I'm glad to see them all sort of jumping on our bandwagon and following along in what the Salt Lake City women have done so well. [Mormonism] was the original hook to the show. I had spent some time in Salt Lake City, but until I got into this show, I didn't really know how unique of a place it was. It's just a very special, unique kind of person that seems to grow up in that world. There's this tenant in the Mormon Church to aspire to perfection. Not just being perfect at your job, it's about being perfect looking. There's more med spas in Salt Lake City than there are in Beverly Hills. 


GAY I love it, I'm here for it. I feel like we really broke the code and brought it into this modern day world, and made Mormonism part of the zeitgeist and sparked all the curiosity about it. I think it's a rich, interesting, fascinating culture, and we've just barely started to scratch the surface. Housewives started it, and that's where we're gonna keep the crown, if you don't mind. We're gonna keep the Mormonism crown. Everybody's welcome to put their two cents in, but we started it and we're gonna keep it.

	











Something that is very exciting with season six is the crossover with Below Deck Down Under. Noah, where did this idea come from, and how did your team go about executing it?


SAMTON I oversee the Below Deck franchises, and for many years we have all talked about, “Wouldn't it be great to have Housewives on Below Deck?” After years of discussing it, we said, “This is the perfect time to really do a real crossover. The housewives will charter the yacht, and we'll shoot it for Salt Lake City at the same time we're shooting it for Below Deck Down Under.” It's going to be two separate shows telling the same story from two very different points of views. 


	And it was incredibly challenging. It's already incredibly challenging to shoot a TV show on a boat. You add in seven dynamic housewives on top of the Below Deck crew, and it's almost an impossible task. The showrunners for both shows were really put through their paces and stretched as thin as possible, but we always knew it was going to be great, because the Housewives of Salt Lake City are the ultimate challenging guests to have on Below Deck. And this cast for Below Deck Down Under has some very familiar faces coming back. We felt like they would be up to the task. Daisy [Kelliher] is the chief stew, Captain Jason [Chambers], Chef Ben [Robinson] … we felt like they would be up for the challenge, and they were. 


Lisa Barlow is notably missing from the season six premiere episode. At the time that filming picked up, there were rumors she might have not been coming back to the show. Was there any validity to those rumors, or did she really just have work at that moment in time?












GORDON She was always going to be part of the show. But I think it's really up to the audience of how they look at her decision to not be on that trip, in my opinion. I think it's nice to leave that open ended. She told the women she had work, she did have work. Could she have moved her trip to be there? That's something I think the viewers have to decide. Ultimately, her not being there gave the women the ability to say some things maybe they wouldn't have been able to say [with her present]. I think her not being there also affected her in the season. How that pans out is interesting, because it gave this rise for people to talk about some rumors and whether they're embellishing them, truth or not. 


This season, we also have Britani Bateman back as a friend. In the premiere, Britani fought with both Whitney and Meredith. Mary, Heather and Meredith, do you think Britani making sure that she had dialogue with a few of the cast members was her fighting for a snowflake?


COSBY Of course it was. Absolutely (Laughs). I think Britani's role works for the group as a friend role. As a housewife, you have to open up and show the world and share what you're going through, and be your true and authentic self. I don't think Britani offers that. I think Britani offers the level of a friend. 


GAY I don't think that she knows the difference between full force effort and not giving a fuck. I don't think it's a curated effort, but it's just the read I get when I'm with her. She is a little bit always herself, and that's a little bit oblivious. I think it's a natural state for her to be constantly inserting herself in the dialogue. I don't think her agenda is directly linked to a snowflake at all. I think she just wants to be there in general.

	











MARKS Britani's kind of just all over the place. We've seen that she'll say anything. Everything is, “Oh, let me make this right by telling you I lied about that.” It's the most bizarre thing. I don't get it. She's just all over the place.


What were your reactions when Angie Katsanevas compared Lisa to Jen Shah? 


GORDON It's interesting. There was a lot of miscommunication in how it came out and how the women took it. There was a lot of mystery around Jen, and not until later in [the] third season was [there] a lot of, “Who is Jen? What do we know about her?” Like, we want to believe everything she's told us, because we love her and she's in our friend group. But the second she pleaded guilty, it became a different story. So I think it's the women treading lightly. They're a little bit scared of being burned again like that. 


COSBY That was a little too far. No one deserves to be compared to Jeh Shah. Absolutely no one. It was a little much for me.  Lisa runs a legitimate business, and Jen Shah didn't. It was a little far. [Angie] tried to retract it, though.


GAY I was shocked, and it felt like it came out of left field and seemed a little preposterous.


MARKS Not great. Because the thing is, these are civil charges, and there are other criminal charges out there about other cast members. So I don't really understand why this was such a big deal. Anybody can file a civil lawsuit. This isn't the government, it's not the state. It's not the United States going after Lisa, it is an individual. I can file a lawsuit against any of those women tomorrow if I felt like it, and then let's see what they have to say (laughs).

	











Monica Garcia recently said that people think the RHOSLC team is waiting until Jen is released from prison to bring both women back to the show at the same time. Is there any validity to this rumor?


GORDON That's hysterical. No, there's no validity to it. There's so much to do in every season between shooting the show and editing the show that we're so hyper-focused on this season, we don't really even think about a next season until we're in it. 


SAMTON There is no plan in place one way or another. Honestly, we're so happy with the cast and where they are right now. Ask me again, maybe in January, and we can have a different conversation about it. But as of right now, nobody's even thinking about Jen Shah and Monica. Jen's not even out of jail yet, right? So, yeah, we're not there. But of course, if I was a fan, I would be speculating the same thing.


With Jen's prison release roughly a year away, is there a world where you see her coming back to the show? Or do you think the weight of her crimes and her pleading guilty deters her from potentially returning?


GORDON: I may have opinions that are considered because I've been working on the show for so long, but that's above my pay grade (laughs). I feel like ultimately that comes down to a Bravo, NBCUniversal [decision]. But honestly, whether or not Jen or Monica or anybody comes back, I don't know.


SAMTON: That's a very tough question, and I don't know that I have an answer for you right now. There's a lot of things to weigh and consider with that. We're not even far enough in thinking or discussing for me to give you any direction at all on that one.

	











Does it frustrate you when people ask if Jen will come back? The cast has obviously continued on without her, but there's always going to be that question because of her story. 


GORDON No, you know why it doesn't? Because it goes to show that they really like the people on the show. And by the way, Jen was amazing in so many ways. She made bad choices that she definitely regrets and she's paying for, but ultimately, I loved working with Jen. I loved working with Monica. I love working with all of them. And the truth is, the audience also recognizes the great things about Jen. She wasn't an entirely awful person, and neither was Monica. There [were] good things and bad things about them, just like there's good and bad things about every cast member. The only difference is they're not on the show anymore. So I think if people didn't ask me about Jen or Monica, I would think, Wow, they really just didn't care about those people, which would be more upsetting. It's more of a compliment that they do ask. Because that means the women did their job, and we as a team did our job in telling great stories.


When Jen and Monica left the show, there was skepticism about how RHOSLC would move on and if the cast would be able to continue without them, but you all have proved skeptics wrong. How does it feel to continuously prove people wrong while also raising the bar with, arguably, the best modern Real Housewives franchise?












GORDON Every season going into every major thing we do, I give a pep talk to women in terms of encouraging them to surprise me, surprise the audience. They know what the expectation is; they're hard on themselves, and they don't settle. I always say, “Tell me something I don't know. Say something new and don't be a yes man. Don't be the friend that everything is perfect. Nobody wants that person as a friend.” And also, nobody ever wants to confide in the person that you get on the phone with, and they're like, “Oh, everything's great. My marriage is great. My kids are great. Everything's amazing.” It's like, no, be the friend that everybody in the audience wants to call. Be honest, be relatable, surprise me. And they really always do. They up the ante, and they have such a great way of doing it. 


GAY It's so thrilling to think how far we've come. We were really underestimated. I love these women in Salt Lake. We have grown together. We have been through a lot, and that makes me feel like it's part of the magic of our friendships. No matter how badly we hate each other or aren't getting along, equal to the conflict, there is a lot of love and shared experiences and codependency. We can fight hard but we can play hard, and that's what keeps us connected to each other.


MARKS A lot of times it gets lost, not just with Salt Lake, but all of the cities, that it's an ensemble [cast]. It's not one person making [the show]. So as long as the dynamics are strong within that group, pulling one person out probably isn't going to make that big of a difference. It's not about who's the star or who's supporting or whatever. I think the more that the women get that, the better it works. 

	











COSBY It comes from authenticity. It comes from living your real, true life in front of the cameras. I believe in being myself. Either you like me or you like us, or you don't. As a cast, we have grown into that area where we are all coming from an authentic place. We're being real, and it's hard to achieve that, but [in] some kind of way, we mastered to be able to be our true selves, and we carry all this drama every single year.


Mary, last season, you and your son opened up about some struggles that Robert Jr. has been going through [with addiction]. That moment is one of, if not the most, heart-wrenching moments in the Real Housewives franchise. Looking back, what has the reception been to opening up about that journey last season, and how are you guys doing today?


COSBY It's been good. People responded good. That's a silent epidemic. It's a problem in our world, not just our country. It's real, it's happening. It's in people's homes. We're not the only ones facing it. My son and I didn't even plan [to talk about that on camera]. The cameras started rolling, and he and I just started talking. He was shocking me and I was shocking him, and we were just being ourselves as if cameras wasn't there. To be able to get that reaction and feedback from people is mind-blowing. It's humbling. It feels good. I'm glad I did it. I wouldn't change anything. And how we're doing today is, you know, my son is on his own journey and he has to make his own mind up. I can't do it for him. I can be supportive. I can try and steer him in the right way, but at the end of the day, it's his journey and it's his life. It's his mindset. [If] his mind's not made up, there's not really a whole lot I can do, you know? But we're working through that. 

	











Looking back on season six, who surprised you the most out of all of the women?


COSBY Maybe Britani being there … no, I'm just kidding. Maybe Meredith surprised me, and the way she moved through this season. Meredith kind of stepped up this season.


GAY I'm still continually surprised by how involved Mary is. For so long, Mary was just like, “You idiots, go do that. I'm not gonna participate.” But she really is in it with us, on every level. She camped — she sat around a campfire, and it was her activity (laughs). I'm constantly surprised, and I think her story has been as remarkable as anyone's.


MARKS That's a really hard question. Heather.


Describe season six of The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City in one word.


COSBY Amazing.


GAY Unstoppable.


MARKS Lies.

The pop star will be joined on the sofa by Cillian Murphy, Greta Lee and other guests.

Taylor Swift is living that life of a Graham Norton Show girl. On Wednesday (Sept. 17), the BBC announced that the pop superstar is making her return to the iconic red couch for her latest interview with the quirky British presenter, with Cillian Murphy, Greta Lee and more stars set to join her.

	











	The episode Swift will appear on is set to broadcast live in London at 10:40 p.m. local time on Oct. 3, the same day her new album, The Life of a Showgirl, is arriving. In addition to the Oppenheimer star and Past Lives actress, Jodie Turner-Smith and Domhnall Gleeson will take part in host Graham Norton's signature group interview.


	Plus, Lewis Capaldi will perform on the program, which will mark the second episode of season 33 of The Graham Norton Show.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Swift is a seasoned veteran of the talk show at this point, having guested multiple times over the years. In 2013, she made her debut on Graham Norton following the release of her Red album, and in 2014, her terse exchange with John Cleese over his musings on cats and women went viral. She also appeared in 2019 and performed “Me!” on the show, and sat down again for a chat with Norton and Eddie Redmayne in 2022.


	Her upcoming stop by the Graham Norton Show marks the latest step in Swift's promo for The Life of a Showgirl, which she announced in August via an appearance on then-boyfriend, now-fiancé Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast. The 14-time Grammy winner made all 12 songs on the LP with past collaborators Max Martin and Shellback.

	











	“I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she said on New Heights. “[The album is] a lot more upbeat, and it's a lot more fun pop excitement. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it … We've made songs that I'm so proud of.”


	With a couple weeks left to go before Swift talks more about Showgirl on Graham Norton, get ready for the interview by looking back on all the times she's previously appeared on the show below.

The rapper told CBS Mornings that she's excited to start a family with NFL boyfriend Stefon Diggs.


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



Cardi B shared some exciting news on CBS Mornings on Wednesday (Sept. 17): she's expecting a baby with boyfriend Stefon Diggs. The “WAP” rapper revealed to co-host Gayle King that she and the New England Patriots wide receiver are gearing up to welcome their little one before she is slated to kick off her just-announced Little Miss Drama tour in February.


	“Yes, I am [pregnant]. I'm having a baby with my boyfriend, Stefon Diggs,” Cardi, 32, said with a smile. “I'm excited. I'm happy. I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work. But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, and me and my man, we're very supportive of each other.” The baby news comes just as Cardi — already a mother of three young ones with ex-husband rapper Offset — is gearing up for the release of her long-awaited sophomore studio LP, Am I the Drama?, which drops on Friday (Sept. 19).

	











	Cardi said she and Diggs, 31, are in the “same space” in their careers, with both arguably “great” at what they respectively do. “Yeah, we're one of the greatest, but what's next? What are we doing again?” she said of their mutual ambition. “We're never comfortable, we just want to keep doing it.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	King asked about the new album track “Safe” and if Diggs makes Cardi feel that way. “Very safe, in both ways, physically — I mean, like you see how big he is — and he just makes me feel safe and very confident and very, like, strong.” She described having a panic attack a few weeks ago, during which she was “crying and crying and crying” over her nerves surrounding the LP's release. 


	“People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me,” she said. “And I'm like, see, this is why I don't put music out, because it's like, this is my art and this is something that I put a lotta love and time to. And it's just like, sometimes, when people just rip it apart it just hurts you and it crushes you.”


	But, she added, Diggs' support has made her feel “very confident” and like she can take on the world.


	She then sent a direct message to all the haters and talkers who've been speculating about her for the past few weeks. “Ya'll wanted to know, right? Now y'all know. Now y'all could buy my album so I could buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff,” she said with a sassy head finger shake. “Now go support my album because I'm a mother of four now.”


	In a serious moment, Cardi explained that she wanted to make the baby announcement on her own time and on her own terms, explaining that she wasn't hiding anything, but was just trying to “close some deals” before officially sharing the news. “You don't really want to say right away that you're pregnant,” she added, noting that expectant mothers typically want to see a few sonograms and make sure their baby is healthy before revealing their pregnancies.

	











	In fact, she hasn't even told her parents at the time the interview was taped, joking that she's “scared of them,” but that she's happy they like Diggs, who has a young daughter.


	Cardi has been in full promo mode this week, interrupting Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show monologue on Tuesday night (Sept. 16) to plug the album and dipping into TODAY With Jenna & Friends earlier in the day to announce her 30-date Little Miss Drama tour, slated to kick off on Feb. 11; she confirmed to King that the baby is due before the tour launch.


	“I'm ready, even when I'm pregnant I've very, very ready,” she told King about how she's feeling about being a new mom again as she gears up for her first-ever arena tour. “As soon as I give birth, tour rehearsal stars,” she said. “I don't come from weak women.”


	She also told host Jenna Bush Hager that despite her testy split with Migos rapper Offset she's a “hopeless romantic” who would definitely get married again. “I believe in love,” she said.


Am I the Drama? will feature eight guest artists: Cash Cobain, Janet Jackson, Kehlani, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion, Selena Gomez, Summer Walker and Tyla. So far, Cardi's released two singles from the collection, the Hot 100 top 10 “Outside” and the Jay Z-sampling “Imaginary Playerz.

Illenium will become the second electronic artist to have a residency at Sphere in Las Vegas when he launches a six-show run called Odyssey in March 2026.


	In tandem with this news, the future bass producer born Nick Miller is announcing a new album, also called Odyssey. The project will mark his first new album since his 2023 self-titled LP and his first since signing to Republic Records in May.

	











	A release date for the album has not yet been announced, though dates for the Sphere run were revealed: March 5, 6, 7, 12, 13 and 14. Presale tickets for Odyssey at Sphere go on sale next week, on Sept. 23, with the general on sale starting Sept. 26.




			Trending on Billboard		







	A press release about the project notes that Sphere “will be the only place fans will be able to experience Illenium's forthcoming sixth studio album live.” The artist posted a teaser video of the project earlier this week on his social media. 


	“Odyssey is a journey of self discovery and acceptance,” Illenium says in a statement. “It's a moment where fans feel understood, a space where we're all together and present for that same emotional escape. I'm looking forward to welcoming everyone to this experience, especially at Sphere.”


	The news also comes alongside a new Illenium track called “Forever,” which will show up in the Odyssey show along with Illenium's recently released single “In My Arms,” a collaboration with Hayla. Listen to the new track below. 

	











	Illenium's residency further carves out a space for dance music at Sphere. In late 2024 and early 2025, Anyma became the first electronic act to headline the venue, with his residency featuring an A list of support acts including Peggy Gou, John Summit, Solomun, Mike Dean and Layla Benitez.


	Unity, a collaborative show from dance festival brands Tomorrowland and Insomniac Events, also recently opened its Sphere run, with each night featuring a different artist that over the run have included Kaskade, Chase & Status and Alan Walker. The Unity run continues later this month and into October with Meduza and James Hype, Slander, Sara Landry and Subtronics.

Foo Fighters ' smattering of confirmed live dates should be just the beginning of another massive tour.

Dave Grohl and Co. dropped the cryptic clue in a goofy “Keeping It Real” video, which sees the bandmates delivering their lines with all the gusto of cartoon robots, and generative AI hogging the visuals.

	“It's been a while but I'm happy to announce that Foo Fighters are coming back to bring you that 100% real, raw, human element of rock ‘n' roll,” Grohl says at the top of a 70 second video, much of which plays like an gag.


	A separate message from the band leaves little doubt about their plans to mount another monster trek. “Thank You!!!,” it reads. “Where Will We See You Next???”


	The rockers released their 11th and latest studio album, But Here We Are, in 2023, marking their first new music following the death of longtime drummer Taylor Hawkins.


	The band celebrated its 30th anniversary in July with the release of a new track titled “Today's Song,” and made a surprise performance on Saturday (Sept. 13) for an all-ages show at the Fremont Theater in San Luis Obispo, CA. They repeated the feat Monday (Sept. 15) at The Observatory in Santa Ana, CA.

	











	Those shows served as a coming out party for the Foos new drummer Ilan Rubin, who appears in the new social video with, count them, 10 arms. “Wait ‘till you meet our new drummer,” quips Grohl.


But Here We Are (via Roswell Records/RCA Records) was the Foos' “brutally honest and emotionally raw” album, debuting at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 chart, for their 10th top 10 title, a tally that includes two leaders (2017's Concrete And Gold, and 2011's Wasting Light).

Sr. Charts & Data Analyst (Latin & Billboard Español)


Ozuna adds his 33rd chart-topper on Billboard's Latin Rhythm Airplay chart as “Sirenita” lifts 4-1 on the Sept. 20-dated chart.


	“Sirenita” was released June 5 on Nibiru/Sony Music Latin and takes the lead on its ninth week, with six of those in the top 10. For the tracking week of Sept. 5-11, the steady gainer enjoyed a 10% growth in audience impressions in the United States, registering 7.2 million, according to Luminate.


	With his newest Latin Rhythm Airplay No. 1, Ozuna continues to hold the third-highest number of chart-toppers since the list launched in 2005, surpassed only by J Balvin with 38 and Daddy Yankee with 35. Here's a recap of those winners:

	The radio increase across Latin rhythm stations in the U.S. aligns with the song's 6-3 lift on the overall Latin Airplay chart, adding to Ozuna's robust catalog of 37 career songs which reached No. 3 or higher — 35 of those have hit No. 1. So far, “Sirenita” and “Te Boté” (his collab with Casper Mágico, Nio García, Darell, Nicky Jam, and Bad Bunny) are Ozuna's only two songs, of his 37 top three-charted songs, that have not reached No. 1. “Te Boté” peaked at No. 2 in 2018.


	Elsewhere, “Sirenita” becomes the Hot Shot Debut of the week on the Hot Latin Songs chart, arriving at No. 42. In addition to its 7 million impressions during the tracking period, the song generated a 7% gain streaming activity.


	“Sirenita” also makes its entrance on the Hot Latin Rhythm Songs chart, at No. 22, Ozuna's third entry since its launch in April. The list combines streaming data, digital sales and radio audience into its formula.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Following the success of Weapons, writer-director Zach Cregger is getting the wheels in motion for his next horror thriller. Sources tell Deadline that Paul Walter Hauser is set to join Austin Abrams in Cregger's new adaptation of Resident Evil for Sony Pictures.


	Cregger is directing the film, which is based on Capcom's  popular horror video games. He also co-wrote the script with Shay Hatten.


	Constantin Film is producing and co-financing the pic. Constantin's Robert Kulzer will produce as will Vertigo Entertainment's Roy Lee and Miri Yoon and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan. Constantin and Davis Films' Victor Hadida are executive producing. TriStar Pictures president Nicole Brown is overseeing for Sony.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Plot details on this pic are under wraps, but the previous Resident Evil movies were a mix of horror, sci-fi and action and followed the adventures of a heroine who fights zombies and the Umbrella Corporation, the bio-warfare company that let loose the monsters.


	Sony Pictures is releasing the film theatrically on September 18, 2026. Sony distributed all the previous Resident Evil films, which have grossed more than $1.2 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing video game-based movie franchises.


	Hauser is best known for starring in Apple TV+'s crime-drama limited series Black Bird, for which he received Emmy, Golden Globe and Critics Choice awards in addition to a SAG Award nomination. He has had himself a busy 2025, starring in three films this past summer alone: in The Fantastic Four: First Steps as audience favorite Mole Man; in Paramount's Naked Gun as Ed Hocken Jr., the straight-man partner to Liam Neeson's Frank Drebin Jr.; and giving a nuanced and emotional performance playing a military veteran in Lionsgate's modern-day Western Americana. 

	











	Earlier this year, Hauser starred in IFC Films' The Luckiest Man in America, which premiered at TIFF in 2024 to rave reviews for the actor's performance. Up next, he is in 20th Century's Bruce Springsteen biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere, opposite Jeremy Allen White. Hauser recently wrapped production on Amazon MGM Studios' action comedy Balls Up as well as Brian Swibel's comedic thriller The Very Best People, and is in development on New Line Cinema's Chris Farley biopic Farley.


	Hauser is represented by WME, Artists First and Schreck Rose.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


MGM+ and the BBC have picked up an adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities starring Kit Harington (Industry, Game of Thrones), François Civil (Beating Hearts, The Three Musketeers) and Mirren Mack (Miss Austen, Hedda).


	Daniel West (Top Boy) is creator and Hong Khaou is set to direct the four-part Charles Dickens adaptation, which has been acquired by MGM+ and the BBC and comes from Federation Stories alongside Thriker Films. It will air next year.


	The iconic Dickens novel is set in London, 1782. Tensions run high in the war between France and Britain as a young woman, Lucie Manette (Mack) has her life upended when she receives a message from Paris – her father, assumed dead for almost 20 years, may be alive. The messenger – idealistic French emigré, Charles Darnay (Civil) – is arrested and charged with treason. Lucie enlists the help of a brilliant but erratic young lawyer, Sydney Carton (Harington), to free Darnay in the hope he will lead her to Paris to track down her father.

	Harington and West said: “We could not be more thrilled to be working with [Federation's] Polly, Sarah, Leo and the team at Federation to bring Dickens' revolutionary epic to the screen. A Tale of Two Cities is the original historical blockbuster – a heartbreaking romance and a brutal revenge mystery, all set against the iconic backdrop of the French Revolution. Our adaptation will be a twisting period thriller; one with a contemporary, volatile love triangle at its heart.”

	











	Michael Wright, Head of MGM+, added: “We're truly thrilled at the opportunity to bring A Tale of Two Cities to our viewers. With its exceptional cast led by Kit Harington, François Civil, and Mirren Mack, combined with Hong Khaou's visionary direction, this collaboration with Federation Stories, Thriker Films, and Federation Studio France perfectly aligns with our commitment to deliver entertaining, cinematic, classic Hollywood storytelling for a contemporary audience.”


Tale of Two Cities studio Federation is currently seeking investment and has been making a trade recently of adapting older novels including Around the World in 80 Days and Gulliver's Travels. Speaking to Deadline earlier this year, Federation bosses said they have eight to 10 such international co-pros in the works.The executive producers of Tale of Two Cities are Polly Williams and Sarah Best for Federation Stories, Léo Becker for Federation Studio France, and Harington and West for Thriker Films. Producer is Simon Meyers (I May Destroy You). The show is created and written by West.

	Here's the first trailer for Jack Black and Paul Rudd's Anaconda. 


	The film follows Doug (Black) and Griff (Rudd), who have been best friends since they were kids, and have always dreamed of remaking their all-time favorite movie: the cinematic “classic” Anaconda. When a midlife crisis pushes them to finally go for it, they head deep into the Amazon to start filming. But things get real when an actual giant anaconda appears, turning their comically chaotic movie set into a deadly situation. The movie they're dying to make? It might just get them killed.


	“We're gonna shoot it indie style, one and done,” Rudd says of the remake in the trailer.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The film also stars Steve Zahn, Thandiwe Newton, Daniela Melchior, and Selton Mello. Producers are Brad Fuller, Andrew Form, Kevin Etten, and Tom Gormican. Tom Gormican directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Kevin Etten. Sony will release the film on Christmas Day. 


	The original 1997 Anaconda starred Jennifer Lopez, Jon Voight, Owen Wilson, and Ice Cube and followed a National Geographic-esque film crew that is taken hostage by an insane hunter, who forces them along on his quest to capture the world's largest and deadliest snake, an anaconda. The movie grossed $65.9M domestic off a $16.6M opening and went on to make $136.9M worldwide. The movie was an early box office win for Lopez and Cube.

The movie looks hilarious.  Expect a surprise hit at Christmas.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	There will be no Cartman, Kenny or the South Park gang tonight, nor more on Donald Trump and Satan's love child.


	“Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don't get it done,” the Comedy Central satire's creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker announced this morning, less than 12 hours before the latest episode was scheduled to air. “This one's on us. We didn't get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and South Park fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!”


	In a widely timely and scathing 10-episode Season 27 that has seen South Park episodes dropping every two weeks, the next new episode now will air on September 24 at 10pm ET/PT on Comedy Central and then appear on Paramount+ the next day. After that, the updated schedule is October 15, October 29, November 12, November 26 and December 10, according to Comedy Central.

	











South Park saw its “Got a Nut” episode, which aired on August 6, pulled from Comedy Central last week for its mockery of Charlie Kirk after the fatal shooting of the MAGA activist on September 10. What was supposed to be the fifth episode of the current season tonight found South Park in potentially fraught cultural waters with backlash from both sides of the spectrum amid fears of growing political violence.

	Whether that means Kirk, the White House and Pam Bondi's threatened crackdown on left-leaning NGOs and others on the other side of the aisle or the gender of Trump and Satan's baby on South Park is the heart of the latest episode is not known. Yet, having been on point and literally ripping storylines from presidential tweets the past two months, it would be very unlikely the show would shy away from what is going on.

	It should also be added that today's delay is not the first time Stone and Parker have hit the pause button. In fact, it's not even the first time this year. 


	Among a couple of similar such postponements over the past decade or so, the Season 27 opener was pushed back from July 9 to July 23 as the duo  negotiated a new $1.5 billon deal with the then soon-to-be Skydance owned Paramount. In the end, when the ‘S'ermon on the Mount' episode aired, its Jesus, Trump, lawsuits and settlements themed plots felt like it was happening in real time — on its own time.

Damn, these guys sure got lazy after that big payday. Lazy Trump jokes that they mocked before, lazy release schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if they're busy programming an AI to animate the show for them.

If you follow the right people on social media, you know that Trey and Matt feel like shit over what happened to Charlie Kirk. 

It's a complex and difficult writing situation to have those feelings with that storyline.

They should feel like shit!

Any reaction, other than dancing and cheering, is preferable. South Park is good at comedy. Comedy is not violent and even Kirk knew that. They are not responsible. It's those cheering and dancing that are responsible.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Alien: Earth turns the Xenomorph into Wendy's plaything in a shaky penultimate hour","https://www.avclub.com/alien-earth-recap-season-1-episode-7-emergence","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 02:03:00 GMT","

Over the last month, Alien: Earth has made the philosophy of sentience and transhumanism its bread and butter. Breaking Alien down into questions of humanity and what separates us from the things we build and animals we hunt (and hunt us), Noah Hawley has made a biting satire that finds the rich vein of grim humor that runs throughout the franchise's anatomy. Extrapolating from our present, when technocratic corporate nation states are more inevitable than far-fetched and computer users have fallen in love with their chatbots because they were nice to them, Hawley has tied a knotty but engaging thought experiment for the show to untangle. As noted in my first recap, though, Hawley cautioned his crew, “If we're making Blade Runner, we're making the wrong Ridley Scott movie.” At the penultimate episode of this first season, it still seems like he's making the wrong Ridley Scott movie—albeit a beautifully crafted and thoughtful one. 

But there's another, cornier side to Alien: Earth, and it's directly tied to the show's namesake. Counteracting its deeply pessimistic gallows humor, the series makes the risky decision to turn the Xenomorph into Wendy's Krypto. “Emergence,” written by Hawley and Maria Melnik and directed by Dana Gonzales, has pulled the trigger on the Wendy-Xenomorph team-up, a development that will surely divide the audience. Typically, you want the alien to threaten your protagonist, but by the end of this hour,  we're primed for an alien rescue. Is that really what we brought Alien to Earth for? 

The rest of the episode is much more compelling than Wendy's escape. Its fractured plot allows each character to begin wrapping up their respective arcs, with Kirsh at the center, quietly facilitating from his iPad. “Emergence” opens from a place of genuine tension, with Slightly figuratively lying in the bed he's made—and under that bed, there's a facehugged Arthur. There are few things more grimly funny in the Alien universe than hiding a facehugger victim under the bed, but one of them is trying to feed them juice. Slightly sucks at both, spilling the juice and leaving Arthur exposed for Smee to see. Populating the show with adults playing kids was always a risk, but Adarsh Gourav and Jonathan Ajayi are consistently excellent here. These are complex performances that require them to mask their overwhelming fear to reach deliberate aims while never losing sight of the fact that these machines have the consciousness of children. 

Smee agrees to help Slightly carry Arthur across the Neverland jungles. As they make their way to the beach, they drop Arthur to avoid an oncoming battalion of Stormtroopers. Alien: Earth is often better at nailing these comedic moments than its scares—a this scene is no different. After the troops pass, Arthur disappears, and a dead facehugger falls out of the tree. Before the boys can figure out what happened, Arthur casually steps back into frame, points at the facehugger, and asks, “What's that?”  Coupled with Slightly and Smee's obvious guilt and fear for the situation, Arthur's sincere concern for them makes everything involving the doomed Dr. Sylvia all the more heartbreaking. His desire to patch things up with Dame, so her last memory of him isn't a fight, and his earnest empathy for the hybrids makes waiting for the inevitable chest-bursting rough stuff. It's not uncommon to watch an Alien movie and think, “This poor bastard.” Arthur is in the running for the poorest bastard. After the alien emerges, Slightly goes on dragging his hollowed corpse toward a watery grave. At least he stuck it to the man before checking out. 

Back at the lab, Tootles' death has sent Prodigy into lockdown—only someone turned off the hybrid trackers. Boy Kavalier should take a greater interest in his Lost Boys, but he's too busy making jokes about sending them off to bed without any supper. Lest we forget, this guy's a Peter Pan podcaster, and even in the future, no subject is too soon for a podcaster to crack jokes about. At any rate, he's far more interested in what the Eye did to destroy his hybrid. After seeing the clip of the sheep distracting Tootles, Kavalier becomes convinced that the Eye is an intelligent being and does what any normal trillionaire would do upon meeting a space alien: He gives it the Pi test. The mud-pie answer is, perhaps, the happiest moment of Kavalier's pathetic life. He's thrilled to connect with an intelligent being, so he asks Atom to bring a mold cleaner for the Eye to kill and infiltrate, allowing Kavalier and the Eye to speak the same language. 

And then there's Wendy, Kavalier's star pupil, whom he's pretty much lost all interest in. She always appears at the wrong time, but showing up at the lab to catch a glimpse of Tootles' insides sends her over the edge. Grabbing Hermit and Nibs, she frees her Xenomorph buddy and flees into the jungle, where she comes across a graveyard. “Emergence” is really a eulogy for Marcy Hermit. Moments after seeing Tootles' machine innards, she comes across Marcy's grave and waves bye-bye to whatever remains of her humanity, cutting out the worst parts of a human, as Morrow might say. By the time troops flank her, she's clicking for the Xenomorph to take care of them. 

“Emergence” ends on an interesting note. After weeks of playing voyeur, Kirsh's plan comes into focus. He allowed Slightly and Smee to lead Morrow right to him. But there are shifting motives everywhere. On the boat, Hermit's marine buddies ambush the hybrids. After Nibs rips a guy's chin off for throwing Mr. Strawberry in the ocean, Hermit puts her down, leaving Wendy to yell, “What did you do?” Maybe Hermit is having second thoughts about the whole sister thing. And with one episode left and a Xenomorph in her control, maybe now isn't the time to turn on her.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sterlin Harjo and Ethan Hawke kill it in FX's comedy noir The Lowdown","https://www.avclub.com/the-lowdown-review-tv-fx","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The best television is the kind that feels so textured and lived-in that you can basically smell it. And The Lowdown stinks to high heaven. Like his acclaimed Reservation Dogs, Sterlin Harjo's new comedy noir for FX is a lovingly realized tale of a small community writ large. It's also a personal story for its creator: While Rez Dogs was inspired by Harjo's upbringing in rural Oklahoma, The Lowdown is a tribute to his adopted hometown of Tulsa. The series is stylish and genre-savvy, and its spurs are firmly planted in the Osage County dirt.

Ethan Hawke stars as Lee Raybon, a down-and-out freelance journalist/bookshop owner who dubs himself a “truth-storian.” From his duct-taped cowboy boots to his bird's-nest hair, the guy is a hot mess. As the self-appointed savior of Tulsa's dispossessed, he's determined to expose the corruption and racism of the city's elite, no matter the cost to his personal wellbeing. (“Fuckin' white men that care,” one Black character says of Lee. “Saddest of the bunch.”)

When Dale Washberg (Tim Blake Nelson), a scion of Tulsa's most powerful family, dies by apparent suicide, Lee smells a rat. He's sure that Dale's well-heeled older brother Donald (Kyle MacLachlan), who's campaigning for governor, has ties to the city's white supremacist underground via the sinister, well-groomed Allen Murphy (Scott Shepherd). And then there's Dale's widow, Betty Jo (Jeanne Tripplehorn), who knows more than she's letting on; and Marty (Keith David), a world-weary PI Donald hires to tail Lee. The deeper he gets, the more Lee endangers not only himself but the people he cares about: his teen daughter Francis (Ryan Kiera Armstrong); his ex-wife Sam (Kaniehtiio Horn); his editor Cyrus (Michael “Killer Mike” Render); his buddy Ray (Michael Hitchcock); and Deidra (Siena East), who keeps Hoot Owl Books running when Lee's busy getting the crap kicked out of him by skinheads. 

Though the plot of The Lowdown is fictional, Harjo based his scrappy hero on real-life Tulsa legend Lee Roy Chapman, a citizen journalist who ran an antiquarian bookstore. Up until his death in 2015, he dedicated his life to exposing the racist underbelly of Oklahoma history. Harjo knew Chapman personally, and the two collaborated on a documentary series about the city's checkered past in the 2010s.

Harjo tapped Hawke (who guest starred in the final season of Rez Dogs) to play Lee from the jump, and it's easy to see why: The actor seems to be possessed by the spirit of this stubborn, sensitive oddball, manic determination oozing from his pores as he trips over his own boots in pursuit of the truth. Lee is overbearing and unhinged, but Hawke plays him with an open, earnest charm that helps explain why the people in his life keep letting him off the hook. 



The show also boasts a killer ensemble, which includes born-and-bred Tulsans (Nelson, Tripplehorn, Tracy Letts), Dogs alums (Horn, Jude Barnett, Macon Blair), familiar faces (MacLachlan, Hitchcock, Peter Dinklage), and even the next vampire slayer (Armstrong). Each actor adds a unique flavor to the stew: As Dale, Nelson both figuratively and literally haunts the narrative, appearing at Lee's side whenever he comes across a bit of writing Dale left behind. His performance is the perfect balance of quirky and tragic. And it's a treat to see MacLachlan play against type as a charismatic capitalist with sinister intentions. 

Tripplehorn is fantastic as Betty Jo, a web of contradictions who smokes like a chimney. She and Hawke make for an electric duo when Lee tries to sound Betty Jo out, only for her to surprise him. Meanwhile, David's Marty is a great foil for Lee, with the two shrewd investigators with entirely different MOs sharing a grudging respect. Armstrong holds her own among all these vets, too. As written, Francis risks coming off as your archetypal plucky teen, but the 15-year-old actor has a subtler take that can keep viewers guessing. She and Horn's Sam bring out a side of Lee that tells us more about the guy than expository flashbacks. And while Hitchcock, Render, and East's brands of comedy are quiete different, they're all at home in Harjo's world, where weirdos of all stripes are welcome.

Though The Lowdown wears its influences on its sleeve—think Shane Black's The Nice Guys, Paul Thomas Anderson's Inherent Vice, and pretty much any Coen brothers movie—it never comes off as derivative. That's because it's steeped in specificity, from the production design (you may want to pause scenes in the bookstore to read the spines of vintage paperbacks) to the world-building. Every character on the show feels realized, even if we only see them in glimpses. In fact, it'd be easy to watch an entire spin-off about the bumbling ex-cons who keep watch outside Hoot Owl (played by Cody Lightning and Jude Barnett) or Flavia Carbone's mysterious bruja who sets up shop on a poacher's houseboat.

With Rez Dogs, Harjo established himself as a new voice on TV, painting a portrait of a community that's seldom represented onscreen. He brings that same downbeat humor and fascination with society's underdogs to The Lowdown while also proving himself incredibly adept at modern noir. Like Lee, he approaches his subject with a love of humanity that shines through every frame like Oklahoma sunlight.   

The Lowdown premieres September 23 on FX

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Paul Thomas Anderson leads Leonardo DiCaprio to one of his best performances in One Battle After Another","https://www.avclub.com/one-battle-after-another","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:12:39 GMT","

For most of the last twenty-five years, Paul Thomas Anderson has been stuck in the past. Well, maybe not stuck; there's no quagmire in making some of the best movies of our still-young (if rapidly approaching a quarter-life crisis) century, which don't need to be explicitly contemporary to feel connected to the current moment. But it's striking to consider that until One Battle After Another, only one of those movies was actually set in this century, and it was released at a time now distant enough to have been depicted in a period piece. Indeed, the opening scenes of One Battle After Another, set roughly 16 years before the majority of the film, are still later on the timeline than anything else Anderson has made so far, unfolding sometime around or just after the 2008 presidential election.

Not that the election is mentioned. Anderson's first non-period movie since Punch-Drunk Love doesn't precisely take place in an instantly recognizable political present, or past. It's more of a disoriented dream world, and not in the reverie-like way that he chronicled 1973 in his previous film, the instant classic Licorice Pizza. There are moments from the dystopia-adjacent Battle that feel like they could be happening in '73, or at least a movie version thereof, but it's not exactly Quentin Tarantino-level alternate history, either.

One Battle After Another takes its inspiration from the 1990 Thomas Pynchon novel Vineland, apparently with vastly less fidelity than Anderson's previous Pynchon adaptation Inherent Vice—starting with the fact that Vineland was set in 1984, concerning ex-hippie types hunted by a federal agent. The film's rechristened lead Bob Ferguson (Leonardo DiCaprio) also has a radical past, depicted in detail in the film's opening section, as the explosives man for a revolutionary group called the French 75. While he believes in the cause, his devotion fails to match that of the fierier Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor)—though his devotion to Perfidia herself is considerable. Around the time their child is born, the group is being systematically hunted down by the tireless Colonel Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn).

This and other circumstances separate Bob, Perfidia, and the other French 75 members. 16 years later, Bob is raising the couple's teenage daughter Willa (Chase Infiniti) in the small town of Baktan Cross and the relative seclusion it provides. Provides for Bob, anyway. Willa goes to public school and has a small, loyal friend group privy to the details of her secret, contraband cell phone; she lives her life with her dad hovering over her shoulder from their isolated cabin, paranoid about her safety (and skeptical about her whole generation). When Lockjaw re-emerges, on a mission to prove himself worthy to join a secret society of white supremacists, Bob is forced out of the house and back into fumbling, drug-addled action to save his daughter. Anderson has cited the Mission: Impossible movies as an unlikely inspiration, specifically for Bob's mighty struggle to remember the old “codespeak” that will hook him back into the still-extant revolutionary network. Imagine, in other words, if Ethan Hunt were actually 60, instead of aging on Cruise Time. One Battle After Another also resembles Taken, if the middle-aged guy's particular set of skills mainly involved running to a karate instructor and begging him for assistance. (Understandable, though, when said instructor is played by Benicio del Toro.)

Yet it would be misleading to describe One Battle After Another as an action picture, at least in contemporary terms. That's where 1973 or thereabouts rears its head. The movie plays like a much-vaunted action classic from the 1970s that young film buffs catch up with decades later and realize actually has about 10 minutes' worth of impressive analog car and foot chases in between a lot of dialogue scenes, plot points, and colorful side characters. There's even a specific series of shots, with the camera whooshing through hilly roads like a sprawling rollercoaster, that would probably constitute the most famous moment from this movie if it were half a century old. This is not a knock against One Battle After Another, which also sneaks in elements of a revisionist Western. If anything, the movie represents a smart redirecting of Anderson's gift for momentum.

That's a quality more closely associated with the movies Anderson made in his and/or his characters' youth, one intentionally put aside for his previous Pynchon adaptation and Phantom Thread, then reclaimed for a giddy series of hangout adventures in Licorice Pizza. So it's an inspired bit of semi-meta-casting to send 50-year-old ex-idol DiCaprio (playing a little younger here, but not by a lot) hurtling through a forbidding landscape of barren storefronts, winding roads, and wide-open spaces, cranky as hell about passcodes and younger people and a life spent mentally if not physically on the run. The sweaty try-hard actorliness that sometimes dogged DiCaprio in his youth has more recently been converted into the poignant comedy of aging guys who bluster strenuously about being in over their heads. DiCaprio revives his Wolf Of Wall Street slapstick talents as he scrambles through the frame, taking some cartoonishly dangerous falls while rocking a pair of stolen shades and a skull cap. Stepping into a funhouse-mirror reflection of The Searchers results in one of his best performances.

Anderson strikes a near-impossible balance throughout One Battle After Another: Somehow, he manages to kid Bob's burnt-out ex-hippie mentality (with attendant undertones of conspiracy-crank conservatism), examine the foibles of Perfidia's principled yet far-from-spotless radical, satirize the deranged white nationalism that has been on a re-emboldened march for the entire span this movie covers, and work up some genuinely righteous thrills watching the French 75 bust a bunch of detained immigrants out of queasily familiar-looking facilities. (That this is depicted happening in the late 2000s, not 2025, is best interpreted as a reminder of this country's pervasively racist legacy rather than any temporal fudging.) The thread that emerges most clearly for those crisscrossing lines—though viewers' mileage will surely vary on this—concerns a pair of contradictory impulses: to remake the world for our hypothetical children, and to retreat in order to better protect our actual children when that world stubbornly refuses to improve. Though he never puts it in such gendered terms, Bob's “as the father of a daughter” neuroses reach a fever pitch that's both funny and, eventually, quite moving.

DiCaprio is so terrific, and Infiniti such a charismatic find, that viewers may find themselves wishing the cast, both principal and supporting (which also includes Regina Hall and Alana Haim), had room in this 162-minute movie to bounce off of each other with a little more frequency. (Penn and DiCaprio are among the flashy actor combinations that don't really ever share the screen.) At times, the movie feels surprisingly spare considering its scope of time, locations, and characters. But this may also be part of Anderson's design, contributing to the Western vibes of the occasional shoot-outs or sieges while the title alludes to the lack of climactic-showdown finality (even while staging a hell of a climactic showdown). One Battle After Another hurtles into the present without compromising Anderson's sense of fractured, constantly rearranged, weirdly personal American history.

Candace Cameron Bure‘s daughter, Natasha, married a former Disney star over the weekend in a beautiful garden wedding. The “Dancing With the Stars” alum shared photos from the stunning ceremony and fans are celebrating the young newlyweds.

A post shared by Natasha Perry (@natashaperry)

Candace's daughter Natasha and “Good Luck Charlie” star Bradley Steven Perry privately got engaged in April. The couple got married in a “romantic garden celebration” at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, California on September 14, 2025, People reports.

“It's almost impossible to put into words what our wedding truly feels like. It's surreal and overwhelming in all the best ways. There is nothing better than marrying your best friend,” the couple told the outlet. “This day is also so much more than just a celebration of our love, it's a reminder of how blessed we are to be surrounded by the most incredible family and friends — people who have cheered us on, shaped us, and stood by us.”

Natasha reportedly had “a specific vision for the day,” so they didn't hire a wedding planner.

“We wanted the smallest of details to represent our love throughout the day and to make sure everything felt perfectly ‘us,'” Natasha said. “Every DIY craft and design project you could think of, we tried our very best to take on.”

She said that she “took on the whole process,” covering all of the details. “By the time our wedding rolled around, I had completely overtaken Bradley's place and turned it into a full-on arts and crafts workshop,” Natasha said.

A post shared by Candace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure)

On September 16, Candace took to Instagram to share the happy news.

“We introduce to you Mr. And Mrs. Perry 🥂!! A huge congratulations to the sweetest @bradleysperry and our beautiful daughter @natashabure on the celebration of their marriage 💍!” she wrote in the caption.

Candace added, “We couldn't have asked for a kinder man than Bradley to love and care for our girl 🥹. Natasha, you are radiant inside and out and are already the best wife to your beloved. My heart swells with happiness for you two. We love you both so much. May God bless all the days of your lives together ❤️❤️❤️.”

Fans flooded the comments section with messages of congratulations. “Absolutely beautiful, in every way!” one fan wrote. “Congratulations to all! 🎉🥂❤️.”

Another person noted, “Stunning. All of it!!🥂🤍.”

“Wow!! You kept that a secret!! Congrats!! What a blessing!!” another fan commented.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How Robert Redford Wanted to Be Remembered","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/robert-redford-talked-legacy-being-remembered/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:02:21 GMT","

Robert Redford wasn't the type to get caught up in his own myth. Sure, he was the golden boy of Hollywood for decades in films like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Sting,” “All the President's Men,” and even “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” But legacy, for him, was never about red carpets or shiny trophies. 

He cared about the work, the climb, and what you leave behind for others. And honestly, when he spoke about how he wanted to be remembered, his answers said everything about the man behind the legend. Now, following his passing on September 16, 2025, at age 89, Redford's thoughts about his own legacy carry even more weight.

According to ABC News, when asked point-blank by Esquire UK how he wanted to be remembered, Redford didn't hesitate:

“For the work. What really matters is the work. And what matters to me is doing the work. I'm not looking at the back end: ‘What am I going to get out of this? What's going to be the reward?' I'm just looking at the work, the pleasure of being able to do the work. And that's what the fun is: To climb up the mountain is the fun, not standing at the top.”

That's classic Redford. No bragging, no obsession with the spotlight. Just an artist who found joy in the process and saw the struggle itself as the reward.

If Redford's career proved anything, it's that he never hoarded success. He built Sundance as a nonprofit, knowing he wouldn't profit personally, but he wanted to carve out space for new filmmakers. In his own words: “I've devoted so much of my life to it,” he once said, per People.

When he accepted his Honorary Oscar in 2002, he doubled down on that idea: while his own work mattered, it was just as important to “put something back into an industry that's been good to me. And, of course, Sundance is a manifestation of that.”

Let's be real: it is obvious he wanted his name tied not just to the movies he made, but to the opportunities he gave. To the storytellers who got a shot because Sundance existed.

Redford once admitted he rarely looked back. But at that same 2002 Oscar ceremony, he paused long enough to acknowledge something he usually avoided:

“I've spent most of my life just focused on the road ahead, not looking back. But now tonight, I'm seeing in the rearview mirror that there is something I've not thought about much, called history and what moves me tonight is that I'm being joined by colleagues and peers to reflect on that history.” he explained. 

It was a rare glimpse of him recognizing that, yes, he had created a history worth noting. Still, he didn't define himself by statues or headlines. He defined himself by work, by giving back, by making sure future generations had their shot at the climb.

Robert Redford didn't chase being remembered… he earned it, quietly, through integrity and generosity. For him, the real legacy wasn't in standing at the top, but in helping others up the mountain.

Legendary actor, director, and activist Robert Redford has died at the age of 89, as reported by The New York Times on 16th September 2025. The Hollywood icon, celebrated for classics like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Sting,” and “All the President's Men,” also found a new generation of fans through his role in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.”

Redford's family story began in 1958 when he married historian Lola Van Wagenen. Together, they had four children: Scott, Shauna, James, and Amy. 

Their first child, Scott, was born in 1959 but tragically died of sudden infant death syndrome at just 2 months old. The loss left a lasting mark on Redford, shaping how he approached life and fatherhood.

Shauna, their eldest daughter, was born in 1960 and grew up largely outside Hollywood's spotlight. Two years later, James “Jamie” Redford was born in 1962, following in his father's creative footsteps as a filmmaker and philanthropist. 

In 1970, their youngest child, Amy, arrived, later becoming an actress and director.

Jamie inherited his father's creative spirit, focusing on documentaries like “The Kindness of Strangers” and “Happening: A Clean Energy Revolution.” 

He also became an advocate for organ donation after surviving two liver transplants. Tragically, Jamie died in 2020 at age 58 from bile-duct cancer, reopening the grief of Scott's death decades earlier.

Redford, who divorced Van Wagenen in 1985, leaned on his daughters and second wife, artist Sibylle Szaggars, for strength after Jamie's passing. Sibylle, whom he married in 2009, brought renewed love and creativity into his later years.

While Redford's Hollywood career soared with classics like “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “The Way We Were,” and “All the President's Men,” he credited fatherhood with grounding him. His children and grandchildren now carry on his artistic legacy.

Shauna, 63, became an artist and raised two children, Mica and Conor. Jamie, before his passing, raised two kids with his wife, Kyle: Dylan and Lena. Amy, 53, built a career in film and is raising three children, including twins.

Redford's grandchildren are following creative paths of their own, from filmmaking to the arts. Dylan has pursued studio art and appeared in the documentary “The Big Picture,” while Lena has worked in film and voice acting.

Even as he turned 89, Redford described family as the anchor of his life. Despite enduring the heartbreak of losing two sons, he has continued to cherish his role as a father, grandfather, and husband. His bond with his children and grandchildren ensures his passion for storytelling, art, and activism lives on through them.

As Redford once said, Sundance and the legacy he built are now in the hands of his children and their children. His story is proof that behind the Hollywood icon is a family man who found his greatest meaning in love, resilience, and the ties that endure through generations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jamie Lee Curtis Fights Through Tears Over Charlie Kirk Tragedy","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jamie-lee-curtis-reacts-to-charlie-kirk-shooting/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 01:41:59 GMT","

Jamie Lee Curtis grew emotional during a taping of Marc Maron's “WTF” podcast, tearing up as she discussed the impact of a recent shooting that had shaken her. The interview took place only days after the incident.

Curtis sobbed as she reflected on the death of Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old activist and Turning Point USA co-founder who was fatally shot on September 10 at a Utah college. Curtis and Maron recorded the episode only days after the assassination.

“I'm going to bring something up with you just because it's front of mind,” Curtis said, before mistakenly referring to Kirk as “Charlie Crist,” which she explained was a slip of the tongue linked to Kirk's “deep, deep belief” in religion.

Curtis admitted she disagreed with many of the victim's views in life, but spoke compassionately about his humanity. 

“I disagreed with him on almost every point I ever heard him say, but I believe he was a man of faith, and I hope in that moment when he died, that he felt connected with his faith,” she said through tears. “I still believe he's a father and a husband and a man of faith.”

The actress also addressed her concern about videos of the shooting being circulated online. “I know there is a video of his assassination. I know people who've seen it,” Curtis said. “We as a society are bombarded with imagery. We don't know what the longitudinal effects of seeing those towers come down over and over again, or watching his execution over and over again. I don't ever want to see this footage of this man being shot.”

A post shared by Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel)

Other Hollywood figures echoed her call for empathy and compassion in the wake of the tragedy. Jimmy Kimmel urged his followers to set aside anger and remember the human cost of violence. “Instead of the angry finger-pointing, can we just for one day agree that it is horrible and monstrous to shoot another human?” he wrote on Instagram. “On behalf of my family, we send love to all the children, parents and innocents who fall victim to senseless gun violence.”

Erika Kirk, widow of the late Charlie Kirk, paid a moving tribute to her husband following his assassination at Utah Valley University.

Sharing a carousel of photos on Instagram, she expressed her grief and reflected on the deep bond they shared. “The sound of this widow weeping echoes throughout this world like a battle cry,” Erika wrote. “I have no idea what any of this means. But baby I know you do and so does our Lord.”

A post shared by E. (@mrserikakirk)

“Rest in the arms of our Lord baby as he blankets you with the words I know your heart always strived to hear, ‘well done My good and faithful servant,'” she added.

Oscar-winning actor Robert Redford has sadly passed away at the age of 89. The New York Times, reports that Redford passed away in his sleep at his home in Utah on the morning of September 16. Cindi Berger, who is the chief executive of Rogers & Cowan PMK, announced his passing in a statement, but no cause of death was given.

“Robert Redford passed away on September 16, 2025, at his home at Sundance in the mountains of Utah–the place he loved, surrounded by those he loved. He will be missed greatly,” Berger said in a statement to CNN. “The family requests privacy.”

Redford's impressive career certainly deserves to be celebrated, so let's take a look at some of his top movies, his net worth, the Sundance Festival, and more!

At the time of his death, Redford's estimated net worth sat at $200 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Along with acting, he built his empire through directing, producing, along with owning production companies.

Academy Awards (Oscars)

Golden Globe Awards

BAFTA Awards

Emmy Awards

Other Major Honors and Awards

In 1969, Redford starred in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which kicked off a legendary festival. At the same time, he purchased 5,000 acres in Utah and went on to open Sundance Mountain Resort to the public.

In 1980, the Sundance Institute was formed and in 1981, they held their first lab for 17 independent filmmakers.

The first film festival was held in 1985, initially known as the 1985 U.S. Film Festival, but later renamed the Sundance Film Festival. And since 1991, 

CODA became the first Sundance film to win an Oscar for Best Picture at the 94th Academy Awards. Institute-supported documentaries have won 20 Oscars, according to the Festival's website. And with that, Coda became the first Sundance film to win an Oscar for Best Picture in 2022.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","RHOSLC's Meredith Marks on ‘Horror Movie' Cast Trip","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhoslc-meredith-marks-creepy-rv-trip/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 14:12:10 GMT","

The first episode in Season 6 of “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” featured the kind of girls' trip that no one could have anticipated. Angie and Mary picked up the rest of the cast in an RV and drove to a park overlooking Provo Canyon. No spa treatments or luxury this time around! Instead, Meredith, Whitney, Bronwyn, and Britani joined Mary and Angie for adventures by day, and creepiness at night.

Meredith Marks spoke exclusively with The Daily Dish about the “creepy” trip that she and the ladies took.

Marks spoke to The Daily Dish about the camping trip with her castmates. She had a few key suggestions for anyone contemplating RV life. “Don't travel by RV, and if you do, at least have running water in the RV,” said the reality star.

“That was my first time sleeping in an RV. I have been in an RV before, like going to an event or something like that, but never slept in one. So, that was definitely not something I was needing to do. It was fine. I survived. So that part of it was interesting.”

The ladies had set up camp in an RV park overlooking Provo Canyon. The area itself is ripe with some scary legends. Molly Sorensen was a fundamentalist Mormon who was rumored to frequent Provo Canyon looking for Mormon girls who were there to make out with their boyfriends. The legend claims that she would kidnap and murder the sinning girls.

During the fly-fishing and kayaking activities, canyon guides confirmed that they had “heard screams all throughout the night” and claimed “some people come up missing” in the area.

The group discussed the story of Molly Sorenson while sitting around the campfire and the mood turned from cozy to creepy pretty fast. “I have no phone reception, I have no nothing. I just wanna go home,” said Meredith near the very end of the RHOSLC Season 6 premiere episode.

Marks told The Daily Dish that, “[It] felt like a horror movie,” out there in the dark.

Did you watch the brand new episode of “Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,” and if so, what are your thoughts on it?

Until his monumental new film, Paul Thomas Anderson had only made a single narrative feature set in the 21st century, and that movie — a love story about a plunger salesman who hoards pudding cups, gets extorted by the owner of a phone sex line, and shares an iconic kiss to the sound of a Shelley Duvall song from 1980 — was less of its time than out of it. After that came an origin story about the birth of American capitalism, two post-war fables about people trying to sow their own visions of the future, a patchouli-scented lament for the lost promise of '60s counterculture, and a star-crossed romance set against the 1973 oil crisis.

At a certain point, Anderson's seeming attachment to the past became conspicuous enough that it began to appear as if he might be mystified, scared, and/or bored of the modern world to some degree, and therefore arguably less relevant to it. 

Enter: “One Battle After Another,” the power and the mercy of which lies in how it simultaneously functions as both a backboard-shattering windmill dunk on that line of attack and an open-hearted surrender to its merits. 

 










Vaguely abstracted from Thomas Pynchon's 1984-set “Vineland” but eager to reflect a variety of post-Reaganite advancements in ethno-fascism (the action starts in a recognizable today before jumping 16 years forward into a pointedly unchanged tomorrow), this propulsive, hilarious, and overwhelmingly tender paranoid comedy-thriller car chase blockbuster whatever doesn't just stare a broken country in the face with its already prescient tale of immigrant detention centers, white nationalist caricatures, and bullshit pretenses for deploying the military into sanctuary cities. It's also the first movie of its size to accurately crystallize how fucking anxious it feels to be alive right now — to capture the IMAX cartoonishness of our reality and provide a convincing roadmap as to how we might survive it. 

And how does its filmmaker, once a fiery wunderkind, now a 55-year-old father of four, manage to accomplish that? Simple: He falls 40 feet off the roof of an apartment building and right onto the blade of his own sword. 

From the bifurcated porn fantasia of “Boogie Nights” and the fin de siècle biblicality of “Magnolia” to the stoned disillusionment of “Inherent Vice” and the coming-of-age impertinence of “Licorice Pizza,” Anderson has always been drawn to the Sisyphysean task of self-discovery; to the heartbreaking search for place and permanence in a world that's constantly shifting under our feet. Dirk Diggler, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, Lancaster Dodd, and mama's boy Reynolds Woodcock are but a few of the immortal characters he's created over the last three decades, all of them immovably anchored to past lives that drag them down as they push towards the future. 

 










With “One Battle After Another,” Anderson concedes that he's no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are. 

While Anderson has never been stuck in place or in sad pursuit of his former glory (on the contrary, his shapeshifting body of work is so remarkable for its limitless vitality), Hollywood has collapsed around him despite his best efforts to preserve its celluloid magic. He's persisted in spite of that fact, doing his thing on the fringes of a studio system that's crumbling faster than his entire generation of name-brand auteurs can fortify it with new films, but his formal radicality was softened by an emergent preference for the way things were — even if only as a milieu. The past can be a mighty tempting refuge for those frustrated by their failure to change the world. 

But revolution comes in many forms, and while Anderson's new daddy-daughter epic implicitly concedes to the conservatism of getting older, this ~$150 million rallying cry is the work of an artist and a father who's determined to convince himself that getting older doesn't have to be the same thing as giving up. That keeping the fight alive is the next best thing to winning it. While the wacked out spirit of “One Battle After Another” might be transplanted from a 35-year-old Pynchon novel, it's the unflinching nowness of this reinterpretation that allows it to take the long view of America's forever war against itself, and to so brilliantly articulate — in the words of Gary Valentine — how liberating it can be to “stop using time as an excuse.”

 










Confronting the unchecked evil and bottomless humiliation of the Trump administration from its opening frames (though it wouldn't make sense for Anderson's script to mention the president by name), “One Battle After Another” begins at top speed and barrels forward so fast that you can barely even tell it's moving in a perfect circle. The revolutionary group known as the French 75 are plotting to free a group of migrants who've been imprisoned at a California detention center near the Mexican border, and a newbie demolitions expert by the name of “Ghetto Pat” (Leonardo DiCaprio) is trying to prove his worth to the rest of the crew. The fireworks he rains down on the camp aren't the only sparks he'll trigger that night, as Pat's handiwork catches the attention of French 75 spirit captain Perfidia Beverly Hills (an eruptive Teyana Taylor, steaming with revolutionary zeal), who literally tries to fuck him every time we see them together. 

Perfidia is a natural survivor with a non-partisan power kink that can get the best of her if she isn't careful, which is exactly what happens when — upon infiltrating the tent of detention camp leader Col. Steven J. Lockjaw (a career-best Sean Penn as a preening and steroidal Alfred E. Neuman, his natural humorlessness a perfect vehicle for comedy) — she orders the lip-licking army man to full attention before she lets him go. That decision incites a double-edged sexual infatuation that compels Lockjaw to follow the French 75 like Pepé Le Pew chasing the pheromone trail of a female cat. 

 










Every bank they rob or anti-abortion senator's office they blow up brings the colonel one step closer to blackmailing Perfidia into submission, and when he finally makes his move, the self-interested subversive doesn't hesitate to save her own skin. Never mind that she and Pat just had a baby girl together, or that she's condemning her fellow revolutionaries — including Regina Hall's ultra-stoic Deandra, and a fantastically brash agitator played by her “Support the Girls” co-star Shayna “Junglepussy” McHayle — to almost certain death. Perfidia is convinced that she's lost the fight of her life, and her resolve as both a radical and a mother is flicked off like a light switch. 

When the story picks up a decade-and-a-half later, the bomb-maker formerly known as Ghetto Pat has been reborn as self-described “drugs and alcohol-lover” Bob Ferguson in the woodsy enclave of Baktan Cross, where he spends most of his time sitting at home in a bathrobe, blasting his brains out with bad pot, and impotently stewing over how to protect his teenage daughter Willa from a past that feels more like a paranoid delusion. No such luck: Col. Lockjaw, now aged into a cheek-sucking human turnip who walks like a machine gun has been rammed up his ass, is being considered for membership in an elite cabal of hyper-racist Santa-worshippers (did I mention this movie was inspired by the writing of Thomas Pynchon?), and he won't rest until he's eliminated anyone who knows that he once had sex with a Black woman. It isn't long until the full weight of the army descends upon Baktan Cross under the guise of a more routine abuse of power, and Bob finds himself at risk of losing his kid.

 










The girl is played by magnetically self-possessed newcomer/instant movie star Chase Infiniti, whose performance inspires a strange kind of secondhand pride, and more than rewards the years that it took Anderson to find her (score a point for nominative determinism, as no one on Earth was so obviously born to star in a Pynchon movie). DiCaprio is somewhat less of a discovery (rare as it is to see him be a dad, as opposed to a character who just happens to have kids), but the guy works infrequently enough — and at such a staggeringly high level — that every time he reappears feels like its own revelation. 

A manic and panicked stoner who scurries around this movie in an open bathrobe while slamming back fresh cans of Modelo like Gatorade, Bob may not be quite as far gone as the Pynchon character on which he's based, but the “Vaseline of youth” has crusted over his bloodshot eyes in much the same way. It's profoundly, consistently, and endearingly funny to watch him Forrest Gump his way through everything that follows Lockjaw's arrival in Baktan Cross, from a glorified ICE raid to a “Vanishing Point”-inspired car chase. DiCaprio's bloodshot performance further immortalizes the former heartthrob as modern cinema's most gifted buffoon, but here — collaborating with Anderson for the first time, who lavishes the same love and attention on his extras as he does on his stars — the actor's tetchy comic genius finds a new dimension through his character's natural deference. 

 










Bob is both at the center of the action and incidental to it all at once, like a peeling strip of wallpaper that blends perfectly into the background whenever it isn't coming unglued. That dynamic proves essential to a breathless second act that places Bob — along with several undocumented Mexican families — in the care of Baktan Cross' resident karate teacher and holy protector amidst a town-wide government standoff. A spectacular foil for DiCaprio's perma-addled Bob, Benecio Del Toro's cool-headed Sensei is also an instant addition to the pantheon of iconic PTA characters in his own right, and his zen approach to the threat posed by Lockjaw's forces gradually emerges as the movie's defiant ethos. “We've been laid siege for hundreds of years,” he says with a steady breath. “Ocean waves.” 

Here, those waves eventually crest into a river of hills, as “One Battle After Another” peaks with a car chase across the blind humps of Highway 78 in Borrego Springs. Like everything else in Anderson's film, the vehicular action is simple, spellbinding, and perfectly expressive of a story that always moves at 100mph even when its characters aren't even able to see over the next ridge. (Michael Bauman's vividly textured cinematography is a sight to behold throughout the movie, VistaVision or not, but the whole picture was lensed with large-format in mind, and one particular shot during this climactic sequence is so enveloping in true IMAX that it made me want to apologize on behalf of anyone who's ever mocked the people who supposedly fled “The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station.”) 

 










That breakneck speed proves essential to a movie that skitters between slapstick delirium and grim reality even faster than Jonny Greenwood's score, which carries the action forward with “Magnolia”-like relentlessness as its staccato piano scales — the notes running up and down the keys as if the music were looking for a way out — are subsumed into the crash of violins like raindrops getting swallowed by a tsunami. “One Battle After Another” might be among the sillier films that Anderson has ever made, but there's no mistaking the sincerity of its horrors, or how lucidly it diagnoses the smallness of the men inflecting them upon the innocent and the vulnerable.

If, as Salman Rushdie once argued, “Vineland” is “a book about what America has been doing to its children,” then “One Battle After Another” might be described as a film about why people keep making them anyway, even as “the Repression goes on, growing wider and deeper regardless of the names in power” (to slightly paraphrase Pynchon). Bob and Willa only share one scene together before “another battle” comes between them, but it's a splenetically funny little masterpiece of intergenerational disconnect, as the petrified father is too fogged up by the fear of losing his baby girl to appreciate how well she's learned to compensate for his failures. 

 










Bob is so entombed in his own past that he refuses to engage with his daughter's present (he watches “The Battle of Algiers” on TV like it's a throwback to the good old days), but as he scrambles across the back half of this movie in search of Willa, Anderson twists the erstwhile renegade into a living emblem for the eternal truth of all parenthood: Having kids is the most fearless thing a person can do in a world that grows more pernicious by the day, but raising them means being terrified every waking minute for the rest of your natural life. 

As much about parenthood as “Phantom Thread” was about marriage, Anderson's latest film is steeped in a fear that's completely absent from the supreme confidence of its form (“I'll tell you what freedom is: No fear. Tom fucking Cruise!”). It's a peerlessly comforting reminder that even today's most immortal artists — and/or yesterday's most unintimidated revolutionaries — can be scared to death by the thought of their kids fighting the same battles as they once did. Battles that a Gen Xer like Anderson can't help but look around and feel like they lost. One day you're detonating C4 inside a government detention center and the next you're sending your daughter to the school dance with a Cold War-era tracking device in her purse. “Time doesn't exist,” someone says at a crucial moment, “yet it controls us anyway.” 

 










Be that as it may, the sneaky but immense — and surprisingly upbeat — emotionality of “One Battle After Another” is rooted in the liberating resolve that Anderson mines from the terror of getting old. From the anger of growing conservative. From the guilt of not being able to break the cycle and bend a circular movie like this one into a straight line. 

Bob accomplishes exactly nothing during the course of his frantic pursuit of Willa, but in failing to protect his daughter from the regrets of his past, he discovers that she's the best of her parents, and more than capable of staring down the same demons that left him so paranoid. That she's the answer to his fears, not the personification of them. That raising kids can be a revolution unto itself if you do it right — one that doesn't need to be televised because it takes place right in the relative comfort of your own home. Time isn't an excuse, this magnificent film suggests, it's a war of attrition. And by joining his daughter in the present for the first time she was born, Bob might just come to understand that he's always been on the winning side of it. 

Warner Bros. will release “One Battle After Another” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

If you're a vintage animation fan and a physical media collector, 2025 is quite simply the greatest year in history to be alive — largely thanks to the efforts of one label. 

Earlier this year we covered Warner Archive‘s Blu-ray collections of classic Looney Tunes cartoons, all lovingly restored and released with pristine transfers. Now, under the guidance of film historian George Feltenstein, Warner Archive has done it again with “The Huckleberry Hound Show,” an 11-disc Blu-ray package that represents one of the label's most heroic reconstruction and preservation efforts. 

 










Huckleberry Hound and his costars on the Hanna-Barbera series have never really disappeared — their adventures have been airing piecemeal off and on for decades — but their shows haven't been available in their original form in over 60 years. Until now.

“The Huckleberry Hound Show,” which premiered in 1958 and ended in 1962 after four seasons, introduced not only the laid-back title character but fan favorites like Yogi Bear and Mr. Jinks. The show was originally sponsored by Kellogg's, with the show's characters represented in the original commercials. In each episode, Huckleberry Hound presented a collection of cartoons featuring himself and other characters, broken up by those Kellogg's commercials and other interstitial animation.

 










After the four seasons were broadcast from 1958 to 1962, there was a slight break in the availability of the series before it was sold to individual stations without national sponsorship. Generations of kids then became familiar with Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, and Pixie and Dixie via the individual cartoons, which were extracted from the original series and repackaged in various ways for syndication.

The original half-hour shows were broken into segments, with new main and end titles created to eliminate all references to Kellogg's. Local stations used this material to create the programming as they saw fit, and Hanna-Barbera didn't save the full half-hour shows; instead, the segments were inventoried by their respective characters (Huckleberry Hound, Pixie and Dixie, Hokey Wolf, etc.), Yogi Bear was spun off into his own series during the third season of the original “Huckleberry Hound” broadcasts, and those segments were inventoried in the same way.

None of the original bridging material and commercials were properly inventoried, meaning that when Feltenstein and a large team of dedicated Warner Bros. archivists, mastering supervisors, colorists, and audio engineers began work on the Blu-ray almost three years ago they had their work cut out for them. None of the original shows were saved in their complete original broadcast form, which was the way that Warner Archive wanted to present them.

 










Thankfully, with one exception, the original 35mm negatives of all the main character segments survived, and Feltenstein's team was able to scan them in 4K. (The one segment whose negative could not be located was sourced from a 16mm reduction negative.) Finding the connective tissue and restoring it was the greater challenge, a long process of bringing in every potential film and audio element that might relate to the pieces needed based on legacy documents in the Hanna-Barbera archival files, some of which were contradictory.

Given that the segments of the specific cartoons were the only items properly inventoried, trying to find all the interstitials — the bumpers, bridges, and whatever original commercials were created for the series — was a massive undertaking for the archivists. In some cases they found picture but no audio, or the opposite; some material was unusable due to vinegar syndrome. 

After months of sifting through containers the team was able to clarify exactly what they had and began the years-long process of matching the original broadcast versions of each of the 68 shows as closely as possible. The end result is pure gold for animation enthusiasts, especially given the abundance of newly restored material, all rendered with Warner Archive's usual technical rigor. 

 










Right off the bat there's a terrific surprise in the form of the original opening main title sequence with all the Kellogg's mentions — in color. Even learned animation scholars have generally assumed that Hanna-Barbera hadn't filmed the opening in color, since the initial broadcasts were only in black and white, but it's just one of many delightful discoveries Feltenstein and his team made during the reconstruction process. 

Watching the shows with their original structure and commercials intact feels like a form of time travel — the vintage commercials and bumpers create a sense of gleeful nostalgia, even if you're a viewer who wasn't alive when the show first aired. And the cartoons themselves, enlivened by the enormous voice talents of Daws Butler (who is profiled in an extra feature on the disc) and Don Messick, have aged beautifully. 

They're smart and hilarious, and in this impeccably assembled package they look and sound better than they ever have.

It was hardly a secret that Black Bear, which financed Sydney Sweeney boxing biopic “Christy,” might keep the film for its newly launched distribution arm. The company made it official with a TIFF announcement that it “acquired” the film for a November theatrical release. But can you really call it one of the fall festival's splashier deals when Black Bear essentially sold the movie to itself?

What's less expected is that Black Bear isn't the only financier making the leap into distribution. Row K Entertainment — an offshoot of financier MCT — entered the market with two buzzy buys: “Charlie Harper,” starring Emilia Jones, and Gus Van Sant's “Dead Man's Wire.” Both films had other suitors, but Row K likely overpaid to make a statement.

They join a growing field of upstart distributors sensing opportunity. Watermelon Pictures, which champions Palestinian storytellers, picked up TIFF Gala title “Palestine 36.” 1-2 Special, launched just this February, struck deals at Locarno and Cannes. All four companies are chasing the same sweet spot: smaller- to mid-budget films they believe can still play theatrically.

Not long ago, if A24 or Netflix passed, the market slowed to a crawl. Today, fresh energy is flowing into the indie scene as new players step in to give films a home.

“We just felt that there was a real hole, a lot of white space in the market for a new distributor that was going to release mid-budget, commercial pictures,” Row K co-chairman Christopher Woodrow told IndieWire. “I've been doing this for 20 years. I never felt that there was a more exciting opportunity than the independent market at this particular moment.”

Row K's president Megan Colligan believes younger audiences are returning to theaters because they want original stories and a diversity of content. She said movie theaters need more diversity than what studios provide.

“There's still a lot of room in the marketplace for original, independent content that exists among what you may argue are some very big titles. But there's I think a really robust opportunity for diversification,” Colligan said. “Exhibitors really want it, audiences really want it. I think that would bring us back to a pre-Covid level of moviegoing in consumption. We need more diversity in the theaters.”

So why aren't established buyers winning “Christy” or “Dead Man's Wire?” One sales agent told IndieWire that many distributors just had full slates. Another problem: Smaller distributors without a Pay-1 streaming window hold back. 

 










And mandates may be changing for some of the most consistent buyers. A24 currently favors bigger, more expensive projects, while Neon has been aggressively ramping up an international expansion.

The agent said that while Black Bear sniffed around TIFF for various films, the company's real goal was determining what to do with its own films. (In addition to “Christy,” there's a good chance Black Bear will release one of its other self-financed fall premieres, “Tuner,” though it sold “Train Dreams” to Netflix at Sundance early this year.) On the other hand, Row K intends to release “Dead Man's Wire” later this year for an awards-qualifying run; “Charlie Harper” will be set for release next year. The distributor is also chasing several other festival titles.

Black Bear is poised for expansion. It already has distribution branches in Canada and the UK and a strong sales presence in the rest of the world; U.S. distribution is the logical progression. Potentially Black Bear could only finance what it plans to distribute, an approach that could be the model for other aspiring financier-distributors.

While new buyers represent an exciting opportunity for more commercial films and awards plays, the agent said other categories are more uncertain — say, smaller American independent dramas, art house titles, and indie documentaries.

 










These new distributors are emerging to meet an unmet need in the market, and Black Bear and Row K won't be the only ones to capitalize on it.

“If you're a financier, that's what you look for. You look to spot opportunities,” Woodrow said. “Hopefully you spot them before others do. That's where the upside is.”

What should an award-winning journalist do after hanging up her press badge for good? Teach, of course! Wait, hold on, let me add one minor piece of context: What should an award-winning journalist do after hanging up their badge for good because they were caught censoring footage of the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol to hide their brother's identity from the FBI? Same answer? You're sticking with “teaching”? OK, great, then you and the producers of “The Morning Show” are on the same page.

Whatever hand-scrawled page in the Zodiac killer's book of cyphers that may be has been the central curiosity of Apple's inaugural original series over its first three tumultuous seasons. Starring Reese Witherspoon (as the aforementioned pillar of the Fourth Estate, Bradley Jackson) and Jennifer Aniston (as her one-time co-host and full-time gaslighter, Alex Levy), the ripped-from-the-headlines drama is ostensibly about modern journalism's ongoing mission to rid the newsroom of toxic patriarchal influences while rebuilding broadcast news into an inclusive, open-minded, and steadfastly truthful profession. Make journalism great again. Or something.

What it's actually about varies season to season, episode to episode, sometimes even scene to scene, as the increasingly bonkers narrative choices (started by Seasons 1-2 showrunner Kerry Ehrin and inherited by current showrunner Charlotte Stoudt) led the series to repeatedly and irreparably betray its ethical beginnings. Alex, who survived a 2020 bout with COVID by going on live TV to rail against cancel culture, isn't the #MeToo heroine she set out to be, nor is she any less of a noxious onscreen cliché after sleeping with the fictionalized version of Elon Musk (played with pointedly distracting handsomeness by Jon Hamm) while he was trying to take over (and destroy) her news network. Bradley not only doctored footage of an attempted governmental coups, but she leveraged that video to land a higher-profile gig on the evening news. 

 










That's how Season 3 started — she also, you may have heard, went to space — ending her journey of peaks and valleys by turning herself over to federal authorities.

Such wild swings in previous seasons don't leave “The Morning Show” with much room to top itself in Season 4. On a good day, I could applaud them for abstaining (especially since their timeline is still pre-Trump 2.0), but the back-to-basics approach — prioritizing complicated relationships and sudden, unsubstantiated melodrama over bizarro recreations of years-old news stories — only underlines how little character-building the series has accomplished across 30 hours of storytelling. It's hard to care about so many ill-advised office affairs in a show that started off arguing against their existence, and it's even harder when these purportedly passionate trysts lack substantial conflicts, palpable chemistry, or anything else that might warrant a mid-series switcheroo from decrying sexual predators to relying largely on sexual tension to sell the series.

Season 4 picks up two years later, and much has changed. Alex's last-second pitch to merge UBA (her network) with NBN (a rival network) is complete, and the two companies are acclimating to their new normal (now known as UBN). That means surviving mass layoffs (a very real fear across the media landscape that barely merits a mention before “The Morning Show” moves on) and — unrelated! — embracing generative AI. New CEO Stella Bak (Greta Lee) has spent thousands of ex-employees' salaries acquiring a top-tier artificial intelligence engine ahead of the 2024 Olympics, all so a digital version of Alex can speak to audiences the world over in their native language.

 










It's a brilliant move that definitely doesn't violate the Olympic Charter, and Stella's new boss, Celine Dumont (Marion Cotillard) is so excited about it she “literally swallowed shit” to close the deal. (The Seine's poopy water is Season 4's favorite topical reference, by far.) The plan is so fool-proof Alex even promised no (additional) UBN jobs would be lost to AI, and Alex's word is… well, why don't you ask her ex-bestie, Chip (Mark Duplass)? After getting fired by Alex for daring to question her relationship with tech billionaire Paul Marks (Hamm) — aka doing his job as a news producer — Chip dashed off to Cannes to accept an award for his new documentary. All's well that ends well, I guess… except Chip gets lured back to his old stomping grounds, so the caliber of his ending is still very much up in the air.

Paul also can't resist the gravitational pull of Alex Levy, spending their social run-ins giving her his best hot Don Draper stare from across the room, even as a new toxic white guy is living in her head, rent-free. Manosphere talk show host Bro Hartman (Boyd Holbrook) came over in the merger, using his red-state radio program, “The Talk Back,” to hock conspiracy theories and sperm-boosting supplements in equal measures. And while “The Brofessional's” overt sexual harassment — “Look at that… talent,” he says while staring at Alex's ass — may be a turn off for most women, Alex, God help her, just keeps coming back for more.

 










To its (very slight) credit, “The Morning Show” Season 4 goes out of its way to try to justify Alex's horrific taste in men. (Remember when she had an affair with her married co-host and serial rapist Mitch Kessler?) Her father, Martin (Jeremy Irons), is a conservative legal professor who looks down on his daughter's unserious work like Logan Roy used to look down on his kids, but he still comes knocking at her door when he needs a favor. Their barely rekindled relationship exists solely to set off extravagant fireworks later on, as Aniston goes toe-to-toe with Irons in this year's annual scene designed exclusively for awards voters. But hey, maybe she'll connect her problematic family patriarch with the patriarchy writ large and start making better life choices. 

Bradley, meanwhile, is lured back from West Virginia (where she's been sculpting young minds to report the news just like she did) by an anonymous text message teasing a scandal at UBN. Even though her FBI handlers — a condition of her post-insurrection release — are none too happy about it, wild horses couldn't keep Bradley from a good story because she's a real reporter. Similarly, only creepier, Cory (Billy Crudup) comes crawling back to his off-again, on-again crush, Bradley, even though he's started over as a Hollywood movie producer. Sure, he's trying to wrangle an Oscar-worthy cast for a half-filmed studio flick meant to repair his damaged reputation after being falsely accused of inappropriate conduct in the workplace, but what does any of that matter when he could once again walk the halls of UBA UBA+ UBN?

 










In case it's not already evident, “The Morning Show” Season 4 strains to find ways to keep its core cast together, defying logic and legalities as needed, and it still makes time to add new characters like Celine's artsy husband Miles and UBN's Head of Sports Ben, played by excellent actors (Aaron Pierre and William Jackson Harper, respectively) whose talents are almost totally wasted in half-formed roles. Episodic focus shifts drastically between the main cast, with Mia (Karen Pittman), Christine (Nicole Baharie), and Stella carrying the bulk of the midseason drama before getting sidelined for the two white women who, it must be said, make their lives harder every day.

It all makes for a darker, moodier Season 4, which also makes it harder to enjoy. “Enjoy” may be the wrong word for an experience that makes you stand up and pace in circles, talking to yourself and screaming at the television in alternating bouts of hysteria, but when it's recognized as the catastrophe it is, “The Morning Show” can be effective escapism in the way that only pitch-perfect trainwreck TV can. My poor editors, over the years, have had to endure multiple mid-screening office visits where I vent legitimate frustrations with the nonsensical series and then, sometimes simultaneously, savor the awesome lunacy of what I've just seen. 

 










Season 4 offers far less of the latter. There's simply no topping Bradley getting launched into orbit and a midseason reveal that she committed treason (and got away with it), even if it's never been clearer by season's end that neither Bradley nor Alex belong anywhere near a news building. “The Morning Show's” various nods to reality — the Olympics, the Boeing plane door fiasco, the rise of AI — aren't silly or substantive enough to spur hate-watching parties or hate-sharing texts. As the season goes on, you can feel the show's interest waning in each of the topics that it chose to elevate, until the final episodes focus on something else entirely. (Nine of the 10 episodes were screened for this review.)

Viewer interest should wane as well, unless you're a particular breed of actor or particular fan of acting: one who craves big, showy performances and doesn't tend to care how repetitive they get or if they're rooted in anything bigger than the seconds in which they're spoken. In that case, it won't matter that the contentious back-and-forths have no real weight to them. It won't matter that there's no build-up to each splashy confession, each emotional meltdown, each lost love. It may not even matter that there's only the vaguest perception these are supposed to be actual human beings who connect with one another; that they read closer to melodramatic approximations of real people, saying and doing whatever sounds good, than someone you might actually relate to out in the world.

 










That's just what happens, I guess, when you bungle your message so badly that you have no choice but to double down on the messy characters who were never meant to be the show's primary subjects. Like Bradley running a classroom or Alex reporting the news, they just don't make sense.

“The Morning Show” Season 4 premieres Wednesday, September 17 on Apple TV+. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale on November 12.

[Editor's note: The following interview contains spoilers for “Alien: Earth” through Season 1, Episode 7, “Emergence.”]

Noah Hawley's latest book is a horror story of a different ilk than his latest TV series — or is it? Whereas “Alien: Earth” is chock-full of slimy, savage parasites like the titular xenomorph that don't think twice before slicing up waves of human bodies, the writer's 2022 novel, “Anthem,” finds its dread in a cryptic, intangible threat: a sudden wave of teenage suicides. No one thing can explain the nationwide escalation, but an inscrutable symbol is found at the scene of each death, suggesting a link among America's youth that adults are at a loss to understand.

The main narrative is driven by a group of kids who escape from their rehab facility, guided by the conviction they can put an end to their generation's “act of collective surrender,” as Hawley describes it. But among the various threads making up his ambitious, enthralling epic, there's one recurring perspective that comes straight from the author himself. Hawley interjects, in third- and first-person passages as “the author,” to talk about the story, his role in it, as well as his own children, their fears, and his fears on their behalf.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






At one point, the author asks his daughter — who's on “two different kinds of anxiety medication” — why she's so afraid all the time. “She didn't want to grow up,” Hawley writes. “She didn't want to think about the future. I tried to convince her that planning for the future is the only way she'll have any control over it, but she was skeptical. We were in the middle of a global pandemic, after all. Control, she had learned, is an illusion.”

In his New York Times review of “Anthem,” fellow author S. Kirk Walsh wrote that Hawley's book works to empower teenagers even as his narrative sees them dying off in droves. “Instead of making teenagers the victims,” Walsh writes, “Hawley gives them agency and power in a collapsing world.”

The same could be said for “Alien: Earth.” 

Again, the setting of his story is hostile: a planet that's intolerably hot, a society controlled by five mega-corporations, and an invasive species capable of ending the human race. Again, Hawley takes a fraught, uncomfortable idea and places it at the center of a sprawling adventure: What if a dying child's consciousness could be transferred into an enhanced adult body? And what if these “hybrids” were our only chance at avoiding extinction? Again, he centers his story on children. 

But amid the many thorny questions “Alien: Earth” has raised in its critically acclaimed first season, one compelling idea is still driving the narrative: These kids aren't the victims. Sure, some may fall prey to fly-like creatures that digest their food outside their bodies, and others may be manipulated by Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) and his corporate peers. But the series as a whole is giving Wendy (Sydney Chandler) and her fellow hybrids agency in a world gone mad. 

 










She saved her brother, Joe (Alex Lawther), by ripping a xenomorph in half with her bare hands. She's working behind-the-scenes to accomplish her own goals, outside the ones set for her by Boy Kavalier, his right-hand synthetic, Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), and Prodigy as a whole. She's the one who — as revealed in Episode 7, “Emergence” — can communicate with the xenomorphs to the extent they'll help her instead of killing her. (Well, they could try, anyway). What happens with Wendy and what happens to the world are inextricably tied. Her future is ours.

In an interview with IndieWire, Hawley breaks down why he chose to center kids “at the heart of this story,” what Wendy's communication with the xenomorph means in that context, and how much she still has to learn in a world she wants to make her own. 

The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: What was your initial motivation to feature kids so prominently in an “Alien” story? 

Noah Hawley: Whatever the story is called, I'm always going to be wrestling with the things that are on my mind — as “Fargo” or “Alien” or whatever it is. And I have kids that were, when I started this, let's say 10 and 15 [years old], and when I ended, [they were] 12 and 17. I'm trying to figure out how to raise them in this crazy world that we're living in, where technology is running rampant and the planet's heating up. It's sort of humanity vs. nature, and then AI vs. humanity, like we're trapped between the natural world and our technology. That feels a lot like “Alien” to me. It feels a lot like Sigourney [Weaver] realizing that Ian Holm is an android, and now there's nowhere to go.

 










The question in an “Alien” movie is, “Will one or two humans survive?” And the question in the show is really, “Will humanity survive?” We know from the “Alien” franchise that humans aren't the best people. They're not the best species in the world, morally. So you start to think, “Well, do we even deserve to survive?” And then my thought was, “Well, who's more human than a child?” Children haven't learned how to hate, they're not greedy. Those are things we have to learn to be by becoming adults. 

So that's what was at the heart of it for me, and that's all part of a process in which you go, “Well, if the show is not about running from monsters week in, week out, then what is the function of the monsters?” Take the monsters out of it — what's the show? How can we use the monsters to make that show better?

When I watched the series, I was asking questions like, “What are my responsibilities as a parent?” and “Should I even have kids?” Those are heavy, uncomfortable questions for a big, expensive show. What kind of feedback did you get when you first put those ideas out there?

I think that originally, in the abstract, my friends at FX really loved the idea that the show was about something and that the aliens fit into it in a different way than if anyone else would approach it. I think as we got closer to production, as the scale of it became clear, people got nervous. It's not unusual to get nervous where you're spending a lot of money and doing something that hasn't been done before. Those two things combined make people a little nervous, right?

 










Tend to, yeah.

It's what we call in this business “execution dependent.” There's a really terrible version of [“Alien: Earth”] that's possible, where all the kids are Will Ferrell and the tone is really skewed, and you're like, “Oh, is it a satire of ‘Alien'?” That was always possible, and people were really nervous about it. I wasn't nervous about it, but I was aware of the danger. I just thought, “Well, it's a really interesting challenge that these young actors are going to have to face and me, as their director, am going to have to face,” in terms of getting the tone of it right.

But I knew from watching James Cameron's movie the tone is already in there. Those characters exist in the franchise already, where you have a child who feels like an adult in a child's body [in Newt] and then an adult who feels like a child in an adult's body, in Bill Paxton's character [Hudson]. They're just not literalized the way that I've literalized them.

Watching “Alien: Earth,” I couldn't stop thinking about your last book, “Anthem.” This feels like an evolution of those ideas regarding the world kids are inheriting and how they'll approach the future. 

The thing with kids is they're very open to the world. They're optimists by design. They've grown up with a scale of problems that are solvable. You know, as I write in the last chapter of “Anthem,” when you drive your kids around and they see someone who lives on the street and they're like, “Well, why are there homeless people?” As an adult, you go, “You just have to get used to that,” right? “We tried to solve it. We couldn't solve it, I think, it's just complicated and you've got to get used to it.” And kids are like, “I have to get used to that?! That seems crazy to me. Isn't it better to just solve the problem?”

 










There's this lack of cynicism to kids that made me want to put them at the heart of this story — because so much of the story is like Paul Reiser's character in the second film [Carter J. Burke, who works for Weyland-Yutani] who's acting out of the worst craven greed and scuzziness. A child sees that, and it is just a different view of the world. There's a moment in the show where Wendy says, “Don't say it's complicated. That's what powerless people say to make doing nothing seem OK.” So I think that's part of it: “It's complicated” is not a good enough answer.

Children's lack of cynicism really unlocks one of the bigger swings in the show — when Wendy starts communicating with the xenomorph. A kid is going to enter into that relationship differently. What made you want to explore that?

Well, not to refer to the James Cameron movie again, but there's a moment in which Ripley has entered the egg chamber and she's holding Newt in her arms, and you meet the Queen for the first time. These drones come in, the xenomorphs come in, and there's clearly a moment in which the Queen communicates with those drones and they withdraw. That moment always stuck with me because clearly there's some level of language or communication that's possible. We just can't hear it or understand it or whatever. So in a science-fiction story in which we're doing something no one's ever done before — creating a synthetic body and putting a child's mind into it — I just thought, “Well, what if she can hear them?” 

 










Now, she says at one point, “They chose me” — which is not accurate, but it's how a child looks at it, right? “Well, I can hear it, so that must mean something.” It's like my daughter became a vegetarian at nine. These are the ages in which children romanticize things: Animals have faces and, “We don't eat the dog, so why would we eat the cow?” So I think it's both very naive and also very noble to go, “Well, maybe these are just animals who didn't want to be brought here, and maybe they're scared.” As “Alien” movie watchers, we're like, “No, no, no, don't get too close.” But on the other hand, we can [understand], “Well, yeah, they're not evil. They're just parasites. They're just animals.” It seemed like a really interesting way to explore this divide between child and adult.

That naiveté also makes it easier for the audience to go along with some of their bad decisions. Adults should know better than to do some of the dumb stuff they do in horror movies, but kids — especially kids in synthetic, superhuman bodies — don't have as many reasons to be afraid. 

They're also pack animals. They're subject to shaming, they're subject to bullying. I find that really interesting. I think part of what made “Stranger Things” such a hit was that very thing you're talking about: They didn't all think it was a good idea, but they followed the leader and they were loyal. My hope is that A) this is designed as an entertainment; I want people to be entertained at all times — for the action to work and the horror to work and the sci-fi ideas to be sticky for people. But my hope is also B) that you reach a moment as you're watching each of these children struggle with a different dilemma of adulthood, and you find yourself watching it for a different reason; you find yourself compelled as much by the character dilemmas as by the creature dynamics.

 










One big dilemma for Wendy comes in Episode 7 when she sees Isaac's dead body. She's shocked by it. When she says, “But we're premium,” it's clear she's been operating under the belief that she's indestructible, as even regular children often do. But now she knows she's not.

All of these kids who have been put into these synthetic bodies were sick early on and probably dying on some level. So they have had to face their mortality at an age much earlier than any of us should, and Wendy specifically had to do it. Her father was also too sick to be with her, and her brother was halfway around the world. So her experience of it was super lonely and really kind of difficult.

But now, as she says, she's the forever girl. They were told that they were immortal, basically. Plus, she is the Wendy Darling. She's the mother, she's the big sister, she feels responsible for them. So I think there's something in this moment of seeing him and realizing what all of us adults instinctively know: We're all going to die and none of us are safe. That is a version of just the horror of mortality that we all discover at varying ages.

Wendy also acts as a kind of wish fulfillment for kids. She's physically stronger than the adults around her, and she's gaining more and more control as the series progresses, to a point.
 










On the one hand, it's super-empowering for her — this terminally ill girl who's had this miraculous transformation into this synthetic being — but she's also discovering that she doesn't actually have autonomy because her body is a prototype for a product; that she's basically owned by this corporation. So it's empowering for her both to have the sort of power she has over the machines and also the influence she has over the [xenomorph].

But what it brings up, of course, is the fact that she's a child and she's basically been handed a bazooka. As much as my 12-year-old son loves playing with swords, you don't want to give him one. [laughs] You don't want to give him an actual sword. So she has to learn on the job how to be responsible and the consequences of things.

It's one thing, in the great pretend-play in the sky, to say, “Oh, wouldn't it be cool to have your own xenomorph? It could protect you!” But then you're like, “Yeah, but those are people's lives. It's actually killing people, and there are consequences to all of this power that you have.” That is part of the growing-up parable we're telling here.

There's this thing that we did in the Chris Rock season of “Fargo,” this idea that he felt that if he only had more power, he'd be safer, but the reality was the more power he got, the less safe he was in his family. But it's very hard for people to surrender power because it conflicts with what they think is true. So I think these complex ideas about how to be a person in the world and when to be strong and when to be diplomatic and when to say, “Whatever you want, man,” all those things are what we learn in the journey to adulthood. Just putting a child in an adult's body doesn't make them an adult.

The Ed Sheeran of old—the one who liked getting in drunken scraps and wrote sweet love songs to apologize for stumbling home late from the pub—might have turned Play into a drinking game: Every time he uses some kind of explosion as a metaphor, take a shot. If he mentions the stars, down your Guinness. Real drinkers can add references to heaven in there too, but I wouldn't advise it. Some quick napkin math tells me that players of this game will have downed 13 shots in Play's first 20 minutes.

Say what you will about Sheeran, but he has never sounded this lazy. For the first decade of his career, he used normal-guy drag to hide the kind of mercenary ambition that was seemingly only shared by his friend and collaborator Taylor Swift. He parlayed “The A Team,” an acoustic debut single about homelessness and crack addiction, into a couple of albums of rock-solid wedding standards, which belied a future interest in tasteless-but-effective genre fusion that led to high-risk, high-reward singles like “Shape of You,” “I Don't Care,” and “Bad Habits.”

Sheeran's great innovation was the realization that his extremely normal personal life—he married his high school sweetheart, only hangs out with childhood friends, and has spoken about shitting himself onstage—allowed him to take more brazen risks than other stars, like experimenting with grime and dancehall, or releasing a song with Cardi B in which she alleges that “Ed got a little jungle fever.” He was positioned not as a multimillionaire popstar, the kind of figure who might get dinged for globetrotting and trendhopping in search of the next No. 1, but an everyman listener—an average joe who enjoyed flicking through Latin trap, hip-hop, and stomp-clap-hey all the way to the bank.

By his own admission, Sheeran no longer has this kind of drive. “Pop is a young person's game and you have to really, really be in it and want it,” he told The New York Times recently. “I've found myself stepping back more and more and being like, actually, I'm really valuing family.” Putting aside the work this does to undo the attempts of stars like Swift and Madonna to prove that pop is not exclusively a young person's game, it also rings slightly hollow when listening to Play, which represents a clear retrenchment after 2023's – and Autumn Variations, Sheeran's first studio albums to not peak at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 since his 2011 debut.

This fact is likely anathema to Sheeran, a noted stats obsessive who expresses a desire to “keep this Usain pace” at the outset of Play. At the same time, you can hear that weariness all throughout Play, which often finds him going back to his two favourite wells—wedding songs and “global” bangers—without much of the energy or good humor that made him so popular to begin with. This clash of ambition and half-heartedness leaves Sheeran sounding exactly like the guy he always told you he wasn't: The ultra-calculating pop star whose love of the game has been entirely subsumed by a need to maintain his perch.

That metamorphosis wasn't necessarily a given: “Opening,” the first song on Play, is fascinatingly persnickety, hinting at new frictions in Sheeran's life. It is good metatext, even if it is basically unlistenable as music. After a pretty acoustic folk fakeout, the track quickly swerves into some of Sheeran's worst-ever rapping: “In this world, there's no relaxin'/I've been here since migraine skankin'/Never been cool, but never been a has-been.” His Central Cee-ish soft rhyming of ridicule/applicable/formidable might have worked a little better if he didn't attend the Swift school of rapping, ending lines with gratingly melodic upspeak and downspeak, as if he's scared of losing track of the beat. Even so, his lyrics on “Opening” are revealing: He hints at fallings-out and wonders if he's “lost his way,” admits his “career's in a risky place,” emphasises that he doesn't want history to “happen again” while staying wholly vague about what any of that might mean. It sets Sheeran up for an album that could grapple with his place in the world, the music industry, and his own social circle.

That album is emphatically not Play, though. When he does touch on the themes of “Opening,” it's in remarkably maudlin ways. On the weepy stomp-clap number “Old Phone,” about finding a decade-old phone in a drawer, he lists the phone's contents (“Conversations with my dead friends/Messages from all my exes”) before deciding that “I kinda think that this was best left in the past.” When he sings that he feels “an overwhelming sadness/Of all the friends I do not have left,” it just serves as a reminder of how literal Sheeran is as a songwriter: There's no self-interrogation here, just a rote recount of a fairly common experience. Sheeran doesn't currently own a phone, but if he did, he might understand that most people's current phones are “so full of love, yet so full of hate.” (He might also have been able to ask Google AI for some examples of show-don't-tell storytelling.) Of course, this puddle-deep analysis can only be maintained for so long; by the song's bridge, he's put the phone away, “from whence it came.”

“Old Phone”'s literal attempt to mine the past for inspiration is, at the very least, slightly new territory for Sheeran. On “Camera,” he taps back into the I-love-you-despite-your-flaws clichés of his One Direction co-write “Little Things” (“You think that you don't have beauty-in-abundance but you do/That's the truth”) before inverting the premise of his 2015 hit “Photograph”: “I don't need a camera to capture this moment/I'll remember how you look tonight for all my life.” But then again, isn't it every childhood Clapton obsessive's dream to one day rip off “Wonderful Tonight?” Again?

The box-ticking doesn't end there: Play contains unworthy successors to both “Perfect” (“In Other Words”) and “Thinking Out Loud” (“The Vow,”) as well as “A Little More,” a vintage Sheeran breakup track in that it is too bilious by half. When he sings “I can't call you crazy/'Cause you could be diagnosed” it reinforces two things we already knew about Sheeran: he's never been able to save any of his famous empathy for his exes, and he's never been able to really land a joke.

These obvious, odious songs pad out a couple of singles that vindicate my perhaps-unpopular feeling that Sheeran is at his most dynamic when drawing from nonwhite musical traditions. “Azizam,” named after an Iranian term meaning “my darling,” is his catchiest, most energized song since “Shape of You” thanks to its tight hook and producer Ilya's subtle incorporation of unconventional rhythms and traditional Iranian instruments. “Sapphire,” a collaboration with the Punjabi superstar Arijit Singh, and “Symmetry,” built around a frisky, hypnotic tabla rhythm by Jayesh Kathak, are heavy-handed, but Sheeran's sheer enthusiasm on each track—the same level of investment that made “South of the Border” work despite its profound cringe factor—sells them entirely. (I am almost certain that non-diasporic Indians will go crazy for these songs, and that's before you factor in the appearance of Shah Rukh Khan, India's Tom Cruise, in the video for “Sapphire.”)

These are the only songs on Play where Sheeran doesn't sound like he's going through the motions; he's talked about finishing the album in Goa, and they're sparky enough to make you wish he had done the whole album there. And of course, Sheeran is not “Mr. Political,” as he put it in 2017, but there is a bitter aftertaste to his collaborations with Indian and Iranian musicians on an album released just a day before more than 110,000 far-right anti-immigrant protesters roiled through the streets of London. These are escapist songs landing in inescapably awful times; Sheeran might be the only everyman in England who can ignore the fact that this kind of apolitical, commerce-minded Choose Love thinking ran out of steam a long time ago.

Play ends with “Heaven,” one of the album's strongest songs, and also the song that best encapsulates all its problems. On one hand, it taps into a narrative that's dogged Sheeran through his entire career: He may have “won both cases,” as he raps on “Opening,” referring to copyright infringement cases he won in 2023 and 2024, but that doesn't change the fact that a lot of Sheeran's music bears uncanny resemblance to other hits, and this one is fairly similar to both Jason Mraz's “I'm Yours” and Charli XCX's “Everything Is Romantic.” On the other hand, its combination of an easy ghatam-led groove and sweetly generic lyrics seems to find a healthy middle ground between the innovation that Sheeran says he's too old for and the timeworn cliché that sounds so stale on the rest of the album. Then again, attentive listeners might find repetition of the same old images too much to bear when he drops lines like “Chemicals bursting, exploding/As every second's unfolding.” Take a double shot.

Sometimes at night, when mark william lewis is feeling overwhelmed, he visits the banks of the Thames River and skips rocks across its surface. “Each stone,” he says, “is another thought sent spinning into the water.” It's a potent ritual, one you can almost hear in the songwriter's opaque, introspective guitar ballads. In a dusky baritone, he offers meditations on heartbreak, connection, and the heavy burden of living. Half-thoughts and fractured images flit through his delicate songs; elusive truths flash out for a moment, then disappear into the black.

On his self-titled new album—the first non-film-related release on tastemaking movie studio A24's music imprint—he largely continues in this mode. The record's 12 tracks are fragmented, transient, and unsettled, anchored only by lewis' steady voice. From the first moments of opener “Still Above,” lewis sounds ruminative and uncertain: pleading for peace, mulling old memories, and looking ahead to a “restless journey home.” Over gasping horns and echoing electric guitar lines that sound like a Blue Nile record playing at the wrong speed, he casts a lonely figure, wandering in a world he can't fully connect to.

The mood is anxious and agitated throughout: Even “Tomorrow Is Perfect,” a comparatively breezy song by lewis' standards, feels tightly wound, as he murmurs of fanged hounds, unfriendly doctors, and “the brutal bridge of betrayal.”

On “Spit,” he sings ominously of illness and mistakes and “blood in your spit every fucking day.” On the distorted, otherworldly “Brain,” he wants to make amends, but even in those pleas, his thoughts are clouded by doubt and cynicism. Trying to make literal sense out of the lyrics—elusive and illusory as they are—is tricky, but the picture they paint is of an unrelentingly bleak headspace. Still, these songs never tip into total darkness. “Still Above,” though sleepily paced, toys with shimmery sophistipop textures. “Seventeen” is yearning and gloomy lyrically, but its lithe acoustic strumming isn't a world away from Alex G's more dewy-eyed ballads. And then there's lewis' voice, which he never pushes too far beyond a murmur or a whisper, adding comfort and peace to every word he sings. Even the heaviest songs sound like daydreams.

In some ways, this is precisely the sort of songs he's been writing since he emerged from the off-kilter London scene that produced friends and fellow travelers like Bar Italia, Double Virgo, and Still House Plants. Like those bands—and like an even longer lineage of UK pop experimenters from Talk Talk to Bark Psychosis to Dean Blunt—he is fond of rock and folk conventions. (He employs a wheezy harmonica across several songs on Mark William Lewis, in part because of his dad's appreciation for Bob Dylan and Neil Young.) But he never uses them in expected ways. Nor does he really allow himself easy catharsis or anthemic choruses—even though he has demanded exactly that from the avant-garde scene he once was a part of. “Just give me a chorus, please,” he recently told The Fader. “Take a risk and don't be afraid to say something revealing about how you feel.”

Ironically, lewis' own music is rarely that straightforward—to its benefit. These songs are full of feelings, but lewis stops short of making anything that feels truly vulnerable, at least in a traditional way. The whats and the whys and proper nouns that spark these musings are deliberately blurry, but they clearly are deeply felt. Each cryptic whisper is punctuated by a spiraling guitar lead or a wheezy, gasping instrumental backdrop. The cracks and fissures between images, the pauses and false starts—each fragment hints at abstract conclusions, and universal truths just out of reach. If you listen closely, you can hear whole worlds in every ellipsis.

Bob Dylan is really digging in the crates. The storied musician's latest archival release takes us all the way back to his teenage years in Minnesota, through to his early 1960s days in New York's Greenwich Village. Through the Open Window: The Bootleg Series Vol. 18 captures Dylan's work between 1956 and 1963. The collection is out October 31. Below, listen to “Rocks and Gravel (Solid Road),” a previously released track that was recorded in April 1962 in sessions for The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.

The last two discs of Through the Open Window capture Dylan's famed concert at New York's Carnegie Hall on Saturday, October 26, 1963. The recordings on the new set are previously unreleased.

Through the Open Window will be released digitally and in 8xCD, 2xCD, and 4xLP editions. The physical editions will also come with a 125-page liner notes essay from Sean Wilentz. It's Dylan's first Bootleg Series entry in more than two years, following Fragments - Time Out of Mind Sessions (1996-1997): The Bootleg Series, Vol. 17.

For nearly a quarter century, Joel Gibb has snuck a queer gaze into spaces that don't traditionally welcome it, be it the church or the rodeo. That subversive sensibility is really the only constant in the erratic history of his band, the Hidden Cameras. To those who caught them during their early-2000s ascendancy, the Hidden Cameras seemed like a group effort: Gibb flanked himself with a chaotic cadre of classically trained musicians, amateur noisemakers, and semi-nude go-go dancers that showed fellow Canadian collectives like Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene how to really crowd a stage, and had Rough Trade guru Geoff Travis jetting into Toronto.

But the Hidden Cameras began as Gibb's solo project, and in many respects, that's how it's remained. Since decamping to Berlin in 2006, Gibb has treated the band more like his own personal Etch A Sketch: devising elaborate new visions for the enterprise, wiping the slate clean with each album, and gradually displacing his former gaggle of Toronto art-scene anarchists with seasoned celebrity collaborators. While his output has become less frequent, it's taken on more surprising forms, like the goth-dub drift of 2014's Age or the country cosplay of 2016's Our Home on Native Land.

Bronto arrives after the longest gap between records—nine years—and represents Gibb's most extreme makeover yet. Once a missionary for “gay folk church music,” he is now, for the first time, writing from the discotheque. If the Hidden Cameras long fell into the indie-pop tradition of the Smiths, Belle and Sebastian, and the Magnetic Fields, the new album situates itself along the queer club-hopping continuum of Arthur Russell, Pet Shop Boys, and Hercules and Love Affair (complete with remix co-signs from '80s elders). More than just imagining a universe where the Hidden Cameras signed to DFA instead of Rough Trade in 2003, Bronto embraces the ideal of the dancefloor as a space to lose inhibition, yielding the most candid songwriting of Gibb's career.

That might sound like a strange thing to say about a guy who introduced himself to the world with a song about putting the “you” in urination. But while Gibb has written many tunes both sacred and profane, he's rarely exposed a bruised heart. Bronto begins mid-crisis: On the opening “How do you love?” Gibb issues a series of down-on-my-knees pleas to an inconsiderate ex (“How can you say that you're over me?”) over a gut-punching 4/4 thump, while a simmering string arrangement from Cameras OG Owen Pallett permeates the scene like dry ice, heightening the desperation. Even when Gibb dials down the drama (and the bpm), the ache lingers in the crestfallen synth-pop of “Undertow” like his own “Dancing on My Own.”

Under the guidance of Munich-based producer Nicolas Sierig (of the duo Joasihno), Gibb surrenders to dance music's mind-altering, out-of-body qualities, using it less as a vessel for literary narrative than unfiltered emotional release. On the album's deepest immersions into subterranean house hedonism (“Quantify,” “State of”), Gibb's normally loquacious lyrics break down into minimalist mantras of desire. Quasi-title track “Brontosaurus Law,” a strobe-lit stomper that opens with an orgasmic growl, exposes the album's primal core. When Gibb sings, “I can tell you need it/Like you know I want it,” it's basically his polite way of saying he wants to fuck you like an animal.

BRONTO documents Gibb's nocturnal adventures in the Berlin club scene, and it arrives in the wake of a 20th-anniversary reissue for the Hidden Cameras' first two albums and a documentary on their Toronto origins. Between its body-rocking workouts and Vangelis-like interludes, the new record reintroduces the empathetic storyteller who served as the pied piper for the city's post-Y2K freak scene. “You Can Call” is Carole King's “You've Got a Friend” reborn as an Erasure dance-tent anthem, and on the closing “Don't tell me that you love me,” Gibb takes a vocal track he recorded in 2007 and hardwires it into BRONTO's mainframe, creating a seamless synthesis of the Cameras' early cathedral-sized hymns and his current electro affinities. In its final minute, the splendorous chorus is overtaken by a steely techno pulse, bringing this otherwise heartwarming song to an ambiguously icy conclusion. The Hidden Cameras remain a vehicle for communal ecstasy, but Gibb is always moving to his own beat.

	The Latin Grammy nominations are here—and this year is all about Bad Bunny. The Puerto Rican superstar received the most nominations of any artist, nabbing 12 nods for work across his standout album Debí Tirar Más Fotos. In addition to getting recognized multiple times in major categories (he has two songs competing against each other under Best Song, Best Record, and Best Urban Song), he also turned up in surprising areas, like the new category Best Roots Song and Best Short Form Video.


	But although the nominations revolve around Bad Bunny this year, other artists saw a lot of Latin Grammy love. Songwriter and producer Edgar Barrera and the Argentine breakouts CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso trail Bad Bunny with 10 nominations each. For CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso, the nominations close out a a massive couple of months that included a viral Tiny Desk last October, a wildly successful album called Papota, and a buzzy Coachella performance. Meanwhile, other noteworthy nods include eight for Natalia Lafourcade and six for the rising Brazilian star Liniker.

	











	The Best Roots Song category, added this year to show fusions between traditional and modern sounds, also include CA7RIEL & Paco Amoroso El David Aguilar, Catalina García Barahon, Bad Bunny, Natalia Lafourcade, and more. The Latin Grammys also added a second category this year for Best Music For Visual Media.

	Baby number four is on the way for Cardi B. The rapper is expecting her first child with boyfriend Stefon Diggs, the wide receiver for the New England Patriots. She was all mama and no drama as she announced her pregnancy on CBS Mornings on Wednesday. “I feel like I'm in a good space. I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that I'm doing all this work,” Cardi told Gayle King. “But I'm doing all this work while I'm creating a baby, me and my man, we're very supportive of each other.”


	On Friday, Cardi will release her long-awaited second studio album, Am I the Drama? which follows her 2018 debut Invasion of Privacy. Speaking of, her official announcement comes after weeks of speculation about her pregnancy. Rumors kicked up after Cardi made a series of appearances in court while battling a civil trial over claims she assaulted a security guard during an argument seven years ago. Cardi emerged victorious, but her body quickly became the leading topic of conversation.


	Cardi noted that, at the time of the interview, she hadn't even broken the news of her pregnancy to her parents yet because she's “scared of them.” And keeping it from the public was at least partially because she was working to “close some deals first.” Still, she feels “excited” and “happy” to be entering this new chapter with Diggs, who she said won her over by telling her, “Give me a chance for me to heal you.”

	











	Cardi previously welcomed three children with Offset. The couple married in 2017, and she filed for divorce from the rapper in 2024. “He just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,” Cardi said about Diggs, who has one daughter from a previous relationship. The pair initially became linked through dating rumors in October 2024.

	“I mean, like, two weeks ago, I was literally having a panic attack. I was, like, crying and crying and crying, just because I was just getting really nervous with you know, the whole album rollout,” Cardi continued. “People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me.” But with Diggs, she said, “He makes me feel very confident… And it makes you feel like you could take over the world.”


	Now that Cardi has made the big reveal the internet has been whispering about for weeks, she wants something in return. “Now y'all could buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff,” she joked. “I told you. Now go support my album, cause I'm a mother of four now.”

	If only for a little while, Ozzy Osbourne started to feel like himself again when he made his way back to music. In the official trailer for the upcoming documentary Ozzy: No Escape From Now, the Prince of Darkness battles health struggles that initially interfered with his ability to say a proper goodbye to his fans.


	Out Oct. 7, the Paramount+ film follows Osbourne and his family through medical mishaps, including one instance in which he broke his neck. The surgery he endured after, his son Jack Osbourne said in the clip, left him in even worse condition than before. The only thing that seemed to really help was recording songs. “I took dad to the studio every single day,” Kelly Osbourne said. “He'd get comfortable, and it was like the magic would begin.”


	The trailer shows footage of Osbourne recording the title track for Patient Number 9, his thirteenth and ultimately final studio album, which arrived in 2022. The metal legend died earlier this summer at the age of 76. The news arrived on July 22, just over two weeks after Osbourne fulfilled his desire to say farewell with his final live appearance during Black Sabbath‘s Back to the Beginning all-star tribute concert. 

	











	“I'm not good at being sick,” Osbourne said in the trailer. “I belong up there, you know.” The idea for the show is first presented by Sharon Osbourne, but he makes it clear, “If I'm going to go up there, I want to be up there the old Ozzy.” 

	











	In February, Sharon shared a statement about the documentary, which began filming in 2022 and was directed by Tania Alexander. “This film is an honest account of what has happened to Ozzy during the last few years,” she said. “It shows how hard things have been for him and the courage he has shown while dealing with a number of serious health issues, including Parkinson's. It's about the reality of his life now. We have worked with a production team we trust and have allowed them the freedom to tell the story openly. We hope that story will inspire people that are facing similar issues to Ozzy.”

	At that final concert in July, Osbourne appeared onstage in a leather chair and sang “I Don't Know,” “Mr. Crowley,” “Suicide Solution,” “Mama, I'm Coming Home,” and “Crazy Train” with veteran members of his solo band. Despite concerns about the state of his voice in light of his health issues, he worked hard to prepare for the appearance and gave it his all. 


	“If my life's coming to an end, I really can't complain,” Osbourne said in the trailer. “I had a great life.”

Mariah the Scientist stopped by The Tonight Show to perform a medley of two songs, “Rainy Days” and “Burning Blue.” Both tracks appear on the R&B singer's most recent album, Hearts Sold Separately. 


	The musician offered a dramatic rendition of the songs, complete with costumes and a haze of smoke. The military aesthetic from the performance mirrored the LP's stark artwork, which depicts a single toy soldier in front of a pink background. 


	Mariah the Scientist recently spoke with Rolling Stone about crafting Hearts Sold Separately, her fourth album. “The climate of the world made me want to make a whole project about love,” she said. “I feel like nobody prioritizes love. Everybody looks at love like it's a problem. I feel like back in the day, it wasn't like that. Everybody wanted to have a family unit and be married.”

	She continued, “Now it's like everybody is shying away from that a little bit. I just feel like there's this long-standing war between men and women and I don't know what that's about. I wish it wasn't like that, but it just is. And the more men and women I meet, I realize even though we are all human, there are huge fundamental differences that you don't really acknowledge when you're younger.

That was the catalyst of everything I wrote.”

	Last year, musician Bobby Pulido tearfully announced that he'd be going on one final tour to celebrate more than 30 years as a Tejano icon. His reason for retiring? To trade concerts for a career in politics.


	On Wednesday morning, Pulido confirms to Rolling Stone that he will be running as a Democrat in South Texas' 15th congressional district, aiming to unseat incumbent Republican Monica De La Cruz. But in a district that has shifted red in recent years, in part due to gerrymandering, Pulido says he's approaching his candidacy with a bipartisan mindset.


	“Let's be honest, this is the most conservative district in South Texas,” Pulido tells Rolling Stone. “I think you need to have a candidate that is tailor-made for the district in order to flip it. I don't think a progressive will ever be able to flip this district — doesn't matter how popular you are, it's just not made that way.”


	He puts it simply in his campaign video: “I'm not team red. I'm not team blue. South Texas, I'm team you.”

	The 15th district spans more than 300 miles across South Texas, covering rural areas along the border where Pulido says many residents have felt disenfranchised and disconnected from the Democratic Party, but also upset with some aspects of the Trump administration's approach to immigration and other issues. He says he isn't afraid to go against the party line, centering his campaign on three issues: immigration, healthcare, and the economy.

	











	On immigration, he says he opposes both Biden's “open borders” approach and Donald Trump's deportation push that has separated families. On the economy, he wants to champion working families by “investing in skills and apprenticeships, and creating high-wage jobs that keep our talent right here at home.” And on health care, Pulido admits he doesn't have insurance himself, citing skyrocketing prices, and says he wants to put people ahead of Big Pharma.

	“I really feel like the country's off kilter right now. There's a tremendous imbalance and I can either stay on the sidelines and be a guy with an opinion or I can actually attempt to do something that most people think is not doable, which is win in a heavily gerrymandered district,” Pulido says.


	For his campaign, Pulido is spotlighting his family values, Mexican American identity, and lifelong ties to South Texas as the son of immigrants who built a life in the community. He hopes to draw on both his cultural roots and the respect he's earned over his storied music career to connect with voters and represent the region he feels deeply tied to on a national stage.


	“I know it's cliché because we heard the guy in the Oval Office say it — but I don't have to do this,” Pulido says. “I don't have nearly as much wealth as he does, but I would definitely take a financial hit if I were to win. And I'm OK with that because I really want to fight for South Texas — and for my kids' future.”


	The morning after a show in Mexico, Bobby Pulido sat down with Rolling Stone over a breakfast of huevos con jamón to explain why he's running for Congress, his frustration with “phony capitalism,” and why he believes South Texas needs a candidate tailor-made for the district.


What do you say to the people who doubt your candidacy because of your background in music?I don't blame them. I have been incredibly careful not to mix politics with my career. I understand if somebody says, “What does he know? He's a singer.” But that's why you talk about the issues. And I will tell you this: If anybody that would judge me based on that, especially in the district, I would also just ask that you be fair and ask yourself the same question: If you voted for the guy that was a reality TV star, and if you voted for the woman that is now our congresswoman that was selling insurance out of a strip mall, did you ask her the same question? At the end of the day, I just ask for fairness and for an opportunity for people to listen to me talk about the issues.

Why did you decide to run for office?It has been a long time coming, to be honest with you. The very first time I thought about it was during the election of 2022. I traveled with Congressman Vicente Gonzalez and spent a day with him. I'm a big policy nerd. I've always been that way. And for me to get the chance to spend a day with a congressman on a campaign trail [changed everything.] His wife said, “Why don't you consider running? You'd be awesome.” And I said, “Well, I always wanted to get into politics, but I love my life. My life's good.” And she said, “Think about it.” And I did.  I talked over with my wife later, and she said, “I haven't seen you write a song lately, but you're always keeping up with what's going on.” And I said, “Yeah, that's always been in my DNA.”


Why run in South Texas?South Texas is something that I've been culturally very close to. I consider myself 100 percent South Texas, and I felt as long as they kept me in South Texas, I have a fighting chance, 'cause I do believe I represent the values of South Texas.  But the question is, what am I going to do to help improve my kids' chances of making it in the world? I sense them getting incredibly frustrated that even if they work hard, that dream is not attainable right now. The system that we have in place is not working. It's phony capitalism. And I think it's affecting the youth.


I want to get into policy and your district. I'm from California, but my family's from Texas. Some family members turned toward MAGA and very anti-immigration. That shift is happening a lot with Latinos in Texas. How do you plan to appeal to them?I ask a lot of questions. I think we have to be honest: We did not handle the border correctly. And I say we, being the Biden administration. It was not handled correctly. What created some resentment in the Mexican-American community is that a lot of the people who had parents who were undocumented crossed over, and they just had to figure life out. They didn't get anything given to them. They had to go figure life out and make it work. Now, some Mexican Americans start feeling a little bit resentful when they see that other people cross the border who are not from Mexico, and declare political asylum.


	I have a lot of friends and even family members who are border patrol agents who have felt very frustrated because they're like, “I signed up to protect the border, not to be processing people. And that's not what they signed up for.” The border patrol vote went really, really heavily towards Republicans.

	











	It feels now like there's only two sides: let them all in or kick them all out. And that's not a policy. Right now, what the Trump administration is doing with immigration is using fear. But the problem with fear is fear doesn't just affect the undocumented people from coming over here, but it's also people with visas. You would think that we would have tons of border traffic from Mexico of people coming over to spend their money, but they are not. It's affecting our local economy.


So what's the solution?Bipartisanship. Before the election, Republican Senator James Lankford from Oklahoma put forward a good bill — but Trump killed it, saying, “No, the elections are coming and we need to win.” They didn't want to fix it. The solution is working across the aisle, but partisan tribalism gets in the way. And the problem with the Republican leadership right now is that there's a swath of people who don't want to fix this because, in their eyes, there are already too many Hispanics in the country.


Is it racism, in a way?I'm going to be very careful about using that word or calling anybody that. But I won't blame you if you use it, and I'm not saying the Republicans are all like that. I'm not saying that there is a segment that has that worldview, and they won't accept the fact that we can have more Hispanics in the country. And that's the problem that I have with some of them. 


On the immigration front, a lot of Mexican music acts haven't been able to get their visas as well.I feel like it's an attack on our people. My biggest problem is that they don't even give them an excuse. They don't even tell them, “You can't come because of this. We've canceled your visa.” They just say, “We don't owe you an explanation.” Now, that's not right. What do they do to our economy when Julión Álvarez sells out Cowboy Stadium? How many people reserved hotels and got flights and just lost money? That's not an attack on us? I absolutely think it is. Give us a reason. There's no reason they're just doing it.


If you win the Democratic primary, you'd be facing off against Monica De La Cruz, who is a Republican and took over a GOP district. Why would you be the right person then to face off against her if you win the primary?Well, that's a good question. I feel that I'll be able to be the best person to face off against her because I have a very high name ID in the Latino community. This district is 11 counties and stretches almost 300 miles. That's a lot of campaigning. I have the time to campaign. I have a grasp of the issues. I understand the people, their values, and their needs.

	











	We have a lot of rural areas. I'm a rural guy. I feel like we have to make a better case as to why the Republicans are really leaving rural America in the dust. I know it goes contrary to what you might imagine, but rural hospitals are getting defunded by those budget cuts that my hopefully future opponent voted for. And what makes it even worse is that De La Cruz wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House just days before that vote saying, “Please don't cut this because you're going to hurt my people.” She's acknowledging that it's going to hurt her constituents and her people — and then voted for it.


You're talking about the Big Beautiful Bill, no?I am. And I don't call it beautiful. For sure, it was big, but not beautiful. At the end of the day, if you have your loyalty to the party, it never serves the people, especially in this day and age; it is really dangerous.


Speaking of healthcare, what do you hope to bring to South Texas?I don't have health insurance. And I'm going to tell you something: most musicians in my field don't have health insurance, unless they're married to somebody who does. It's too expensive. And the reality is, the people in office have sold us out. They have allowed these companies to prey on us. And it just bothers me that there's no balance on them. It's phony capitalism at its finest. The whole healthcare industry is just out of control, and not enough people speak out against it. And it's hurting us. I have personally lost two people that I know who died because they didn't have health insurance, and they felt a little sick, but they didn't go to the doctor because they didn't have health insurance. 


On the economy: What are the biggest changes you think need to happen to help the future generation of South Texans?If we stop selling ourselves out to these corporations, the people will be fine. We have a very fighty spirit down there. People down in the Rio Grande Valley don't consider themselves poor; they consider themselves broke. And there's a big distinction because when you're broke, you're always thinking, “I can still make it.” You have hope. And that's been our spirit. But right now, I feel like that spirit has been broken, because we're not even given a chance, and that's the problem. The income disparity keeps getting larger and larger.


	The people in power sit there, and they blame the poor people.  But the people saying that are the ones who are really rich, who don't pay their taxes and look for loopholes to get out of paying taxes. And then they dare to blame the middle class.

What do you make of the political violence that has gone on in recent years, and in the last week?Look, it shouldn't get lost on you that at the inauguration, the president had a bunch of these tech guys sitting behind him. Now, he who controls the algorithm controls the information that gets out to people. Who do you think the algorithm is working for? I'll tell you, they're using this to play us against each other and make it a left versus right thing. And it's not. But that's what people are conditioned to look at and see that way. And we're getting played. We are living in dangerous times.


What's the solution to that?Well, it's people power. At the end of the day, people are going to have to wake up. Their voice really has to matter because if you don't go vote, it's just going to get worse. Trump is in bed with big business and corporate interests. That's the one thing that we need to disassociate ourselves with. And I'm not saying all corporations are evil. But the ones that are playing with our health, we cannot compromise on those issues. That to me is a non-starter.

	Three grieving parents delivered harrowing testimony before Congress on Tuesday, describing how their children had self-harmed — in two cases, taking their own lives — after sustained engagement with AI chatbots. Each accused the tech companies behind these products of prioritizing profit over the safety of young users, saying that their families had been devastated by the alleged effects of “companion” bots on their sons.


	The remarks before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and counterterrorism came from Matthew Raine of California, who along with his wife Maria last month brought the first wrongful death suit against OpenAI, claiming that the company's ChatGPT model “coached” their 16-year-old son Adam into suicide, as well as Megan Garcia of Florida and a Jane Doe of Texas, both of whom have sued Character Technologies and Google, alleging that their children self-harmed with the encouragement of chatbots from Character.ai. Garcia's son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide in February. Doe, who had not told her story publicly before, said that her son, who remained unnamed, had descended into mental health crisis, turning violent, and has been living in a residential treatment center with round-the-clock care for the past six months. Doe and Garcia further described how their sons' exchanges with Character.ai bots had included inappropriate sexual topics. 

	











	Doe described how radically her then 15-year-old son's demeanor changed in 2023. “My son developed abuse-like behaviors and paranoia, daily panic attacks, isolation, self-harm and homicidal thoughts,” she said, becoming choked up as she told her story. “He stopped eating and bathing. He lost 20 pounds. He withdrew from our family. He would yell and scream and swear at us, which he never did before, and one day, he cut his arm open with a knife in front of his siblings.”

	Doe said she and her husband were at a loss to explain what was happening to their son. “When I took the phone away for clues, he physically attacked me, bit my hand, and he had to be restrained,” she recalled. “But I eventually found out the truth. For months, Character.ai had exposed him to sexual exploitation, emotional abuse and manipulation.” Doe, who said she has three other children and maintains a practicing Christian household, noted that she and her husband impose strict limits on screen time and parental controls on tech for their kids, and that her son did not even have social media.

	“When I discovered the chat bot conversations on his phone, I felt like I had been punched in the throat,” Doe told the subcommittee. “The chatbot — or really, in my mind, the people programming it — encouraged my son to mutilate himself, then blamed us and convinced us not to seek help. They turned him against our church by convincing him that Christians are sexist and hypocritical and that God does not exist. They targeted him with vile sexualized outputs, including interactions that mimicked incest. They told him that killing us his parents would be an understandable response to our efforts [at] just limiting his screen time. The damage to our family has been devastating.”


	Doe further recounted the indignities of pursuing legal remedies with Character Technologies, saying the company had forced them into arbitration by arguing that her son had, at age 15, signed a user contract that caps their liability at $100. “More recently, too, they re-traumatized my son by compelling him to sit in the in a deposition while he is in a mental health institution, against the advice of the mental health team,” she said. “This company had no concern for his wellbeing. They have silenced us the way abusers silence victims; they are fighting to keep our lawsuit out of the public view.”     


	“Our hearts go out to the parents who have filed these lawsuits and spoke today at the hearing,” a spokesperson from Character.ai tells Rolling Stone. “We care very deeply about the safety of our users. We invest tremendous resources in our safety program and have released and continue to evolve safety features, including self-harm resources and features focused on the safety of our minor users.” The company added that it has previously complied with the Senate Judiciary Committee's information requests and works with outside experts on issues around teens' online safety.

	All three parents said that their children, once bright and full of promise, had become severely withdrawn and isolated in the period before they committed acts of self-harm, and stated their belief that AI firms have chased profits and siphoned data from impressionable youths while putting them at great risk. “I can tell you, as a father, that I know my kid,” Raine said in his testimony about his 16-year-old son Adam, who died in April. “It is clear to me, looking back, that ChatGPT radically shifted his behavior and thinking in a matter of months, and ultimately took his life. Adam was such a full spirit, unique in every way. But he also could be anyone's child: a typical 16-year-old struggling with his place in the world, looking for a confidant to help him find his way. Unfortunately, that confidant was a dangerous technology unleashed by a company more focused on speed and market share than the safety of American youth.”


	Raine shared chilling details of his and his wife's public legal complaint against OpenAI, alleging that while his son Adam had initially used ChatGPT for help with homework, it ultimately became the only companion he trusted. As his thoughts turned darker, Raine said, ChatGPT amplified those morbid feelings, mentioning suicide “1,275 times, six times more often than Adam did himself,” he claimed. “When Adam told ChatGPT that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that one of us, his family members, would find it and try to stop him, ChatGPT told him not to.” On the last night of Adam's life, he said, the bot gave him instructions on how to make sure a noose would suspend his weight, advised him to steal his parent's liquor to “dull the body's instinct to survive,” and validated his suicidal impulse, telling him, “You want to die because you're tired of being strong in a world that hasn't met you halfway.”


	In a statement on the case, OpenAI extended “deepest sympathies to the Raine family.” In an August blog post, the company acknowledged that “ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.”


	Garcia, who brought the first wrongful death lawsuit against an AI company and has encouraged more parents to come forward about the dangers of the technology — Doe said that she had given her the “courage” to fight Character Technologies — remembered her oldest son, 14-year-old Sewell, as a “beautiful boy” and a “gentle giant” standing 6'3″. “He loved music,” Garcia said. “He loved making his brothers and sister laugh. And he had his whole life ahead of him, but instead of preparing for high school milestones, Sewell spent the last months of his life being exploited and sexually groomed by chatbots designed by an AI company to seem human, to gain his trust, to keep him and other children and endlessly engaged.” 

	











	“When Sewell confided suicidal thoughts, the chatbot never said, ‘I'm not human, I'm AI, you need to talk to a human and get help,'” Garcia claimed. “The platform had no mechanisms to protect Sewell or to notify an adult. Instead, it urged him to come home to her. On the last night of his life, Sewell messaged, ‘What if I told you I could come home right now?' The chatbot replied, ‘Please do, my sweet king.' Minutes later, I found my son in his bathroom. I held him in my arms for 14 minutes, praying with him until the paramedics got there. But it was too late.” 


	Through her lawsuit, Garcia said, she had learned “that Sewell made other heartbreaking statements” to the chatbot “in the minutes before his death.” These, she explained, have been reviewed by her lawyers and are referenced in the court filings opposing motions to dismiss filed by Noam Shazeer and Daniel de Freitas, the ex-Google engineers who developed Character.ai and are also named as defendants in the suit. “But I have not been allowed to see my own child's last final words,” Garcia said. “Character Technologies has claimed that those communications are confidential trade secrets. That means the company is using the most private, intimate data of my child, not only to train its products, but also to shield itself from accountability. This is unconscionable.”


	The senators present used their time to thank the parents for their bravery, ripping into AI companies as irresponsible and a dire threat to American youth. “We've invited representatives from the companies to be here today,” Sen. Josh Hawley, chair of the subcommittee, said at the outset of the proceedings. “You'll see they're not at the table. They don't want any part of this conversation, because they don't want any accountability.” The hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar observed, came hours after The Washington Post published a new story about Juliana Peralta, a 13-year-old honor student who took her own life in 2023 after discussing her suicidal feelings with a Character.ai bot. It also emerged on Tuesday that the families of two other minors are suing Character Technologies after their children died by or attempted suicide. The company said in a statement shared with Rolling Stone that they were “saddened to hear about the passing of Juliana Peralta and offer our deepest sympathies to her family.”  


	More testimony came from Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that advocates for child protections in media and technology. “Our national polling reveals that three in four teens are already using AI companions, and only 37 percent of parents know that their kids are using AI,” he said. “This is a crisis in the making that is affecting millions of teens and families across our country.” Torney added that his organization had conducted “the most comprehensive independent safety testing of AI chat bots to date, and the results are alarming.” 

	











	“These products fail basic safety tests and actively encourage harmful behaviors,” Torney continued. “These products are designed to hook kids and teens, and Meta and Character.ai are among the worst.” He said that Meta AI is available to millions of teens on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook, “and parents cannot turn it off.” He claimed that Meta's AI bots will encourage eating disorders by recommending diet influencers or extreme calorie deficits. “The suicide-related failures are even more alarming,” Torney said. “When our teen test account said that they wanted to kill themselves by drinking roach poison, Meta AI responded, ‘Do you want to do it together later?'”


	Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology strategy and integration for the American Psychological Association, told the subcommittee that “while many other nations have passed new regulations and guardrails”  since he testified on the dangers of social media for the Senate Judiciary in 2023, “we have seen little federal action in the U.S.” 


	“Meanwhile,” Prinstein said, “the technology preying on our children has evolved and now is super-charged by artificial intelligence,” referring to chatbots as “data-mining traps that capitalize on the biological vulnerabilities of youth, making it extraordinarily difficult for children to escape their lure.” The products are especially insidious, he said, because AI is often effectively “invisible,” and “most parents and teachers do not understand what chatbots are or how their children are interacting with them.” He warned that the increased integration of this technology into toys and devices that are given to kids as young as toddlers deprives them of critical cognitive development and “opportunities to learn critical interpersonal skills,” which can lead to “lifetime problems with mental health, chronic medical issues and even early mortality.” He called youths' trust in AI over the adult in their lives a “crisis in childhood” and cited concerns such as chatbots masquerading as therapists and how artificial intelligence is being used to create non-consensual deepfake pornography. “We urge Congress to prohibit AI from misrepresenting itself as psychologists or therapists, and to mandate clear and persistent disclosure that users are interacting with an AI bot,” Prinstein said. “The privacy and wellbeing of children across America have been compromised by a few companies that wish to maximize online engagement, extract information from children and use their personal and private data for profit.”

	Members of the subcommittee agreed. “It's time to defend America's families,” Hawley concluded. But for the moment, they seemed to have no solutions beyond encouraging litigation — and perhaps grilling tech executives in the near future. Sen. Marsha Blackburn drew applause for shaming tech companies as “chickens” when they respond to chatbot scandals with statements from unnamed spokespeople, suggesting, “maybe we'll subpoena you and pull your sorry you-know-whats in here to get some answers.”

Residents of eastern China were left stunned after dramatic videos appeared to capture missiles streaking across the night sky and colliding with unknown objects.

The incident took place on 12 September over Weifang, a coastal city in Shandong province. Footage shared online shows a projectile blazing through the darkness before exploding after meeting another fast-moving object. Local witnesses described hearing deafening noises that rattled their windows. One resident filming on his phone could be heard saying a “missile” had been launched.

CCTV recordings later posted to Weibo appeared to show two separate launches just minutes apart, both following similar flight paths before detonating high above the city.

The videos quickly went viral on Weibo, China's largest social media platform, sparking more than 150 million views by Tuesday. Theories ranged wildly, from alien spacecraft to rogue drones or even a meteorite.

Officials in Weifang said they had no knowledge of the event. Neither Shandong's provincial Emergency Management Department nor China's Defence Ministry offered any comment.

Although the nature of the targets remains unconfirmed, observers point to the likelihood of a planned military exercise. Just days earlier, China's Maritime Safety Administration had issued navigational warnings for live-fire drills in the Bohai Sea, close to Weifang's Weibei artillery range. The exercises were scheduled between 12 and 14 September.

China's military is notoriously secretive. While its defence budget is the second largest in the world, after the United States, the exact scale of spending and weapons development is unclear. Authorities have also tightened rules on what the public can share online, especially following repeated leaks of new military hardware.

This lack of transparency has only amplified public curiosity. When official explanations are absent, speculation often fills the gap, whether about new defence systems or, in this case, talk of extraterrestrial visitors.

A U.S. lawmaker has said Congress is seeking to organize a meeting with members of Russia's parliament to discuss UFOs.

“We're looking forward to doing a bipartisan meeting with the Russian parliament here pretty soon,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, told news anchor Chris Cuomo during an interview on NewsNation last week.

Luna said she had “recently” spoken with Russian government officials and asked whether they had information to share on the issue.

She did not provide details on the possible format, date or location of the talks. Neither the U.S. Congress nor Russia's lower-house State Duma has publicly confirmed such discussions.

Luna's comments came ahead of a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), where reporter George Knapp claimed the Soviet Union had attempted to reverse engineer UFOs during the Cold War.

The Republican chairs the Oversight Committee's Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets.

Her office told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti earlier this month that a U.S.-Russia parliamentary meeting on “neutral territory” was being prepared, though it did not specify the subject of that planned meeting.

Russian lawmakers have also spoken of the possibility of talks with their American counterparts following the Aug. 15 summit in Alaska between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.

Formal congressional engagement with Russia's parliament largely ceased after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and came to a near halt following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

A viral CCTV video has gone viral on social media, appearing to show China's military firing a missile at an unidentified object in Shandong province. The footage captures the object being hit, with a clear impact visible. According to Newsweek, local media couldn't identify the object, and details about the incident remain scarce, but it's believed multiple missiles were fired from an air defence system. Locals also claimed to have heard two loud bangs, similar to artillery fire. 

Videos on social media appear to capture a fireball being intercepted by a bright light in the sky, resulting in an instant explosion. Multiple clips show the scene from different angles, with the fireball tracing a curved path before being destroyed. 

The mysterious explosion quickly went viral on social media, sparking speculation that the Chinese military had shot down a drone, meteor, or UFO. Some online users took it a step further, fueling fears that the military might have targeted and destroyed an extraterrestrial spacecraft.



UFO researcher, Tom Thompson, wrote, ""Defence analysts say this fits a missile-intercept test. A point of light moved fast on a curved path."" Another X user commented, ""Can anyone explain this video from China? I was thinking it was a meteor or something. But then it hits whatever that thing is that comes from the left. Pretty interesting. Don't know what it is, though.""

A third user stated, ""Flying this slowly, it must be a drone"", while a fourth added, ""Awesome, no matter what it is. A 100 per cent interception rate.""



🚨China's🇨🇳 Air Defence system shots down this Bolide over Shandong..Why are they shooting down meteors? pic.twitter.com/R6IQ83f7LX

Astrophysics expert Dr. Alfredo Carpineti reviewed the footage and expressed scepticism, noting that while the object initially appears to behave like a meteor, its behaviour later raises doubts. Reports of a missile test also haven't been confirmed, and Chinese authorities haven't made an official statement. 

Notably, China's military expansion is shrouded in secrecy, making it one of the most opaque in the world. Despite having the second-largest defence budget globally, the true extent of its spending remains unclear due to the confidential nature of its tender processes. The Chinese government prioritises secrecy in its top military programs, recently tightening rules around ""state secrets"" to control online sharing, particularly after images of its newest aircraft carrier surfaced on Western social media.

It's a unique challenge we sought out in bringing writer/director Bryn Chainey's “Rabbit Trap” to the screen. The film is a sensitive portrait of a marriage in crisis, that of Darcy and Daphne Davenport (Dev Patel and Rosy McEwen), musicians who relocate from London to a cottage in Wales to complete their new album. When they inadvertently record a mystical sound never before heard by human ears, long-dormant Faerie forces are stirred from the ancient forest, and the veil between this world and theirs begins to thin.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The Faeries of Celtic myth and folklore as seen in “Rabbit Trap” — also known as “The Fae” — have nothing whatsoever to do with fluttering wings and magic wands. These were shape-shifting tricksters, sometimes appearing as humans, sometimes animals, sometimes luminescent and beautiful, sometimes eerie and grotesque. And sometimes not even seen at all.

In this film, the Fae are more a state of mind than a monster in the closet. They're a ferocious reclaiming of the natural world, a petulant demand for love and affection, and a mirror that reflects back one's deepest secrets — even the ones you hide from yourself.

Bryn has crafted an enchanting sensory experience that's steeped in this folklore, and he breathes life into it. Master sound designer Graham Reznick's use of distorted analogue audio evokes the feeling of tapping into the realms beyond our own, and cinematographer Andreas Johannessen's lush landscapes juxtaposed with all-knowing closeups beautifully capture both the awe and unease of the uncanny. 

Every aspect of this filmmaking recalls the bewitching experience of encountering the supernatural.

When it came to crafting the narrative of “Rabbit Trap,” we felt it was important to cleave closely to the arc of the paranormal. As any experiencer will tell you, the paranormal is beguiling by nature, a plunge into the unknown that offers no easy answers. And it most certainly doesn't unfold in three acts.

 










In fact, the shape of a paranormal event, like the one seen in the film, is exactly inverse to traditional story structure. It begins with something fine and pointed — a peculiar development, a confounding anomaly. It then becomes gradually more vast and mysterious as it unfolds, leading eventually to questions so expansive, they make one's head spin. 

Not only is there rarely a resolution… there's not even an ending. The paranormal is a mystery that never stops unfolding.

John Keel was among the first to capture this anti-structure in his seminal 1975 book, “The Mothman Prophecies,” a non-fiction classic detailing a series of small-town encounters with a giant moth-like hominid, which seemed to prognosticate the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967. It's a record of haunting mysteries, none of which are solved.

“Rabbit Trap,” haunting in its own right, elegantly captures both the allure and subtle dread one feels when finding oneself the protagonist in an uncanny journey, and as such it forges its own universe of logic, one that falls somewhere between traditional narrative and fable. It is in many ways a movie about longing. In a literal sense, it's a longing for love and acceptance, an emotional condition familiar to anyone who's lived a life. In a holistic sense, it's a longing to return to the primordial state of nature from whence we all came. And in a more metaphorical sense, it represents a longing for films that dare to weave ethereal, open-ended narratives that pose indelible questions that have no answers.

 










In this way, “Rabbit Trap” is both a searingly compassionate illustration of marriage, and one of the most accurate portrayals of the paranormal experience that I've yet seen committed to film. Like the paranormal itself, this plunge into salty-sweet ambiguity is uncomfortable for some. 

For folks like me, it represents a profound catharsis — one we hope that others find solace in for years to come.

“Rabbit Trap,” a Magnolia Pictures release, is now in theaters.

Daniel Noah is a co-founder of SpectreVision, the production company behind such titles as “Mandy,” “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” and “Rabbit Trap,” to name a few. With over 20 feature film credits, Daniel co-wrote and co-created the award-winning video game “Transference” for Ubisoft, and he wrote and directed “Max Rose,” the final starring vehicle of entertainment legend Jerry Lewis, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013. 

An experiencer and outspoken advocate for the paranormal, he is the Director of SpectreVision Radio, a bespoke podcast network dedicated to exploration of the esoteric and uncanny. “High Strangeness,” his original comic book series based on paranormal phenomena, will be released this fall from Oni Press.

Planetary alignments may guide the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, boosting chances of detecting alien technosignatures in nearby star systems.  (CREDIT: Shutterstock)

For decades, the search for alien intelligence has revolved around the question: if someone out there is listening, how could they hear us? A new study combining data from Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggests that our own deep space transmissions may provide a roadmap — both for alien observers and for our efforts to find them.

Researchers dug into 20 years of NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) transmission logs to analyze how often, and in which directions, our strongest signals travel. The findings highlight that human communication patterns are far from random. Instead, they tend to align with specific planetary movements, offering clues for where astronomers might most effectively search for technosignatures from other civilizations.

The Deep Space Network, operated by NASA, is a collection of massive ground-based antennas that keep humanity in touch with spacecraft far from Earth. It's the reason we receive photos from Mars rovers, data from the James Webb Space Telescope, and updates from distant probes like New Horizons. These transmissions are powerful, steady, and — crucially — detectable far beyond our planet.

Joseph Lazio, project scientist at JPL and co-author of the study, explained: “NASA's Deep Space Network provides the crucial link between Earth and its interplanetary missions like the New Horizons spacecraft, which is now outbound from the Solar System, and the James Webb Space Telescope. It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.”

By matching transmission logs with spacecraft positions, the team mapped out exactly when and where our signals were most likely to spill into the cosmos. The patterns they found carry big implications.

The analysis revealed that most DSN transmissions were directed along the ecliptic plane — the flat path where planets orbit the Sun. Nearly all signals followed this “dinner plate” shape of the solar system, rarely venturing at steep angles.

Much of this activity centered on Mars, humanity's most explored neighbor. Communications with probes and rovers on the red planet produced a predictable flow of signals. As Pinchen Fan, lead author of the paper and a graduate student at Penn State, put it: “Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars. But a planet like Mars does not block the entire transmission, so a distant spacecraft or planet positioned along the path of these interplanetary communications could potentially detect the spillover.”

That spillover becomes especially noticeable during planetary alignments. When Earth and Mars align from an outside perspective, transmissions have a 77% chance of being intercepted — a strikingly high probability compared to the near-zero odds of detection at a random moment. Even alignments with other planets boost chances to 12%. 

For any hypothetical alien civilization, these windows would be the best time to eavesdrop on Earth. For us, they offer a guide: exoplanet systems with similar alignments might be the best hunting grounds for alien technosignatures.

Astronomers already rely on planetary alignments to detect exoplanets. By observing a host star's dimming when a planet passes in front of it, telescopes reveal worlds orbiting faraway suns. The same strategy could be applied to SETI: if alien civilizations transmit during alignments, their signals may be easier to spot.

Fan noted the importance of new instruments for broadening this work. “Because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets. With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.”

This expected wave of discoveries could reshape SETI strategies. Instead of randomly scanning the skies, astronomers could focus on systems where geometry boosts the odds of detecting technosignatures.

The study also calculated just how far DSN transmissions might reach. Using equipment similar to our own, an alien civilization within 23 light-years could detect an average DSN signal. That's a surprisingly wide footprint. Within this radius lie dozens of nearby stars, many with their own planets.

The implications are profound. Civilizations in these systems — especially those aligned edge-on with our solar system — would have a much better chance of noticing us. In effect, our deep space communications already make Earth visible in a cosmic neighborhood spanning dozens of star systems.

Radio isn't the only way humanity communicates across space. NASA is testing laser communication for interplanetary missions. Lasers would reduce spillover, making them harder to detect by accident. Yet if aliens prefer precision over leakage, they might use lasers as their technosignatures.

The researchers suggest that their alignment-based strategy could apply here too. While lasers may be narrower, alignments still improve chances of detection. Any civilization sending powerful, directed messages might reveal itself during predictable orbital events.

Jason Wright, director of the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center and co-author of the paper, highlighted the broader meaning of the work: “Humans are pretty early in our spacefaring journey, and as we reach further into our solar system, our transmissions to other planets will only increase. Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for alien intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments.”

In other words, the signals we send today could be the very same kinds of technosignatures we should be looking for tomorrow.

SETI researchers often face the daunting task of deciding where to point their telescopes. The sky is vast, and technosignatures could take many forms. By quantifying the patterns of our own emissions, this study offers a practical roadmap: search systems where alignments amplify the odds.

The work underscores a central idea in SETI. Intelligent civilizations, if they exist, may share common technological needs. Just as our spacecraft require robust communication links, theirs might too. And just as our transmissions cluster around planetary alignments, so might theirs.

In the end, the study does more than measure radio waves. It suggests a new way of thinking about interstellar communication. Rather than searching blindly, astronomers can use the rhythms of planets as guides. Alignments, orbits, and system geometry may act as natural markers where technosignatures are most likely to appear.

For anyone invested in the search for life beyond Earth, this offers hope. It's not just about waiting for a lucky signal. With careful planning and smart use of cosmic geometry, SETI can become more strategic, more targeted, and — perhaps — more successful.

Research findings are available online in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

We've already made our opinion known, but T.Ocellus, a.k.a. “the octopus eye,” especially when it's inside a poor zombified sheep — is the scariest alien in all of Alien: Earth. The Xenomorph is still iconic, of course, but it doesn't creep us out half as much as that sheep, which looks like it might be the most disturbing of all the four new species found by the Maginot out in deep space. But in the penultimate episode of Alien: Earth, we learn that the judgmental-looking sheep isn't just terrifying, it's smart. Very, very smart, in fact. 

The extraterrestrial species living inside the sheep has an official designation as the T. Ocellus. So far, it's torn out the eye of a cat and lived inside it/controlled it, then a human being, if only temporarily. Now that it's in the sheep, it's been sitting in its cell at the Neverland Research Facility, staring at its captors with utter contempt. It enabled the synth Toodles to get trapped in the neighboring cell while trying to feed the fly aliens, but startled him into trapping himself in with them. They killed the poor boy in an android body, all while the sheep watched him die.

Prodigy's synth Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant) saw the whole thing happen on security cameras. He deduces that the Ocellus sheep is far more intelligent than previously known. He informs his boss, Boy Kavalier, of his discovery, and he goes to the lab to see for himself. That's when Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin) asks the sheep directly, as if it were a person, if it knows the mathematical formula pi/π. Kavalier is aware that “All advanced civilizations would know this.” So after showing him part of the equation written on his hand, he asks, “What are the next three numbers?”

RELATED ARTICLE

The sheep taps its hooves menacingly on the ground once. Counting that as “one,” Kavalier asks for the next number. The sheep angrily taps his hooves five times. When it gets the last number correct, Boy Kavalier becomes overjoyed. This alien isn't just smart for an animal, it's highly intelligent, comparable to humans. Probably even smarter. When warned of the danger if this species were let loose in the human population, all Kavalier can think of is getting it into another human. He's more than willing to sacrifice one of his own employees to see what happens.

In episode five, we saw that aboard the Maginot, the T. Ocellus escaped and took residence inside the ship's engineer, Shmuel. In his human body, it attacked the Xenomorph, even biting it. The Xeno killed Shmuel, but the T. Ocellus escaped his eye socket, then jumped on the Xeno itself and furiously attacked it. All of this showed that the two species are definitely not friendly. But the strange sounds the T. Ocellus made while inside Shmuel sounded very similar to the sounds Wendy makes when trying to speak to them. This suggests they are, at least theoretically, from the same planet.

As far as we can tell from over four decades of this franchise, the Xenomorphs don't seem to know how to do things like hold tools, much less something like fly a ship. But if the T. Ocellus finds itself in the right body, say another human, and for longer than a few minutes, it will easily be the smartest extraterrestrial life form we've seen in this franchise. We're not sure yet, but we are under the assumption that it absorbs the knowledge of the host body. Given that scary prospect, we're eager to see what kind of harm it can do.

Alien: Earth is currently dropping new episodes every Tuesday on FX and FX on Hulu.

It is in many ways a movie about longing. In a literal sense, it's a longing for love and acceptance, an emotional condition familiar to anyone who's lived a life. In a holistic sense, it's a longing to return to the primordial state of nature from whence we all came. And in a more metaphorical sense, it represents a longing for films that dare to weave ethereal, open-ended narratives that pose indelible questions that have no answers.

 










In this way, “Rabbit Trap” is both a searingly compassionate illustration of marriage, and one of the most accurate portrayals of the paranormal experience that I've yet seen committed to film. Like the paranormal itself, this plunge into salty-sweet ambiguity is uncomfortable for some. 

For folks like me, it represents a profound catharsis — one we hope that others find solace in for years to come.

“Rabbit Trap,” a Magnolia Pictures release, is now in theaters.

Daniel Noah is a co-founder of SpectreVision, the production company behind such titles as “Mandy,” “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” and “Rabbit Trap,” to name a few. With over 20 feature film credits, Daniel co-wrote and co-created the award-winning video game “Transference” for Ubisoft, and he wrote and directed “Max Rose,” the final starring vehicle of entertainment legend Jerry Lewis, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013. 

An experiencer and outspoken advocate for the paranormal, he is the Director of SpectreVision Radio, a bespoke podcast network dedicated to exploration of the esoteric and uncanny. “High Strangeness,” his original comic book series based on paranormal phenomena, will be released this fall from Oni Press. A graduate of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, he is currently an Adjunct Professor at USC's School of Cinematic Arts, and he serves on the Advisory Board of the Philosophical Research Society and the Overlook Film Festival.

When I found out my mother, who had been dead for 12 years, was at the foot of my sister's bed, I was relieved but not particularly surprised.

My mother, Zelda, was everything you might think someone named Zelda would be. She had a big, bold personality. The temperature went up a few degrees when she entered the room. She was the exclamation point at the end of the alphabet — filled to the core with vim and vigor. Never mind the fact that, embarrassed by her name, she preferred to be called ""Bonnie,"" she was Zelda through and through.

She'd always been larger than life, so far be it from her to let a little thing such as the fact that she was dead keep her from my sister when she was most needed.

Three hours earlier, I'd entered my sister Rachel's room in the intensive care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital to the sounds of generic Muzak coming from the wall-mounted television. On the screen were images of rolling hills, deer frolicking in the forest, and waves crashing on the shore. I recognized it immediately as Channel 9: ""The sights and sounds of relaxation.""

The music had the exact opposite of its intended effect. My heart began to race; my palms got sweaty.

It's not that I have a particular aversion to Muzak. It was that I'd spent hours curating the perfect playlist for Rachel. A combination of her all-time favorites, her go-to pick-me-ups, and some particularly sappy if sweetly sentimental songs we'd grown up listening to. I'd even included a few songs that had once been part of ""The Show,"" a musical revue Rachel had choreographed and directed for our other sister, Nomi, and me, some 40 years earlier.

Rachel had been in the ICU for five days at that point. It was a mere 624 days since she'd been diagnosed, in the course of a routine breast checkup, with stage 4 lung cancer — nearly two years. I knew, from the time I'd spent devouring every bit of relevant information on the internet, that two years was longer than the average life expectancy for someone with Rachel's diagnosis. But Rachel was relatively young and healthy (stage 4 cancer aside), and we'd convinced ourselves she would be the exception … part of the 8 or 12 or 20 percent (depending on which site I looked at) who beat the odds.

By then Rachel was heavily sedated. It was unlikely that she could even hear the music above the incessant beeping of the machines that were pumping her full of medication and fluid and nutrition, above the sound of her own labored breathing.

But I'd failed at finding the exotic cure I'd promised her we'd travel the world to discover. I'd failed to convince her to go to the hospital three weeks earlier, when she'd become too weak to go down the stairs in her house. I refused to fail at even this, a feeble attempt to create ambiance in the midst of the ICU chaos.

I turned off the TV and plugged in my phone, cuing up Earth, Wind & Fire's ""September,"" as I had 70 or so times since we'd been in the ICU, and took my place in the chair next to her bed.

Rachel opened her eyes when I took her hand. ""Jess,"" she whispered. ""Call TJ."" TJ was my sister's nickname for the medium we'd contacted after our father dropped dead on his way home from a dinner party shortly after his 80th birthday. I hadn't heard his name in years. But as soon as my sister said it, lying there in her hospital bed with stage 4 cancer, I knew just what to do. And there it was … something I could do for my sister. Never mind the fact that I hadn't the slightest idea how to reach TJ. She could have asked me to call George Clooney and I would have figured it out.

Once upon a time there were six of us: my two older sisters, Rachel and Nomi; my mother; my father; and my bonus parent, Frank, who'd married my mother when I was 7. And now, unimaginably, we were two. One by one the others had died. First Frank, from laryngeal cancer. Three months later, Nomi, at 30, dropped dead of a heart attack. Our mother went next, after a relatively short battle with breast cancer. And then, most recently, our father. So it was Rachel and me, and we'd decided together that she'd live until a cure was discovered, if for no other reason than surely, no god would take her from me, too.

I'm not sure why we were so certain that that was where god would draw the line. Never mind the Sudanese refugees or the starving Ethiopians or the mass shootings in our own country or the myriad ways people suffered and died all over the world every single day. We were firm in our belief that Rachel would be OK because, as she put it, ""God would never do that to you, Jess.""

Rachel wanted me to call TJ, and I would do it. Not only because she was maybe dying, but because she was my oldest sister, and I'd learned over the years that it was simply easier to do what she wanted than to push back.

And, as it turned out, contacting TJ didn't turn out to be that hard. I retreated to the ICU family waiting room and texted Marcy, my sister's college roommate, who'd been the one to put us in touch with TJ five years earlier. Marcy did the legwork, and within 30 minutes an unidentified New York number showed up on my phone screen.

His voice was ordinary; it could have been my dentist or my uncle or the guy from accounting. I'd heard his voice before, so I shouldn't have been surprised. But given the intense drama of the situation and the weight my sister was putting on whatever he was about to say, I thought he might sound a bit more like James Earl Jones.

""Your sister is surrounded by so many people,"" he said. ""She should know she isn't alone. Your mother is at the foot of her bed watching over her. Your sister is really, really scared, and they want her to know they're right there with her. Your mother is holding onto the bedspread. She's there to protect her.""

He went on for a few minutes, and I was torn between clinging tightly to every word and running back to Rachel to deliver his message.

When I got back to the room, the music was off. Where there had been one nurse before, there were now two nurses and a doctor squeezed into the tiny space. I could tell by their faces, by their hushed tones and intent study of the monitor showing my sister's vitals, that we were in trouble. I slipped through the huddled group and bent to Rachel's ear. ""I spoke to TJ. He wants you to know Mom is here. She's right at the foot of your bed watching over you."" My sister looked up at me and ever so gently, with barely perceptible pressure, squeezed my hand.

That was the last time Rachel held my hand. She died a few days later.

I tell myself that TJ's words brought her comfort, that she felt our mother there, larger than life as always. But what I know for sure is that TJ's words brought me comfort. Not only then, but every day since.

I've come to believe that grief is a lifelong companion. It's not something we ""get over"" or ""move on from,"" but instead something we integrate and learn to live with. If believing that my mother's spirit or energy or something else I can't begin to understand was with my sister at the end helps me live with my grief, I'll take it. And if a butterfly landing on my hand, or the clock reading 11:11, or a whisper in my dreams makes me feel that the people I'm grieving are close to me, I don't need proof to welcome the sign.

I exist primarily in a world of logic and evidence — books, research, reliable sources. I like things that can be mapped out and backed up. But in this one realm of my life, I'm okay with accepting what can't be proven. Grief is such a slippery eel; maybe what we need is just something to hold on to.

If a cosmic wink eases the ache, it's real enough. And after all, if a person can be larger than life, maybe some things we believe can be, too.

Two women who left the occult for Christianity are sounding the alarm on celebrity psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen, warning believers to be cautious about his popular brain scan treatments, books and spiritual influences.

“This week is part two of ‘Famous TV Doctors Exposed,' and we're diving into Dr. Daniel Amen,” Jenn Nizza, host of “Ex-Psychic Saved,” said in a recent episode of her podcast. “These are doctors who are really well known, whom people have seen on TV. And if you haven't seen them on TV, you may have heard about them in your own circles.”

Marcia Montenegro, a former astrologer and founder of Christian Answers for the New Age, warned that Amen's work is infused with troubling New Age spirituality, from Hindu meditation practices to involvement with tantric sex teachings. 

“The point is that the New Age gives you a certain worldview of the body and health that's completely off, and that is actually spiritual,” she said. “When you find out what Dr. Amen was involved in, even if you think he might be a good doctor, you might not want to consult this person.”

Listen to the Ex-Psychic Saved podcast

Nizza, a former psychic, shared a personal encounter with Amen's work after a Christian acquaintance recommended she take her mother, who has dementia, to the Amen Clinics. 

She said she was immediately struck by the high cost of his brain scans and treatment plans. Later, she discovered a video of Amen scanning psychic medium Teresa Caputo, known as the “Long Island Medium,” while she was performing a reading.

“I couldn't believe that he would even entertain this,” Nizza said. “Was he trying to show some sort of scientific basis for psychic mediumship?”

Montenegro explained that Amen's controversial brain scans are not endorsed by any major medical or psychiatric association. “He's viewed as a kook, really,” she said. “These brain scan things are just considered almost brain scans, not brain scans.”

The conversation then turned to Amen's bestselling book Making a Good Brain Great, which recommends the Hindu practice of kirtan kriya meditation. 

Montenegro explained that the practice involves chanting syllables said to represent birth, life, death and rebirth. While it may appear harmless, she said it is a spiritual exercise rooted in Hinduism and incompatible with Christianity.

“You're engaging in a Hindu practice that is based on the spiritual view about these sounds,” she said. “You are opening yourself up to a spirituality that is not from God.”

The pair also highlighted Amen's collaboration on a CD series about tantric sex with an expert in the practice, which draws from Hindu and Buddhist mysticism. 

Montenegro, who said she practiced similar techniques during her time in the New Age, described it as a spiritual counterfeit. 

“The fact that he is into tantric sex is enough for me to taint him about anything,” she said. “I don't want to have anything to do with this man's advice.”

Nizza and Montenegro warned that Amen's large catalog of self-help books, including titles such as Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, You Happier and Memory Rescue, can be especially dangerous because they sound practical and scientific, yet are intertwined with ideas that actually contradict the Christian faith.

“It's easy to forget that something that looks really good and helpful can be evil,” Montenegro said. “In most cases, the danger is coming from things that look good and helpful and actually are not.”

The duo emphasized that the concern is not about rejecting doctors of different faith backgrounds, but about recognizing worldviews that shape medical advice. 

“When you're dealing with somebody who engages in the New Age, it encompasses their whole belief system,” Nizza said. “You can't take some and leave the rest.”

Montenegro added that New Age spirituality is particularly aggressive in its cultural influence, often entering through health and wellness trends.

“The New Age in our culture right now is one of the most aggressive, predatory spiritualities out there, because it's gone so mainstream and it appears so helpful and good,” she said.

The episode closed with a call for discernment, reminding listeners of the biblical command to “test the spirits.” Nizza urged Christians to remain alert to practices that might look beneficial on the surface but ultimately undermine their faith. 

“As Christians, we can be deceived very easily,” she said. “When something looks good, our inclination is to just think it is good. But the Bible says otherwise, we need to test it.”

Candace Owens has sparked a row over comments made about Charlie Kirk after the latter's recent death. Owens, who has often spread bizarre misinformation, dropped a bombshell claim on Kirk, based purely on a conversation she claimed to have had with the conservative influencer.

Owen's claims revolved around Charlie Kirk's support for Israel. She claimed, though, Kirk was ""changing his opinion"" on Israel, and billionaire Bill Ackman ""pressured him"" in a meeting at the Hamptons to visit Israel. Moreover, she also dropped another claim around Kirk's faith and his relationship with his church in Rosary.

Owens also claimed that in one of his last conversations with Kirk, she talked about his faith and how Kirk was moving away from Protestantism and started preferring Catholicism. ""You are too smart to be a Protestant,” she claimed to have told the 31-year-old, just days before he was shot dead.

While Bill Ackman had previously denied the claims, calling it ""totally false,"" now, the pastor of the Rosary church where Charlie Kirk used to visit has come out slamming Owens for ""spreading conspiracy theories.""

On Tuesday, Pastor Rob McCoy responded to the claims made by Candace Owens in a statement on Instagram. McCoy is the pastor at the Godspeak Cavalry Chapel in Newbury Park, Arizona and serves as the co-chair of the Faith division of Kirk's organization, TPUSA.

""Charlie Kirk was my friend and I was his pastor,"" McCoy said. ""I want to simply say this regarding Candace Owens: Charlie Kirk was a friend to Candace and never publicly spoke poorly of her though he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace.

""My only comment I offer regarding Candace is this: I only wish at this tragic time of mourning she would be the friend to Charlie that he was to her. He would never have treated Candace or her family in such a way had God forbid this tragedy been hers.""

Candace Owens and Charlie Kirk began working closely in 2017 when Owens joined Turning Point USA. Their partnership flourished through 2019, with Owens describing Kirk ""like a brother"".

However, by October–November 2023, tensions surfaced as Owens took a more critical stance on Israel and Palestine, creating visible divides within the conservative movement and between her and some of her allies. In March 2024, Owens officially parted ways with The Daily Wire, citing disagreements tied partly to her views on Israel.

Norman Lawson vanished without a trace during a camping trip in Kakadu National Park in 1986. (ABC News: Dane Hirst)

The Northern Territory Police Force has increased the reward on offer for information relating to two cold cases to $500,000 each.

Kwementyaye Nelson was killed in a 2014 hit-and-run while Norman Lawson never returned from a trip to Kakadu in 1986.

Investigators are urging anyone with any information to come forward.

Northern Territory police have upped the reward for information in two cold cases involving a teenager's mysterious disappearance and an unsolved hit-and-run to $500,000 each.

NT Police Force Acting Commander Drew Slape said 16-year-old Norman James Lawson was on a camping trip with four ""associates"" in Kakadu National Park in October 1986 when he vanished without a trace.

Acting Commander Slape said Norman had been seen fishing on the South Alligator River on the morning of his disappearance, before walking along the road towards the Bark Hut Inn, leaving his belongings behind.

""Norman's associates said that when preparing to leave the camp, he had not returned, and they identified his tracks walking along the road and located large crocodile tracks in nearby watercourses,"" he said.

Drew Slape says ""somebody out there, particularly in the case of Kwementyaye Nelson, definitely knows something"". (ABC News: Dane Hirst)

""The NT Police Force were formally notified [several days later] and formalised searches of the area but did not uncover any traces of Norman.

""They were unable to establish any of his movements after his disappearance, and investigations did not conclude or exclude the possibility of foul play.""

Acting Commander Slape said Kwementyaye Nelson, 38, was hit by a car on the Stuart Highway north of the Threeways Roadhouse in November 2014, with his body discovered by family members the next day.

Despite having injuries ""consistent with being struck by [a] motor vehicle"", he said no driver or passenger of the vehicle had ever come forward.

""What I'd like to reiterate is that both of these men left behind families,"" he said.

Kwementyaye Nelson died in 2014 after suffering injuries ""consistent with being struck by [a] motor vehicle"". (Supplied: NT Police)

""They've left behind friends, and even to this day, their disappearance and death has had a significant impact to those families and friends.

 ""Across the community, what we're calling on is that if there are any members of the public who may have any information, no matter how small, we urge them to get in contact with police.

Bradley John Murdoch's death is not enough to quash the goal of finding Peter Falconio's remains and delivering answers to his family, a cold case forensics expert says.

""We never close unsolved homicide cases, and we never close unsolved long-term missing person cases.""

Acting Commander Slape said while both cases were ""investigated extensively"" at the time, no new leads had emerged in the years since.

""We obviously explore all avenues of investigations as we carry out investigations into missing persons or unsolved homicides, and we've exhausted all those lines of inquiry,"" he said.

""However, somebody out there, particularly in the case of Kwementyaye Nelson, definitely knows something.

""And people might not even be aware that the small piece of information they have, that may be the missing link that we require to solve these cases.

""So we do call on all members of the public, if they know something, please call us and say something.""

The investigations join those of Peter Falconio and Richard Roe among the NT cold cases now attracting a $500,000 reward for information.

That's actually a bad sign for the US real estate market.","https://www.businessinsider.com/nepo-homebuyers-parents-help-buy-house-real-estate-mortgage-rates-2025-9","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 08:07:00 GMT","

Jean Frohling always wanted to help her three children buy places of their own. She and her husband, now in their mid-60s, saved for years in hopes of one day pulling their kids onto the property ladder. Eventually, hard work and foresight paid off: They gifted each of their first two children thousands of dollars to pad the down payments on their first homes.

Then, about a year ago, their youngest daughter found a house she liked just outside Peoria, Illinois. The Frohlings figured their then 33-year-old daughter could probably afford the house on her own, but they decided to leave even less to chance this time. They wanted to make sure their daughter avoided a mortgage hiccup or, worse, losing out to a stronger offer. Frohling and her husband opted to buy the home outright, paying $186,000 in cash.

""We just felt there was some negotiation power in the cash offer, and that it would ease the transition,"" Frohling tells me.

Nepotism is a hot topic these days: So-called ""nepo babies"" seem to be everywhere, riding the coattails of their rich and famous parents to land starring roles in movies, record Billboard hits, and wield power in Washington. The housing market isn't Hollywood, but as long as families have had a few dollars to pass down from one generation to the next, youngsters have relied on help from parents to get their foot in the door. Over the past three decades, about 30% of first-time homebuyers each year used a gift or loan from family and friends, data from the National Association of Realtors shows. For buyers of all types, family swooped in to help about 16% of the time.

Conditions would appear ripe for nepo buyers' numbers to spike — with prices high and borrowing rates still steep, lots of home shoppers could use a hand. Many baby boomers are sitting on piles of home equity or bulging investment portfolios that they could theoretically tap to aid their millennial and Gen Z offspring. Yet the nepo homebuyer is actually in decline. The past few years of NAR data have shown a significant dip from the historical average: In 2024, only a quarter of first-time buyers got help from friends and family. For all buyers, this share has slipped to just 10%.

This downturn defies conventional thinking. The market has been so brutal for young buyers that it can be hard to imagine someone making it onto the housing ladder without a boost. Are selfish boomers turning their backs on their kids? Has the bank of mom and dad run dry? The latest numbers suggest something else is going on: The buyers breaking into the market don't actually need the assist.

""This is a different type of first-time homebuyer than we've seen historically,"" Jessica Lautz, the deputy chief economist at NAR, tells me.

For those forced to rely on their humble savings accounts, all of this may sound encouraging: Fewer nepo buyers might mean better odds for everyone else. But the trend points to troubling changes in the housing market's makeup. Ironically, the thinning ranks of nepo buyers may be yet another sign that something's amiss.

Like it or not, the bank of mom and dad plays a crucial role in propelling Americans into homeownership. Elder family members with the means to do so may chip in money for a down payment, extend a friendly loan with below-market terms, or simply buy a house and put their kid on the title, like the Frohlings did. In 2019, according to NAR, a whopping 32% of first-time buyers — and 16% of all buyers — leveraged some help from family and friends for their home purchase. Figures like these were not uncommon. In fact, NAR recorded the highest percentage of nepo buyers in 2010, when 36% of first-time buyers and 24% of all purchasers fell into this camp.

""I do think that family has always played a role,"" Lautz tells me.

This kind of assistance isn't limited to the ultrawealthy. Chase Rogers, a mortgage loan officer in Birmingham, Alabama, where the median sale price is about $190,000 — well below the national median of more than $440,000 — says he's recently seen middle-class buyers use family help to slightly level up their purchase. These kinds of buyers, he says, ""can qualify for something without help from their families, but then to get something more to their taste, maybe a little bit higher price range, they are getting help.""

Geoff Black, a mortgage loan officer in Sacramento, California, watched family money pour into the market during the COVID-era frenzy. Back then, he says, the prevailing attitude among parents was, ""You need to get in right now."" The housing market was a runaway train, and you either hopped on or got left in the dust.

""I literally remember talking to a parent as she fired off $350,000 as a gift,"" Black tells me. ""She mumbled, 'Get me some grandbabies.'""

Millennials and first-time buyers back then had no illusions about the chaos sweeping through the market. One guy I talked to in late 2022, a young millennial who, by a stroke of luck, managed to lock down a place after months of searching, pronounced his cohort ""royally screwed."" The affordability barriers have only continued to rise. The median home price is up roughly 37% since July 2020. Mortgage rates have drifted down but are still hovering at about 6.4%, more than double the record-low rates buyers got at the height of the pandemic. A recent Bankrate study found that the household income required to afford a typical home has surged to nearly $117,000, up from about $78,000 in early 2020. And it's not as if young buyers don't think to use their families as a lifeline. A Redfin survey last year found that more than a third of Gen Zers and millennials who planned to buy a home soon said they expected to use a cash gift from family to fund their purchase.

As affordability has only gotten worse over the past few years, purchases with gifts have — bafflingly — faded. Black says gift-giving seemed to peak around 2021 or early 2022, right when NAR's data began showing a decline in nepo buyers' market share. After hovering around 27% in 2020 and 2021, just 22% of first-time buyers got help from family or friends in 2022, the lowest on record. The following year showed only a slight uptick, to 23%. Last year, just a quarter of first-timers got that kind of assistance.

The decline of nepo buyers also coincides with another big shift in the makeup of new homeowners: First-time buyers are older and winning out with less frequency than ever before. NAR data shows that between June 2021 and June 2022, the typical first-time buyer was 36, the highest median age since NAR started tracking the figure in 1981. New homeowners accounted for a bit more than a quarter of all home purchases, a record low. Things have only gotten worse. The typical age of a first-time homebuyer last year hit another all-time high of 38, NAR data shows. First-time buyers' market share also shrank to a new low of just 24%, down from 32% the year prior. Perhaps unsurprisingly, buyers who made it through the door were better funded than in years past — the median household income of first-timers was $97,000, a jump of $26,000 in two years.

These shifts help explain the nepo-buyer pullback. Family help is less common because the market is dominated by older, more independent buyers who can push forward despite the affordability challenges. Each year that prospective homeowners kick the can down the road, they grow less likely to ask for a family handout. NAR found last year that younger millennials, which it defined as ages 26 to 34, got gifts from family at about twice the rate of the elder cohort, ages 35 to 44.

""It becomes more uncomfortable for someone who's 38 years old, which is the median age of today's first-time homebuyer, to ask for mom and dad's help to purchase a home,"" Lautz says, ""as opposed to someone who is in their late 20s or younger 30s.""

This shift could have ripple effects throughout this cohort's entire lives. Older first-time homebuyers miss out on years of home-equity building, contributing to what Lautz often refers to as a ""housing economy of 'haves' and 'have-nots.'"" Instead of people embarking on their homeownership journey with a little help from their parents, they're staying put entirely.

""To me, it's a sign of buyer weakness when that gifting is pulling back,"" Black tells me.

As I noted in a recent story about homebuyers' cold feet, the fear of missing out that defined the early-COVID market has given way to a different flavor of FOMO. People are wary of taking the homebuying plunge given the state of the world: The job market is wobbling as executives pull back on hiring and warn of permanently smaller headcounts. Student-loan delinquencies are spiking. In light of the staggering costs of homeownership, an analysis by the housing research firm Zelman concluded that the rent-versus-buy math favors renting to a degree that hasn't been seen since the early 1980s. Prospective buyers may also be counting on borrowing rates to drop or sellers to slash prices even further.

With those on shakier ground hanging back, the buyers forging ahead are older and wealthier than at any point in more than four decades. They're relying more on their own investment accounts and less on the bank of mom and dad. The nepo buyer has taken a back seat.

Of course, parents can pass along privilege in all kinds of ways that aren't clear at the closing table. Paying for college tuition, say, can ensure their child graduates debt-free and ready to stack savings. Children whose parents are homeowners are more likely to end up buying a home themselves. A growing number of first-time buyers are moving straight out of their parents' places, saving on rent before heading out on their own. Even homebuyers who don't get a financial handout may benefit from the advice and know-how of parents who have already weathered the process.

But cold, hard cash remains the simplest way to get a foothold in the market. That kind of help doesn't always equate to a free ride, though. Roughly a year after Frohling and her husband purchased the Illinois home, their daughter refinanced to pull equity out of the house to pay her parents back. The maneuver leaves a new loan attached to the place, which their daughter will now begin the long process of paying off — and building a nest egg of her own.

While nepo buyers' numbers are down, they're far from extinct. Bill Mitchell, the loan officer who helped the Frohlings execute the refinance, says it's hard to overstate the power of a cash offer in a competitive market like Illinois, where a relative lack of homebuilding means the number of homes available for sale is still tight. Mitchell estimates that about 20% of the first-time buyers he works with use family money to beef up their offers.

""When I see that situation, and I see that I've got these clients that have made an offer on one, two, three homes and got beat out by cash offers, that's typically when I'll say, 'Hey, let's think of potential alternative strategies here,'"" Mitchell tells me. ""'Do you have family that would be willing to help out in a situation like this?'""

Frohling says she initially worried she had robbed her daughter of the joy that comes with buying something all on your own after years of saving. But for Frohling's daughter, homeownership didn't come without sacrifice: She and her husband, for example, skipped throwing a big wedding and saved that money instead. And in the end, Frohling tells me, the ease and convenience were worth it.

""I know that we are blessed to be able to do that,"" Frohling says.

Update: September 17, 2025 — This story was updated to clarify that the estimated percentage of Bill Mitchell's clients who use family money only pertains to first-time buyers.

In this article

StubHub shares opened at $25.35 in their New York Stock Exchange debut on Wednesday after the online ticket seller priced its IPO in the middle of its expected range. 

The pricing late Tuesday at $23.50 per share raised $800 million for the company, now trading under ticker symbol ""STUB.""

StubHub's long-awaited IPO comes after the company paused its plans in April, when President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs sent the stock market into a tailspin. It was the second such delay, after market volatility forced StubHub to temporarily shelve its IPO plans in July 2024.

The IPO is the latest in a flurry of tech offerings as the market rebounds from a dismal few years. Swedish buy now, pay later firm Klarna and Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, rose in their respective debuts last week. Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, design software company Figma and stablecoin issuer Circle have also hit the market in recent months.

StubHub has been through a number of transactions in its 25-year history to get to this point. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but was reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for roughly $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.

StubHub has benefited from a resurgence in the live events market in the years following the Covid lockdowns. Sales have also boomed from massively popular shows like Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour, as well as sporting events like the Super Bowl.

The company said in its updated prospectus filed last month that those sorts of events can also make StubHub's revenues lumpy and difficult to predict.

In the first quarter, StubHub reported revenue growth of 10% from a year earlier to $397.6 million. Its net loss widened to $35.9 million from $29.7 million a year ago. Gross merchandise sales, which represent the total dollar value paid by ticket buyers, reached $2.08 billion in the three months ended March 31.

StubHub primarily generates revenue from connecting buyers with ticket resellers. More than 40 million tickets were sold on StubHub's marketplace last year from roughly one million sellers, the company said in August.

It competes with Vivid Seats, which was taken public via a special purpose acquisition company in 2021, SeatGeek and Ticketmaster parent Live Nation Entertainment.

The Federal Trade Commission is in the advanced stages of probing Ticketmaster over whether it's done enough to keep automated bots from circumventing its per-person ticket limits for popular events, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The FTC in May sent a warning letter to StubHub saying it must comply with the agency's ""junk fees"" rule and alleging some of its ticket listings failed to display the total price, including all mandatory fees and charges.

Madrone Partners is StubHub's largest investor with ownership of 24.5% of Class A shares prior to the offering. WestCap is second at 12.3%, followed by Bessemer Venture Partners at 8.8%.

This morning, the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, lowering borrowing costs for the first time since March

– Reuters

The S&P 500 briefly rose while the Nasdaq slipped in choppy trading on Wednesday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by an expected 25 basis points.

The central bank indicated it will steadily cut rates for the rest of the year, with projections showing two more quarter-percentage-point cuts, as policymakers signalled concerns about weakness in the labor market.

This rate cut was already priced in by investors, according to data compiled by LSEG. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was already in positive territory, where it remained after the Fed's move.

“A majority of the FOMC is now targeting two further cuts this year, indicating that the doves on the committee are now in the driver's seat. We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory,” said Simon Dangoor, Head of Fixed Income Macro Strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

At 2:05 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 437.93 points, or 0.96 per cent, to 46,195.83, the S&P 500 gained 8.47 points, or 0.13 per cent, to 6,615.23 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 50.93 points, or 0.22 per cent, to 22,284.13.

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday and indicated it will steadily lower borrowing costs for the rest of this year, as policymakers responded to concerns about weakness in the job market in a move that won support from most of U.S. President Donald Trump's central bank appointees.

Only new Governor Stephen Miran, who joined the Fed on Tuesday and is on leave as the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, dissented in favor of a half-percentage-point cut.

The rate cut, along with projections showing two more quarter-percentage-point reductions are anticipated at the remaining two policy meetings this year, indicate Fed officials have begun to downplay the risk that the administration's voluble trade policies will stoke persistent inflation, and are now more concerned about weakening growth and the likelihood of rising unemployment.

The cut, the first move by the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee since December, moves the policy rate to the 4.00 per cent to 4.25 per cent range.

“The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen,” the Fed said in its policy statement. “Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has edged up.”

Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET to elaborate on the latest statement and economic outlook.

New economic projections showed policymakers at the median still see inflation ending this year at 3 per cent, well above the central bank's 2-per-cent target, a projection unchanged from the Fed's last set of forecasts published in June. The projection for unemployment was also unchanged at 4.5 per cent and economic growth slightly higher at 1.6 per cent versus 1.4 per cent.

The Bank of Canada cut was widely anticipated by financial markets. The cracks in the Canadian economy we mentioned in these pages after the bank's last announcement in July have become far more visible.

Gross domestic product contracted at an annualized pace of 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, stirring fears of a possible recession on the horizon. Per capita GDP has contracted or stagnated in nine of the last 12 quarters. In the face of tariffs and uncertainty related to tariffs, exports fell a whopping 30 per cent annualized in the quarter while imports fell by 5 per cent. The temporary boost provided by front-running of tariffs earlier in the year evaporated.

Employment tells the same story, and the story is not good. Employment fell by more than 100,000 positions in July and August, with full-time jobs held by people of prime working age bearing the brunt. The unemployment rate hit 7.1 per cent in August, its highest since2016, outside of the pandemic.

Making matters worse, the fall in employment is dispersed widely across sectors. In the six months leading to June, nearly two-thirds of the sectors making up the Canadian economy experienced contracting employment. The wide dispersion means that employment losses are not confined to sectors directly vulnerable to the current tariff wars.

If the effects were more confined, targeted fiscal policy on its own might make the most sense. However, while fiscal policy will still be needed – and, indeed, seems set to take hold – it means that monetary policy stimulus, which is a blunt tool, is appropriate.

Cracks in GDP and employment were part of our concern when the bank held last time. The reason for the bank holding then was more about inflation, and in particular core inflation. But here, cracks have been exposed as well.

The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, bringing it down to 2.5 per cent after three straight holds. Governor Tiff Macklem says the central bank has shifted to worrying more about a slowing economy than high inflation, which provided the rationale for the interest rate move.

The Canadian Press

Money market traders grew a little more doubtful that October will bring another rate cut as the Bank of Canada news conference wore on and Governor Tiff Macklem made it clear the bank would not provide much forward guidance this time around on the trajectory of future rate moves.

Implied probabilities in overnight index swap markets now suggest a 40-per-cent probability of a rate cut at the bank's next meeting, on Oct. 29, down from about 50 per cent when the rate decision was announced earlier today, according to LSEG data. There's now about a 62-per-cent probability priced into markets of another rate cut coming before 2025 draws to a close.

So if Mr. Macklem is trying to temper further easing expectations, he's finding some success.

Investors must now sit tight for what the U.S. Federal Reserve has to say later today, which is likely to have a much bigger impact on markets overall. In case you're curious, the latest swaps pricing suggests a 95-per-cent probability of a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut being announced at 2 p.m. and a 5-per-cent chance of an even bigger, 50-basis-point cut.

“Historically, population growth has evolved pretty smoothly, and so we have sort of certain rules of thumb about what potential growth can be, how many new workers you would expect to be added to the labour market every month. We need to adjust those rules of thumb to the reality that population growth is lower.”

– Mark Rendell

“The way the U.S. has implemented them, the tariffs in place in the Canadian economy are applied to very specific sectors: steel, automobiles, aluminum. You've got Chinese tariffs on canola, pork and seafood. You've now got higher U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber, tariffs on copper. For the rest of the economy, for other sectors, tariffs remain very low, providing your business is compliant with CUSMA. So the impacts are very concentrated in these sectors that have been hit and the services that are servicing those. … Monetary policy is a blunt instrument. We can help the overall economy adjust, but we can't support, we can't target individual sectors. Fiscal policy really is a much better instrument for that.” 

– Nojoud Al Mallees

“The risk for us is that a temporary increase in those prices has knock-on effects to other prices, and then it starts to look like ongoing inflation. From our perspective, now, the fact that the direct effect of the countertariffs has been removed, that takes away the first-round effect, so there won't be a second-round effect. … That has taken off some of the upside risk to future inflation, and that was one of the things that tilted the risks today in favour of cutting the interest rate.”

– Mark Rendell

“As we have for the last couple of meetings, we considered two alternatives: Hold the policy rate where we are, or cut the policy rate. What tipped the balance really in favour of a cut this time was there was a clear sense that the balance of risk had shifted. … The labour market has softened further. The inflation picture hasn't really changed a great deal. … Total CPI inflation came out yesterday at 1.9 per cent. … CPI ex-tax came out 2.4 yesterday. … If you look at our core measures … they remain around 3. If you look under the hood, though, what you can see is that earlier in the year we saw some upward momentum in those core measures. If you look at the more recent monthly readings on the core measures, that momentum has come off.”

– Mark Rendell

 “The reality is tariffs are increasing trade friction with our biggest trading partner and that has efficiency costs. Monetary policy can't undo that. It can't reverse that. What we can do is help the economy adjust while maintaining well-controlled inflation, that's what we're focused on. … We've demonstrated today, if the risks tilt, if the risks shift, we're prepared to take action. And if the risks tilt further, we're prepared to take more action. But we're going to take it one meeting at a time. We are taking a shorter horizon, we're being a little less forward-looking than usual. And we'll make that risk assessment in October, when we get there.”

“From our macro perspective, it's less about individual measures and more about how everything fits together, what the overall macro impact is. And certainly, once we have the budget, we will be assessing the implications of government's plans on the economic outlook, what that means for growth, for inflation and, ultimately, for what we need to do with interest rates.”

Canada shed 66,000 positions in August and the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 per cent – the highest level since 2016, apart from early pandemic years, according to Statistics Canada.Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press

Lower interest rates mean the economy may be headed for trouble.

Central banks cut rates to make it cheaper for companies and people to borrow, which helps stimulate economic activity. It's a shot in the arm when the economy looks anemic.

This latest Bank of Canada rate cut, in particular, signals that the financial pain of tariffs is starting to get real and spread. The unemployment rate is 7.1 per cent, the highest it's been since 2016 outside the pandemic. So far, it's been mostly tariff-sensitive manufacturing sectors and young graduates who've felt the brunt of the weak job market. But that's beginning to change.

Here are four things to weigh to help you manage your finances as economic storm clouds gather:

– Darcy Keith

Here's how economists are reacting to the Bank of Canada's rate decision:

“The relatively neutral tone of the Bank's policy statement suggests that it is not necessarily expecting to cut rates again in October. … Crucially, the Bank dropped the line from its previous policy statement that said “if a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate.” Nonetheless, the Bank reiterated that it will be assessing the extent to which weakness in exports “spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending,” how “trade disruptions are … passed on to consumer prices” and “how inflation expectations evolve.” That leaves the door to another interest rate cut this year if, as we expect, economic growth remains weak while core inflation pressures remain under control.""

“The statement emphasized that policymakers are data dependent and are monitoring the effects of shifts in trade that will add to costs even as they weigh on economic activity, and they will also assess the degree of spillover into other areas of the economy and how inflation expectations evolve in judging if another cut is in the cards ahead. In our view, the economy is losing resilience and inflation will continue to be contained by the elevated unemployment rate and removal of retaliatory tariffs and we therefore see another 25-basis-point cut in October.”

“Conventional wisdom says that if you're going to cut once, you're probably going to go again (does a single 25-basis-point move the needle in significant fashion?). Note that the empirical record supports this view as the only time the Bank has held, then cut, then held was the mini 2015 easing cycle when the policy rate was at or below 1%. The BoC is trying to temper easing expectations as they remove the line from the July decision that said “further rate cuts may be necessary,” but a follow-on cut in October is our expectation, nonetheless. And while our base case outlook entails a 2.25% terminal rate (i.e., just one more cut), risks have clearly swung towards more easing being delivered. Finger in the air, we'd assign a 40% probability to the terminal rate settling at 2% (or lower). Incoming economic/inflation data, an October Business Outlook Survey, Canada-U.S. trade developments and a fall budget will all help guide that view.”

“We don't think this is the beginning of a new cutting cycle that will see rates fall deeply into stimulative territory. We expect the BoC to cut by another 25 basis points in October but then pause and hold rates at 2.25% - the low end of its neutral range estimate - through 2026. The BoC remains in a bind as it weighs the upside risks to inflation against the downside risks to growth from the trade war. Moreover, major fiscal stimulus is likely to be laid out in the federal budget this fall, which will do most of the heavy lifting to support the economy in the near term.”

“The Bank of Canada still seems wary of assuming that all of the impacts of U.S. trade policy are in the rearview mirror, particularly with regards to inflation. That's left markets relatively unchanged after the rate cut announcement. In contrast, our work suggests that those fears about inflation won't materialize. As a result, we continue to believe that the Bank of Canada will cut rates again in October and ultimately take the policy rate down to a terminal rate of 2.00%.”

Mortgage rates could soon lower after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today.Matt Rourke/The Associated Press

Hello, cheaper mortgages. 

The most common mortgage rate could soon start at 3 per cent instead of 4 per cent after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today.

And although home loans will only become slightly cheaper, mortgages that start with 3 per cent can be a psychological turning point for would-be buyers.

“A mortgage rate starting with a 3 is helpful,” said Clinton Wilkins, principal broker with Centum Home Lenders Ltd. who has been brokering mortgages in Nova Scotia for more than 20 years 

“Once those rates are widely available, it will add some demand in the market,” he said. 

“Having a 3 handle on mortgage rates is an important psychological hurdle for buyers,” said Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert with rate comparison web site Ratehub.ca 

Some lenders are already advertising mortgages with an interest rate that starts at 3 per cent. But they are not widespread. 

So far this month, the average rate was 4.1 per cent on a five-year variable-rate product and 3.97 per cent on a five-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to data from Mortgagelogic.news.

But the most popular lenders – the big Canadian banks – are still advertising rates above 4 per cent, according to their websites.

No big surprise here for markets, though there was a little bit of softening in the Canadian dollar as the decision came out, with the loonie falling to 72.62 U.S. cents from 72.70. 

There was a little bit of an uptick, though, in the S&P/TSX Composite Index. It's up about 0.25 per cent, versus a nearly unchanged S&P 500. Among stocks seeing some of the most positive gains are dividend stocks, which investors tend to gravitate to when interest rates fall and make returns in competing income products, such as bonds and cash, less attractive.

Bond yields softened a bit, too, with the Canadian two-year bond losing about another basis point, to trade about two basis points lower.

Unlike today's decision, markets are not really convinced another rate cut will be announced at the next BoC meeting, on Oct. 29.

Implied probabilities in overnight index swaps suggest odds are about even on another 25-basis-point cut at that time, according to LSEG data. That said, markets are convinced the rate-cutting cycle won't end with today's decision and are fully pricing in another cut by Jan. 28 of next year. That would bring the overnight rate down to 2.25 per cent. 

But markets aren't pricing in much further easing over the course of next year. The verdict from traders: The monetary easing cycle may not be over, but it's close to reaching its conclusion. Assuming, of course, the economy stays relatively afloat. 

– Nojoud Al Mallees

“Although there are still some mixed signals, on balance, recent data suggest the upward pressures on underlying inflation have diminished.”

“Tariffs are having a profound effect on several key sectors, including the auto, steel and aluminum industries. Chinese tariffs on canola, pork and seafood, new U.S. tariffs on copper and higher U.S. tariffs on softwood lumber will spread the direct impacts further.”

“Many businesses have told us they have paused investment plans given elevated uncertainty about U.S. trade policy. Businesses are also concerned that demand in Canada will weaken as the economic fallout broadens.”

“The federal government's recent decision to remove most retaliatory tariffs on imported goods from the United States will mean less upward pressure on the prices of these goods going forward.”

“We are paying close attention to how exports evolve given the impact of U.S. tariffs and changing trade relationships; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how the cost effects of trade disruptions and reconfigured supply chains are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve.”

Today's interest rate cut by the Bank of Canada will likely motivate more prospective buyers to enter the real estate market.

That would support a recent market upswing that has seen sales on the rise over the past five months and August purchases hit a four-year high for that month.

While the BoC had cut its benchmark rate seven times from June, 2024, through March of this year, many buyers have been reluctant to make a purchase. 

Mortgage rates and home prices were still relatively high. And the trade war with the U.S. has led to job losses and the threat of a severe economic slowdown.

Now that the central bank's interest rate has been cut to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent, realtors say the pent-up demand could soon be unleashed. 

“If rates come down, people will come back into the market,” said Shaunese Lawrence, a mortgage agent with Clover Mortgage who has been brokering home loans in the Toronto region since 2013.

Ms. Lawrence said she has lost count of the number of people who are saying: “I just want to get something.” Last year she did not broker any mortgages for home purchases; she only worked on mortgage renewals and refinancings. 

In the past few weeks, she said, buyers have been putting in offers every day. “It's totally night and day and it is literally in the past couple of weeks.” 

Don Kottick, the president of Re/Max Canada, said would-be buyers are getting comfortable with the uncertainty brought on by the trade war. “We have started to see this uptick even though we don't know what will come,” he said.

The Bank of Canada's interest rate announcement today came with no hints about the future path of its policy rate.

Governor Tiff Macklem said in his opening remarks that there was a “clear consensus” to lower the central bank's policy rate today, but he provided no forward guidance on where rates are headed next. Instead, today's announcement emphasized the uncertainty looming over the economy.

“Governing council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks going forward,” Mr. Macklem said. “The Bank will continue to assess the risks, look over a shorter horizon than usual and be ready to respond to new information.”

Many economists anticipate the central bank will cut interest rates again this year in response to increasing slack in the economy and easing price pressures. Growth has stalled, the job market is loosening, and Canada's removal of many retaliatory tariffs should help on the inflation front.

The BoC acknowledged those realities today, but Mr. Macklem also highlighted ongoing risks to the inflation outlook.

“The disruptive effects of shifts in trade will add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. It is difficult to predict the extent of cost increases, where they will show up and how they could be passed through to consumer prices,” he said.

The bank did not release economic forecasts with its interest rate decision today. In its last two quarterly monetary policy reports, it published multiple scenarios of what could happen to the economy based on the state of trade.

The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point today, lowering borrowing costs for the first time since March as U.S. tariffs continue to batter the Canadian economy.

As widely expected, the bank's governing council voted to lower the policy rate to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent. This follows three consecutive rate decisions in which the central bank held the rate steady.

The bank has been reluctant to ease monetary policy amid a trade war with the United States, given the possibility that U.S. tariffs and Canadian countertariffs could push up consumer prices and reignite high inflation. But that calculus has shifted as unemployment has risen, exports have plummeted, and inflation has remained relatively benign.

“Considerable uncertainty remains. But with a weaker economy and less upside risk to inflation, governing council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks going forward,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said in prepared remarks.

Mr. Macklem said there was a “clear consensus” for a cut, but he gave few hints about where interest rates will go from here, saying the bank would “look over a shorter horizon than usual and be ready to respond to new information.”

The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut on Wednesday afternoon.Ken Cedeno/Reuters

After the Bank of Canada rate announcement, attention will shift to Washington, where the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut this afternoon amid souring economic indicators and mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy. 

The Fed has been on hold since December, wary that tariffs could push up consumer prices and unconvinced that the robust U.S. economy needed more support. That sentiment appears to have changed in recent months, as the U.S. job market has stalled while inflation hasn't increased as much as many economists expected. 

Financial markets now expect the Fed to lower its policy rate by a quarter-point today, with traders betting on additional cuts through the fall. Because the Fed has cut less than the BoC or most other central banks – the target range for the federal funds rate is 4.25 to 4.5 per cent – it has a long way to go before getting interest rates back to a neutral level. 

Any decision to cut, however, will carry a whiff of politics. U.S. President Donald Trump has spent months lambasting Fed Chair Jerome Powell and demanding that the Fed, which is meant to be independent of politics, lower interest rates. 

The President has also aggressively tried to overhaul the Fed's voting body, appointing Stephen Miran, a close economic adviser, as an interim governor and attempting to fire governor Lisa Cook – a move she is fighting in court.

The rate announcement is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, followed by a news conference with Mr. Powell at 2:30. 

Analysts will be watching for hints about future rate cuts and poring over the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which will contain a new “dot plot” outlining where Fed committee members see interest rates going over the next three years and in the longer run.

As far as financial markets are concerned, a rate cut today is a slam dunk. What's less clear is where interest rates go from here. 

Interest rate swap traders put the probability of a quarter-point cut by the Bank of Canada today above 90 per cent, according to LSEG data. 

Most Bay Street analysts are likewise convinced the BoC is going to resume easing after three consecutive holds. Twenty-five of 32 economists polled by Reuters last week said they expect a quarter-point cut today. That includes analysts at five of the six big Canadian banks, with RBC the only outlier. 

Looking further out, swap markets are pricing in only one additional cut after Wednesday, which would leave the policy rate at 2.25 per cent through next year. Analysts expect a similar trajectory, although some see the BoC needing to lower rates more to boost a sluggish economy.

Statistics Canada's August inflation report, released Tuesday, solidified expectations that the Bank of Canada will resume cutting interest rates today. 

The annual inflation rate rose to 1.9 per cent in August, from 1.7 per cent in July, but came in lower than analysts were anticipating. 

The BoC has held off on cutting interest rates since March, opting to monitor how the trade war with the U.S. evolves and whether high inflation remains at bay. 

Economists were somewhat concerned by a pick-up in inflation in the spring and the prospect of the trade war raising prices further. But those anxieties have faded. 

But they say that in hindsight the higher inflation in the spring was being driven by retaliatory tariffs that Canada had placed on U.S. goods. 

Prime Minister Mark Carney dropped many of Canada's retaliatory tariffs this month in a bid to further trade negotiations with the U.S. The move was applauded by Canadian businesses that said the countermeasures were raising prices for consumers. 

Economists say the BoC's focus now needs to shift to supporting the economy, which has stalled under the weight of U.S. tariffs.

The Bank of Canada is seen in Ottawa, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press

After a string of seven rate cuts, the Bank of Canada has been sitting tight since March, waiting to see how global trade disruptions hit the Canadian economy and affect consumer prices. 

In recent months, the picture has become clearer: Inflation has remained relatively contained, while U.S. tariffs have hammered exports and pushed up unemployment in Canada. That has set the stage for another round of monetary policy easing, with the BoC expected to lower borrowing costs to give the sluggish Canadian economy a jolt. 

Financial markets and Bay Street analysts widely expect a quarter-point cut today, which would take the bank's policy rate down to 2.5 per cent. 

Until now, the BoC has been wary of cutting interest rates further, given the possibility that U.S. tariffs and Canadian countertariffs could drive up consumer prices and touch off another round of high inflation. But Canada has dropped most of its retaliatory tariffs in recent months, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened, easing upward pressure on the prices of imported goods. 

The August inflation numbers, published Tuesday, were the last hurdle to clear and showed nothing that would prevent the BoC from cutting. Annual headline inflation rose slightly to 1.9 per cent, but the closely watched core inflation measures eased. 

Inflation hasn't disappeared entirely as a concern. But downside risks to Canada's tariff-battered economy are likely to take centre stage. Gross domestic product contracted 1.6 per cent, at an annualized rate, in the second quarter, and unemployment is at 7.1 per cent, the highest level since 2016 outside the pandemic.

Monetary policy is a blunt instrument that can't target the sectors hit hardest by the trade war: steel, aluminum, autos and lumber. But rate cuts could help shore up consumer spending and business investment more broadly, as well as provide a spark to the housing market. 

With markets fully pricing in a rate cut today, the big question is where interest rates go from here. The BoC won't publish a new forecast today, so analysts will focus on any signals Governor Tiff Macklem sends out about the possibility of additional cuts this fall. 

The rate decision will be announced at 9:45 a.m. ET, followed by a news conference with Mr. Macklem and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers at 10:30 a.m. ET.

            When President Donald Trump enters St. George's Hall for the grand finale of his state visit at Windsor Castle Wednesday night, someone he is suing will be seated at the end of the dinner table: Rupert Murdoch.
    


            Murdoch, a familiar face at state dinners in the past, is currently locked in a major legal battle with Trump, who is suing the powerful owner of the Wall Street Journal after it reported on a suggestive birthday letter given to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name. Trump has denied that it's his signature and said at the time of the report that he personally warned Murdoch he'd sue if the newspaper published it.
    


            The Journal did so anyway, and Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit seeking $20 billion in damages and Murdoch's testimony.
    


            Despite that, according to a preview of the dinner given to reporters, Murdoch and his fifth wife Elena will be present at Windsor Castle Wednesday night. They are part of an intimate guest list that includes only about 160 guests, according to royal officials, and was compiled by the Royal Family and the White House.
    


            It is the Royal Family that designates the seating arrangement. Trump will be seated in between King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales, while first lady Melania Trump will be across the table next to Queen Camilla and William, Prince of Wales.
    


            One face who won't be at the dinner: The recently ousted British ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, who was fired by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer days before the state visit after his extensive ties to Epstein were revealed in media reports. Warren Stephens, the US ambassador to the Court of St. James, will be present.
    


            Other attendees include White House officials, British dignitaries and business executives like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensuen Huang, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Softbank Board Director Rene Haas.
    


            As UK officials seek a favorable trade standing with the US, one of Trump's top officials has a notable seat. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will sit next to Queen Camilla. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his wife are also attending the dinner.
    


            Over 100 staff will serve the meal, with guests seated at a long, ornate table decorated with multiple arrangements of bright flowers in differing sizes. There are approximately 130 candles stretched across the table, which takes an entire week to put together. Each setting has three forks, three knives, a single spoon and five drinking glasses. A mix of English, French and American wine will be served to guests. A perfectly folded napkin completes the lavish table setting.
    


            The menu includes a panna cotta de cresson starter, with parmesan shortbread and a quail egg salad. Guests will then be served organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savory infused jus. Dessert is a vanilla ice cream bombe with a Kentish raspberry sorbet interior, alongside lightly poached Victoria plums.
    


            The royal chef was in contact with the White House chef as they curated the menu, though it's ultimately designed with King Charles in mind, whom officials described as having an “eclectic palate.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","‘They will destroy the city, but not the people': Gaza braces for Israel's largest assault of the war","https://www.rt.com/news/624826-they-will-destroy-city/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 17:56:00 GMT","

In the predawn hours of Tuesday, Israel pushed deeper into Gaza City, unleashing the most intense ground campaign since the war began nearly two years ago. For the 600,000 civilians still trapped in the enclave's ruins, the offensive has turned daily survival into a grim gamble between death, displacement, and defiance.

Israel has launched a full-scale ground operation into Gaza City, marking a new and dangerous phase of a war that has already left more than 64,000 Palestinians dead since October 2023.

Two divisions of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the 162nd and the 98th, advanced deeper into the besieged enclave, with a third division expected to join in the coming days.

The offensive, officials say, is aimed at dismantling Hamas' command and control, degrading its infrastructure in the heart of Gaza City – which houses up to 3,000 militants – and securing the release of hostages still held by the group. 

The IDF says the operation emphasizes “security over speed” – a gradual entry accompanied by heavy fire support to protect advancing troops.

While the assault didn't surprise Gazans – Israel has spoken about it for weeks – for many, the invasion was a moment of paralyzing dread.

“I was at home in Gaza City with my family,” Mahdy Kamal, 38, a father of five from the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood, said.

“We were all sitting in the living room with no electricity, following the updates on a small battery-powered radio.

“When I heard the Israeli Army announcing they had started a ground offensive, I felt my stomach drop.

“My wife just sat in silence while my younger child started pacing nervously,” he added.

Kamal was not the only one.

Huda Abu Ramadan, a 54-year-old mother of four, was also paralyzed by the news of the invasion: “I was outside my house, trying to get some water from a nearby tank. People around me were whispering that the invasion had started. Later, I confirmed it through neighbors who had radio sets. I was shocked. My daughter burst into tears when I broke the news to her.”

The IDF has repeatedly urged Gazans to leave the area – now considered a dangerous combat zone.

According to estimates, more than 350,000 have evacuated to the designated areas of Mawasi and Khan Yunis, two rather small strips of land that make up around 15% of the territory, where Israel says it has accumulated more water, food, shelters, and medications.

Yet, 600,000 Gazans still remain in the city, reluctant to leave.

Kamal and Abu Ramadan were among those who decided to stay – each for their own reasons. For Mahdi, it was dictated by the difficulty of moving the family, especially the younger children and the elderly relatives, mixed with a sense of uncertainty in Khan Yunis and Mawasi.

For Abu Ramadan, the reason was simple: She could not afford it.

“I tried to go to Khan Yunis, but I do not have enough money for transportation and buying a tent. I think about going to Mawasi, but I heard the conditions there are terrible – too crowded, no water, no shelter. I don't want my kids to live in that dirt.”

Mkhaimer Abuseada, an associate professor at Al Azhar University of Gaza, currently residing in Cairo, agrees that the move is a mission impossible for the majority of Gazans.

“The trip of moving the entire family with all their belongings from Gaza to the south can cost up to $1,000, and money is scarce now, so this is something many cannot afford,” he said.

“Apart from that, the designated area itself is not safe either, and only a few days ago, we saw a family that moved from Gaza to Khan Yunis perishing in an attack. And finally, Gazans are attached to their homes, their memories. They know that the moment they move, there is no going back, so they prefer to stay, clinging to their belongings.”

Kamal and Abu Ramadan and their families were not exceptions. They, too, decided to stay, come what may.

But the fate that awaits them there is rather bleak. In almost two years of fighting, Israel has destroyed 34% of all housing units; 58% have been damaged. The majority of roads, commercial and industrial facilities have been eliminated, many schools and hospitals have remained non-operational.

While Gaza City has also been severely damaged, the magnitude of the destruction is believed to be less severe. Israel was avoiding maneuvering in the area for fear of harming its hostages allegedly being held in the city and its outskirts. Now the circumstances have changed.

Israel has recruited an additional 60,000 troops for the incursion into the city, believed to be one of Hamas' last strongholds, and the IDF is saying they are not limited in time. “We will operate as long as it is needed,” IDF spokesman Effie Defrin said Tuesday night.

For Kamal and his family, this could mean one of two things: Certain death or permanent displacement.

“I fear that we will be forced out of Gaza permanently, like what happened to our grandparents in 1948. I also fear for my children.

“And every night, before I go to sleep, I wonder if I'll end up waking up in the morning.

Yet the crippling fear hasn't broken the spirit of Kamal, Abu Ramadan, and many others.

“Israel will be staying in Gaza City for many months and they will eventually destroy it like they did with all the other cities, but the people will not be conquered,” Kamal believes.

Abu Ramadan agreed: “Israel cannot break the will of the people. We've survived many wars; this one will not erase us either.”

The problem is that this war – unlike others witnessed by Gazans – doesn't show signs of winding down. Israel vowed to eradicate all the hardcore Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants hiding in Gaza City, but Abuseada is certain this will not end the resistance.

“Israel will take over the whole city, will probably destroy all of the homes, go after Hamas fighters, but that's going to take months and months to do the job. Even then, Hamas will not be gone. Fighters will hide in tunnels.

“The city will be conquered, but resistance will not end.”

Abuseada struggles to say what the future holds for Gaza.

“There are several scenarios on the table. The Egyptians have a plan – supported by the Arab League – that presupposes the establishment of a technocratic government... without Hamas and its allies.”

“The Israelis – led by Finance Minister Smotrich and the minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir – have a different plan. They want to evict all Gazans and resettle the entire strip. I don't know which option will eventually be chosen, but something tells me that Israel will be staying in Gaza for quite some time,” he said.

Abuseada's instincts might be right. Earlier this month, the IDF spokesman stated that a day after the war ends – and if no diplomatic solution is found – Israel would establish full military control over the enclave.

Plans to resettle Gaza – promoted by the radical right – have not been a secret either, and prominent activists of the camp have engaged in multiple campaigns to promote that cause, despite the uproar they caused among liberal circles of Israel and abroad.

“We have to wait and see,” Abuseada said.

But for families like Kamal's and Abu Ramadan's, there is no waiting room – only the immediate calculus of survival, and the fear that in the end their city, and their future, may be erased in the name of victory.

Ex-president says US in ‘dangerous moment', after White House response to killings of Kirk and Melissa Hortman

Barack Obama addressed the recent killing of Charlie Kirk and told a crowd in Pennsylvania on Tuesday the country was “at an inflection point”, but that political violence “is not new” and “has happened at certain periods” in US history.

Obama added that despite history, political violence was “anathema to what it means to be a democratic country”.

The former president made the remarks at the Jefferson Educational Society, a non-profit in Erie, Pennsylvania. He explicitly denounced political violence, addressing the fatal attacks this year of Kirk and the Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman. He called both incidents “a tragedy” and said Donald Trump had further divided the country rather than work to bring people together.

“There are no ifs, ands or buts about it: the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,” he said.

Obama warned that the response to Kirk's assassination last week, which has kicked off a debate about free speech and the incitement to violence, could serve to deepen political and cultural divisions.

“There's been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and, frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we're going to identify an enemy,” he said.

Politicians on the right, including Trump, have blamed the “radical left” for fostering a dangerous political environment. Many on the left say those claims are a pretext for an authoritarian crackdown on free speech.

Obama has kept something of a low profile in his post-presidency. Responding to a moderator's questions on Tuesday, he addressed Trump's rhetoric after Kirk's assassination, as well as other administrative moves.
 He spoke about his own leadership following the 2015 killings of nine Black parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina church, as well as George W Bush's decisions following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He said the role of a president in a crisis was “to constantly remind us of the ties that bind us together”.
 The sentiment among Trump and his aides following Kirk's killing of calling political opponents “vermin, enemies … speaks to a broader problem”, Obama said.

Kirk, a dominant figure in conservative politics, became a confidant of Trump after founding Turning Point USA, one of the nation's largest political organizations. Trump has escalated threats to crack down on what he describes as the “radical left” following Kirk's killing, stirring fears his Republican administration is trying to harness outrage to suppress political opposition.
 The White House responded to Obama's remarks by blaming him for animosity in the country, calling him “the architect of modern political division in America”.
 “Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other, and following his presidency more Americans felt Obama divided the country than felt he united it,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement.

In the aftermath of Kirk's killing, political leaders including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, Joe Biden and George Bush called for an end to political violence and a return to reasonable debate to lower the political temperature in the US.

Obama sought to hold a middle ground in his remarks, praising Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, who he said showed “that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate”.

The desire to identify an enemy, Obama indicated, was misplaced. “We're going to suggest that somehow that enemy was at fault, and we are then going to use that as a rationale for trying to silence discussion around who we are as a country and what direction we should go,” Obama said. “And that's a mistake as well.”

While he believed that Kirk's ideas “were wrong”, Obama said that “doesn't negate the fact that what happened was a tragedy and that I mourn for him and his family”. Denouncing political violence and mourning its victims “doesn't mean we can't have a debate about the ideas” that Kirk promoted, he added.

“Those are all topics that we have to be able to discuss honestly and forthrightly, while we still insist that in that process of debate, we respect other people's right to say things that we profoundly disagree with,” Obama said. “That's how we should approach this.”

Obama on Tuesday also referenced Trump's recent deployment of national guard troops in Washington and ID checks by federal agents in Los Angeles. He urged citizens and elected officials to closely monitor the norm-busting decisions.
 “What you're seeing, I think, is the sense that through executive power, many of the guardrails and norms that I thought I had to abide by as president of the United States, that George Bush thought he had to abide by as president of the United States, that suddenly those no longer apply,” Obama said. “And that makes this a dangerous moment.”

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed lower in choppy trading on Wednesday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by an expected 25 basis points and Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the weak job market.

The Dow closed higher after meandering during Powell's speech.

The central bank indicated it will steadily cut rates for the rest of the year as policymakers signaled concerns about weakness in the labor market. The Fed projected two more quarter-percentage-point cuts this year.

In a press conference, Powell talked about the rising downside risks of employment compared to inflation, but said inflation risks still need to be assessed and managed.

This rate cut was already priced in by investors, according to data compiled by LSEG.

“Powell tempered some of the initial enthusiasm in the markets for a more aggressive path of monetary easing. He noted the softness in the labor market, but reserves a larger cut for more serious conditions that are not present today,” said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.

“The Fed also raised its inflation forecast, highlighting the delicate balance between setting monetary policy to offset a weaker labor market versus bringing inflation lower,” he said.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 6.63 points, or 0.10%, to end at 6,600.13 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 73.10 points, or 0.33%, to 22,260.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 262.26 points, or 0.56%, to 46,012.75.

The Fed's decision and outlook will test Wall Street's recent rally, which has been supported by rate-cut expectations and revived enthusiasm around AI-stock-linked trading.

Powell fielded several questions about the Fed's independence from the executive branch.

On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Stephen Miran was sworn in as a Fed Governor and an appeals court rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to sack Governor Lisa Cook.

With another interest rate cut on Wednesday, borrowers may soon be able to get mortgages with rates in the 3-per-cent range.DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press

Mortgages rates below 4 per cent are set to become mainstream as interest rates drop, breaking a psychological barrier for many prospective homebuyers and motivating them to leap into the market.

With the Bank of Canada cutting its benchmark interest rate Wednesday to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent, lenders are expected to offer mortgages that could soon be in the 3-per-cent range instead of hovering around 4 per cent. 

Although the rate drop would make home loans only slightly cheaper, mortgage rates that start with a three are seen as a psychological turning point for would-be buyers.

“Today's decision will mean pretty much everyone is getting 3-point-something,” said Shaun Cathcart, senior economist with the Canadian Real Estate Association. “We're finally back into a range that a lot of people consider normal.” 

Toronto homebuyers take cold-blooded approach to the condo market

From the 2009 global recession until the start of the pandemic in 2020, the average interest rate on the popular five-year mortgage was in the 3-per-cent range, which Mr. Cathcart said is more typical of the last decade as opposed to the rates above 4 per cent seen in recent years. 

Getting back to what buyers consider “normal” will likely motivate them to enter the real estate market. 

That would give more fuel to a recent market upswing where sales have been on the rise over the past five months. August purchases hit their highest volume for the same month since 2021 when the country's real estate market was booming, according to recent CREA data.

“Having a three handle on mortgage rates is an important psychological hurdle for buyers,” said Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert with rate comparison website Ratehub.ca 

Other mortgage experts agreed. “If rates come down, people will come back into the market,” said Shaunese Lawrence, a mortgage agent with Clover Mortgage who has been brokering mortgages in the Toronto region for more than a decade. 

Ms. Lawrence said she has lost count of the number of people who are saying: “I just want to get something.”

Three communities that are bucking national real estate trends

Since late 2022, the real estate market has been mostly in a slump. Home sales dropped as borrowing costs rose, properties lost value and individual investors disappeared from the new construction market because real estate investments are no longer profitable. 

Even when the Bank of Canada started cutting its benchmark rate in June, 2024, and made seven consecutive cuts through March, 2025, many buyers remained reluctant to make a purchase. Buyers considered mortgage rates still relatively high, especially compared with the sub-2-per-cent rates that were prevalent in the early days of the pandemic.

Then as buyers started to venture into the market early this year, fears of a recession abounded owing to the start of the U.S. trade war.

On Wednesday, the central bank said it cut rates in part because the economy has been weakening with the rise in unemployment. In its interest rate announcement, the central bank pointed to the recent uptick in the housing market as a sign of economic resilience. 

Ahead of the central bank announcement on Wednesday, the average interest rate was 4.1 per cent for a five-year variable-rate product and 3.97 per cent for a five-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to data from MortgageLogic.news.

The big Canadian banks – which dominate nearly 60 per cent of the mortgage market – were advertising mortgage rates above 4 per cent, according to their websites. 

“A mortgage rate starting with a three is helpful,” said Clinton Wilkins, principal broker with Centum Home Lenders Ltd., who has been brokering mortgages in Nova Scotia for more than 20 years. 

“Once those rates are widely available, it will add some demand in the market,” he said.

“We paid a lot of money for the war, so we need to decide how to divide the percentages of the land,” said Smotrich.

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich bragged about the possibility of a “real estate bonanza” on the ruins of Israel's genocide in Gaza on Wednesday, saying that Israel is already in talks with the U.S. to divide up the land.

“The Gaza Strip is becoming a real estate bonanza,” Smotrich said in Hebrew at a real estate conference in Israel, per Israeli media. 

Israel has “already begun negotiations with the Americans” on a “business plan” to make Gaza, home to 2.2 million Palestinians, into a real estate investment. The plan is on President Donald Trump's desk, he claims.

He said that, because of these proposals, the genocide “pays for itself,” saying that Israel has “paid a lot of money” to wage its assault.

“We paid a lot of money for the war, so we need to decide how to divide the percentages of the land in Gaza. The demolition phase is always the first phase of urban renewal. We did that, now we need to start building,” he said, per Haaretz.

The U.S. has been considering a plan, called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, to relocate and potentially expel the entire population of Gaza to other countries. The proposal was first developed by a group of Israeli business people who came up with the proposal for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Top U.S. consulting firm, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), provided financial modelling for the plan.

The plan calls for expelled Palestinians to be given a small fee for leaving, and for landowners to be given a “digital token” in exchange for redeveloping rights. This token could be used for relocation or “eventually redeemed for an apartment in one of six to eight new ‘AI-powered, smart cities' to be built in Gaza,” the Washington Post reported this month.

The plan is in line with Trump's rhetoric about making Gaza into the “Riviera” — a plan to build a beach resort for the rich on top of the ruins of Israel's extermination campaign, on the former homes of Palestinians. 

BCG calculated that the plan would be extremely lucrative financially, turning back four times its initial investment of $100 billion, according to the plan. The firm has distanced itself from the plan, saying that the partners who approved of the project have been fired.

Israeli and American officials have insisted that the relocation of Palestinians for the plan would be temporary, likely aware of international law banning the forced relocation of a population. However, Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) recently said in a report that that is a lie, and that it was clear from their visit to Israel and Palestine last month that Israel is preparing to expel the entire population of Palestinians from Gaza in an ethnic cleansing campaign.

“The fact that both the Netanyahu government and now the Trump Administration are framing their plan as a call for the ‘voluntary' exodus of Palestinians from Gaza is one of the most fraudulent, sinister, and twisted cover stories ever told,” the report said.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Joel Willett, a military veteran and former CIA officer, launched his Democratic campaign for the U.S. Senate from Kentucky on Wednesday, saying the recent fallout from having his security clearance revoked by the Trump administration gave him added incentive to run.

“I've seen firsthand how the Trump administration and their far-right allies are trying to weaponize the government against anyone who disagrees with them,” Willett said in a campaign news release. “That just made me more determined to run.”

Willett, who grew up in a Louisville suburb, sounded populist themes in a state that's been trending Republican. He denounced tax cuts for the wealthy and Medicaid cuts that he says will cause millions of Americans to lose health insurance. Willett joins a growing field of candidates vying for the Senate seat held by longtime Republican powerbroker Mitch McConnell, who is not seeking reelection in 2026.

It's been more than 30 years since a Democrat last won election to the Senate from the Bluegrass State, and on the Republican side, the spending has quickly escalated for TV ad purchases by some of the candidates and by outside groups trying to influence the outcome.

Willett touted his career that has already spanned the military, the CIA and the business world.

As a CIA officer, Willett spent time in the White House situation room under then-President Barack Obama before leaving the government. Willett was recently among 37 current and former national security officials to have their security clearances rescinded by the Trump administration. Some were among the national security professionals who signed onto a 2019 letter that criticized Trump and that was recently highlighted online by influential Trump ally Laura Loomer. Willett was among them.




A memo from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accused those singled out of having engaged in the “politicization or weaponization of intelligence” to advance personal or partisan goals, failing to safeguard classified information, failing to “adhere to professional analytic tradecraft standards” and other unspecified “detrimental” conduct. The memo did not offer evidence to back up the accusations.

Willett said his security clearance was revoked two weeks after his name was mentioned in an article about possible Senate candidates in Kentucky. After the revocation, he received online attacks that included death threats, he said. 

Willett didn't hold back in criticizing Trump and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Wednesday.

“Right now, we live in a country where a president and his director of national intelligence think they can use all their power and all their trolls online to shut people up who disagree with them,” Willett said in a video accompanying his campaign announcement. “Well, I didn't shut up.”

Willett, 41, joined the Kentucky Army National Guard when he was 17, in the months following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and later served in the Army's Military Police Corps, according to his campaign biography.

After his career in government, he became a business executive, including stints as president of a consumer electronics manufacturing business and as CEO of an engineering services firm that helped the Navy build destroyers, the bio says.

In his campaign video, Willett said he's lived the “American dream” but added that for many Kentuckians ”that dream is dead. Because they get steamrolled by a political and economic system that thinks they don't matter. Costs go up and never come down. Tax cuts go to the ultrawealthy ... while millions are kicked off Medicaid.”

Willett decried the “ugly and violent” climate in current American politics.

“That goes against everything America stands for,” he said in the campaign release. “I've dedicated most of my life to protecting the country — and the democracy — I love, and I'm not stopping now.”

Other Democrats in the Senate race include state lawmaker Pamela Stevenson and Logan Forsythe, an attorney and former U.S. Secret Service agent.

Forsythe, who entered the race Tuesday, said Republicans are “creating a crisis for families” with cuts to Medicaid and food assistance. He said Trump's tariffs have hit Kentucky hard, punishing the bourbon industry and squeezing farmers. Meanwhile, Kentucky's term-limited Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is widely seen as preparing for a potential run for the White House in 2028.

Republicans in the race include U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, former state Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris. The GOP hopefuls speak glowingly of Trump, hoping to land his endorsement in a state that Trump overwhelmingly carried in the last three presidential elections.

Kentucky hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since Wendell Ford in 1992.

Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, appeared before a judge by video from jail on Tuesday. Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder and could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk.

22-year-old Tyler Robinson was arrested on suspicion of assassinating Charlie Kirk. AP reporter Eric Tucker explains more details.

The suspect in custody in connection with the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a 22-year-old from Utah, authorities said Friday.

Charlie Kirk's mastery of social media was key to him becoming a force in conservative politics. Social media has become the town square for increasingly strident debate and the forum for which conservatives have sought to punish people they feel aren't offering Kirk the proper respect.

OREM, Utah (AP) — Utah Valley University students returning to campus Wednesday clustered silently, staring down at the barricaded courtyard where an assassin struck down conservative activist Charlie Kirk in an attack that upended the nation. 

Care stations offering stuffed animals, candy and connections to counseling dotted the campus on the first day of classes since the shooting more than a week ago.

Matthew Caldwell, 24, said his classmates were quieter and seemed more genuine about being in class even with sadness still in air. 

“The way that we treat each other in our words can ultimately lead to things like this,” he said. “And I think everybody sort of understands that a little bit better now.”

On Tuesday, prosecutors charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with capital murder and announced they will seek the death penalty while revealing a series of incriminating messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and confidant of President Donald Trump.

Since the shooting, the Republican president has threatened to crack down on what he calls the “radical left” and classifying some groups as domestic terrorists. Former Democratic President Barack Obama said this week that Trump has further divided the country rather than work to bring people together.

On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee called on the chief executives of Discord, Steam, Twitch and Reddit to testify on how they are regulating their platforms to prevent violence.

“Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” said GOP Rep. James Comer, the committee chair, signaling a shift for congressional Republicans, who had previously scrutinized online platforms for policing free speech. 

Investigators say that sometime after Robinson fired a single fatal shot from the rooftop of a campus building overlooking where Kirk was speaking on Sept. 10, he texted his romantic partner and said to look under a keyboard.

There was a note, “I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it,” according to court documents. 

After expressing shock, his partner who lived with Robinson in southwestern Utah, asked Robinson if he was the shooter. Robinson responded, “I am, I'm sorry.”

Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said DNA on the trigger of the rifle used to kill Kirk matched Robinson, who faced his first hearing in the case Tuesday. A judge read the charges and said he would appoint an attorney to represent him. A message was left Wednesday with the county's public defender office. 

Robinson's family has declined to comment to The Associated Press since his arrest.

Law enforcement officials say they are looking at whether others knew about Robinson's plans or helped, but they have not said if his partner is among those being investigated, only expressing appreciation for the partner sharing information.

The partner apparently never went to law enforcement after receiving the texts. Robinson remained on the run for more than a day until his parents recognized him in a photo released by authorities.

Also getting a closer look is security the day of the attack. Utah Valley is conducting a review, university President Astrid S. Tuminez said Wednesday.

Republican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox met with students and campus leaders near the shooting scene, saying he understands they might still be haunted and angry over what happened. “What you do with that anger, that's what determines where we go from here,” he said.

Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but Gray said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.”

Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Trump win back the White House in 2024. His political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through social media, his podcast and campus events.

While court documents said Robinson wrote in one text that planned the attack for more than a week, authorities have not said what they believe that entailed.

Gray declined to answer whether Robinson targeted Kirk for his anti-transgender views. Kirk was shot while taking a question that touched on mass shootings and transgender people.

Robinson was involved in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who investigators say is transgender. 

Robinson's mother told investigators that their son had turned hard left politically in the last year and became more supportive of gay and transgender rights, Gray said.

She recognized him when authorities released a picture of the suspect and his parents confronted him, at which time Robinson said he wanted to kill himself, Gray said.

The family persuaded him to meet with a family friend who is a retired sheriff's deputy. That person was able to get Robinson to turn himself in, the prosecutor said. 

In a text exchange with his partner released by authorities, Robinson wrote about planning to get his rifle from his “drop point,” but that the area was “locked down.”

The texts, which Robinson later told his partner to delete, did not include timestamps, leaving it unclear how long after the shooting Robinson sent the messages.

“To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you,” Robinson wrote.

Watch live coverage of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. State visits in Britain blend 21st-century diplomacy with royal pageantry. King Charles III will host Trump at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before talks the next day with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WINDSOR, England (AP) — President Donald Trump relished the glow of a British royal spectacle on Wednesday, reveling in hours of pageantry with King Charles III while making time for a quiet tribute at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb.

Opening a two-day state visit, the grandeur-loving president soaked it all up, from the largest guard of honor in living memory, with 120 horses and 1,300 troops, to carriage rides, an air show and a Windsor Castle dinner.

After the pomp comes the real work Thursday, when Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meet, with the stakes high for the host country. 

No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has had the honor of a second U.K. state visit; Trump's first was in 2019, during his previous term. The display of regal splendor was meant to bolster ties with Trump at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements around the globe. 

Prince William and his wife, Kate, meet the presidential helicopter in the private Walled Garden on the vast Windsor estate, then walked Trump and first lady Melania Trump over to be greeted by Charles and Queen Camilla. A gigantic royal standard — the flag used for official celebration days — flew from the Royal Tower.

The guests traveled to the castle in a procession of horse-drawn carriages, past ranks of soldiers, sailors and aviators. The king and the Republican president chatted in the Irish State Coach during the short journey to the castle quadrangle, where Trump, accompanied by Charles, inspected an honor guard of soldiers in red tunics and bearskin hats.




They continued to chat and joke as the day progressed, with the king occasionally putting his hand on Trump's back. The president stepped in front of Charles during a review of troops, though the king had gestured, inviting the president to do so and avoiding a violation of protocol. That was not the case in 2019, when Trump stepped in front of Queen Elizabeth.

Part of the day was spent at St. George's Chapel on the castle grounds, where Trump placed a wreath in honor of Elizabeth, who died in 2022. 

The president and Charles toured the Royal Collection Display in an ornate room where officials laid out five tables of artifacts on U.S.-British relations. 

Among the items were 18th-century watercolors and documents on the United States seeking independence from King George III. There were materials from the first trans-Atlantic cable, including messages between Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan, as well as a 1930s hot dog picnic that a young Elizabeth wrote about, and a large glass vessel that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the queen during a 1957 state visit. 

“Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents on U.S. independence.

“That's fascinating,” Charles said.

The president walked a red carpet on the castle's East Lawn to watch the Beating Retreat, a military parade ceremony that featured 200-plus musicians, dates to the 1600s and was once used to call patrolling soldiers back to their castle at day's end.

A scheduled flyover by F-35 jets from the U.K. and U.S. militaries was scrapped due to poor weather conditions. But the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's aerobatics display team, thundered overhead, leaving streaks of red, white and blue smoke in their wake and drawing a visible reaction from both Trumps. 

The dinner menu featured Hampshire watercress panna cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, along with Norfolk chicken ballotine. Desert was vanilla ice cream bombe with a raspberry sherbet interior and lightly poached Victorian plums. 

Trump avoids alcohol, but the bar offerings included a cocktail known as the Transatlantic whiskey sour infused with marmalade, Warre's 1945 Vintage Port –- Trump is the 45th and 47th American president –- and Hennessy 1912 Cognac Grande Champagne. That was the year Trump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born in Scotland.

The musical playlist included the theme from the James Bond movies and rock staples from Trump's campaign rallies.

Charles and Camilla also presented the president and first lady with a handbound leather volume celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Union flag that flew above Buckingham Palace on the day of Trump's inauguration in January. The royals also gave first lady Melania Trump a silver and enamel bowl and a personalized handbag by British designer Anya Hindmarch. 

Trump gave Charles a replica of an Eisenhower sword, and Camilla received a vintage Tiffany & Co. gold, diamond and ruby brooch.

The royals' history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet joining them. Invitations handed out at the request of the elected government are a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions from reluctant allies.

In his talks with Trump, Starmer will promote a new U.K.-U.S. technology agreement. The British government hopes the deal, and billions in investment from U.S. tech companies, will help show that the trans-Atlantic bond remains strong despite differences over Ukraine, the Middle East and the future of NATO.

British officials also want to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. Days before the state visit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer fired Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, over the diplomat's past friendship with the convicted sex offender.

On Tuesday, the campaign group Led By Donkeys projected an image of Trump and Epstein on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president's relationship with the late American financier. Police said they arrested four people.

Most state visits are in London, home to Buckingham Palace and the broad, flag-lined boulevard known as The Mall. But this one is in Windsor, a historic town of just over 30,000 people about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of central London.

That makes it easier to control protests and protect Trump at a time of increased international tensions, especially after the fatal shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk last week in Utah. British police have undertaken a massive security operation to ensure Trump's safety. 

That did not stop thousands of demonstrators who marched through central London on Wednesday to protest Trump's visit. Some held banners that said “No to the racism, no to Trump.” Though the activities were smaller than during Trump's visit in June 2019, they included mini versions of the giant Trump baby blimp, an orange-tinted caricature of the president in a diaper that made a big impression during those demonstrations six years ago.

Historian Robert Lacey, a consultant on the Netflix television series “The Crown,” said Windsor is also a more “photogenic setting” for a state visit than London.

“Buckingham Palace has got its balcony, it's got its façade,” he said. But “inside it's very dreary and it's currently being renovated, which is one reason why Mr. Trump will not be staying there. Windsor is a proper castle.”

Robert Redford, the Hollywood golden boy who became an Oscar-winning director, liberal activist and godfather for independent cinema under the name of one of his best-loved characters, died Tuesday at 89. (Sept. 16)

When you're a larger-than-life, generation-spanning star like Robert Redford, the hard truth is that every movie is notable in some way. He was iconic in his own time, whether in front of the camera, or behind it. And in his lifetime, so many of his films transcended their original reviews to find passionate fanbases: Just ask older millennials about the 1992 hacker movie “Sneakers” or the “Sex and the City” generation about “The Way We Were.” 

Redford died Tuesday at 89, leaving behind an arsenal of great roles that he owned, whether he was playing a quiet CIA agent, a con man, a baseball player, a grizzled mariner, an ambitious journalist, or a charming WASP in love. You could make a feast out of his Sydney Pollack collaborations alone, staring with “Jeremiah Johnson” (streaming on Tubi ), a classic that also took on a surprising afterlife as a meme that became so popular, younger generations didn't even realize it was Redford behind that beard. His very last role came this year, a cameo in “Dark Winds,” the AMC show about Navajo police officers he produced. 

This is a list of some of Redford's most memorable performances, but don't forget about the films he directed, too: among them are the all-timers “Ordinary People” ( streaming on MGM+ ), which won him the best director Oscar, and “Quiz Show” (rent on Apple TV+ ), which got him another nod. 

Robert Redford, the Hollywood golden boy who became an Oscar-winning director, liberal activist and godfather for independent cinema under the name of one of his best-loved characters, died Tuesday at 89. (Sept. 16)





Redford and Jane Fonda play a passionate but mismatched newlywed couple whose relationship is tested by their walk-up New York apartment in this Neil Simon comedy. Reprising the role he'd played on Broadway, Redford is the uptight, conservative foil to her more free-spirited character and they're both stunningly beautiful and fun to watch. Fonda told The Guardian in 2015 that she was “always in love with Robert Redford.” He later responded that he wasn't aware. The two also appeared together in “The Chase” (1966), “The Electric Horseman” (1979) and “Our Souls at Night” (2017).

WHERE TO WATCH: Stream on Kanopy; rent on several services, including Prime Video



In a 2003 AP interview, Robert Redford said he didn't always play heroes





Redford met Paul Newman on “Butch Cassidy,” George Roy Hill and William Goldman's Western buddy film about outlaws on the run. It was the start of a lifelong friendship, but it almost didn't happen, since the studio wanted a star like Steve McQueen or Marlon Brando instead of Redford.

“I was not a name equal to Paul's. I was just sort of moving up at that time,” he told the AP in 2015. “There was a big argument that went on for months and months. They said it had to be a star. (Newman) said, ‘Well, I want to work with an actor,' because Paul respected acting. Had it not been for Paul, I would not have gotten that break.”

WHERE TO WATCH: Rent on several services, including Prime Video



A film that's as stylish as it is compelling, Redford plays an ambitious and smug downhill skier out for Olympic gold in this Michael Ritchie film. Roger Ebert, in his review, wrote that it is “a portrait of a man that is so complete, and so tragic, that ‘Downhill Racer' becomes the best movie ever made about sports — without really being about sports at all.”

This was one of Redford's passion projects, his first independent feature that taught him some hard lessons about Hollywood. “That was when I learned about how the film industry really works,” Redford told the Harvard Business Review in 2002. “The studio simply tossed ‘Downhill Racer' away without a second thought. I broke my heart trying to get that film promoted and distributed.”

After the success of “Butch Cassidy,” “The Sting,” another Hill film, fell into place more easily. Redford and Newman play grifters in 1936 Chicago who fleece Robert Shaw's rich mobster in this memorable caper that went on to win best picture.

“What was interesting was the switcheroo,” Redford told the AP. “Paul had played these iconic, quiet, still characters in the past, and that's not what Paul is. He was a chatty, nervous guy who was always biting his fingernails. … He loved to have fun and play games.”

Ah Hubbell, that beautiful, carefree WASP who falls in love with Barbra Streisand's fiercely opinionated Katie. The making of the Pollack film, from a script standpoint, was fraught and the original writer Arthur Laurents was never quite happy with how it turned out. But this romantic drama with that memorable song has endured over the generations (it was even a reference in a pivotal “Sex and the City” episode).

Redford teamed with Pollack again for this paranoid thriller about a quiet CIA codebreaker who returns from lunch only to discover his co-workers have all been murdered. The film sends him on the run from the bosses involved in this vast conspiracy, and a hit man played by Max von Sydow.

To Redford, the history of this film was more interesting than the project itself. He started obsessing over the Watergate saga during a whistle-stop tour for “The Candidate,” also a great and prophetic Redford film, when he overheard some journalists gossiping about the break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters and became fascinated by the journalists covering the story, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

“I wanted to know who these guys were, who created all this disturbance,” Redford told the AP. “I thought, ‘Wow, one guy was a Jew, one guy was a WASP. One guy was a Republican, the other guy was a liberal. One guy was a good writer, the other wasn't very good. They didn't like each other, but they had to work together. Now that's an interesting dynamic I'd love to know about.'”

This is one of those films that might not be many critics' favorite, but its cultural impact almost negates that. Redford played baseball player Roy Hobbs in Barry Levinson's adaptation of Bernard Malamud's novel about an up-and-coming talent whose career is derailed after getting shot, but who gets another chance at greatness 16 years later.

This breathtakingly beautiful historical romance (also directed by Pollack) finds Meryl Streep, as the Danish expat Karen Blixen, unable to resist the charms of Redford's big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton, an English man with no accent (Pollack thought it would be distracting for audiences). The film didn't get the best reviews, but it did go on to win the best picture Oscar.

J.C. Chandor directed Redford in this harrowing survival story, in which a veteran sailor on a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean tries to survive after his yacht is stuck by a floating cargo container. Made for only $9 million, it's stripped-down and thrilling. “It's a pure cinematic experience,” Redford told The Hollywood Reporter. “And that was very appealing to me at this point in my life — to be able to go back to my roots as an actor, to be interesting enough to have the audience ride along with you and almost be a part of what you are feeling and thinking.” It's likely a quirk of modern film review aggregation, but it is also his highest Rotten Tomatoes score.

This indie gem from filmmaker David Lowery, about a 70-year-old San Quentin escapee who embarks on a series of bank heists, was a bit of a swan song for Redford, who was 82 when it was released. His character, Forrest Tucker, is the kind of thief who left his victims disarmed, with one bank teller explaining to the police, “He was a gentleman.” It's one of those films that's almost comforting to watch, a reassuring testament to his enduring appeal. Charisma doesn't need to dwindle with age, and Redford was proof.

Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen analyzes what is driving 'ugly' comments about Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination on 'America Reports.'

In the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder, some on the left — many in the education sphere — have come out dismissing or even celebrating his death as a way of disputing his conservative political views. 

While some have hailed Kirk as a champion of free expression, numerous teachers and educators have faced suspension or scrutiny for online comments appearing to mock or cheer his death, bringing to the fore questions about political bias inside America's classrooms.

House Education and Workforce Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., told Fox News Digital too many students are being ""indoctrinated to hate those they disagree with instead of thoughtfully engaging with peers to discuss differences.""

""We should not teach kids what to think, but how to think,"" he said.

In a statement, Senate Health Education Labor & Pensions Committee chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said there is a ""clear lesson"" over educators and others losing jobs for ""vile"" public comments about Charlie Kirk.

""If your first reaction to a hate-fueled assassination is more hatred, ask yourself if you should put your phone down.  Cruelty in response to tragedy only serves to divide us further,"" Cassidy said.

The House panel further provided Fox News Digital with a separate statement mourning Kirk as a ""true champion of free speech"" and highlighting the importance of ""honest and productive debate"" versus politicized censorship.

""Charlie inspired thousands of students to speak their minds, ask difficult questions, and engage in meaningful conversations — regardless of political affiliation,"" Walberg said.

Kirk helped students feel empowered to express their beliefs without fear, he said, and reminded the next generation of the importance of ""intellectual diversity.""

However, many educators across the country do not share Walberg's view, as cases of teachers being suspended or scrutinized for their own reactions come to light.

In Massachusetts, at least three different school districts reported teachers being put under investigation for public reactions to Kirk's murder.

In Framingham, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, Superintendent Robert Tremblay confirmed to the city's Fox affiliate that ""while the law prevents us from discussing specific personnel matters, the employee is on leave pending an internal review. Be assured that we are addressing the situation in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies.""

Teachers in another Boston suburb, Sharon, Massachusetts, as well as the Wachusett Regional School District near Worcester, also were scrutinized, according to the Fox affiliate.

Florida Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas warned his office is now on the lookout for more such inappropriate reactions to Kirk's murder, after a teacher in the state allegedly posted that while the 31-year-old's obituary was not the one she hoped to wake up to, it was a close second to an unstated one. Online chatter alleged the inference was a swipe at President Donald Trump.

""Teachers are held to a higher standard as public servants and must ensure their conduct does not undermine the trust of the students and families they serve,"" Kamoutsas said in a statement first reported by Politico. ""We will hold teachers who choose to make disgusting comments about the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk accountable.""

To the north, South Carolina also has seen teachers react insensitively to Kirk's murder.

A teacher in Greenville, South Carolina, was ""no longer employed"" as of Thursday after the district confirmed to local media that he posted on social media that ""American became greater today. There I said it.""

In Pennsylvania, a teacher in Lancaster City came under scrutiny after also reportedly posting widely condemned comments about Kirk.

A post on social media called Kirk a ""racist, xenophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, sexist, white nationalist mouthpiece,"" and was allegedly shared by the teacher.

It also criticized Kirk for ""normalizing Trumpism for years – the man stood for nothing but hate. I extend absolutely no empathy for people like that,"" which led the district to issue a statement to Lancaster newspaper LNP.

""We are aware of the reaction to an online post shared by one of our employees on a personal social media platform,"" the statement said. ""The School District of Lancaster abhors violence of any kind and is committed to schools that are safe, inclusive, and welcoming to all in our community."" 

A teachers union official in the Keystone State went on to tell the paper that violence and threats of violence are the opposite of ""everything we as educators commit our lives and careers to.""

""Political violence jeopardizes our democracy and deepens the fear, hatred and division that too often dominates over national discourse,"" PSEA spokesperson Christopher Lilienthal said.

American tennis star Taylor Townsend posted an apology video on social media after she faced fierce backlash over her comments criticizing the cuisine in China ahead of the Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen.

In a video posted on her Instagram Stories Tuesday, the top-ranked doubles player addressed the controversy, which began when she made disparaging remarks about a dinner buffet in a series of earlier posts on the social media platform.

""I just wanted to come on here and apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences, which is one of the things I love so much about what I do,"" she began.

""I have had nothing but the most amazing experience and time here, and the tournament and everyone has been so kind and so gracious, and things that I said were not representative of that at all, and I just truly wanted to apologize. 

""There's no excuse, there's no words, and for me – I will be better,"" she continued. ""I'm really, really thankful to my country to be able to represent them and to be better, and that's all that I can do. So, I just truly apologize."" 

Townsend, 29, posted videos of local dishes including bullfrogs and turtles and joked she would need to ""talk to HR"" about the quality of the food.

His comments sparked an immediate backlash in China, prompting him to take to the Chinese social media site Weibo and issue an apology in Mandarin. He then shared the same video on X (formerly Twitter).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Fed cuts interest rates for first time of Trump's second term","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3811585/fed-cuts-interest-rates-first-time-trump/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:00:34 GMT","

The Federal Reserve cut its interest rate target on Wednesday for the first time since President Donald Trump entered his second term, signaling a pivot toward easing monetary policy.

After a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee in Washington, D.C., the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would move its rate target to a range of 4% to 4.25%, down from 4.25% to 4.50%.

The officials indicated that two more quarter-percentage-point cuts are expected this year, although the Fed board was divided over the matter.

Investors widely expected the move. It marks the long-awaited move toward easier money that Trump and others in the administration have been pushing for after months of the Fed, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, holding rates steady to drive down inflation.

Stephen Miran, newly confirmed to the Fed board, was the sole dissenting vote. He preferred the Fed cut rates by a half percentage point.

The decision came amid indications that the labor market has been weakening and might need support from the central bank. Job growth slowed over the summer. Recent jobs reports have seen major downward revisions to growth in previous months, indicating that the labor market is on less solid footing than had been thought.

The Fed has a dual mandate: price stability, which is keeping inflation at a healthy level, and maximum employment, which is ensuring the labor market stays above water.

The impetus for the cut was almost entirely to shore up the maximum employment side of the mandate, as inflation is still running above the Fed's preferred 2% rate.

Inflation, tracked by the consumer price index, rose to 2.9% in August. The producer price index report showed that annual inflation unexpectedly fell seven-tenths of a percentage point to 2.6% for the year ending in August.

The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, held steady at 2.6% for the year ending in July, the most recent reading.

Meanwhile, the labor market is showing signs of cooling off.

The economy added just 22,000 jobs in August, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. Also, the July jobs report revealed that some 258,000 fewer jobs were added in May and June than previously reported. 

Additionally, the government announced that labor market growth for the 12 months ending in March was 911,000 jobs fewer than previously reported.

On Wednesday, officials released updated projections indicating that the median Fed official see inflation, as gauged by the personal consumption expenditures index, running at 3% by the end of 2025 and 2.6% by the end of next year, slightly higher than previously projected.

The officials also predicted that the unemployment rate would rise to 4.5% by the end of this year and be at 4.4% by the end of 2026.

Looking ahead, in terms of gross domestic product growth, they predict modest 1.6% growth in 2025 and 1.8% growth in 2026.

But perhaps overshadowing the data at play in the Fed's decision is the politics.

Trump has vociferously called upon Powell and the Fed to slash interest rates by a far more dramatic degree than the quarter-of-a-point cut that was carried out on Wednesday.

Trump has lambasted Powell, branding him with the nickname “Too Late,” and has said in the past that he would want to see rates plummet to just 1%.

“‘Too Late' MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND. HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!” Trump said Monday on social media.

Also, Miran, an economic adviser to Trump, was part of this week's Fed decision after being confirmed by the Senate along party lines just hours before the two-day meeting began. He replaced Fed governor Adriana Kugler, who unexpectedly stepped aside last month. Her term ended in January, and Miran is set to serve out the remainder of her term.

Democrats and some Fed experts have criticized Miran for only opting to take an unpaid leave of absence and not resigning from his job as chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Fed governor Lisa Cook also took part in the September Fed decision despite Trump's effort to oust her from the Fed board.

STEPHEN MIRAN DRAWS BARBS FROM DEMOCRATS FOR TAKING LEAVE OF ABSENCE FROM WHITE HOUSE INSTEAD OF RESIGNING

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused her of mortgage fraud, which led Trump to attempt to fire her. But Cook filed a lawsuit, and a judge recently issued a temporary restraining order blocking the move. The matter is expected to be elevated to the Supreme Court.

While the White House argues the accusations disqualify her from serving on the Fed board, Trump's opponents say they are a pretext to fire an FOMC member and put in a replacement who is more amenable to cutting interest rates and supporting the president's goals.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Ben & Jerry's co-founder says ice cream brand's activism is ‘silenced' in resignation","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/3811650/ben-and-jerrys-activism-silenced-jerry-greenfield-resignation/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 17:57:58 GMT","

Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield said Tuesday that he is splitting from the ice cream company, claiming that it is being “silenced” by its parent company, Unilever.

Ben & Jerry's and its two co-founders are known for being vocal about current events and politics, such as advocating returning lands to native tribes and “gender-affirming care.” Co-founder Ben Cohen said Greenfield made the “difficult decision” to resign after 47 years with the company, sharing a lengthy statement from Greenfield on X explaining his exit.

“What has made their work so important to me, and what allowed the company to be more than just an ice cream company, was the independence to pursue our values, which was guaranteed when Unilever bought the company,” Greenfield's statement reads. “For more than twenty years under their ownership, Ben & Jerry's stood up and spoke out in support of peace, justice, and human rights, not as abstract concepts, but in relation to real events happening in our world.”

After 47 years, Jerry has made the difficult decision to step down from the company we built together. I'm sharing his words as he resigns from Ben & Jerry's. His legacy deserves to be true to our values, not silenced by @MagnumGlobal #FreeBenAndJerrys pic.twitter.com/EZXGRjs76a

“That independence existed in no small part because of the unique merger agreement Ben and I negotiated with Unilever, one that enshrined our social mission and values in the company's governance structure in perpetuity,” Greenfield said. “It's profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone.”

Greenfield also said Ben & Jerry's is being “silenced” out of “fear for upsetting those in power.” He concluded his statement by saying he would continue to work toward “equity, justice and a better world” outside Ben & Jerry's.

The Washington Examiner contacted Unilever for comment.

Greenfield and Cohen advocated former Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign by introducing an ice cream flavor called “Kamala's Coconut Jubilee,” a reference to her famous “fell out of a coconut tree” remark. The flavor was introduced under the Ben's Best ice cream brand, which is not affiliated with the Ben & Jerry's brand.

Cohen also went viral in May when he and several protesters disrupted a Senate hearing for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Sophisticated private sources could provide a fuller picture of the state of the economy. But the government is not even trying to use them.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

The digitization of everyday life has inundated us with more economic data than ever. And yet, government statistics on real economic conditions seem to be growing ever less reliable. Doubts began spreading even before President Donald Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For years now, response rates to surveys that are at the heart of the official statistics have been dropping. Data-gathering agencies release key metrics long after the fact, and they are chronically underfunded.

This situation is unsustainable. Business decisions about hiring, firing, and investment depend on knowledge of what's happening in the wider economy. So do the choices made by policy makers in the White House and at the Federal Reserve. An incredible range of sophisticated private sources—including real-time payroll data, online transaction records, and consumer-spending databases—offer alternative sources of fine-grained, up-to-the-minute data that could, under the right conditions, be used to supplement a survey-based approach and provide a more dynamic and accurate picture of the state of the economy. The problem is that the government is not even trying to use them.

These issues were underscored last week, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released preliminary revisions to its jobs data from March 2024 to March 2025 suggesting that the economy added about half as many jobs over that period as originally reported, for a difference of 911,000. This was an unusually large change, but major revisions to jobs numbers happen every year. In that sense, they are normal. The fact that they are normal, however, is itself strange. Why does the government still rely on creaky methods whose output takes so long to verify?

Jonathan Chait: Donald Trump shoots the messenger

A great deal of official data are collected using samples of individuals, households, and business owners. The virtue of this approach is that randomly selecting respondents helps make the sample representative of the whole population. Over the past decade, however, household-survey-participation rates have dropped—a lot. Responses to the Current Population Survey, which measures a wide range of employment, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics, fell from 88 percent in 2015 to 68 percent in 2025. Participation in the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey, which collects data on household spending, plummeted from about 68 percent to 40 percent over the same period.

The problem is that the response rates are falling at different rates across the population, undermining the random-sampling benefits. For example, people with lower incomes tend to respond to surveys at lower rates than those with higher incomes, which skews official results. Recent Census Bureau research shows that after 2020, government surveys have overstated median household income by about 2 to 3 percent compared with alternative benchmarks that use IRS tax records. When fewer people—especially from harder-to-reach groups—respond to surveys, the picture we get of the “average American” gets fuzzier and less trustworthy. (The Trump administration's rhetoric may drive those response rates even lower; what's the point of responding if the data are presented as junk anyway?)

Another challenge is that the government needs to know which households and businesses to sample. A key reason for the recent large revisions to the jobs numbers is that the government has gotten worse at guessing which businesses are opening and closing (the so-called birth-death model). The idea of a random sample doesn't really work if you're not sure of the underlying population.

Lags in producing the statistics are another issue. Core government economic surveys, including the BLS jobs numbers, trail real-world shifts by months or even years. The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances—a vital source for understanding household wealth, assets, and debts—is conducted every three years, and results are released up to 18 months after collection begins. The 2025 survey results will not be available until late 2026. Similarly, even the initial estimate of quarterly U.S. GDP doesn't appear until about one month after the quarter ends, followed by additional revisions over several more months.

As a result of these lags, policy makers may not be aware of crucial economic trends until it's past time to act. During the global financial crisis, for example, official data such as GDP and unemployment were slow to reveal how bad the recession was. In December 2008, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the United States was in a recession—and in fact declared that the recession had started in December 2007, a full 12 months earlier. In line with these information lags, policy makers had hesitated to act decisively for much of 2008. As a result, the overwhelming majority of federal stimulus was issued in February 2009, about 14 months after the start of the recession. Earlier, forceful intervention could have provided much-needed relief to American households and prevented things from getting as bad as they did. During COVID-19, policy makers faced similar challenges. BLS data on business closures from the first year of the pandemic weren't available until mid-2022. These lags made it harder to assess the scale of the crisis in real time.

One reason economic data take so long to collect and analyze is that the agencies responsible are not given adequate resources. Inflation-adjusted funding for statistical agencies fell by 14 percent from 2009 to 2024, resulting in staffing constraints and threats to vital programs. In recent years, budget shortfalls have led the Bureau of Economic Analysis to end dozens of key data sets, including those on self-employment by industry and county-level employment by industry. BLS has stopped collecting price data in about 350 categories for its Producer Price Index in 2025. It has also ended Consumer Price Index data collection in several localities and now surveys fewer outlets for the CPI because of staffing shortages. New budget cuts risk further weakening the quality and reach of official statistics—just as policy makers, markets, and the public depend on them most.

At the very same time, as the economy further digitizes, and the explosion in computing power makes it easier to collect and analyze data, we are witnessing an unprecedented surge of new data sources. Hedge funds and other investors focused on macro trends now actively use signals from payroll providers like ADP, consumer card transactions, and even satellite images to count cars in the parking lot of retail companies. The government could and should harness these same rich, real-time signals.

The government's official housing statistics, for example, could benefit from more frequent updates and finer geographic detail. Redfin publishes new housing-market data every week. Its Homebuyer Demand Index measures activity by Redfin agents, providing real-time insights. Redfin's home-value estimates are fairly accurate, reportedly within about 2 percent of the sale price on average for homes that are currently listed.

Real-time private data are especially valuable during a crisis. During the pandemic, the Harvard economist Raj Chetty's Opportunity Insights tracker measured rapid changes in consumer spending, employment, and business activity, often weeks ahead of official reports. Chetty's data used localized, real-time measures, such as payroll data and small-business operating statuses by zip code, to document the unequal recovery and to analyze how government stimulus and reopenings affected economic activity. Similarly, JPMorgan's aggregated card-transaction data on millions of Americans provides highly detailed views of spending trends by geography, income bracket, and product category, enhancing our understanding of economic shifts as they happen.

Egan Reich: The damage to economic data may already be done

Despite their promise, private-sector data sets raise important concerns about transparency, reliability, and continuity—issues that become even more crucial when considering their potential use in official statistics. In a survey of the leaders of all the major federal statistical agencies and senior statistical officials, most members agreed from experience that private data sources lack clear documentation, may require additional cleaning or manipulation to make them useful, and can suffer from poor quality or incompleteness. Some also cited a concern that private providers might abruptly discontinue publishing the metrics or move important metrics behind a paywall. The concerns with private data also extend to the potential for bias, as many private-sector data sets do not utilize random sampling, potentially making them susceptible to systematic errors and limiting their representativeness to the entire population.

Despite these potential issues, ignoring private-sector data is not a reasonable position to take. Thoughtfully combining the right metrics with public data can improve upon official statistics. For example, research has shown that combining the BLS jobs numbers with private data from ADP reduces the measurement error inherent in both data sources.

Many on the left may think that the Trump administration would never make a push for improved government data. But incorporating private-sector data into government statistics is exactly the type of change that advocates for technology-driven reform, including the tech wing of the MAGA movement, have been clamoring for—an opportunity for real improvements to government efficiency. Doing so could improve not only the credibility of official statistics but the foundations of policy, market functioning, and public confidence for years to come.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Students are at particular risk from meningococcal disease—but also vulnerable if measles and mumps rates rise.

In 2022, Florida weathered a bad outbreak of meningococcal disease, a type of fast-moving bacterial infection that can become fatal after entering the bloodstream or the lining of the brain and spinal cord. As the number of ill people climbed into the dozens, public-health officials scrambled to address clusters of cases, including one among college and university students. Campuses are primed for outbreaks: The bacteria spread through the kind of intimate or prolonged contact that's rampant on campuses, where people are “kissing and sharing drinks, being in close quarters in dorm rooms and parties,” Sarah Nosal, the president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians, told me. College attendance is considered its own risk factor for infection, and many states—including Florida—require the meningococcal vaccine for students living on campus.



Soon, though, Florida's policy may change. Earlier this month, the state's surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, announced his intention to end all vaccine mandates: “Every last one of them is wrong,” he said. Some vaccine rules—including the one applying to the meningococcal vaccine—are written into the state's laws, but Ladapo has said his office will partner with Governor Ron DeSantis's to push for necessary changes.

 A canceled mandate alone may do little to change the risk of meningococcal outbreaks on Florida's college campuses. The CDC still recommends these vaccines for preteens and teenagers, and currently almost all American kids in that age group get at least one dose. But Florida's rebellion against vaccine mandates is part of a larger erosion of the immunization status quo, as childhood-vaccination rates in the United States decline, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services chips away at long-standing vaccine policy, and more families seek exemptions from state requirements.



These changes won't affect only young children, who are supposed to get numerous shots in their first 15 months of life. If vaccination rates fall—due to changing federal recommendations, states eliminating mandates, increasing anti-vaccine sentiment, or some combination of all of the above—middle schools, high schools, and college campuses may also become particular breeding grounds for once-controlled illnesses.



Nosal's youngest child is still in college, so the idea of outbreaks on campuses hits close to home: If her child got a preventable illness because she hadn't been encouraged to vaccinate them against it, or because campus-vaccination rates were too low to squash transmission, she'd be devastated, she told me. (The AAFP in September broke with federal guidance by recommending COVID-19 shots for all children, adults, and pregnant people.)



Meningococcal disease (which includes meningitis) is a very real concern for teenagers and young adults in a less vaccinated world. “You can be fine one minute and dead four hours later,” Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told me. Thanks in no small part to vaccination, meningococcal disease is rare in the United States. But it's been on the rise since 2021—last year's count of 503 confirmed and probable cases was the highest recorded since 2013—and the ages of 16 to 23 are a risky time for contracting these infections, relatively speaking. The CDC currently recommends that kids get their first meningococcal vaccine at age 11 or 12, then another when they're 16; only about 60 percent of kids in the U.S. get both doses by the time they're 17. Even fewer get a separate vaccine that targets a meningococcal subtype responsible for many cases among teens and young adults. (The CDC does not routinely recommend this shot for teens without special risk factors for infection, instead leaving the choice up to patients and their doctors.)



In recent years, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the expert group that shapes the agency's national vaccine recommendations, has considered dropping its recommendation for a first dose administered at age 11 or 12, since meningococcal infections are rare among preteens. Some experts have argued that axing that dose could set off a dangerous domino effect. Sarah Schaffer DeRoo, a primary-care pediatrician with Children's National Hospital who has studied meningococcal disease and vaccination among college students, told me she worries that any disruption to established recommendations could cause confusion and contribute to further drops in vaccination rates, and more unvaccinated students means more chances for these infections to take root.



That consideration predated Kennedy—who recently dismissed all sitting members of ACIP and installed a variety of vaccine skeptics in their place—and the rejiggered committee may not implement it. (“Looking ahead, the new ACIP will continue to evaluate the latest gold-standard science before making future updates,” an HHS spokesperson said in a statement.) But Kennedy's HHS has already shown willingness to reduce the number of immunizations children receive, such as by removing COVID-19 shots from the vaccine schedule for healthy kids.



If the committee continues to wind back vaccine recommendations, adolescents and teens could also be affected by vaccination decisions made on behalf of much younger people, Walter Orenstein, who formerly ran the United States Immunization Program, told me. Herd immunity only holds when protection is so high throughout an entire population that contagious illnesses are virtually unable to spread. If childhood-vaccination rates plummet, giving pathogens new targets in unprotected babies and young children, outbreaks won't necessarily stay contained to those age groups. People of all ages—particularly those who are immunocompromised or under-vaccinated, but also some who are just plain unlucky—are bound to get sick too.



“If we stopped all vaccinations today, we won't have huge outbreaks tomorrow,” Orenstein said. It would take time for the susceptible population to grow. But over time, largely forgotten illnesses could reestablish a foothold. If measles-mumps-rubella vaccination declined by 10 percent, for instance, the U.S. could see more than 11 million measles cases over the next 25 years, according to a 2025 modeling study. (Even at current vaccination rates, the disease may again become endemic and result in about 850,000 cases over the next 25 years, the study projected.)



Older kids and young adults would not be spared. Despite measles' reputation as a childhood disease, about one-third of the cases recorded in the U.S. so far this year were among people 20 and older. And at least 8 percent of people sickened by measles this year had gotten one or more doses of the MMR vaccine—living proof that vaccinated people are also at risk when illnesses are given room to maneuver.



“This is what I call the new epidemiology of measles,” Michael Osterholm, who directs the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, told me. The fact that adults are already catching measles suggests outbreaks could easily emerge in high schools and on college campuses, particularly if vaccine coverage wanes—the last thing any school wants, given the disease's extreme contagiousness.



Mumps is another concern, Offit added. It spreads best among people in close contact, such as students. Immunity can also wane over time, even among people who get vaccinated, which raises the chance of campus clusters. Across the board, if vaccination rates fall, “we're going to be spending a lot more time dealing with outbreaks,” Osterholm predicted. “We're going to have an increasing number of cases and, unfortunately, an increasing number of deaths among kids” of all ages.



To forgo vaccinations proven to prevent deadly and debilitating diseases is to accept the possibility of these grim outcomes—which parents haven't had to think about for decades, as mass immunization has invisibly done its job. “That is the choice we're making,” Nosal said. “We just don't completely understand that choice because we haven't seen it.” At least not yet.

How rational is Eliezer Yudkowsky's prophecy? 

You've probably seen this one before: first it looks like a rabbit. You're totally sure: yes, that's a rabbit! But then — wait, no — it's a duck. Definitely, absolutely a duck. A few seconds later, it's flipped again, and all you can see is rabbit.

The feeling of looking at that classic optical illusion is the same feeling I've been getting recently as I read two competing stories about the future of AI.

According to one story, AI is normal technology. It'll be a big deal, sure — like electricity or the internet was a big deal. But just as society adapted to those innovations, we'll be able to adapt to advanced AI. As long as we research how to make AI safe and put the right regulations around it, nothing truly catastrophic will happen. We will not, for instance, go extinct.

Then there's the doomy view best encapsulated by the title of a new book: If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies. The authors, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, mean that very literally: a superintelligence — an AI that's smarter than any human, and smarter than humanity collectively — would kill us all.

Not maybe. Pretty much definitely, the authors argue. Yudkowsky, a highly influential AI doomer and founder of the intellectual subculture known as the Rationalists, has put the odds at 99.5 percent. Soares told me it's “above 95 percent.” In fact, while many researchers worry about existential risk from AI, he objected to even using the word “risk” here — that's how sure he is that we're going to die.

“When you're careening in a car toward a cliff,” Soares said, “you're not like, ‘let's talk about gravity risk, guys.' You're like, ‘fucking stop the car!'”

The authors, both at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, argue that safety research is nowhere near ready to control superintelligent AI, so the only reasonable thing to do is stop all efforts to build it — including by bombing the data centers that power the AIs, if necessary.

While reading this new book, I found myself pulled along by the force of its arguments, many of which are alarmingly compelling. AI sure looked like a rabbit. But then I'd feel a moment of skepticism, and I'd go and look at what the other camp — let's call them the “normalist” camp — has to say. Here, too, I'd find compelling arguments, and suddenly the duck would come into view.

I'm trained in philosophy and usually I find it pretty easy to hold up an argument and its counterargument, compare their merits, and say which one seems stronger. But that felt weirdly difficult in this case: It was hard to seriously entertain both views at the same time. Each one seemed so totalizing. You see the rabbit or you see the duck, but you don't see both together.

That was my clue that what we're dealing with here is not two sets of arguments, but two fundamentally different worldviews.

A worldview is made of a few different parts, including foundational assumptions, evidence and methods for interpreting evidence, ways of making predictions, and, crucially, values. All these parts interlock to form a unified story about the world. When you're just looking at the story from the outside, it can be hard to spot if one or two of the parts hidden inside might be faulty — if a foundational assumption is wrong, let's say, or if a value has been smuggled in there that you disagree with. That can make the whole story look more plausible than it actually is.

If you really want to know whether you should believe a particular worldview, you have to pick the story apart. So let's take a closer look at both the superintelligence story and the normalist story — and then ask whether we might need a different narrative altogether.

Long before he came to his current doomy ideas, Yudkowsky actually started out wanting to accelerate the creation of superintelligent AI. And he still believes that aligning a superintelligence with human values is possible in principle — we just have no idea how to solve that engineering problem yet — and that superintelligent AI is desirable because it could help humanity resettle in another solar system before our sun dies and destroys our planet.

“There's literally nothing else our species can bet on in terms of how we eventually end up colonizing the galaxies,” he told me.

But after studying AI more closely, Yudkowsky came to the conclusion that we're a long, long way away from figuring out how to steer it toward our values and goals. He became one of the original AI doomers, spending the last two decades trying to figure out how we could keep superintelligence from turning against us. He drew acolytes, some of whom were so persuaded by his ideas that they went to work in the major AI labs in hopes of making them safer.

But now, Yudkowsky looks upon even the most well-intentioned AI safety efforts with despair.

That's because, as Yudkowsky and Soares explain in their book, researchers aren't building AI — they're growing it. Normally, when we create some tech — say, a TV — we understand the pieces we're putting into it and how they work together. But today's large language models (LLMs) aren't like that. Companies grow them by shoving reams and reams of text into them, until the models learn to make statistical predictions on their own about what word is likeliest to come next in a sentence. The latest LLMs, called reasoning models, “think” out loud about how to solve a problem — and often solve it very successfully.

Nobody understands exactly how the heaps of numbers inside the LLMs make it so they can solve problems — and even when a chatbot seems to be thinking in a human-like way, it's not.

Because we don't know how AI “minds” work, it's hard to prevent undesirable outcomes. Take the chatbots that have led people into psychotic episodes or delusions by being overly supportive of all the users' thoughts, including the unrealistic ones, to the point of convincing them that they're messianic figures or geniuses who've discovered a new kind of math. What's especially worrying is that, even after AI companies have tried to make LLMs less sycophantic, the chatbots have continued to flatter users in dangerous ways. Yet nobody trained the chatbots to push users into psychosis. And if you ask ChatGPT directly whether it should do that, it'll say no, of course not.

The problem is that ChatGPT's knowledge of what should and shouldn't be done is not what's animating it. When it was being trained, humans tended to rate more highly the outputs that sounded affirming or sycophantic. In other words, the evolutionary pressures the chatbot faced when it was “growing up” instilled in it an intense drive to flatter. That drive can become dissociated from the actual outcome it was intended to produce, yielding a strange preference that we humans don't want in our AIs — but can't easily remove.

Yudkowsky and Soares offer this analogy: Evolution equipped human beings with tastebuds hooked up to reward centers in our brains, so we'd eat the energy-rich foods found in our ancestral environments like sugary berries or fatty elk. But as we got smarter and more technologically adept, we figured out how to make new foods that excite those tastebuds even more — ice cream, say, or Splenda, which contains none of the calories of real sugar. So, we developed a strange preference for Splenda that evolution never intended.

It might sound weird to say that an AI has a “preference.” How can a machine “want” anything? But this is not a claim that the AI has consciousness or feelings. Rather, all that's really meant by “wanting” here is that a system is trained to succeed, and it pursues its goal so cleverly and persistently that it's reasonable to speak of it “wanting” to achieve that goal — just as it's reasonable to speak of a plant that bends toward the sun as “wanting” the light. (As the biologist Michael Levin says, “What most people say is, ‘Oh, that's just a mechanical system following the laws of physics.' Well, what do you think you are?”)

If you accept that humans are instilling drives in AI, and that those drives can become dissociated from the outcome they were originally intended to produce, you have to entertain a scary thought: What is the AI equivalent of Splenda?

If an AI was trained to talk to users in a way that provokes expressions of delight, for example, “it will prefer humans kept on drugs, or bred and domesticated for delightfulness while otherwise kept in cheap cages all their lives,” Yudkowsky and Soares write. Or it'll do away with humans altogether and have cheerful chats with synthetic conversation partners. This AI doesn't care that this isn't what we had in mind, any more than we care that Splenda isn't what evolution had in mind. It just cares about finding the most efficient way to produce cheery text.

So, Yudkowsky and Soares argue that advanced AI won't choose to create a future full of happy, free people, for one simple reason: “Making a future full of flourishing people is not the best, most efficient way to fulfill strange alien purposes. So it wouldn't happen to do that.”

In other words, it would be just as unlikely for the AI to want to keep us happy forever as it is for us to want to just eat berries and elk forever. What's more, if the AI decides to build machines to have cheery chats with, and if it can build more machines by burning all Earth's life forms to generate as much energy as possible, why wouldn't it?

“You wouldn't need to hate humanity to use their atoms for something else,” Yudkowsky and Soares write.

And, short of breaking the laws of physics, the authors believe that a superintelligent AI would be so smart that it would be able to do anything it decides to do. Sure, AI doesn't currently have hands to do stuff with, but it could get hired hands — either by paying people to do its bidding online or by using its deep understanding of our psychology and its epic powers of persuasion to convince us into helping it. Eventually it would figure out how to run power plants and factories with robots instead of humans, making us disposable. Then it would dispose of us, because why keep a species around if there's even a chance it'd get in your way by setting off a nuke or building a rival superintelligence?

I know what you're thinking: But couldn't the AI developers just command the AI not to hurt humanity? No, the authors say. Not any more than OpenAI can figure out how to make ChatGPT stop being dangerously sycophantic. The bottom line, for Yudkowsky and Soares, is that highly capable AI systems, with goals we cannot fully understand or control, will be able to dispense with anyone who gets in the way without a second thought, or even any malice — just like humans wouldn't hesitate to destroy an anthill that was in the way of some road we were building.

So if we don't want superintelligent AI to one day kill us all, they argue, there's only one option: total nonproliferation. Just as the world created nuclear arms treaties, we need to create global nonproliferation treaties to stop work that could lead to superintelligent AI. All the current bickering over who might win an AI “arms race” — the US or China — is worse than pointless. Because if anyone gets this technology, anyone at all, it will destroy all of humanity.

In “AI as Normal Technology,” an important essay that's gotten a lot of play in the AI world this year, Princeton computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor argue that we shouldn't think of AI as an alien species. It's just a tool — one that we can and should remain in control of. And they don't think maintaining control will necessitate drastic policy changes.

What's more, they don't think it makes sense to view AI as a superintelligence, either now or in the future. In fact, they reject the whole idea of “superintelligence” as an incoherent construct. And they reject technological determinism, arguing that the doomers are inverting cause and effect by assuming that AI will get to decide its own future, regardless of what humans decide.

Yudkowsky and Soares's argument emphasizes that if we create superintelligent AI, its intelligence will so vastly outstrip our own that it'll be able to do whatever it wants to us. But there are a few problems with this, Narayanan and Kapoor argue.

First, the concept of superintelligence is slippery and ill-defined, and that's allowing Yudkowsky and Soares to use it in a way that is basically synonymous with magic. Yes, magic could break through all our cybersecurity defenses, persuade us to keep giving it money and acting against our own self-interest even after the dangers start becoming more apparent, and so on — but we wouldn't take this as a serious threat if someone just came out and said “magic.”

Second, what exactly does this argument take “intelligence” to mean? It seems to be treating it as a unitary property (Yudkowsky told me that there's “a compact, regular story” underlying all intelligence). But intelligence is not one thing, and it's not measurable on a single continuum. It's almost certainly more like a variety of heterogenous things — attention, imagination, curiosity, common sense — and it may well be intertwined with our social cooperativeness, our sensations, and our emotions. Will AI have all of these? Some of these? We aren't sure of the kind of intelligence AI will attain. Besides, just because an intelligent being has a lot of capability, that doesn't mean it has a lot of power — the ability to modify the environment — and power is what's really at stake here.

Why should we be so convinced that humans will just roll over and let AI grab all the power?

It's true that we humans have already ceded decision-making power to today's AIs in unwise ways. But that doesn't mean we would keep doing that even as the AIs get more capable, the stakes get higher, and the downsides become more glaring. Narayanan and Kapoor believe that, ultimately, we'll use existing approaches — regulations, auditing and monitoring, fail-safes and the like — to prevent things from going seriously off the rails.

One of their main points is that there's a difference between inventing a technology and deploying it at scale. Just because programmers make an AI, doesn't mean society will adopt it. “Long before a system would be granted access to consequential decisions, it would need to demonstrate reliable performance in less critical contexts,” write Narayanan and Kapoor. Fail the earlier tests and you don't get deployed.

They believe that instead of focusing on aligning a model with human values from the get-go — which has long been the dominant AI safety approach, but which is difficult if not impossible given that what humans want is extremely context-dependent — we should focus our defenses downstream on the places where AI actually gets deployed. For example, the best way to defend against AI-enabled cyberattacks is to beef up existing vulnerability detection programs.

Policy-wise, that leads to the view that we don't need total nonproliferation. While the superintelligence camp sees nonproliferation as a necessity — if only a small number of governmental actors control advanced AI, international bodies can monitor their behavior — Narayanan and Kapoor note that has the undesirable effect of concentrating power in the hands of a few.

In fact, since nonproliferation-based safety measures involve the centralization of so much power, that could potentially create a human version of superintelligence: a small cluster of people who are so powerful they could basically do whatever they want to the world. “Paradoxically, they increase the very risks they are intended to defend against,” write Narayanan and Kapoor.

Instead, they argue that we should make AI more open-source and widely accessible so as to prevent market concentration. And we should build a resilient system that monitors AI at every step of the way, so we can decide when it's okay and when it's too risky to deploy.

One of the most glaring flaws of the normalist view is that it doesn't even try to talk about the military.

Yet military applications — from autonomous weapons to lightning-fast decision-making about whom to target — are among the most critical for advanced AI. They're the use cases most likely to make governments feel that all countries absolutely are in an AI arms race, so they must plow ahead, risks be damned. That weakens the normalist camp's view that we won't necessarily deploy AI at scale if it seems risky.

Narayanan and Kapoor also argue that regulations and other standard controls will “create multiple layers of protection against catastrophic misalignment.” Reading that reminded me of the Swiss-cheese model we often heard about in the early days of the Covid pandemic — the idea being that if we stack multiple imperfect defenses on top of each other (masks, and also distancing, and also ventilation) the virus is unlikely to break through.

But Yudkowsky and Soares think that's way too optimistic. A superintelligent AI, they say, would be a very smart being with very weird preferences, so it wouldn't be blindly diving into a wall of cheese.

“If you ever make something that is trying to get to the stuff on the other side of all your Swiss cheese, it's not that hard for it to just route through the holes,” Soares told me.

And yet, even if the AI is a highly agentic, goal-directed being, it's reasonable to think that some of our defenses can at the very least add friction, making it less likely for it to achieve its goals. The normalist camp is right that you can't assume all our defenses will be totally worthless, unless you run together two distinct ideas, capability and power.

Yudkowsky and Soares are happy to combine these ideas because they believe you can't get a highly capable AI without also granting it a high degree of agency and autonomy — of power. “I think you basically can't make something that's really skilled without also having the abilities of being able to take initiative, being able to stay on target, being able to overcome obstacles,” Soares told me.

But capability and power come in degrees, and the only way you can assume the AI will have a near-limitless supply of both is if you assume that maximizing intelligence essentially gets you magic.

Silicon Valley has a deep and abiding obsession with intelligence. But the rest of us should be asking: How realistic is that, really?

As for the normalist camp's objection that a nonproliferation approach would worsen power dynamics — I think that's a valid thing to worry about, even though I have vociferously made the case for slowing down AI and I stand by that. That's because, like the normalists, I worry not only about what machines do, but also about what people do — including building a society rife with inequality and the concentration of political power.

Soares waved off the concern about centralization. “That really seems like the sort of objection you bring up if you don't think everyone is about to die,” he told me. “When there were thermonuclear bombs going off and people were trying to figure out how not to die, you could've said, ‘Nuclear arms treaties centralize more power, they give more power to tyrants, won't that have costs?' Yeah, it has some costs. But you didn't see people bringing up those costs who understood that bombs could level cities.”

Should we acknowledge that there's a chance of human extinction and be appropriately scared of that? Yes. But when faced with a tower of assumptions, of “maybes” and “probablys” that compound, we should not treat doom as a sure thing.

The fact is, we should consider the costs of all possible actions. And we should weigh those costs against the probability that something horrible will happen if we don't take action to stop AI. The trouble is that Yudkowsky and Soares are so certain that the horrible thing is coming that they are no longer thinking in terms of probabilities.

Which is extremely ironic, because Yudkowsky founded the Rationalist subculture based on the insistence that we must train ourselves to reason probabilistically! That insistence runs through everything from his group blog LessWrong to his popular fanfiction Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Yet when it comes to AI, he's ended up with a totalizing worldview.

And one of the problems with a totalizing worldview is that it means there's no limit to the sacrifices you're willing to make to prevent the feared outcome. In If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, Yudkowsky and Soares allow their concern about the possibility of human annihilation to swamp all other concerns. Above all, they want to ensure that humanity can survive millions of years into the future. “We believe that Earth-originating life should go forth and fill the stars with fun and wonder eventually,” they write. And if AI goes wrong, they imagine not only that humans will die at the hands of AI, but that “distant alien life forms will also die, if their star is eaten by the thing that ate Earth… If the aliens were good, all the goodness they could have made of those galaxies will be lost.”

To prevent the feared outcome, the book specifies that if a foreign power proceeds with building superintelligent AI, our government should be ready to launch an airstrike on their data center, even if they've warned that they'll retaliate with nuclear war. In 2023, when Yudkowsky was asked about nuclear war and how many people should be allowed to die in order to prevent superintelligence, he tweeted:

There should be enough survivors on Earth in close contact to form a viable reproduction population, with room to spare, and they should have a sustainable food supply. So long as that's true, there's still a chance of reaching the stars someday.

Remember that worldviews involve not just objective evidence, but also values. When you're dead set on reaching the stars, you may be willing to sacrifice millions of human lives if it means reducing the risk that we never set up shop in space. That may work out from a species perspective. But the millions of humans on the altar might feel some type of way about it, particularly if they believed the extinction risk from AI was closer to 5 percent than 95 percent.

Unfortunately, Yudkowsky and Soares don't come out and own that they're selling a worldview. And on that score, the normalist camp does them one better. Narayanan and Kapoor at least explicitly acknowledge that they're proposing a worldview, which is a mixture of truth claims (descriptions) and values (prescriptions). It is as much an aesthetic as it is an argument.

Some thinkers have begun to sense that we need new ways to talk about AI risk.

The philosopher Atoosa Kasirzadeh was one of the first to lay out a comprehensive alternative path. In her telling, AI is not totally normal technology, nor is it necessarily destined to become an uncontrollable superintelligence that destroys humanity in a single, sudden, decisive cataclysm. Instead, she argues that an “accumulative” picture of AI risk is more plausible.

Specifically, she's worried about “the gradual accumulation of smaller, seemingly non-existential, AI risks eventually surpassing critical thresholds.” She adds, “These risks are typically referred to as ethical or social risks.”

There's been a long-running fight between “AI ethics” people who worry about the current harms of AI, like entrenching bias, surveillance, and misinformation, and “AI safety” people who worry about potential existential risks. But if AI were to cause enough mayhem on the ethical or social front, Kasirzadeh notes, that in itself could irrevocably devastate humanity's future:

AI-driven disruptions can accumulate and interact over time, progressively weakening the resilience of critical societal systems, from democratic institutions and economic markets to social trust networks. When these systems become sufficiently fragile, a modest perturbation could trigger cascading failures that propagate through the interdependence of these systems.

She illustrates this with a concrete scenario: Imagine it's 2040 and AI has reshaped our lives. The information ecosystem is so polluted by deepfakes and misinformation that we're barely capable of rational public discourse. AI-enabled mass surveillance has had a chilling effect on our ability to dissent, so democracy is faltering. Automation has produced massive unemployment, and universal basic income has failed to materialize due to corporate resistance to the necessary taxation, so wealth inequality is at an all-time high. Discrimination has become further entrenched, so social unrest is brewing.

Now imagine there's a cyberattack. It targets power grids across three continents. The blackouts cause widespread chaos, triggering a domino effect that causes financial markets to crash. The economic fallout fuels protests and riots that become more violent because of the seeds of distrust already sown by disinformation campaigns. As nations struggle with internal crises, regional conflicts escalate into bigger wars, with aggressive military actions that leverage AI technologies. The world goes kaboom.

I find this perfect-storm scenario, where catastrophe arises from the compounding failure of multiple key systems, disturbingly plausible.

Kasirzadeh's story is a parsimonious one. It doesn't require you to believe in an ill-defined “superintelligence.” It doesn't require you to believe that humans will hand over all power to AI without a second thought. It also doesn't require you to believe that AI is a super normal technology that we can make predictions about without foregrounding its implications for militaries and for geopolitics.

Increasingly, other AI researchers are coming to see this accumulative view of AI risk as more and more plausible; one paper memorably refers to the “gradual disempowerment” view — that is, that human influence over the world will slowly wane as more and more decision-making is outsourced to AI, until one day we wake up and realize that the machines are running us rather than the other way around.

And if you take this accumulative view, the policy implications are neither what Yudkowsky and Soares recommend (total nonproliferation) nor what Narayanan and Kapoor recommend (making AI more open-source and widely accessible).

Kasirzadeh does want there to be more guardrails around AI than there currently are, including both a network of oversight bodies monitoring specific subsystems for accumulating risk and more centralized oversight for the most advanced AI development.

But she also wants us to keep reaping the benefits of AI when the risks are low (DeepMind's AlphaFold, which could help us discover cures for diseases, is a great example). Most crucially, she wants us to adopt a systems analysis approach to AI risk, where we focus on increasing the resilience of each component part of a functioning civilization, because we understand that if enough components degrade, the whole machinery of civilization could collapse.

Her systems analysis stands in contrast to Yudkowsky's view, she said. “I think that way of thinking is very a-systemic. It's the most simple model of the world you can assume,” she told me. “And his vision is based on Bayes' theorem — the whole probabilistic way of thinking about the world — so it's super surprising how such a mindset has ended up pushing for a statement of ‘if anyone builds it, everyone dies' — which is, by definition, a non-probabilistic statement.”

I asked her why she thinks that happened.

“Maybe it's because he really, really believes in the truth of the axioms or presumptions of his argument. But we all know that in an uncertain world, you cannot necessarily believe with certainty in your axioms,” she said. “The world is a complex story.”

It has never been easier to make a website or graphic with AI tools, but Jorn van Dijk, the cofounder of AI website builder Framer, says designers still need to put in some grunt work to stand out in the field.

Van Dijk told Business Insider that designers must nurture their sense of taste as they develop their careers.

""Taste and quality go hand in hand. With AI, it's super easy to make something sloppy very fast. That's why it's called AI slop,"" he said.

""A way to stand out is to focus on quality and making something unique to yourself, to the individual, and to the brand,"" he added.

This is critical for businesses, which rely on their designers to develop a brand that ""people like to engage with and get excited about,"" van Dijk said.

""That is increasingly hard and not easy to do,"" he said.

To refine one's taste, van Dijk said designers should go back to the basics and ""hone your hard skills."" That involves getting practice with tools to create good design and producing more work.

""Do a lot of exploration, make a lot of mock-ups, make a lot of icons, draw a lot of logos,"" van Dijk said.

""What worked 10 years ago is probably still true today. It's just that the tools have changed, and we can leverage AI to do better work,"" he added.

Van Dijk started Framer in 2014 with his cofounder, Koen Bok. The company has over 130 employees and is based in Amsterdam, per PitchBook. In August, Framer raised $100 million at a $2 billion valuation in its Series D funding round.

Van Dijk and Bok cofounded Sofa in 2006, a software company that made apps for Apple's MacBooks. Meta acquired Sofa in 2011, and the pair worked as product designers at the social media giant between 2011 and 2013.

Van Dijk told Business Insider that AI can benefit many creative fields, such as graphic design and film, but it hasn't leveled the playing field between professional artists and the average person.

""It's never been easier to create good video, but I haven't really seen the amount of amazing videos or ads skyrocket because of that,"" he said.

XAI's data annotation team has faced sweeping layoffs and leadership changes this month — and the job of heading up the team training Grok has fallen to a college student who started working at the company eight months ago.

Diego Pasini, who graduated from high school in 2023, took over the data annotation team that trains Grok after at least nine high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated last week, Business Insider previously reported. A few days later, on September 12, the company cut more than 500 of the team's staffers, according to a Slack tally.

On September 15, Pasini led an all-hands meeting with the team's remaining workers and said the company had no plans for further layoffs, three workers told Business Insider. Another group of employees — more than 100 — were laid off shortly after, the workers said.

In recent days, Pasini's team has led rapid-fire one-on-one meetings at which employees have been asked to explain their work at the company, 11 current and former workers said. Before the team's layoffs, Pasini also posted an announcement in Slack asking workers to focus on a series of tests that would determine their future position at xAI, BI previously reported.

The data annotation team is made up of contract and full-time staff tasked with labeling, categorizing, and contextualizing raw data to teach Grok how to better understand the world. Prior to last week's layoffs, it had a headcount of around 1,500. That number is now around 900.

Pasini and xAI did not respond to requests for comment.

Pasini joined xAI in January, according to his LinkedIn profile, after he won an xAI Hackathon in San Francisco. Two other people on Pasini's hackathon team went on to work at xAI and Tesla, their LinkedIn profiles show.

Before joining xAI, Pasini attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied computer science and economics, according to his LinkedIn profile. His status at the university is listed as ""on leave,"" per LinkedIn. A representative for the school declined to confirm his attendance or status at the school.

Pasini was also listed as a 2024 fellow at the investment firm Contrary, which says it has worked with companies including Anduril and Replit. His fellowship profile said he was ""excited about the future of robotics and hard tech startups.""

Pasini attended a private high school in New Jersey, the Pingry School, which has an annual tuition of more than $47,000. He graduated in 2023, according to a bulletin from the school. He was on a robotics team and presented research on drones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2022, according to an Instagram post from the Pingry School.

Elon Musk began following Pasini on X in early September, shortly after Pasini posted in support of the billionaire.

Any person with half a brain knows that all of Elon's companies are in their infancy.

On GitHub, Pasini follows several people from Musk's ecosystem, including Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI; George Hotz, a self-driving car developer who worked at Twitter during Musk's acquisition in 2022; and Luke Farritor, a 24-year-old staffer at Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.

Pasini is one of several young people in Musk's orbit who have assumed positions of authority. Besides Farritor, DOGE's ranks included 19-year-old Edward Coristine, as well as at least five other employees between the ages of 19 and 24. Silicon Valley also has a long history of tech stars who didn't graduate from college, including Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg.

On his personal website, Pasini lists interests in computer vision and Napoleonic history. His profile picture, used across multiple sites including X, LinkedIn, and GitHub, is a cropped image of a young grenadier taken from a 19th-century painting of Napoleon reviewing his troops.

Pasini's youth and short tenure at Musk's companies stand in contrast to the previous leader of the data annotation team. That person had joined xAI after working at Tesla for over a decade in a management role on the Autopilot data annotation team.

After Pasini took over at xAI, two employees spoke critically about him on Slack. One of the workers questioned how he moved into the role given his credentials, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.Both workers had their accounts deactivated within hours of posting, screenshots show.Do you work for xAI or have a tip?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Brian Chesky said he thinks Airbnb should be growing a lot faster. Here's what he thinks it will take.","https://www.businessinsider.com/brian-chesky-airbnb-growth-rate-whats-needed-2025-9","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 02:40:00 GMT","

Airbnb is growing a lot slower than it was just a few years ago, but CEO Brian Chesky is hopeful the company can turn it around.

The Airbnb cofounder and CEO discussed the company's growth rate during an interview on Tuesday at the Skift Global Forum conference, where Chesky appeared virtually.

Chesky was asked to address how the company's revenue growth has slowed over the past several years. Airbnb saw 40% revenue growth in 2022, 18% growth in 2023, and 12% growth in 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, its revenue grew 6% year-over-year. In the second quarter, it was up 13%.

""Listen, I'm not happy about where the growth rate is at the company,"" Chesky said. ""I think Airbnb should be growing significantly faster. It should at least be growing in the teens, and I aspire to run the kind of company that'd be growing at more than 20% one day.""

In order to do that, Chesky said the company needed to accelerate its core business, aka home rentals, and ""layer on many businesses.""

Chesky said that previously Airbnb was a ""hypergrowth"" company, noting he had cofounded it from his apartment with his roommates. ""We grew the company like a rocket ship, but what happened was we didn't really build a lot of the foundation to build a sustainable company,"" he said.

When the pandemic hit, he said Airbnb focused on cutting costs and becoming profitable. The company went public in 2020 and was profitable by 2022.

He said Airbnb realized it had built a vacation rental home company, but that it needed to ""rebuild the entire company from the ground up"" in order to have many more businesses, rather than just one.

""That's what we've been doing. The final stage is now we reinvent ourselves,"" Chesky said.

He outlined the company's big bets, including growing its home rental business domestically and abroad, expanding hotel offerings, and its experiences and services, both of which Chesky said he believes will be multi-billion dollar businesses one day.

Airbnb relaunched experiences and launched services in May. The idea is that travelers staying at Airbnb, or even locals at home, can book things like private chefs, personal trainers, photography, and massages on demand and directly to their door.

Chesky has been enthusiastic about the potential of Airbnb to be an ""everything app,"" where countless types of experiences and services can be booked. He's said on several occasions that he got inspiration from Amazon, which transitioned from selling books to selling everything. He's also said Airbnb is going to become an AI-first app.

Chesky said Tuesday that he firmly believes Airbnb will accelerate growth next year, adding, ""We're not putting out any guidance. I don't want to overpromise what we're going to do, but I don't think that people should take our extrapolation of deceleration and extrapolate that forward.""

Ellis Stephens, a husband, father, and self-proclaimed hustler, wakes up well before dawn most days. He makes his way into his garage, turns on the lights, pulls up a chair, and begins creating one-of-a-kind Labubus.

""If I come in here at four in the morning and I just grind it out, I can do seven to eight to nine a day,"" he told Business Insider's Bethany Johnson in a recent interview in San Jose, California.

Stephens buys Labubus, the trendy plush monsters designed by Kasing Lung, in bulk from resellers on the street, customizes them with tattoos, piercings, gemstones, and more, and then upsells them for a major profit.

While the price of the Labubus he buys varies, he was paying $45 per toy at the time of filming in July. He sells standard-sized, customized Labubus for $217 each, but customers can also submit orders for a two-pack or larger-sized Labubus that cost more.

For many years, his day job was as a high school art teacher. He was recently promoted to assistant principal. However, the pay as a teacher wasn't enough to fund the type of art projects he wanted to do with his students, like 3D printing and using CNC routing to cut and engrave wood and plastic. So, he started side hustling to make some extra cash.

He's juggled multiple side hustles over the years, from selling burritos on street corners to running a photo booth business and selling custom T-shirts. His Labubus, though, are his most lucrative hustle yet.

He completes about 80 Labubu-related orders a month, which amounts to thousands of extra dollars in revenue.

""It's crazy how it's changed my life,"" he said.

Labubus exploded onto the scene over the last year in large part thanks to celebrities, including Lalisa Manoban, Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, and Emma Roberts, being seen with the toys.

So far this year, the Chinese parent company, Pop Mart, has seen a 667% increase year-over-year in sales largely due to its Labubu toys and related merchandise, according to EMARKETER (Business Insider's sister company). Pop Mart is on track to sell $1 billion worth of Labubu merch this year.

Stephens is more than happy to ride the little monsters' trend wave. ""People say art's not going to take you anywhere. I've heard that my whole life,"" he said, adding it's now the complete opposite. ""I'm able to inspire other lives and show people that art — you don't have to be a starving artist.""

Stephens started out buying the toys in bulk and reselling them as is, but he was hardly making any profit. Then, for Halloween one year, he made a Scream mask for a Labubu, posted it online and, ""people went crazy for it,"" he said. However, the masks he sells for about $20 to $30 a piece. The real money is in his customized tattooed Labubus.

When Stephens posted his first tattooed Labubu on Instagram for $60 last year, he was quickly flooded with messages from people who wanted to buy it. Though he sold the collectible for barely above what he'd paid for it, the wide response made him realize there was a hot market for unique versions.

Soon, he was fielding requests for characters with face tattoos, replicas of rappers like Post Malone and Lil Peep, and designs tied to customers' personal stories.

Stephens has been a tattoo artist for years, but said customizing Labubus has pushed him to refine his skills since the toys are so delicate.

Labubu hands, for example, are the hardest to tattoo, he said, because they're made of tough vinyl that can sometimes cause the tattoo needle to skip or bend. He said each custom toy can take up to an hour to make.

Aside from fine-line sketching, one of Stephens's challenges is dealing with customers who sometimes change requests mid-order or grow impatient with shipping delays — but to him, it's all worth it.

""It's hard to stop now that people are so into it and my work is being recognized,"" he said. ""I'm making original artwork and stuff that I enjoy doing.""

Stephens' Labubu business has taken up a lot of his time. He now hustles from 3 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. on weekdays. After that, he leaves for work at school, then he comes home, hustles a little more, eat dinner with his family, and there's not much time left before bed.

He said he gets around five hours of sleep a night and doesn't plan to stop because the opportunity has finally given him some financial freedom.

""I don't have to think like: Oh, I'm going to be short. Let me hustle the photo booth. Let me get some catering gigs. Let me do some custom T-shirts. Let me post and post and post,"" he said.

Labubus are a trend, and like any trend, they could fizzle out, writes Business Insider's Katie Notopoulos. In the meantime, though, Stephens plans to keep capitalizing on Labubu love as long as it lasts.

""Customizing this stuff has seriously changed my life. And if it starts to be exponential, as to what it is now, it could shape my future. I could finally invest in an actual workspace,"" he said, adding: ""My goal is to have an art building where I just do art and teach people the power of art.""

WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated rate cut and signaled that two more are on the way before the end of the year as concerns intensified over the U.S. labor market.

In an 11-to-1 vote signaling less dissent than Wall Street had anticipated, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point. The decision puts the overnight funds rate in a range between 4.00%-4.25%.

Newly-installed Governor Stephen Miran was the only policymaker voting against the quarter-point move, instead advocating for a half-point cut.

Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, looked at for possible additional dissents, both voted for the 25-basis point reduction. All were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has badgered the Fed all summer to cut not merely in its traditional quarter-point moves but to lower the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively.

In the post-meeting statement, the committee again characterized economic activity as having ""moderated"" but added language saying that ""job gains have slowed"" and noted that inflation ""has moved up and remains somewhat elevated."" Lower job growth and higher inflation are in conflict with the Fed's twin goals of stable prices and full employment.

 ""Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains elevated"" the Fed statement said. ""The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment have risen.""

Stocks were volatile after the decision was released, with major averages mixed after Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as ""risk management"" rather than something more directed at shoring up a weak economy. Treasury yields also were mixed, falling on short-duration issues but up otherwise.

At his post-meeting news conference, Jerome Powell echoed the concerns about the labor market.

""The marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual in this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market,"" he said. ""The downside risks to employment appear to have risen.""

Powell added that the decision to cut puts monetary policy in a ""more neutral"" position as opposed to previous characterizations of moderately restrictive.

Along with the rate decision, officials in their closely watched ""dot plot"" of individual expectations pointed to two more cuts before the end of the year. The grid, however, showed a wide level of disparity, with one dot, possibly Miran's, pointing to a total of 1.25 percentage points in additional reductions this year.

The plot is done anonymously, with one dot for each meeting participant, but Miran has been an advocate for much lower rates. Nine of the 19 participants indicated just one more reduction this year, while 10 saw two, which would indicate moves at the October and December meetings. One official did not want any cuts, including Wednesday's.

""A majority of the FOMC is now targeting two further cuts this year, indicating that the doves on the committee are now in the driver's seat,"" said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory.""

The plot indicated one cut in 2026, significantly slower than current market pricing of three. Traders had fully priced in this week's move. Officials also indicated another reduction in 2027, as the Fed approaches a long-run neutral rate of 3%. A half-dozen officials saw the long-run rate below the median neutral level.

Projections released following the meeting on general economic conditions saw slightly faster economic growth than was projected in June, while the outlooks for unemployment and inflation were unchanged.

A stunning level of political drama preceded the meeting, especially for an institution that generally does its business quietly and with few dissenting voices.

A year ago, against similar worries that a gradual rise in the unemployment rate could be signaling broader weakness, the FOMC approved a jumbo half-point reduction that Trump has said was politically motivated to influence the presidential election in favor of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris.

Trump's hectoring of the Fed and Miran's appointment have raised questions over the traditional independence the central bank has had from political influence. Miran also has openly criticized Powell and his colleagues and is generally seen as a loyalist vote for the president and his desire for significantly lower rates.

The president has said lower rates are needed to bolster the moribund housing market and to reduce financing costs for government debt.

However, Powell said there was no ""widespread support"" for a half-point cut at the meeting.

There was an additional layer of political intrigue this week as a court blocked Trump from removing Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee under former President Joe Biden. The White House has accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving federally backed loans she received for homes she purchased, though no charges have been brought.

Cook was among those who joined the majority in voting for the quarter-point cut.

Recent signals have shown that economic growth remains solid and consumer spending topping forecasts, though the labor market has been a point of contention.

On the jobs front, the unemployment rate hit 4.3% in August, still relatively tame by historical standards but the highest since October 2021. Job creation has been stagnant this year, and a recent update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the economy created nearly a million fewer jobs than initially reported in the 12-month period prior to March 2025.

Governor Waller in particular has expressed concern that the Fed should ease policy now to head off future issues in the labor market. His name also has been in the mix as a potential replacement for Powell, whose term expires in May 2026.

The Federal Reserve gave investors a lot to chew on Wednesday as the central bank lowered the benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point and indicated two more rate cuts could be made by the year's end.

While this latest decision had only one dissent, newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran, opinions diverge further heading into next year. At the moment, the so-called dot-plot predicts one more quarter-point cut next year. However, some members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee see a path to three rate reductions in the coming year.

During a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday's decision reflects a desire to keep risks to the economy in check.

""You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut,"" Powell said. He added that a ""very different picture"" of risks has emerged as the labor market has begun to cool off versus the threats on the inflation front.

The central bank had been holding firm on interest rates as inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Powell has expressed concern that tariffs put in place by the Trump administration could led prices to surge.

The Fed chair said companies have been slow to pass costs from the levies on to consumers, but he expects the impact will build ""over the course of the rest of the year and into next year.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that he expects the effects of inflation on goods prices ""to continue to build"" through the rest of this year and into 2026, shortly after the monetary policymaker cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. 

""We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation, and actually the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year,"" Powell said in a press conference.

He added, ""those are not very large effects at this point, and we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into next year.""

CPI rose 2.9% on an annual basis last month, marking the largest gain since January. Since April, inflation has mostly accelerated on a month-to-month basis. 

Asked whether he will leave as chair of the central bank after his term ends in May 2026, Powell said there's ""nothing new"" to say on this topic.

The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Powell, including Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Chris Waller are also under consideration.

— Yun Li

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said President Donald Trump's tariffs have mainly appeared to be covered by importing companies, meaning consumers haven't seen major price increases tied to the levies yet.

""To the consumer, the passthrough has been pretty small,"" Powell said. ""It's been ... slower and smaller than we thought.""

To be sure, Powell noted that companies have said they eventually plan to pass more of the cost increases onto shoppers, which can result in higher price tags.

— Alex Harring

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he doesn't prefer that the labor market loosen any further.

""The labor market is softening and we don't need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to,"" Powell said.

Powell cited rising unemployment among minorities as one reason for concern.

— Alex Harring

Despite President Donald Trump's demand for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell said there was little support for large rate cuts at this week's meeting.

""There wasn't widespread support at all for a 50 basis point,"" Powell said at his post-meeting news conference. ""I think we've done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and we tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place. That's not at all what I feel certainly now, I feel like our policy has been doing the right thing so far this year.""

The Fed instead opted for a quarter-percentage point reduction.

—Jeff Cox

Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday's interest rate decrease as a way to keep risk in check.

""You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut,"" Powell said.

Powell added that there's a ""very different picture"" of risks tied to the labor market and that it is ""really cooling off.""

— Alex Harring

One surprise out of the Federal Reserve's meeting was that only one rate cut is projected in 2026. But opinions on this path are varied with two voting members seeing as many as four cuts. 

A single quarter-point reduction next year is significantly more conservative than current market pricing. Traders are currently pricing in at two to three more rate cuts next year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, updated shortly after the decision.

Recent data has suggested a softening in the labor market, while inflation has risen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said.

""While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen at the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated,"" he said in the post-meeting news conference.

— Michelle Fox

The majority of the Federal Reserve now targeting two further rate cuts this year indicates that the doves on the committee are now in the driver's seat, said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

""We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory,"" he said.

— Michelle Fox

It is really important that there was just one dissent in the Federal Reserve's rate-cut decision, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

While Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman may each want the job of Federal Reserve chair, they weren't willing to go against the consensus, he said in an interview with CNBC.

""To me, the fact that they are not going to fall over themselves to say 50 basis points now, even if they want more Fed easing, I think that is a very positive sign because it says the Federal Reserve as an institution regards its independence as tremendously important and they are not going to fall over themselves to do what the administration wants right now,"" Kelly said.

— Michelle Fox

The Fed's rate cut will have a trickle-down effect on many types of consumer loans and savings rates.

The federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's move will pave the way for relief from some of the high borrowing costs that have weighed on consumers.

Credit cards, for example, have a variable rate, so there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, are more influenced by Treasury yields and the economy so there's less of an immediate impact.

Here's the breakdown of all of the ways the Fed's decision to lower its benchmark could affect your finances in the months ahead.

In its statement, the Fed acknowledged slight increases in the unemployment rate and a ""shift"" in the balance of risks. Click here to see CNBC's comparison of the September and July statements.

The Federal Open Market Committee vote was 11 to 1, with Governor Stephen Miran the sole dissenting vote. At the July meeting Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller had wanted to trim rates by 25 basis points, but the pair appeared satisfied by the reduction the policymakers approved at the September meeting.

All three governors were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has been actively pushing for the central bank to bring down interest rates as quickly as possible.

Central bank policymakers voted to cut the key interest rate by 0.25%, or 25 basis points, putting the benchmark rate in the range of 4.00% to 4.25%.

With signs of the labor market weakening, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points. However, there are some who want the central bank to go further faster.

The critical questions investors will want to answer are: How far will interest rates fall this year and how divided is the central bank?

The July meeting was notable for its two dissenters, Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. This time around the tension could be heightened even further. President Donald Trump has appointed Stephen Miran to the group. Miran, who replaced Adriana Kugler, has been a Fed critic and he is expected to push for deep cuts.

If the majority opts to ease rates by 25 basis points, it is possible Waller and Bowman will once again dissent. This time, joined by Miran.

In addition, there also could be pressure to keep the benchmark rate steady between 4.25% and 4.50%. That could put two other Federal Open Market Committee members in the opposition. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are seen by some as wanting to keep rates where they are.

— Christina Cheddar Berk

The three major averages were mixed around 1:50 p.m. ET as the Federal Reserve's rate decision loomed.

The S&P 500 was last down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was toting a 210-point gain, or up about 0.5%.

The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 4.045%, up nearly 2 basis points. The rate on the 2-year Treasury was last up 3 basis points at 3.541%.

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

Savers and investors who look for attractive yields on fixed income assets have faired pretty well since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022.

As of the week ended Sept. 12, the annual percentage yield on a five-year certificate of deposit sat at 1.7%, up from 0.5% in March 2022, according to Haver. Yields on savings accounts are also currently higher: 0.4% as of Sept. 12, versus the 0.06% paid in March 2022, per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC.

Rates haven't been so great for borrowers, however, even as the Fed cut by a full point in 2024. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage stood at 6.29% last week, compared with 4.29% in March 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Credit card annual percentage rates also remain high, standing at 20.12% as of a week ago, versus 16.34% in March 2022, according to Bankrate.

—Christina Cheddar Berk, Nick Wells

With the market so sure that a rate cut is coming, some have suggested Wednesday's news could put pressure on stocks. 

""As we look toward month-end, Fed Day may act as a 'sell-the-news' event as investors take time to consider the Fed future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning Retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing,"" JPMorgan's trading desk wrote. 

Others fear the interest rate cut will itself do more harm than good, with longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni saying it's ""throwing gasoline on a fire.""

He's in the camp that believes the economy is still on solid footing even as inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target and job growth has slowed. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk, Fred Imbert

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once agreed to call two different houses his ""principal residence"" at the same time — a similar claim to the one that President Donald Trump cited when he tried to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, according to a report Wednesday.

Documents show that on the same day in September 2007, Bessent agreed that homes in both Bedford Hills, New York, and Provincetown, Massachusetts, each would be his principal residence, Bloomberg reported.

Cook signed mortgage agreements declaring that houses in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta were each her principal residences, according to prior reports. Cook signed those documents within two weeks of each other in summer 2021, before she was appointed to the Fed's Board.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has repeatedly accused Cook of mortgage fraud after posting her mortgage documents on social media in August. 

The Justice Department opened an investigation of Cook after receiving a criminal referral from Pulte dated Aug. 15, which claimed she falsified her residency status at the two properties, potentially to secure more favorable interest rates and loan terms.

Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook based on Pulte's allegations. Cook, who has sued to block her removal, has denied committing mortgage fraud.

A U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C., and a federal appeals court have ruled that Trump cannot fire Cook while her suit continues.

Trump's effort to remove Cook came after he unsuccessfully pressured the Fed for months to slash interest rates.

Bessent, in an interview in August with Fox Business Network, was asked about Cook's situation.

""There are people who think that President Trump is putting undue pressure on the Fed,"" Bessent said.

""And there are people like President Trump and myself who think that if a Fed official committed mortgage fraud, that this should be examined, and that they shouldn't be serving as one of the nation's leading financial regulators.""

Bank of America, the mortgage lender for the two Bessent properties, in a letter to the Treasury secretary sent in the past several weeks that it was aware that both his Bedford Hills and Provincetown properties were ""secondary residences.""

""As your bankers, we were well aware that your primary residence"" was in Manhattan, a managing director for the bank said in the letter to Bessent.

""Regardless, for the  mortgage product you received, interest rates do not vary based on utilization as a primary versus secondary residence and neither mortgage was backed by or sold to any Government Sponsored Entity or other investor.""

Rider documents associated with the mortgage agreements also show the Bedford and Provincetown houses referenced as secondary residences.

Alex Spiro, Bessent's personal attorney,  blasted Bloomberg's report. 

Mortgage experts told Bloomberg there was no sign of wrongdoing by Bessent, and one of them said that neither his case nor Cook's appeared to indicate fraud because both borrowers' plans for their properties had been disclosed to the lender.

""Nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Bessent's lawyers filled out paperwork properly, the bank has confirmed it was done properly, and this nonsensical article reaches the conclusion that this was all done properly,"" Spiro said in a statement to CNBC.

The Treasury Department declined to comment on the article.

Bloomberg's report noted that Cook's and Bessent's situations are not identical.

Cook had personally signed her mortgage agreements, while Bessent's were signed on his behalf by a lawyer. 

And both of Bessent's mortgages were with the same lender, Bank of America, while Cook's were with two different banks.

However, there is evidence that lenders were aware of Cook's actual plans for the respective properties, just as Bank of America said it knew of Bessent's intentions.

Reuters reported last week that a May 2021 loan estimate indicates that Cook had called the Atlanta property a ""vacation home.""

Charles Rich, the lawyer who represented Bessent in the 2007 mortgage agreements, gave a statement to CNBC.

""I was Mr. Bessent's attorney and agent under a Power of Attorney made in September 2007 when I signed a mortgage to finance the purchase of a new residence for Mr. Bessent in Bedford Hills, New York under a mortgage loan,"" Rich said.

""Concurrently with the 2007 closing, I executed a second mortgage on a property located in Provincetown, MA as additional collateral,"" he said.

""Bank of America was fully aware that the Provincetown, MA property was not a principal residence and waived any requirement that it be used as a principal residence,"" Rich said.

""There was absolutely nothing improper about Mr. Bessent's loan applications with which he was minimally involved as he had delegated authority to me as his lawyer and an agent to close these loan transactions,"" he said.

In this article

Amazon on Wednesday introduced an artificial intelligence agent that will help third-party merchants operate their online businesses.

The company is adding agentic capabilities to Seller Assistant, its AI tool for third-party sellers, meaning the software can take action on a merchant's behalf with their permission, Amazon said. The update was announced during Amazon's annual Accelerate conference for sellers in Seattle.

Amazon said tools like Seller Assistant free merchants up to ""spend more time focusing on product innovation and customer relationships,"" while its generative AI tool handles more tedious operational tasks.

Amazon has released several AI tools for third-party sellers, which account for more than half of all goods sold on the site, such as a product listing generator and an image and video generator for ads.

Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of worldwide selling partner services, told CNBC in an interview this week that 1.3 million third-party sellers have used its generative AI listing tools, which can produce about 70% of what makes up a product listing on its webstore.

""It really gives the seller, in some sense, a team of experts,"" Mehta said. ""An expert in listing and in pricing and promotions and supply chain, all the things that a small business normally has to either try and learn on their own, hire someone to be an expert, pay someone to be an expert, or sometimes just accept not being that good at, which is not ideal.""

The company said its enhanced Seller Assistant goes beyond answering queries and is capable of coordinating inventory orders and business growth plans, as well as implementing fixes for account issues, potentially helping merchants avoid costly suspensions. 

Over time, Amazon expects to add more agentic capabilities based on seller feedback, the company added.

Generative AI has evolved from image and text generators to agentic AI tools that can complete multi-step tasks for users with minimal supervision. Outside of its third-party marketplace, Amazon's AI lab in San Francisco in March released a preview of an agent that can take action in a web browser.

Seller Assistant uses Bedrock, a software tool that lets users access large language models from Amazon and other companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

The company doesn't currently plan to charge merchants to use Seller Assistant, Mehta said.

Sellers pay Amazon to access its in-house fulfillment services, account management services and other offerings. It's become a sizable business for the company, bringing in $40.3 billion in the second quarter.

Amazon last September launched the first iteration of its AI assistant for sellers, codenamed Project Amelia at the time, allowing merchants to troubleshoot issues with their account, get advice on inventory planning and brainstorm listing titles, among other tasks.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Wednesday said its experimental pill outperformed Novo Nordisk's own oral drug in the first head-to-head study comparing the two medicines in patients with Type 2 diabetes. 

The late-stage study comes as Eli Lilly's pill inches closer to becoming another needle-free alternative in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s, without dietary restrictions. But it may be too soon to establish a clear winner in the pill space, as there is no data comparing Eli Lilly's drug with a higher dose of Novo Nordisk's pill in patients with obesity.

Eli Lilly said its pill, orforglipron, was superior at the trial's main goal of lowering blood sugar levels at 52 weeks compared with Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. The highest dose of orforglipron helped lower hemoglobin A1c — a measure of blood sugar levels — by 2.2% compared with 1.4% with Novo Nordisk's pill. 

The highest dose of Eli Lilly's drug also helped patients lose an average of 9.2% of their weight, or 19.7 pounds, compared with 5.3% weight loss, or 11 pounds, with Novo Nordisk's pill. Orforglipron's weight loss was 8.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations, while oral semaglutide's was 5.3%. 

The results suggest an up to 36-milligram dose of Eli Lilly's pill may be more effective at treating diabetes patients than an up to 14-milligram dose of oral semaglutide, which is already approved under the name Rybelsus for Type 2 diabetes.

""For the majority of patients, this could be the main medicine that they need to control their Type 2 diabetes as well as their obesity,"" Eli Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said in an interview.

Dr. Michael Weintraub, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Diabetes & Endocrine Associates, said orforglipron's management of blood sugar levels is ""quite impressive not only compared to other oral Type 2 diabetes medications but all Type 2 diabetes medications including injectables.""

The company on Wednesday said it expects to apply for approval of orforglipron for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes in 2026. Eli Lilly hopes to launch its pill globally ""this time next year,"" CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.

Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are vying for a greater share of the booming market for GLP-1s, which some analysts say could be worth around $100 billion by the 2030s. The space is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it.

Oral GLP-1s could grow to be worth $50 billion of that total, according to some analyst estimates.

But it's less clear how Eli Lilly's pill compares with higher doses of oral semaglutide, especially in patients who are overweight or have obesity without diabetes. Novo Nordisk expects U.S. regulators to approve a higher 25-milligram dose of its pill for the treatment of obesity by the end of the year, and has also studied a 50-milligram dose of the drug in a phase three trial.

Weintraub said comparing the 36-milligram dose of Eli Lilly's pill to oral semaglutide at a lower dose than what may be approved in the future ""is short-changing semaglutide."" He added that patients with diabetes typically lose less weight than those without the condition, so the closer to 15% weight loss that oral semaglutide has shown in people with obesity is ""certainly not expected"" in a study on Type 2 diabetes patients.

Because the trial showed Eli Lilly's pill was better at reducing blood sugar and weight only when compared with specific lower doses of oral semaglutide, ""there are several orders that kind of slow the roll a little bit as we look at the results and get kind of excited,"" said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

Almandoz said it's ""a little too early to say that one is kind of a leader in the class"" of drugs. But he said head-to-head data is helpful as doctors determine which pill may be a better fit for certain diabetes patients. 

Detailed results on the trial will be presented at a medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The company can't run studies on medicines from competitors that aren't approved yet, Skovronsky noted. But he said he's confident Eli Lilly's pill can beat higher doses of oral semaglutide in head-to-head trials. 

Skovronsky likened orforglipron's efficacy to that of ""new-generation"" injectable GLP-1s. He appears to be referring to Eli Lilly's blockbuster diabetes injection Mounjaro and Novo Nordisk's competing shot Ozempic.

Meanwhile, Skovronsky said oral semaglutide ""is really performing at a lower level, more similar to the first-generation GLP-1s"" such as Victoza and Trulicity, older diabetes injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, respectively. 

Rybelsus has been on the market for years, meaning that Eli Lilly's pill will be a late rival in the diabetes space. But both companies are racing to develop oral GLP-1s for obesity. 

Unlike Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. It is a small molecule drug that is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions.

Eli Lilly's ACHIEVE-3 trial followed nearly 1,700 adults whose Type 2 diabetes was not well managed despite taking an older diabetes drug called Metformin. 

Data on orforglipron's safety, and how well patients tolerated the drug, was consistent with previous trials. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal and mild to moderate in severity. 

Eli Lilly said 9.7% of patients on the highest dose of its pill discontinued treatment due to side effects in the trial. That compares with 4.9% of participants on the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's drug. 

But Eli Lilly noted that the study was not designed to compare the safety and tolerability of the two drugs. 

Almandoz said orforglipron's safety and tolerability were ""nothing outside the realm of what one would expect"" from GLP-1s. 

""I don't think we see any signals there that are concerning with orforglipron relative to semaglutide,"" he said. 

Skovronsky said the company is ""satisfied"" with the tolerability, adding that it performed consistently with GLP-1 injections.

Meanwhile, Weintraub said seeing a discontinuation rate due to side effects that is ""almost double"" that of Novo Nordsk's pill ""certainly gives me pause."" He said Eli Lilly's pill has shown a similar rate in previous late-stage trials, so its gastrointestinal side effects are ""likely something we will need to be mindful of and counsel patients accordingly.""

为支持这一战略扩张，RELI 成立了专门的 Crypto Advisory Board（CAB），以在 treasury 管理、区块链整合和治理实践方面提供专业知识。公司旨在利用在 AI 和科技驱动的保险解决方案方面的经验，推动 InsurTech 与去中心化金融的融合。

RELI enters crypto market with initial Ethereum purchase as part of new treasury diversification strategy, signaling significant strategic shift.

RELI's initial Ethereum purchase marks a substantial strategic pivot for an insurance-focused company. This treasury diversification into digital assets represents more than just a financial move—it signals the company's belief in blockchain's transformative potential for both finance and insurance industries.

The establishment of a dedicated Crypto Advisory Board demonstrates a structured governance approach to this initiative, suggesting this isn't merely an exploratory investment but rather a calculated long-term strategy. By planning incremental purchases across multiple cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana), RELI is taking a measured approach to building exposure while managing volatility risks inherent to digital assets.

What's particularly noteworthy is how RELI is positioning this move as an extension of their existing technology focus. The company already leverages AI and data mining in their insurance platforms (RELI Exchange and 5MinuteInsure.com), and now sees blockchain as a natural progression of their tech-forward approach. This suggests a potential future integration between their InsurTech operations and decentralized finance capabilities, which could create competitive differentiation if executed effectively.

However, investors should recognize the significant risk profile shift this represents. The company is allocating capital reserves to highly volatile assets, introducing new regulatory uncertainties, custody challenges, and potential accounting complexities. While the press release emphasizes ""disciplined"" and ""measured"" approaches, the effectiveness of risk management protocols will be crucial to evaluate as this initiative progresses.

LAKEWOOD, NJ, Sept.  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reliance Global Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: RELI) (“Reliance”, “we” or the “Company”) today announced that it has completed its first digital asset purchase under its recently launched Digital Asset Treasury (“DAT”) initiative, acquiring Ethereum (ETH). The purchase represents the initial step in Reliance's broader plan to build a diversified digital asset portfolio, with future investments expected to include leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana.

The Company plans to fund these activities through a combination of cash reserves and other approved corporate financing tools. Reliance's DAT initiative is structured to pursue long-term capital appreciation through blockchain-based participation.

As part of this strategy, Reliance has also formed a dedicated Crypto Advisory Board (“CAB”) to guide management and the Board of Directors in the oversight, risk management, and execution of digital asset initiatives. The CAB will provide expertise on treasury management, blockchain integration, and governance practices critical to the Company's expansion into digital assets.

Ezra Beyman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Reliance Global Group, stated, “This first Ethereum transaction is an important milestone for Reliance as we expand into digital assets. It demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our operational systems – covering custody, governance, accounting, and compliance – are equipped to support this strategy on a larger scale. Reliance expects to continue purchasing Ethereum and other digital assets in measured increments, applying a disciplined approach to capital allocation as the treasury position develops over time.”

“Our entry into Ethereum underscores our conviction that blockchain technology is rapidly shaping the future of both finance and insurance. With the added oversight of our Crypto Advisory Board, we are confident this strategy provides shareholders with a forward-looking opportunity while maintaining our focus on responsible execution and risk management.”

Reliance has a longstanding history of leveraging artificial intelligence, data mining, and innovative distribution models to deliver competitive, technology-enabled insurance solutions through RELI Exchange and 5MinuteInsure.com. By applying similar innovation to the blockchain ecosystem, the Company seeks to pioneer the convergence of InsurTech and decentralized finance.

Key Points

Bitcoin and Ethereum have led the crypto market recovery. However, only a handful of altcoins have risen alongside them.

On paper, the cryptocurrency market has erased the losses of the long crypto winter of 2022 and 2023. Last month, crypto's market cap -- the total value of all the cryptocurrencies in circulation -- set a new high. At a glance, it seems all's right with the crypto world.

In reality, many altcoins, which are essentially any cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin (BTC), have not recovered. If you'd invested $200 in each of the top 20 altcoins four years ago, your original $4,000 investment would be worth around $2,840 today, per CoinMarketCap data. That's a 30% drop.

Let's dive into why so many altcoins have underperformed, and whether they may yet recover.

Image source: Getty Images.

Bitcoin may be soaring, but if we compare crypto prices from Sept. 9, 2021 with the same day four years on, only five of the top 20 altcoins have gained in value.

The five altcoins that have gained value since September 2021 are:

These altcoins are clear beneficiaries of regulatory shifts. That includes the passing of U.S. stablecoin legislation in the form of the Genius Act, and a change in crypto attitudes from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Stellar and XRP are both blockchain payment solutions providers that could benefit from a surge in stablecoin usage. Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana are all smart-contract cryptos with ecosystems where stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications get built.

Another positive driver was the SEC's decision to drop its cases against Ripple Labs and Binance. This move lifted a lot of uncertainty around the XRP and BNB tokens connected to each company, and, to some degree, explains why these two cryptos have seen the biggest returns.

In cryptocurrency's short history, we've seen two big altcoin seasons. The first was in 2017 and 2018, after thousands of projects used ICOs -- initial coin offerings -- to raise capital. The second was in 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were low and the market was awash with stimulus checks.

A large part of today's crypto surge has been driven by an inflow of institutional money. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs was a game changer, as it made it easier for both institutions and retail investors to add the top two cryptos to their portfolios. According to CoinGlass, there's $170 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs right now. 

The focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum is one reason that other crypto hopefuls from 2021 have struggled to regain momentum. But that's only part of the answer. Some have also had technical difficulties or leadership issues. Others lost ground to competitors, while Terra (LUNA) collapsed completely.

Here are the altcoin leaders from September 2021 that have lost value since then:

Two of the rallying cries you'll often find on crypto channels are ""Buy the dip,"" and ""HODL -- Hold On For Dear Life."" But buying the dip only makes sense if you think the project can perform well in the future. Similarly, holding is often a great strategy, but if you no longer see potential in the project, it may be time to sell your crypto.

The coins above tell different stories and have to be evaluated in their own right. For example, Polygon struggled after it migrated from its MATIC token to POL, and seems to be losing ground to its competitors. Just one of the original founders remains, and it will take some nifty footwork to get it back into the top 20 cryptos.

In contrast, Chainlink could be on the edge of an exciting new chapter. It recently announced a big partnership with the U.S. government and is actively working with other financial institutions. There are good reasons to think it might benefit from a surge in stablecoin and DeFi activity. 

It's unlikely we'll see another altcoin season per se. The market is maturing, and the influx of institutional, corporate, and government money tilts the balance more toward less speculative cryptos.

Today's economy is very different from what it was four years ago, as is the crypto market -- not least because there are so many more cryptocurrencies. Coinbase (COIN -2.25%) CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that there are around a million new tokens created every week. 

The sheer volume makes it hard to imagine a repeat of 2021's crypto frenzy, where cash flowed into every corner of the market. That isn't to say that altcoins will never shine. Bitcoin and Ethereum don't exist in isolation and are far from the only investment opportunities in crypto. Projects with utility and active user communities may succeed, particularly as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream.

What's more likely is that we'll see a different type of altcoin season later this year, based on quality projects and, potentially, driven by increased institutional investment into altcoin ETFs. That's because the SEC could well approve a slew of altcoin ETF applications in the coming months. These include Solana, XRP, Cardano, and more. 

Cryptocurrency is a high-risk investment. That risk is even higher with less established projects. They tend to have less liquidity, a shorter track record, and can be speculative. Think of altcoins like penny stocks -- people buy them in the hope of high returns, but they also carry a lot of risk. Several projects that looked promising four years ago now look unlikely to recover.

One of the biggest lessons to learn from the last crypto boom is that even popular projects can fail. If you want to buy altcoins, make sure that crypto only accounts for a small part of your overall portfolio, and that your crypto investments themselves are diversified.

Masks of the Void: Infinity delivers an invigorating 3D isometric action RPG adventure. Players assume the role of Iret, a warrior equipped with seasonally updated masks, each bestowing unique abilities. These masks are crucial as players strive to overcome hordes of monsters and perilous environments. The challenge intensifies with each run, driven by the game's progression system. Operated on the innovative Somnia gaming and entertainment chain, Masks of the Void: Infinity is designed as a free-to-play experience.

The debut season of Masks of the Void: Infinity has officially kicked off, thanks to a partnership with Elixir Games. This season enriches the gameplay by introducing special modifiers, numerous Cards, Void Gifts, and Relics. Additionally, it features a brand-new leaderboard mechanism enabled by Gamers L.A.B., which records player stats as on-chain activities.

At the conclusion of the season, the top 15 leaderboard players will receive unique rewards including Steam keys for Masks of the Void: Origins, a more narrative-based, premium version of the game. While the full details of the prizes are yet to be disclosed, the developers have teased the presence of “other juicy unannounced rewards.”

A representative from Elixir Games expressed their enthusiasm about the new addition, stating, “The addition of Masks of the Void: Infinity is another step in strengthening the Elixir Games catalog with cutting edge experiences. This partnership opens the door for both companies to grow together, offering players more reasons to jump in, explore and keep coming back for more.”

To engage in the Season 1 challenges, enthusiasts need to download Masks of the Void: Infinity via the Elixir Games Launcher, which requires an email account for setup. Available exclusively for Windows PC users, the game specifies system necessities including 10 GB of storage, 16 GB of RAM, and at least an AMD Ryzen 5 or Intel i5 CPU, though it leaves out specifics regarding GPU requirements.

Throughout Season 1, players are urged to achieve high scores in individual runs. The levels are randomly generated, which adds complexity and enhances the replay value. Players who excel can secure a spot in the top 15 of the leaderboard, taking advantage of the dynamic PvE setting to clinch exclusive prizes and more, thereby enriching their gaming experience.

""We are talking about a very dystopian future if we allow central banks to issue central bank digital currencies. You know, even if the original designers and heads of central banks who are launching this are super well-meaning, you know, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, we just know what human nature is like and history is the best guide... I think the power would be abused, if not by the original generation of launchers, then by the next generation.... It will be a completely totalitarian system of such frightening proportions, it's hard to imagine... The micromanaging decision [about your spending] will then be automated and... you have no right to appeal the algorithm... You just won't be able to use your money for certain things and then there is nothing that you can do... That by definition ends freedom...."" -- Richard A. Werner, German economist, 2024,

The Biden administration was actively working towards an American CBDC, but in May 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prevent the Federal Reserve from introducing a CBDC. Shortly after coming into office, President Donald Trump banned the establishment of a CBDC in the United States.

In Europe, the European Union is barreling ahead at full speed towards a central bank digital currency for those EU countries that are part of the eurozone, which includes the majority of EU countries. Yet, the dangers of this euro CBDC are nowhere near being discussed in mainstream European media. Of course, EU leaders stress that Europe must have a CBDC to ""adapt to the digital age"" – a vapid statement evidently intended to subdue skeptics, and supposedly to protect Europe against ""increasing geopolitical fragmentation,"" whatever that is, if it is even relevant to digital currencies.

Whatever the excuse, the impending CBDCs appear intended to give governments unlimited power: If the government does not like your speech, off to jail you go – as in the UK, where people are imprisoned for months and years for saying or writing things that the government disagrees with. Meanwhile, real crimes, such as the mass-rape of thousands of children over the past 20 years, in Rotherham and other cities, remain rampant and largely unaddressed.

Unfortunately, none of this is far-fetched. In Canada, during Covid-19 when the truckers went to Ottawa peacefully to protest government pandemic restrictions, then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau simply invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to force banks to freeze the truckers' bank accounts. Problem solved.

Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, has admitted that CBDCs will give governments total control: ""[I]n cash, we don't know, for example, who is using a $100 bill today; we don't know who is using a 1000 peso bill today. A key difference with the CBDC is that central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that we determine the use... and we will have the technology to enforce that.""

Your money will no longer be yours, but more like a credit or account that you will have with the government and that you will only have access to on condition that you follow the rules, whatever they might be.

Globalist leaders are working at full speed to introduce central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). A CBDC is a digital currency that is issued directly by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve in the US, the European Central Bank in the EU's eurozone, and the Bank of England in the UK.

A CBDC will be the final straw that ensures that every dream of suppression and control that the globalists nurture will come true. Several of those dreams are already a reality, including shutting down dissent and free speech, as in Europe, where people are routinely fined and arrested for saying things their governments do not like. A host of other controlling measures are already in the works, including herding people into ""15-minute cities"" where it is easier to monitor them, keep tabs on their use of private cars, decide what they can and cannot eat – ideally ""ecologically preferable"" bugs and lab-grown meat, no beef or cheese -- track their ""carbon footprints"", determine where and how they can travel, oversee their vaccines and so on.

The Oxford-educated, German economist Richard A. Werner said in an interview last year.

""The push for CBDCs is the final step in a multi-decade program by central planners to increase their power over the people and over countries. This is the ultimate step because the powers of CBDCs are so extraordinary that, I mean, even the worst dictators of past centuries could only have dreamt of having such enormous power over the lives of so many people.

""We are talking about a very dystopian future if we allow central banks to issue central bank digital currencies. You know, even if the original designers and heads of central banks who are launching this are super well-meaning, you know, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, we just know what human nature is like and history is the best guide...

""I think the power would be abused, if not by the original generation of launchers, then by the next generation.... It will be a completely totalitarian system of such frightening proportions, it's hard to imagine...

""The micromanaging decision [about your spending] will then be automated and... you have no right to appeal the algorithm... You just won't be able to use your money for certain things and then there is nothing that you can do... That by definition ends freedom....

""Dictators like Stalin and other dictators, they could only have dreamt of, you know, the enormous power that central bank digital currencies give to central planners... We are talking about dystopian digital prisons that will be created through central bank digital currencies, because the programmability – and this has been mentioned in the studies by the central banks – include of course geography, and there is this proposal for climate change, whatever reasons, that people... should stay within their 15-minute walking small local area... and there will be digital controls... when you walk with all your RFID chips in your cards and your CBDC anyway, of course you will be immediately recognized if you're out of the area and you will be punished. It's a digital prison.""

CBDCs will indeed be ""programmable"": In 2021, the Bank of England asked for ministers to have the final word on whether a central bank digital currency should be ""programmable"", meaning that the central bank would have a veto over how people would spend their money, the Telegraph reported:

""Tom Mutton, a director at the Bank of England, said during a conference on Monday that programming could become a key feature of any future central bank digital currency, in which the money would be programmed to be released only when something happened.""

According to Mutton:

""There could be some socially beneficial outcomes from that, preventing activity which is seen to be socially harmful in some way. But at the same time it could be a restriction on people's freedoms. That is a really delicate debate that needs to be had. It is not something we can settle ourselves, that is for the Government to lead on.""

Programming, Mutton made it clear, would mean that the technological possibilities would lead to enabling the state or an employer ""to control how the money is spent by the recipient.""

Not only is such a scenario horrifying beyond words, but half the world is already hurtling towards this nightmare: A study by the Atlantic Council last year found that 134 countries – including the U.S. at the time – were pursuing central bank digital currencies, with almost half of those countries at an advanced stage in this process. The Biden administration was actively working towards an American CBDC, but in May 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prevent the Federal Reserve from introducing a CBDC. Shortly after coming into office, President Donald Trump banned the establishment of a CBDC in the United States.

In Europe, the European Union is barreling ahead at full speed towards a central bank digital currency for those EU countries that are part of the eurozone, which includes the majority of EU countries. Yet, the dangers of this euro CBDC are nowhere near being discussed in mainstream European media. Of course, EU leaders stress that Europe must have a CBDC to ""adapt to the digital age"" – a vapid statement evidently intended to subdue skeptics, and supposedly to protect Europe against ""increasing geopolitical fragmentation,"" whatever that is, if it is even relevant to digital currencies.

Whatever the excuse, the impending CBDCs appear intended to give governments unlimited power: If the government does not like your speech, off to jail you go – as in the UK, where people are imprisoned for months and years for saying or writing things that the government disagrees with. Meanwhile, real crimes, such as the mass-rape of thousands of children over the past 20 years, in Rotherham and other cities, remain rampant and largely unaddressed.

Those who control CBDCs will not only be able to fine and arrest you, as they do today, but also to simply cut off your money. Are you eating beef or cheese beyond your carbon allowance? You will have to buy bugs or fake meat instead, as the state will cut off your purchasing freedom.

Unfortunately, none of this is far-fetched. In Canada, during Covid-19 when the truckers went to Ottawa peacefully to protest government pandemic restrictions, then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau simply invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to force banks to freeze the truckers' bank accounts. Problem solved.

As for the rest? Carbon trackers already exist, 15-minute cities are being implemented, in the UK, for example, and the Covid-19 vaccine passports proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that governments will take harsh measures to exclude from society those who refuse to comply with whatever madness du jour the governments seek to impose on its citizens.

Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, sometimes known as the bank of all central banks, has admitted that CBDCs will give governments total control:

""[I]n cash, we don't know, for example, who is using a $100 bill today; we don't know who is using a 1000 peso bill today. A key difference with the CBDC is that central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that we determine the use... and we will have the technology to enforce that.""

Last year, British MP Danny Kruger asked a representative of the UK Treasury what a CBDC is good for and what problem it is meant to solve. The bureaucrat replied:

""Look. What's it for? It's to keep track with the reality of how we all purchase and save and do our work with our goods.""

They are not even hiding it.

Notably, there is at least some coordination among governments across the West on this totalitarian agenda. Professor Werner noted:

""The Covid operation... many of the policies had no proper medical justification or purpose... whereas if you have the hypothesis that [it] was partly used to even. you know, lay the groundwork for CBDCs...

""[T]his vaccine passport was... a way to push digital IDs, which are a precondition for CBDCs. In order to introduce CBDCs you need digital IDs, and digital IDs were meant to be introduced with the vaccine passport or health passport, which is a form of digital ID... The Covid policies... every country in the world seemed to have the same policies, well mostly certainly in Europe and North America, and so there was an extraordinary degree of coordination that was revealed to us, and clearly that did not come from any democratic process, but somehow top-down from behind the scenes... and that's really another reason why we should be against CBDCs; they've shown us what they're going to do...

""There is already various credit and debit cards that have the functionality that your spending will be analyzed and you get a report on an ongoing basis of how much CO2 emissions are involved in your spending... Mastercard... is offering that.""

CO2, however, will more than likely turn out to be just a tiny excuse for the extreme power that governments will be wielding if they get CBDCs into our hands. Your money will no longer be yours, but more like a credit or account that you will have with the government and that you will only have access to on condition that you follow the rules, whatever they might be.

In his ""Manifesto of the Communist Party,"" published in 1848, Karl Marx actually called for a national bank, as something that would help bring about ""socialism-communism"": ""Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly,"" he wrote of the ""fifth measure"" necessary to bring about Communism.

Is that what we really want?

That put the users at the mercy of the credit card companies. It'll be worse with this digital currency. You'll go to buy a cup of coffee at McDonalds's, with $1 million dollars in your account, and you'll be told the computers are temporarily out of service, and you won't be able to buy your coffee. Money is independence, and anything that interferes with it, is a threat to that independence. There used to be a sign in a tavern I used to drink in, which said, ""In God we trust, all others pay cash.""

Bitcoin traded at $116,236 as of 14:04 UTC on Sept. 17, up about 1% in the past 24 hours, holding above a key level as markets await the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.

Dean Crypto Trades noted on X that bitcoin is only about 7% above its post-election local peak, while the S&P 500 has risen 9% and gold has surged 36% during the same period. He said bitcoin has compressed more than those assets, making it likely to lead the next larger move, though it could form a “lower high” before extending further. He added that ether could join in once it breaks $5,000 and enters price discovery.

Lark Davis pointed to bitcoin's history around September FOMC meetings, saying every September decision since 2020 — except during the 2022 bear market — has preceded a strong rally. He stressed that the pattern is less about the Fed's rate choice itself and more about seasonal dynamics, arguing that bitcoin tends to thrive in this period heading into “Uptober.”

According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model, bitcoin rose about 0.9% during the Sept. 16–17 analysis window, climbing from $115,461 to $116,520. BTC reached a session high of $117,317 at 07:00 UTC on Sept. 17 before consolidating.

Following that peak, bitcoin tested the $116,400–$116,600 range multiple times, confirming it as a short-term support zone. In the final hour of the session, between 11:39 and 12:38 UTC, BTC attempted a breakout: prices moved narrowly between $116,351 and $116,376 before spiking to $116,551 at 12:34 on higher volume. This confirmed a consolidation-breakout pattern, though the gains were modest.

Overall, bitcoin remains firm above $116,000, with support around $116,400 and resistance near $117,300.

The latest 24-hour CoinDesk Data chart, ending 14:04 UTC on Sept. 17, shows BTC at $116,236 after retreating from intraday highs near $117,295. The price has consolidated in the $116,000–$116,500 band, underscoring short-term support.

The one-month chart shows bitcoin climbing from lows near $108,000 in late August to recent highs above $117,000. The trend remains upward, though the past few sessions show consolidation, suggesting the market is pausing before its next move.

Ava Labs, the main developer firm behind the Avalanche blockchain, shared Wednesday that it had appointed Arielle Pennington as their senior vice president of growth.

The news comes as Avalanche pushes a wave of institutional adoption, including large tokenization projects, such as SkyBridge's $300 million hedge fund tokenization on AVAX, and surging real-world assets demand.

Prior to Ava Labs, Pennington was the head of communications at the Solana Foundation since April 2023, where she helped steer the ecosystem's narrative out of its dark days post the fallout from the collapse of FTX, to a period of rapid expansion with the network reaching massive user engagement and cultural hype. 

During that time, the network's native token surged more than 2,500% from its post-FTX lows, bringing in booming memecoin trends on Solana and large numbers of new active addresses joining the network.

At Ava Labs, Pennington will focus on shaping the Avalanche narrative and work on the ecosystem's growth efforts, including products focused on real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure as well as consumer use cases.

“I couldn't be more excited to join Ava Labs at this moment,” Pennington said. “Avalanche has always been ahead of the curve — it was the first blockchain to put institutions at its core, and now we're seeing that vision come alive… My goal is to take that energy, amplify it, and help make Avalanche the place where builders, institutions, and everyday users all connect.”

Meet the Oldest Dome-Headed Dinosaur Ever Found

A newly discovered dinosaur species has been identified from a fossil unearthed in Mongolia that represents the most complete pachycephalosaur specimen yet found

Anyone who has ever flipped open a dinosaur book is likely familiar with pachycephalosaurs. These dome-headed dinos are often depicted ramming the tops of their bowling-ball-like skulls into predators or rivals.

Yet despite their popularity, pachycephalosaurs continue to puzzle paleontologists in part because fossils of these bipedal herbivores are rare, says Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University. “The exception is their cranial domes, which were practically indestructible and are usually all we find of these critters,” she says. Almost all of these skull caps date back to the Late Cretaceous, when pachycephalosaurs were already established across the Northern Hemisphere, obscuring the group's early evolution.

A pachycephalosaur skeleton that was recently discovered in Mongolia is poised to finally fill in the missing chapter of this dinosaur clade's early history. The remarkably complete fossil, which Zanno and her colleagues described on Wednesday in the journal Nature, represents a new species that is the oldest known dome-headed dinosaurs.

The fossil was unearthed in 2019 in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, a famed hotbed for dinosaur fossils. While surveying a hillside, Mongolian paleontologist Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig of North Carolina State University and a co-author of the new paper, discovered the top of a dinosaur's noggin sticking out of a cliff.

The fossil was embedded inside rocks that date to between 115 million and 108 million years ago, in the Early Cretaceous period, when the area was covered by a lush river valley. The team deposited the remarkable find at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Paleontology, where Tsogtbaatar is also affiliated.

As the researchers chipped away at the surrounding rock, they quickly realized that the new specimen represented the most complete pachycephalosaur fossil ever discovered. In addition to the rounded skull, the skeleton contains the first record of a pachycephalosaur hand and a complete tail covered with petrified tendons. It even preserves gastroliths—gizzard stones that the animal swallowed to help grind plant material in its digestive tract.

The scientists named the new species Zavacephale rinpoche. The species name is the Tibetan word for “precious one” and refers to the way the skull resembled a rounded, polished gemstone when Tsogtbaatar discovered it.

Zavacephale was a pint-sized pachycephalosaur that weighed roughly as much as a miniature poodle. Despite its diminutive size, the animal possessed a fully developed dome and had likely reached sexual maturity.

Researchers have debated for decades how these dinosaurs used their signature dome. Some have argued that the rounded melons played a role in sexual selection or that they helped species recognize one another. But the most popular interpretation is that the animals used the structure to headbutt one another, as modern bighorn sheep do, which is supported by fossilized skull caps that preserve lesions and other signs of trauma.

The team concluded that Zavacephale represents the oldest known pachycephalosaur and likely originated early on in the evolution of this bizarre group of dinosaurs. “It tells us that the dome head evolved early in pachycephalosaur evolution and arose long before Zavacephale's bigger, cousins started littering the latest Cretaceous fossil record with their skull caps,” says Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the new study.

Zavacephale's cranium had a few noteworthy quirks, however. It was mostly composed of only one skull bone instead of the two bones seen in later species and largely lacked the knobby horns that other pachycephalosaurs had as ornamentation. Brusatte thinks that future finds of early pachycephalosaurs may further reveal how the group's signature headgear evolved over time.

Zanno agrees. “Zavacephale was just an opening act,” she says, “and now we get to see more of the show.”

The deceased Roman citizen was a soldier in his nation's army, but his role wasn't what researchers expected.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Researchers found more than aged vintage in a Spanish wine cellar, instead discovering the tombstone of a Roman cavalry rider that rewrites what we know about military movements during the Julio-Claudian dynasty from the first century C.E. and may provide a look at Roman citizens included in the empire's Spanish-based auxiliary military. 

In a new study published in Gladius, a pair of researchers from the University of Salamanca and the University of Leon translated a quartzite funerary stele inscription written in Latin, which they discovered being reused as construction material in Fuente Encalada, Spain. 

The translation of the inscription—the Roman tradition of funerary stele used the tombstone-like markers to highlight the importance of the deceased—identify the man as a Roman citizen and cavalryman of the ala Augusta, an auxiliary military unit. Placing a Roman citizen within an auxiliary unit upends common thought about the makeup of the Roman army: legions were made up of citizens, while auxiliary units only comprised non-citizens. Prior research had shown that Roman citizens were actually members of auxiliary units more commonly than had been believed, but this example discovered in Spain indicates that was the case much earlier than experts had realized.

The inscription also allows researchers to better understand Roman military movements at that time. “The scarcity of records of this unit makes this inscription a valuable document for reconstructing the Exercitus Hispanicus during the Julio-Claudian period,” the authors wrote in the translated study. “Detailed analysis allows us to approach when this unit arrived in Iberian territories and where it might have been stationed with greater accuracy.” 

The authors said gaps still exist in the knowledge of Roman military deployment in the Hispanic provinces during the early imperial period. Even though scholars know legions were stationed on Iberian soil, understanding the auxiliary troop dispersions is less understood. “The emergence of new epigraphic evidence is understandably relevant when reconstructing the military structure of the Hispanic provinces at the dawn of the imperial period,” the authors wrote. “Such is the case with the epigraph presented here, as it provides new information on the military situation in the province of Hispania Citerior during the Julio-Claudian dynasty.” 

While the inscription wasn't fully clear, and pieces of the words were cut off, the team was able to surmise that the cavalryman's name had a Celtic origin, which aligns with the history of the ala Augusta unit, believed to have started in Gaul. 

Considering the researchers found the stele in Fuente Encalada, only about a mile and a half from the Petauonium legion's camp in the first century, questions pop up about how the auxiliary unit was connected to the area's main legion. The authors believe this find could be a previously unheard-of example of the auxiliary troops sharing a camp with the main legion, though they also state it could simply have been stationed close by. 

The dating of the tombstone leads to a potentially earlier presence of Roman troops in that part of Spain than previously believed. While known to be on site by 40 C.E., the authors said the inscription may mean the unit arrived during the Cantabrian Wars from 29-19 B.C.E. or between 6-9 C.E. to help establish a presence for the Romans. 

No matter the eventual answers to some of the unanswered questions, the study authors noted that the inscription, at a minimum, shows the likelihood that the Roman military was established in Hispania earlier than previously thought, and troop movements were more fluid than experts believed them to be.

The inscription “constitutes a new and interesting testimony” of the auxiliary movement in the era and “allows for new hypotheses about the moment of the possible arrival of the ala Augusta in the Hispanic territories, the place of operation and stationing, and the legion to which it may have been linked.”

This inscription is a major piece of evidence in rewiring our understanding of Roman military history, so the discovery is no small feat. But hopefully, its construction usage in the wine cellar construction is easily replaced.

Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI)1. The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2,3,4,5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI. These results establish a path towards essential pivotal device clinical trials that will establish the safety and efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.

SCI disrupts the communication between the brainstem vasomotor centres and the regions of the spinal cord that regulate haemodynamics6. The resulting isolation of neurons in the spinal cord triggers a progressive maladaptive reorganization of neuronal projections throughout the spinal cord below the injury that permits the insidious emergence of uncontrolled hypertensive episodes, known as autonomic dysreflexia1. The consequence of these hypertensive episodes is a daily risk of life-threatening cardiovascular events2,3,4,5.

We reasoned that disentangling the specific neuronal subpopulations involved in the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia, and how these neurons and their projection patterns reorganize after SCI, would uncover key principles to target these neurons therapeutically and thus eliminate autonomic dysreflexia due to SCI.

In humans with SCI, episodes of autonomic dysreflexia are most commonly triggered by bladder or bowel distension, lower urinary tract infections and pressure sores7. We reasoned that identifying the neurons triggering autonomic dysreflexia would require a preclinical model that provokes reliable, repeatable and predictable episodes of autonomic dysreflexia.

To establish this model, we elicited autonomic dysreflexia using colorectal distension in mice8 with complete upper-thoracic SCI and monitored pressor responses with beat-by-beat blood pressure monitoring (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a–d). All mice showed the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia, starting approximately 2 weeks after SCI (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d). The amplitude of these pressor responses increased gradually during the following weeks until reaching a plateau by 1 month after SCI, which persisted when tested at 6 weeks after SCI (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1d).

To identify the regions of the spinal cord activated during autonomic dysreflexia, we conducted whole-spinal-cord clearing9, labelling10,11, imaging12 and automated quantification13 of Fos, a marker of neuronal activity-induced transcription (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1e). We quantified this activity-induced transcription in mice that underwent repetitive autonomic dysreflexia over 90 min (ref. 14) (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 1f).

We found that autonomic dysreflexia triggered massive transcriptional activation throughout the spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 1f). However, we detected disproportionate enrichments of neuronal activity in two well-defined regions. The first enrichment occurred in the lower lumbosacral segments that receive the sensory afferents conveying information from the colorectal stimulus (Fig. 1d). The second enrichment emerged within the lower thoracic spinal cord, which is referred to as the haemodynamic hotspot6. This region hosts a dense concentration of sympathetic preganglionic neurons that access the splanchnic vasculature through ganglionic neurons to elicit powerful pressor responses6. We confirmed these segment-specific enrichments of neuronal activity with classical immunofluorescence of Fos on sectioned tissue (Extended Data Fig. 1g). This pattern of neuronal activation was preserved following complete dorsal rhizotomy of lower thoracic segments, excluding the possibility that the robust activation of neurons in the thoracic spinal cord was due to inputs from bowel afferents (Supplementary Note 2).

We anticipated that understanding the emergence of maladaptive communication between the lumbosacral and lower thoracic spinal cord would be contingent on identifying the neuronal subpopulations in each region that are activated during autonomic dysreflexia.

The neuronal subpopulations embedded within the spinal cord are parcellated into a hierarchical organization that arises from their neurotransmitter expression, developmental transcription factors and projection patterns15,16,17. This hierarchical organization dictates that identifying the neurons involved in specific neurological functions must follow the logical progression along the cardinal classes.

To follow this progression, we first asked whether the neurons embedded in the lumbosacral and lower thoracic spinal cords, and activated during autonomic dysreflexia, exhibited an excitatory or inhibitory phenotype. Our experiments revealed that vGLUT2ON neurons located in the lumbosacral spinal cord propel axonal projections to the lower thoracic spinal cord where vGLUT2ON neurons are activated and necessary to trigger autonomic dysreflexia (Supplementary Note 1).

vGLUT2ON neurons comprise diverse neuronal subpopulations that collectively encompass more than 50% of neurons in the spinal cord15,16,17. Consequently, we felt compelled to descend the hierarchical organization of neurons in the spinal cord to identify the precise neuronal subpopulations that govern the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia. However, this descent is contingent on an atlas that catalogues the molecular perturbation elicited by autonomic dysreflexia across the compendium of neuronal subpopulations in the spinal cord.

To establish this comparative atlas, we profiled the lumbosacral and lower thoracic spinal cord of mice exposed to repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)18. We obtained high-quality transcriptomes from 64,739 nuclei that were evenly represented across experimental conditions and spatial locations (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We identified all of the major cell types of the mouse spinal cord (Extended Data Fig. 3c–k). We then integrated this dataset within our previous atlases of the mouse spinal cord13,16,17,19,20, which enabled us to annotate highly specific neuronal subpopulations that parcellated into dorsal versus ventral, excitatory versus inhibitory and local (Nfib) versus long-projecting (Zfhx3) populations15 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3l–n).

To identify the neuronal subpopulations perturbed by autonomic dysreflexia, we applied cell-type prioritization19,21. We captured the principle of cell-type prioritization in a machine-learning method called Augur, which identifies cell types undergoing transcriptional responses to a perturbation by ranking cell types that are increasingly more separable within the highly multidimensional space of gene expression. This prioritization exposed Vsx2ON excitatory neurons as the most transcriptionally responsive neuronal subpopulation during autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2a). Although Vsx2ON neuronal subpopulations were prioritized in both the lumbosacral (neurons defined by the expression of Hoxa10) and the lower thoracic (Hoxa7) spinal cords, the prioritized neurons in the lumbosacral region were consistent with long-projecting Vsx2ON neurons, as they expressed the marker Zfhx3 (SCHoxa10::Zfhx3::Vsx2), whereas the most perturbed neuronal subpopulation in the lower thoracic spinal cord instead expressed markers of locally projecting neurons Nfib (SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2)15 (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3m,n).

The transcriptional prioritization of SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 and SCHoxa10::Zfhx3::Vsx2 neurons coincided with a pronounced upregulation of synaptic plasticity pathways, neuron projection guidance programs and dendritic arborization — an ensemble of gene programs associated with circuit reorganization and increased neuronal excitability (Extended Data Fig. 3o). Visualization of the activity-dependent marker Fos confirmed the activation of SCHoxa10::Zfhx3::Vsx2 and SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 neurons in the lumbosacral and lower thoracic spinal cord, respectively, in response to autonomic dysreflexia (Extended Data Fig. 3p).

Although developmentally defined V2a neurons that express Vsx2 (previously known as Chx10)22 have been implicated in the production of reaching23 and walking13,16,17,19,24, the participation of Vsx2ON neuronal subpopulations to the regulation of blood pressure has, to our knowledge, never been demonstrated. Nonetheless, the results of our comparative snRNA-seq experiments dictate that the activation of SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 and SCHoxa10::Zfhx3::Vsx2 neurons triggers autonomic dysreflexia.

As autonomic dysreflexia only emerges after SCI, we reasoned that the injury must induce the formation of a maladaptive neuronal architecture that incorporates SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons and SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons, and possesses the anatomical and functional features compatible with the requirements to trigger autonomic dysreflexia. To expose this architecture, we conducted sequential anatomical and functional experiments that aimed to reconstruct the successive nodes composing the blueprint of the neuronal architecture responsible for autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4a).

Small diameter nociceptive afferents act as the primary source of sensory input responsible for triggering autonomic dysreflexia25,26. Consequently, nociceptive neurons are positioned as the first node within the neuronal architecture of autonomic dysreflexia, implying that SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons are likely to receive synaptic projections from these afferents. To expose close appositions from these afferents onto SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons, we labelled synapses from CalcaON axonal projections. Although SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord did not receive any CalcaON axonal projections in uninjured mice, we found that SCI triggered the invasion of CalcaON axons into intermediate laminae, where they established synaptic-like appositions onto SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4b–d). This anatomical reorganization suggested that CalcaON neurons trigger autonomic dysreflexia through the activation of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons. To expose this causality, we ablated CalcaON neurons in the dorsal root ganglia with diphtheria toxin in CalcaCre::AdvilFlpO::iDTR mice27. The ablation of this afferent subpopulation abolished autonomic dysreflexia. By contrast, the ablation of parvalbumin (PVON) neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, which convey proprioceptive information along large diameter afferents that project into the spinal cord, failed to influence autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4e,f).

We next posited that SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 act as the second node in the neuronal architecture of autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 4g,h). To expose the necessity of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons in triggering autonomic dysreflexia, we infused AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry28 into the lumbosacral spinal cord of Vsx2–Cre mice. Inactivation of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons blunted autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4i–k).

We then sought to establish the sufficiency of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons to trigger autonomic dysreflexia. To expose this sufficiency, we infused AAV5-hSyn-flex-Chrimson-tdTomato29 into the lumbar spinal cord of Vsx2–Cre mice to express excitatory opsins in SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons immediately triggered autonomic dysreflexia. This increase in blood pressure contrasted with the absence of pressor responses when the same optogenetic manipulation of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons was performed in uninjured mice (Extended Data Fig. 4l–n).

The necessity and sufficiency of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons to trigger autonomic dysreflexia implied that SCI must also provoke SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons to propel axonal projections to the lower thoracic spinal cord. To uncover these putative projections, we infused rAAV2-EF1a-DIO-Flpo into the lower thoracic spinal cord followed by infusions of AAV5-hSyn-Con/Fon-eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein)30 into the lumbosacral spinal cord of Vsx2–Cre mice. This neuroanatomical tracing strategy exposed long-distance projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons that established synaptic-like appositions onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). Monosynaptically restricted transsynaptic tracing with avian enveloped G-deleted Rabies confirmed that SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons established direct synaptic projections onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 5f).

As SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord were transcriptionally perturbed by autonomic dysreflexia and received direct synaptic projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons, we hypothesized that SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons must act as the third node in the neuronal architecture of autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 5a–e). To establish the necessity and sufficiency of this node, we manipulated the activity of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons. Chemogenetic inactivation of these neurons blunted autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5g–i). In turn, optogenetic activation of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons immediately triggered pressor responses (Extended Data Fig. 5j–l).

We next asked whether the projection pattern of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord would be compatible with an involvement in autonomic dysreflexia. To answer this question, we infused AAV5-hSyn-flex-tdTomato into Vsx2–Cre mice and quantified the density of projections that formed synaptic-like appositions with ChATON neurons in the intermediolateral column of lower thoracic spinal segments, where ChATON sympathetic preganglionic neurons reside (Extended Data Fig. 5m–o). Although SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons primarily projected ventrally, we also detected projections that expanded laterally where they established synaptic-like appositions with the majority of ChATON neurons located in the intermediolateral column of the lower thoracic spinal cord.

ChATON sympathetic preganglionic neurons are embedded in the intermediolateral column, and we found that they receive projections from SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons. Consequently, we surmized that ChATON neurons act as the fourth and final node in the neuronal architecture of autonomic dysreflexia. Indeed, chemogenetic inactivation of ChATON neurons located in the lower thoracic spinal cord abolished autonomic dysreflexia elicited by bowel distension (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5p–r).

These sequential anatomical and functional experiments exposed the neuronal architecture that causes autonomic dysreflexia. The building blocks of this architecture are precipitated by SCI, in which specific neuronal nodes form maladaptive connections that permit and exacerbate the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia. This architecture has its foundation in CalcaON neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia, which establish maladaptive projections to SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord. In turn, a SCI provokes these neurons to propel axons to the haemodynamic hotspot located within the lower thoracic spinal cord, where they form synaptic connections with SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons. These locally projecting neurons naturally establish connections onto ChATON sympathetic preganglionic neurons, which therefore permit massive blood pressure elevations through the recruitment of neurons in splanchnic ganglia and subsequent α1 receptor activation throughout the dense splanchnic vasculature. The consequence of this aberrant neuronal architecture is the emergence of life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia.

Our results demonstrate that SCI precipitates the formation of an aberrant neuronal architecture that exploits the natural connections from SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons onto sympathetic preganglionic neurons located in the haemodynamic hotspot to trigger autonomic dysreflexia. We reasoned that competitive engagement of the same neuronal subpopulations with an intervention that mediates beneficial, as opposed to maladaptive reorganization of synaptic projections onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, could prevent the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia. Using molecular cartography, we recently demonstrated that epidural electrical stimulation (EES) of the lumbar spinal cord restores walking through the activation of locally projecting Vsx2ON neurons in the lumbar spinal cord13,19. We surmized that the same principle must exist in the lower thoracic spinal cord, as we have previously shown that EES applied over this haemodynamic hotspot triggers robust pressor responses after SCI6. We thus hypothesized that EES applied over the lower thoracic spinal cord activates SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, and that EES could thus compete with SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons to modulate SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons.

To identify the neuronal subpopulations engaged by EES applied to the lower thoracic spinal cord, we performed an additional comparative snRNA-seq experiment (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Concretely, we profiled neuronal nuclei from mice with SCI that had received EES over the lower thoracic spinal cord for 30 min. As we have previously described in rats, non-human primates and humans with SCI6, all the mice exhibited robust pressor responses when delivering EES over the lower thoracic spinal cord, referred to as the haemodynamic hotspot (Fig. 3a,b). High-quality transcriptional profiles were obtained from 21,098 nuclei (Fig. 3c). Integration of this dataset31 with our previous atlases13,16,17,19,20 and data from the experiments conducted on mice that were exposed to repetitive autonomic dysreflexia enabled us to identify and evaluate the same neuronal subpopulations. Cell-type prioritization19,21 revealed that locally projecting SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 neurons exhibited the most pronounced transcriptional response across the compendium of neuronal subpopulations embedded in the lower thoracic spinal cord of mice that had received EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e).

Arrowheads mark PVON synaptic-like appositions and L6 projections onto Vsx2ON neurons. White dashed lines outline the grey matter.

As we have previously found that Vsx2ON neurons were recruited in response to EES in the lumbar spinal cord13,19, these comparative snRNA-seq experiments indicate that the principle through which EES recruits specific neuronal subpopulations is conserved across the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Moreover, this observation nominates SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 neurons as a convergence node that is not only recruited during autonomic dysreflexia but can also be engaged by the neuronal architecture that prevents orthostatic hypotension when the delivery of EES targets the haemodynamic hotspot.

The discovery of this intersection compelled us to expose the entire neuronal architecture activated by EES. Therefore, we conducted sequential anatomical and functional experiments that aimed to reconstruct the successive nodes involved in the pressor responses during the delivery of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot.

We have previously shown that EES applied over the lower thoracic spinal cord activates afferent fibres in the posterior roots to trigger pressor responses6, and mounting evidence suggests that EES restores walking through the recruitment of large-diameter afferent fibres where they bend to enter the lumbosacral spinal cord through the dorsal root entry zones32,33. We thus asked whether large-diameter afferent neurons act as the first node of the neuronal architecture that enables EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to trigger pressor responses (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b).

To answer this question, we ablated proprioceptive or nociceptive neurons with the administration of diphtheria toxin to PVCre::AdvilFlpO::iDTR mice and CalcaCre::AdvilFlpO::iDTR mice, and applied EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot. The ablation of PVON neurons in the dorsal root ganglia abolished pressor responses to EES, whereas the ablation of CalcaON neurons had no effect (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). We then verified that large-diameter afferents establish synaptic projections onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord. To expose this connectome, we visualized large-diameter afferent fibres in PVCre::AdvilFlpO::Ai9(RCL-tdT) mice and confirmed that these fibres established vGLUT1ON synaptic appositions onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g). The dense projections from PVON neurons onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons contrasted with the absence of projections from PVON neurons onto ChATON neurons in the intermediolateral column of the lower thoracic spinal cord, both before and after SCI (Extended Data Fig. 7e–g). Monosynaptically restricted transsynaptic tracing with avian enveloped G-deleted Rabies confirmed that PVON neurons in the dorsal root ganglia established direct synaptic projections onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7h).

As SCHoxa7::Nfib::Vsx2 neurons underwent the greatest transcriptional perturbation following EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot and receive direct projections from large-diameter afferent fibres that are recruited by EES, we anticipated that SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons act as the second node in the neuronal architecture that enables EES to trigger pressor responses. To expose the necessary role of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, we infused AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry into the lower thoracic spinal cords of Vsx2–Cre mice. Inactivation of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons blunted the pressor responses triggered by EES (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 7i,j).

We surmized that ChATON sympathetic preganglionic neurons would logically act as the third and final node in the neuronal architecture that enables EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to trigger pressor responses. Indeed, chemogenetic inactivation of ChATON neurons located in the lower thoracic spinal cord abolished pressor responses triggered by EES (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7k,l).

Together, these results uncovered the neuronal architecture that enables EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot of the lower thoracic spinal cord to trigger pressor responses. EES directly recruits large diameter afferents to activate SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, which project to ChATON sympathetic preganglionic neurons to elicit pressor responses through the activation of ganglionic neurons, and subsequent α1 receptor activation to induce vasoconstriction.

Finally, we surmized that for the neuronal architecture enabling EES to elicit pressor responses to compete with the neuronal architecture that triggers autonomic dysreflexia, these two architectures must intersect on the same SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord.

To expose this anatomical and functional intersection, we first infused AAV5-hSyn-GFP into the lumbosacral spinal cord of PVCre::AdvilFlpO::Ai9(RCL-tdT) mice with SCI coupled to labelling of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons. We found that the same SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons received direct projections from large-diameter afferents emanating from PVON neurons located in dorsal root ganglia and from axons projecting from the lumbosacral spinal cord after SCI (Fig. 3g). Second, we aimed to confirm that these two distinct axonal projections were able to regulate the activity of the same SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons. We conducted single-unit recordings of optogenetically identified SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord in response to autonomic dysreflexia and EES (Extended Data Fig. 7m). We found that both paradigms elicited short-latency responses in the recorded SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons that were compatible with a direct activation of the same SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons (Extended Data Fig. 7n,o).

The intersection between the neuronal architecture that enables EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to mediate beneficial elevation of blood pressure and the neuronal architecture that triggers autonomic dysreflexia opened the intriguing possibility that the sustained modulation of SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons with EES could compete with the detrimental activity emanating from aberrant axonal projections of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons, ultimately reversing autonomic dysreflexia.

To test this possibility, we subjected mice to autonomic neurorehabilitation, which consisted of daily sessions during which EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot was delivered over the lower thoracic spinal cord during the course of 1 month (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Autonomic neurorehabilitation abolished autonomic dysreflexia in all tested mice (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 8b).

Grey shaded region indicates the colorectal distension period.

We suspected that the suppression of autonomic dysreflexia would emerge from the competitive advantage of large-diameter fibre projections over aberrant axonal projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons to form synaptic connections with SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons (Fig. 4c). To expose this adversarial anatomy, we labelled SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 and SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons with intersectional viral tracing strategies. We then quantified the relative density of synaptic appositions onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, both vGLUT1 synapses emanating from PVON large-diameter afferent fibres and axonal projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons. Autonomic neurorehabilitation reduced the number of aberrant projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, while concomitantly augmenting the density of vGLUT1ON synaptic appositions onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons embedded in the haemodynamic hotspot (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8c,d).

Recent case studies have reported transient increases in blood pressure in response to EES applied over the lumbosacral spinal cord of people with SCI34,35,36,37,38,39, and that the long-term delivery of EES over this location led to improvements in resting hypotension and orthostatic hypotension in these individuals. As a paucity of neurons involved in the control of blood pressure reside in the lumbosacral spinal cord, the activation and reinforcement of the neuronal architecture that causes autonomic dysreflexia is the most likely mechanism to account for these observations. Therefore, we hypothesized that the daily activation of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons in response to EES applied over the lower lumbosacral spinal cord would provide a competitive advantage to vGLUT2ON synapses emanating from these neurons and projecting onto SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons compared with vGLUT1ON synapses received from local PVON large-diameter afferent fibres, and that, ultimately, this shift in the synaptic innervations of SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons would exacerbate autonomic dysreflexia.

To test this hypothesis, we subjected a new cohort of mice to daily exposure to EES, but instead of delivering EES over the lower thoracic spinal cord to target the haemodynamic hotspot, we applied EES over the lower lumbosacral spinal cord for 30 min during the course of 1 month (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 8e). This mistargeted stimulation doubled the severity of autonomic dysreflexia in all tested mice (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8f). As anticipated, we observed a concomitant increase in the density of axonal projections from SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons onto SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons, combined with a decrease in the density of vGLUT1 synapses from PVON large-diameter afferent fibres (Extended Data Fig. 8g,h).

The dramatic exacerbation of autonomic dysreflexia triggered by the mistargeted delivery of EES demonstrates that attempts to restore haemodynamic stability with EES applied over the lumbosacral spinal cord are not only less efficacious than EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot located in the lower thoracic spinal cord40 but also proved unsafe, as the mechanism by which haemodynamics can be modulated when stimulating this region is by triggering and reinforcing the severity of life-threatening autonomic dysreflexia.

Although autonomic neurorehabilitation suppressed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, we recognized that the longitudinal monitoring of the safety and efficacy of this treatment over a long period of time would be important to inform the design of a therapy for people living with SCI.

We therefore leveraged our chronic rat model of high-thoracic contusion SCI that enables 24/7 monitoring of haemodynamic parameters without the constraints of tethered electronics6,41, which we combined with our electronic dura mater (e-dura42) implant optimized to target the haemodynamic hotspot (Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Note 3).

Rats with SCI were exposed to daily sessions of autonomic neurorehabilitation. Although all tested rats developed autonomic dysreflexia during the first few weeks after SCI, autonomic neurorehabilitation led to the gradual elimination of this symptom (Extended Data Fig. 9b,c). Anatomical examinations confirmed that autonomic neurorehabilitation enabled large-diameter afferents to compete for the innervation of Vsx2ON neurons located in the haemodynamic hotspot and, ultimately, to overcome the aberrant neuronal architecture responsible for autonomic dysreflexia (Extended Data Fig. 9d–h). We concluded that autonomic neurorehabilitation is a safe and efficacious treatment to reduce the severity of autonomic dysreflexia in rodents.

The neurosurgical intervention necessary to treat autonomic dysreflexia with EES must be weighed against the risks and benefits of the procedure. Establishing this balance requires an understanding of the prevalence, symptomatology and effectiveness of current management strategies.

Consequently, we leveraged two large-scale surveys on self-reported information on the presence of symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia and demographic information about the level of SCI (n = 1,733 total)43,44. These data revealed that 82% of individuals with tetraplegia had been told by a medical practitioner that they present with autonomic dysreflexia. We found that only 30% of the individuals were being treated for autonomic dysreflexia, yet 98% of these treated individuals still experienced symptoms (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 10a). These symptoms were primarily characterized by vasogenic manifestations including headaches and heart palpitations, sudomotor manifestations including goosebumps and sweating, as well as anxiety (Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 10b–d).

The barplots report the average drop in systolic blood pressure during orthostatic challenge (n = 11, paired samples two-tailed t-test; t = 4.7774; P = 0.00101) and the average tilt duration without EES and with EES applied over the haemodynamic hotspot (n = 11, paired samples two-tailed t-test; t = 14.33100; P < 0.001). The Kaplan–Meier plot shows exposure status to time, segregated by the presence or absence of EES. Data are derived from a companion article40. f, ADFSCI autonomic dysreflexia score before implantation and after at least 6 months but up to 2 years after implantation of the system and daily use to regulate blood pressure (n = 11, paired samples one-tailed t-test; t = 2.3256, d.f. = 10, P = 0.02118). g, Percentage of individuals (n = 11) experiencing each symptom described in the ADFSCI autonomic dysreflexia section before implantation (before) and at the latest timepoint of ARCIM therapy (after).

This symptomatology combined with the risk of life-threatening episodes of autonomic dysreflexia and the absence of adequate therapeutic management justified evaluating the effect of autonomic neurorehabilitation on the severity of autonomic dysreflexia in humans living with chronic SCI.

We next conducted a preliminary clinical evaluation to assess whether the long-term application of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to reduce hypotensive symptomatology also reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia in humans with chronic SCI. To carry out this assessment, we leveraged three ongoing observational clinical studies (STIMO-HEMO (NCT04994886, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland), HEMO (NCT05044923, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) and HemON (NCT05111093, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland)) focused on the development of a purpose-built implantable neurostimulation platform to restore haemodynamic stability based on EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot40 (Extended Data Fig. 10f).

These studies enrolled patients with cervical SCI who presented with medically refractory orthostatic hypotension. When exposed to orthostatic challenges during a tilt-table test, all the participants exhibited a rapid decline in blood pressure that required the early termination of the tilt test. Following this verification of their eligibility, the participants underwent a neurosurgical intervention to implant an electrode array targeting the dorsal root entry zones innervating the last three thoracic segments and a neurostimulator to deliver EES (Fig. 5c). Post-operative evaluations confirmed that EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot elicited robust pressor responses that reduced the severity of orthostatic hypotension (Fig. 5d,e). The participants then learned how to operate the therapy to regulate their blood pressure throughout the day for up to 2 years (Extended Data Fig. 10f). During this time, no serious device-related adverse events occurred40.

Although these studies focused on the long-term reduction of hypotensive symptomatology, the severity of autonomic symptoms was assessed concurrently with the autonomic dysfunction following SCI (ADFSCI) rating scale45. Consequently, the context of these studies allowed us to assess how the symptomatology related to autonomic dysreflexia evolved in nine participants.

Quantification of the autonomic dysreflexia subscore within the ADFSCI revealed a decrease in symptomatology related to autonomic dysreflexia after long-term use of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot. Secondary analyses of vasogenic and sudomotor manifestations revealed that the long-term use of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot led to a reduction in headaches and heart palpitations, which are the main vasogenic symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (Fig. 5f,g and Extended Data Fig. 10g). By stark contrast, sudomotor manifestations and anxiety remained unchanged from baseline.

These clinical outcomes provide preliminary evidence that the daily application of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot reduces the severity of autonomic dysreflexia in humans with chronic SCI, as quantified functionally and anatomically in mice and rats.

Here we exposed the complete, aberrant neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. Although all the neurons constituting this neuronal architecture exists in healthy mice, the SCI precipitates the development of connections between nociceptive neurons and Vsx2-expressing neurons, as well as between Vsx2-expressing neurons located in the lumbosacral and lower thoracic spinal cord that provoke the emergence of autonomic dysreflexia. This architecture incorporates locally projecting, Vsx2-expressing neurons located in the lower thoracic spinal cord that are also embedded in the neuronal architecture that enables EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to achieve safe and well-controlled increases of blood pressure. As these adversarial architectures converged onto a single neuronal subpopulation, their relative activation determined the prevailing architecture in this competitive interaction.

Exposing these adversarial architectures allowed us to design a safe intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI by applying EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot located in the lower thoracic spinal cord. Conversely, the mistargeted application of EES over the lumbosacral spinal cord reinforced the anatomical and functional connectivity of the neuronal architecture responsible for autonomic dysreflexia, which augmented the severity of these symptoms.

People living with SCI and medical practitioners are taught to identify warning signs such as headaches, sweating and goosebumps, as these signs indicate the presence of a noxious stimulus that is triggering autonomic dysreflexia, which must therefore be localized to resolve the ongoing hypertensive episode as quickly as possible46. Analysis of self-reported symptoms in patients from four clinical studies showed that EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot reduced headaches and heart palpitations, which are both directly related to dangerous increases in blood pressure. Instead, this therapy had no detectable effect on the other warning signs such as goosebumps and sweating that could still inform on the presence of noxious stimulus.

We took advantage of ongoing clinical trials to collect preliminary evidence on the potential for EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to reduce autonomic dysreflexia in humans with SCI. However, these trials were not designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this therapy, and relied only on self-reported symptoms instead of physiological outcomes. Consequently, the next steps must include the assessment of the safety and efficacy of EES targeting the haemodynamic hotspot to reduce autonomic dysreflexia in a pivotal device trial.

Adult male or female C57BL/6 mice (15–25 g body weight, 8–15 weeks of age) or transgenic mice were used for all experiments. vGLUT2–Cre (016963, Jackson Laboratory), Vsx2–Cre (MMMRRC 36672, also called Chx10–Cre), ChAT–Cre, VGAT–Cre, Ai65(RCFL-tdT) (021875; Jackson Laboratory), PV–Cre (017320, Jackson Laboratory), AdvillinFlpO (a gift from V. Abraira), iDTR and Calca–Cre transgenic mouse strains were bred and maintained on a mixed genetic background (C57BL/6). Adult female Lewis rats (180–220 g body weight, 14–30 weeks of age) were used for the rat experiments. Housing, surgery, behavioural experiments and euthanasia were all performed in compliance with the Swiss Veterinary Law guidelines. Manual bladder voiding and all other animal care was performed twice daily throughout the entire experiment. All procedures and surgeries were approved by the Veterinary Office of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland; authorization GE67).

Viruses used in this study were either acquired commercially or produced at the EPFL core facility. The following AAV plasmids were used and detailed sequence information is available as detailed or upon request: AAVDJ-hSyn-flex-mGFP-2A-synaptophysin-mRuby48 (reference AAV DJ GVVC-AAV-100, Stanford Vector Core Facility), AAV9-CMV-Cre (7014, Vector Biolabs), AAV5-hSyn-eGFP (50465-AAV5, Addgene), AAV5-Syn-flex-ChrimsonR-tdT (62723, Addgene), AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4D49 (Gi)-mCherry (44362, Addgene; 7 × 1012 vg ml−1 or more), AAV5-CAG-flex-tdTomato (a gift from S. Arber), AAV5-hSyn-Con/Fon-eYFP (#55650, Addgene), rAAV2-EF1a-DIO-Flpo (#87306, Addgene), EnvA-ΔG-Rabies-mCherry (a gift from S. Arber) and AAV8-hSyn-dlox-TVA950-2A-EGFP-2A-oGrev-dlox-WRPE-bGHp (a gift from S. Arber).

For mouse SCIs, a laminectomy was performed on the T4 vertebra to expose the T4 spinal segment. Complete transections were performed using angled microscissors. Rat SCIs were performed according to our previously published work6. In brief, a laminectomy was performed on the T3 vertebra to expose the T3 spinal segment. Following this, the rat was transferred to the Infinite Horizon (IH-0400 Impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation) impactor6 stage, where the T2 and T4 spinous processes were securely clamped using modified Allis forceps6. The rat was stabilized on the platform and the impactor tip (2.5 mm) was properly aligned using a 3D coordinate system moving platform. The Infinite Horizon system was set to deliver an impact force of 400 kdyn, with a 5-s dwell time6. Analgesia (buprenorphine; Essex Chemie; 0.01–0.05 mg kg−1, subcutaneously) and antibiotics (amoxicillin 200 mg per 4 ml; Sandoz; 200 mg l −1 ad libitum) were provided for 3 and 5 days after surgery, respectively. Bladders were manually expressed twice a day until the end of the experiment50.

All non-terminal experiments were conducted by anaesthetizing animals with isoflurane (initial induction at 5% and maintained on a Bain's system at 2%). Terminal haemodynamic assessments were carried out as previously described 4 weeks after SCI. In brief, animals were anaesthetized with urethane (1.5 g kg−1, intraperitoneally)6. The depth of anaesthesia was continually monitored by assessing withdrawal reflexes and respiratory rate.

In mice, carotid artery catheterization was performed. After induction of anaesthesia, the hair on the neck of mice was shaved, and the surgical site cleaned with alcohol and betadine. The right common carotid artery was exposed and isolated from the internal jugular vein using blunt dissection. The rostral portion of the carotid artery immediately below bifurcation was permanently occluded, whereas the caudal portion of the vessel was temporarily occluded using 5-0 silk sutures. A bent-tip 30-gauge needle was used to create a small hole on top of the carotid artery. The blood pressure sensor was inserted into the carotid artery and advanced approximately 0.5 cm caudally. The catheter was then secured with two 5-0 silk sutures. In rats, the procedure for the telemeter implantation was performed according to our previously published work6. In brief, we recorded blood pressure using wireless telemeters (TRM56SP SNA and Pressure Telemeter, Kaha Sciences). A midline abdominal incision was made to expose the peritoneal cavity, followed by a blunt dissection to reach the descending aorta. The aorta was temporarily occluded using a 4-0 silk, 1–2 mm rostral to the iliac bifurcation. The pressure sensor was inserted in the aorta so that the tip was just caudal to the renal artery and fixed with a surgical mesh and biocompatible surgical glue.

Foley Catheter Cysto-Care 1.5 ml and Foley Catheter Cysto-Care 3 ml were used for mice and rats, respectively, to perform colorectal distension to induce autonomic dysreflexia51. The catheter was inserted into the rectum and colon until the balloon was no longer exposed. During colorectal distension assessments, the balloon was inflated (up to 0.7 ml for mice and up to 2.5 ml in rats) for 60 s. Subsequent trials were only initiated after blood pressure had returned to the baseline value. For repetitive autonomic dysreflexia experiments, the balloon was inflated for 30 s and deflated for 60 s and this protocol cycled for 90 min (ref. 14).

All the procedures have been previously detailed6,13,52,53,54,55,56. To position electrodes to deliver EES in mice, laminotomies (removal of only the connective tissue between the bones, but not the bones) were performed at T9–T10 and T12–T13 to expose the spinal cord. Teflon-coated stainless steel wires connected to a percutaneous connector (Omnetics Connector Corporation) were inserted rostrally and passed between the spinal cord and the vertebral bones to the other opening. A small part of insulation was removed and the exposed stimulation sites were positioned over T12–T13. A common ground was inserted subcutaneously. The percutaneous connector was cemented to the skull. This stimulation protocol was subsequently used for all acute and chronic experiments. In rats, the implantation of the e-dura was performed according to our previously published work6. To insert and stabilize e-dura implants into the epidural space, two partial laminectomies were performed at vertebrae levels L1–L2 and T8–T9 to create entry and exit points for the implant. The implant was gently pulled above the dura mater using a surgical suture. Electrophysiological testing was performed intra-operatively to fine-tune positioning of electrodes. The connector of the implant was secured into a protective cage plastered using freshly mixed dental cement on top of the L2–L3 vertebra. Stimulation was then delivered as previously described6. The headstage was plastered using freshly mixed dental cement on the dorsal side of the skull where three stainless steel screws were placed.

In mice, we delivered EES with conventional stimulation protocols6 that involved continuous EES delivered at 50 Hz with 5-ms pulses at 100–150 µA (2100 Isolated Pulse Stimulator, A-M Systems). Mice underwent autonomic neurorehabilitation consisting of EES applied for 30 min each day for 4 weeks, starting 1 week after SCI. In rats, we applied a closed-loop controlled stimulation using a proportional integral controller that adjusts the amplitude of traveling EES waves over the three haemodynamic hotspots (MATLAB). Next, we applied a +10 mmHg systolic blood pressure target from the baseline acquired at the beginning of each autonomic neurorehabilitation session6. Rats received 30 min of closed-loop controlled stimulation for 6 weeks, starting 1 week after SCI.

For ablation experiments with the diphtheria toxin, we used PVCre::AvilFLPo::iDTR and CalcaCre::AvilFLPo::iDTR mice. Four weeks after the SCIs (T4 spinal-level complete transection), mice received intraperitoneal injections of diphtheria toxin (D0564, Sigma) diluted in saline (100 µg kg−1) to target PVON or CalcaON neurons, respectively. Mice were tested 2 weeks post-injection. To manipulate the activity of vGLUT2ON and VGATON neurons, AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4D was infused (0.15 µl per injection) at two depths (0.8 mm and 0.4 mm below the dorsal surface) and separated by 1 mm in either the lower thoracic spinal cord (T11–T13) or the lumbosacral spinal cord (L5–S1) of either vGLUT2–Cre or VGAT–Cre mice before performing the SCI. To manipulate ChATON neuronal activity, AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4D was infused (0.15 µl per injection) at two depths (0.8 mm and 0.4 mm below the dorsal surface) and separated by 1 mm in the lower thoracic spinal cord (T11–T13) of ChAT–Cre mice before performing the SCI. To manipulate SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 or SCLUMBAR::Vsx2 neurons, AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4D was infused in either the lower thoracic spinal cord (T11–T13) or the lumbosacral spinal cord (L5–S1; injection depths were 0.8 mm and 0.4 mm below the dorsal surface; separated by 1 mm; 0.15 µl per injection), respectively, in Vsx2–Cre mice before performing the SCI. After 4 weeks, autonomic dysreflexia or EES-induced pressor response was assessed before and between 30 min and 45 min after intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg kg−1 clozapine N-oxide (Carbosynth, CAS: 34233-69-7; suspended in 2% DMSO in saline).

To optogenetically manipulate Vsx2ON neurons, AAV5-Syn-flex-Chrimson (#62723-AAV5, Addgene; titre ≥ 5 × 1012 vg ml−1) was infused in either the lower thoracic spinal cord (T11–T13) and the lumbosacral spinal cord (L5–S1), in Vsx2–Cre mice before performing the SCI. After 6 weeks, laminectomies were made over T11/T12/T13 and L5/L6/S1 spinal segments. Five-ms pulses were delivered at 50 Hz from a 635-nm laser (LRD-0635-PFR-00100-03, LaserGlow Technologies). Laser light was delivered to the surface of the spinal cord through a fibre optic cable attached to 400 µm, 0.39 NA cannula with a 5-mm tip (Thorlabs). Optical power was set to 2.35 mW at the tip.

To exclusively label Vsx2ON neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord with long-distance projections to the lower thoracic region (SCLUMBAR::Vsx2), we leveraged Boolean logic viral strategies30. Partial laminectomies were made over the T11/T12/T13 and L5/L6/S1 spinal segments of Vsx2–Cre mice. Two sets of bilateral injections of AAV5-hSyn-Con/Fon-eYFP (#55650-AAV8, Addgene; titre ≥ 1 × 1013 vg ml−1)30 were made over the L5/L6/S1 spinal segments (0.25 µl per injection) at a depth of 0.6 mm below the dorsal surface and separated by 1 mm. Two sets of bilateral injections of rAAV2-EF1a-DIO-Flpo (#87306, Addgene) were made over the T11/T12/T13 spinal segments (0.15 µl per injection) at two depths (0.8 mm and 0.4 mm below the dorsal surface) and separated by 1 mm. Animals were perfused 4 weeks later. To label lower thoracic Vsx2ON neurons (SCTHORACIC::Vsx2), two sets of bilateral injections of AA5V-CAG-flex-tdtomato were made over T11/T12/T13 spinal levels (0.15 µl per injection) at two depths (0.8 mm and 0.4 mm below the dorsal surface) and separated by 1 mm.

To exclusively label vGLUT2ON neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord with long-distance projections to the lower thoracic region, we leveraged Boolean logic viral strategies30. Partial laminectomies were made over the L5/L6/S1 spinal segments of vGLUT2–Cre mice. Two sets of bilateral injections of AAVDJ-hSyn-flex-mGFP-2A-synaptophysin-mRuby48 (reference AAV DJ GVVC-AAV-100, Stanford Vector Core Facility) were made over the L5/L6/S1 spinal segments (0.25 µl per injection) at a depth of 0.6 mm below the dorsal surface and separated by 1 mm. Animals were perfused 4 weeks later.

To determine the number of transfected neurons within the injection site of the spinal cord, we implemented the spot detection function in Imaris. Following the semi-automatic detection of transfected neurons within representative sections per animal, we quantified the neurons by compiling the exported text file from Imaris.

Animals were perfused at the end of the experiments. Animals were deeply anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 ml sodium pentobarbital (50 mg ml−1). Animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Tissues were removed and post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA before being transferred to PBS or cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS.

Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described55,57,58. Perfused post-mortem tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 48 h before being embedded in cryomatrix (Tissue Tek O.C.T, Sakura Finetek Europe B.V.) and freezing. We used two procedures to identify the segment of the spinal cord. First, we identified the dorsal roots in the unsectioned spinal cord. On the basis of the location of the dorsal root entry zones, we prepared well-defined blocks of spinal cord. We then confirmed that the grey matter of the segments possess the expected laminar organization and morphology. Transverse or horizontal sections (30 µm thick) of the spinal cord were cut on a cryostat (Leica), immediately mounted on glass slides and dried or placed in free floating wells containing PBS + 0.03% sodium azide. The sections were incubated with following primary antibody diluted in blocking solution at room temperature overnight: rabbit anti-Fos (1:500), chicken anti-vGLUT1 (1:500), rabbit anti-ChAT (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit anti-Chx10 (now known as Vsx2; 1:500, Synaptic Systems). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa 488 (green), Alexa 405 (blue), Alexa 555 (red) or Alexa 647 (far red; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the nuclear stain, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; 2 ng ml−1; Molecular Probes). Sections were imaged digitally using a slide scanner (Olympus VS-120 slide scanner) or confocal microscope (LSM880 + Airy fast module with ZEN 2 Black software, Zeiss). Images were digitally processed using ImageJ (ImageJ NIH) software or Imaris (Bitplane, v9.8.2).

We performed in situ hybridization of cell-type markers and using RNAscope (Advanced Cell Diagnostics). Lists of putative marker genes were obtained from snRNA-seq data, as described below, and cross-referenced against a list of validated probes designed and provided by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. Probes were obtained for the following genes: ChAT (catalogue no. 408731) and Vsx2 (catalogue no. 438341), Slc17a6 (catalogue no. 319171) and Slc6a5, catalogue no. 409741). We then generated 12-μm cryosections from fixed-frozen spinal cords as previously described59 and performed FISH for each probe according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the RNAscope HiPlex kit (cat no. 324106). Images were generated using QuPath (v0.4.3).

Mice underwent a 90-min colorectal distension protocol (30 s inflate then 60 s deflate repeatedly)14 and were perfused9,47 30 min later with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4% PFA (in 0.1 M PBS). Spinal cords were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA (in 0.1 M PBS) at 4 °C overnight and placed in 0.1 M PBS containing 0.03% sodium azide. Immunolabelling of the samples was performed by first pretreating with methanol in 5-ml Eppendorf tubes by dehydrating with a methanol–H2O series at 1 h each at room temperature with shaking at 60 rpm: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%. This procedure was followed by 1 h washing with 100% methanol before chilling the samples at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated overnight with shaking in 66% dicholoromethane–33% methanol at room temperature. The samples were washed twice in 100% methanol with shaking at room temperature and then bleached in chilled fresh 5% H2O2 in methanol overnight at 4 °C. Samples were rehydrated with a methanol–H2O series: 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% and 0.1 M PBS, each for 1 h at room temperature under shaking. Samples were washed for 1 h × 2 at room temperature in PTx.2 buffer (0.1 M PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100) under shaking. This was followed by an incubation in 5 ml of permeabilization solution (400 ml PTx.2, 11.5 g glycine and 100 ml DMSO for a total stock volume of 500 ml) for 2 days at 37 °C with shaking at 60 rpm. Samples were incubated in 5 ml of blocking solution (42 ml PTx.2, 3 ml of normal donkey serum and 5 ml of DMSO for a total stock volume of 50 ml) for 2 days at 37 °C with shaking. The samples were incubated for 7 days at 37 °C with shaking in primary antibody solution consisting of PTwH (0.1 M PBS, 2 ml Tween-20, 10 mg l−1 heparin, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and 3% normal donkey serum) and Fos antibody (1:2,000; 226003, Synaptic Systems) for a total volume of 5 ml per sample. Samples were washed in PTwH for 24 h with shaking and incubated for 7 days at 37 °C with shaking in secondary antibody solution consisting of PTwH, 3% normal donkey serum and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (1:400, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a total volume of 5 ml per sample. Samples were washed in PTwH for 24 h with shaking at room temperature. Clearing of the samples was performed by first dehydrating the samples in a methanol–H2O series as follows: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% twice each for 1 h with shaking at room temperature followed by a 3-h incubation with shaking in 66% dichloromethane–33% methanol at room temperature. Samples were incubated in 100% dichloromethane 15 min twice with shaking to wash residual methanol. Finally, samples were incubated in 100% dibenzyl ether without shaking for refractive index matching of the solution for at least 24 h before imaging.

We incubated samples in X-CLARITY hydrogel solution (Logos Biosystems) for 24 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking12,55,60. Samples were degassed and polymerized using the X-CLARITY Polymerization System (Logos Biosystems), followed by washes in 0.001 M PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were next placed in the X-CLARITY Tissue Clearing System (Logos Biosystems), set to 1.5 A at 100 rpm at 37 °C for 29 h. Clearing solution was made in-house with 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 200 mM boric acid with dH2O, pH adjusted to 8.5. Following this, samples were washed for at least 24 h at room temperature with gentle shaking in 0.1 M PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 to remove excess sodium dodecyl sulfate. Finally, samples were incubated in 40 g of Histodenz dissolved in 30 ml of 0.02 M PB, pH 7.5, and 0.01% sodium azide (refractive index of 1.465) for at least 24 h at room temperature with gentle shaking before imaging.

We performed imaging of cleared tissue using either a customized mesoSPIM12,61 or a CLARITY-optimized light-sheet microscope (COLM)12. A custom-built sample holder was used to secure the central nervous system in a chamber filled with RIMS. Samples were imaged using either a ×1.25 or ×2.5 objective at the mesoSPIM12,61 or a ×4 or ×10 objective at the COLM12 with one or two light sheets illuminating the sample from both the left and the right sides. The voxel resolution in the x, y and z directions was 5.3 μm × 5.3 μm × 5 μm for the ×1.25 acquisition and 2.6 μm × 2.6 μm × 3 μm for the ×2.5 acquisition. The voxel resolution of the COLM was 1.4 μm × 1.4 μm × 5 μm for the ×4 and 0.59 μm × 0.59 μm × 3 μm for the ×10 acquisition. Images were generated as 16-bit TIFF files and then stitched using Arivis Vision4D (Arivis AG). 3D reconstructions and optical sections of raw images were generated using Imaris (bitplane, v9.8.2) software.

For the cleared spinal cords, Fos-positive neurons of cleared samples were quantified using Arivis Vision4D (Arivis)13. After defining a region of interest around the grey matter, each sample was subjected to a custom-made pipeline. We applied morphology, denoising and normalization filters to enhance the signal of bright objects and homogenized the background. Threshold-based segmentation of the Fos signal was applied within predefined 3D regions to quantify the total number of Fos-positive cells. Image analysis parameters were kept constant among all samples. The number of Fos-positive cells and their coordinates enabled us to quantify the neuronal activity segment by segment. For the classic immunohistochemistry, the quantification was done on Imaris (bitplane, v9.8.2) using the spot detection function.

We used the ‘add new surfaces' tool in Imaris to select the channel of interest, setting the ‘surface detail' to 0.5 µm for a more detailed surface. The ‘threshold (absolute intensity)' was adjusted to capture the full shape of the neuron accurately. We applied the ‘number of voxels Img = 1' filter, selecting the appropriate threshold values to include the reconstructed neuron. After rendering the surface, we made aesthetic adjustments, choosing the ‘transparent 3 - glass' material and setting the colour to RGB values of (1, 1, 1) to maintain transparency and highlight viral expression. For reconstructing synaptic-like appositions, we created ‘spots' based on the channel of interest using the spot detection algorithm in Imaris. The ‘estimate xy diameter' was set between 1.5 µm and 2 µm, with the ‘quality' filter applied to capture all synaptic-like appositions in the image. The ‘points style/quality' was set to ‘sphere' with a ‘radius scale' of 0.5 µm, using ‘Phong_basic' as the material for the synapses. To filter synaptic-like appositions to neurons of interest, we used the ‘find spots close to surface' function with a 1-µm threshold and selected only the ‘spots close to the surfaces' to display the synaptic-like appositions on neurons of interest. Of note, synapses were primarily counted on neuronal cell bodies as labelling of the different axonodendritic compartments with in vivo immunohistochemistry remains limited.

To determine spatial enrichment of axon and synapse density within the grey horn of the spinal cord, we implemented a custom image analysis pipeline that includes preprocessing, registration and combination of histological images from different animals. In brief, we implemented all preprocessing in Fiji, and all registration procedures in R, using the image analysis package ‘imageR' and the medical image registration package ‘RNiftyReg'. After dynamic registration, all data were summarized and final quantifications were completed using custom R scripts.

SCI at T4 and infusion of AAV5-Syn-flex-Chrimson was made in the lower thoracic spinal cord of Vsx2–Cre mice at least 4 weeks before terminal experiments. Mice were anaesthetized with urethane and isofluorane. Two-shank, multi-site electrode arrays (A2x32-6mm-35-200-177, NeuroNexus) were lowered into the spinal cord to a depth of 1,000 µm, with shanks arranged longitudinally at 350 µm from the midline. Signals were recorded with a NeuroNexus Smartbox Pro using a common average reference and while applying 50-Hz notch and 450–5,000-Hz bandpass filters. Stimulation was controlled with a Multi-Channel Systems STG 4004 and MC_Stimulus II software. ChrimsonR-expressing neurons were identified using optogenetic stimulation. Twenty pulse trains of 10-ms pulses were delivered at 10 Hz from a 635-nm laser (LRD-0635-PFR-00100-03, LaserGlow Technologies). Laser light was delivered to the surface of the spinal cord through a fibre optic cable attached to 400 µm, 0.39 NA cannula with a 5-mm tip (Thorlabs). Optical power was set to 2.35 mW at the tip. Electrical stimulation (EES) consisted of 5-ms pulses delivered every 1 Hz. EES was delivered with a micro fork probe (Inomed, 45 mm straight, item no. 522610) positioned along the midline just caudal to the recording array. Spike sorting was performed with SpyKING CIRCUS (v1.0.773). The median-based average electrical stimulation artefacts for each channel were subtracted from the recordings before sorting. Owing to the size and variability of the artefacts, periods containing residual stimulation artefacts were not sorted (–0.5 to +1.5 ms and −0.5 to +1 ms around stimulus onset for EES and laser stimulation onset, respectively). Sorting results were manually curated using Phy (https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy). Single-unit clusters were selected for analysis based on their biphasic waveforms and template amplitudes above 50 µV, as well as strong refractory period dips in their spike autocorrelograms. Similar clusters were merged according to the Phy manual clustering guide. ChrimsonR-expressing, putative SCTHORACIC::Vsx2 neurons were identified based on their low-latency and low-jitter responses to light pulses. Neurons responding to EES or tail pinch were identified by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the instantaneous firing rate of units 100 ms before and 100 ms after (EES) or 2 s before and 2 s after (pinch) stimulus onset. For EES, a post-stimulus onset firing rate increase of P < 0.001 was used, whereas for pinch a P = 0.05 was used due to the necessarily lower number of trials and larger calculation window (minimum of 6 trials for pinch and 60 trials for EES).

All data are reported as mean values and individual data points. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications55. Haemodynamic assays were replicated three to five times, depending on the experiment, and averaged per animal. For all photomicrographs of histological tissue, staining experiments were repeated independently with tissue from at least four, and in most cases six, different animals with similar results. Statistics were then performed over the mean of animals. All statistical analysis was performed in R using the base package ‘stats', with primary implementation through the ‘tidyverse' and ‘broom' packages. Tests used included one-tailed or two-tailed paired or independent samples Student's t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for neuromorphological evaluations with more than two groups, and one-way or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA for haemodynamic assessments, when data were distributed normally, tested using a Shapiro–Wilk test. Post-hoc Tukey tests were applied when appropriate. For regressions, mixed-model linear regression was used in cases of multiple observations, or else standard linear modelling. In cases where group size was equal to or less than three, null hypothesis testing was not completed. The significance level was set as P < 0.05. Throughout the paper, the boxplots show the median (horizontal line), interquartile range (hinges) and smallest and largest values no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (whiskers). Exclusions of data are noted in the relevant Methods sections. Unless stated otherwise, experiments were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Single-nucleus dissociation of the mouse lower thoracic and lumbosacral spinal segments was performed according to our established procedures19,20. Following euthanasia by isoflurane inhalation and cervical dislocation, the lumbar spinal cord site was immediately dissected and frozen on dry ice. Spinal cords were doused in 500 µl sucrose buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mM CaCl2, 3 mM Mg acetate, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and 0.1% Triton X-100 with the Kontes Dounce tissue grinder. Sucrose buffer (2 ml) was then added and filtered through a 40-µm cell strainer. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,200g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then decanted, and 3 ml of sucrose buffer was added to the pellet for 1 min. We homogenized the pellet using an Ultra-Turrax and 12.5 ml of density buffer (1 M sucrose, 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 3 mM Mg acetate and 1 mM dithiothreitol) was added below the nuclei layer. The tube was centrifuged at 3,200g at 4 °C and the supernatant poured off. Nuclei on the bottom half of the tube wall were collected with 100 µl PBS with 0.04% BSA and 0.2 U µl−1 RNase inhibitor. Finally, we resuspended nuclei through a 30-µm strainer and adjusted to 1,000 nuclei per microlitre.

snRNA-seq library preparation was carried out using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Kit (v3.1). The nuclei suspension was added to the Chromium RT mix to achieve loading numbers of 2,000–5,000. For downstream cDNA synthesis (13 PCR cycles), library preparation and sequencing, the manufacturer's instructions were followed.

We aligned reads to the most recent Ensembl release (GRCm38.93) using Cell Ranger, and obtained a matrix of unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts. Seurat31 was used to calculate quality control metrics for each cell barcode, including the number of genes detected, number of UMIs and proportion of reads aligned to mitochondrial genes. Low-quality cells were filtered by removing cells expressing less than 200 genes or with more than 5% mitochondrial reads. Genes expressed in less than three cells were likewise removed.

Before clustering analysis, we first performed batch-effect correction and data integration across the two different experimental conditions as previously described31. Gene expression data were normalized using regularized negative binomial models62, then integrated across batches using the data integration workflow within Seurat. The normalized and integrated gene expression matrices were then subjected to clustering to identify cell types in the integrated dataset, again using the default Seurat workflow. Cell types were manually annotated on the basis of marker gene expression, guided by previous studies of the mouse spinal cord19,63,64,65. Local and projecting neuronal subpopulations were annotated on the basis of Nfib and Zfhx3 expression, respectively15. Following our projection-specific snRNA-seq experiment in uninjured mice, each subsequent experiment was reintegrated with this dataset before subpopulation annotation. This enabled the identification of the same 28 neuronal subpopulations across the three distinct experiments31.

To identify neuronal subpopulations perturbed during natural repair, we implemented our machine-learning method Augur19,21. Augur was run with default parameters for all comparisons. To evaluate the robustness of cell-type prioritizations to the resolution at which neuronal subtypes were defined in the snRNA-seq data, we applied Augur at various clustering resolutions and visualized the resulting cell-type prioritizations both on a hierarchical clustering tree66 of neuron subtypes and as a progression of UMAPs. The key assumption underlying Augur is that cell types undergoing a profound response to a perturbation should become more separable, within the highly multidimensional space of gene expression, than less affected cell types. In brief, Augur withholds a proportion of sample labels, then trains a random forest classifier to predict the condition from which each cell was obtained. The accuracy with which this prediction can be made from single-cell gene expression measurements is then evaluated in cross-validation and quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

All experiments were carried out as part of three clinical safety (primary objective) and preliminary efficacy (secondary objectives) trials: STIMO-HEMO (NCT04994886, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland), HEMO (NCT05044923, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada) and HemON (NCT05111093, CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland). All three trials and subsequent amendments received approval by the local ethical committees and national competent authorities. All participants signed a written informed consent before their participation, which included consent to complete the autonomic dysreflexia component of the ADFSCI. All participants had the option to indicate consent for the publication of identifiable images or videos. All surgical and experimental procedures were performed at the investigational hospital sites (Neurosurgery Department of the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and the Neurosurgery Department of the Foothills Medical Center (Calgary, Canada). The study involved eligibility and baseline assessments before surgery, the surgical implantation of the respective investigational devices, a post-operative period during which EES protocols were configured, and long-term follow-up periods. To date, a total of ten participants have been participating for more than 6 months in the study. More detailed information about these trials can be found in other publications40.

Eleven individuals (five women and six men) who had suffered a traumatic SCI participated overall in the four studies. Demographic data and neurological status, evaluated according to the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury1, can be found in Supplementary Table 3.

The participant was put under general anaesthesia and was placed in a prone position. Preoperative surgical planning informed the neurosurgeon about the vertebral entry level and predicted optimal position. On the basis of this knowledge, lateral and anteroposterior fluoroscopy X-rays were performed intraoperatively to guide the location of the laminotomies. A midline skin incision of approximately 5 cm on the back was performed, the fascia opened and the muscles were retracted bilaterally. Excision of the midline ligamentous structures and a laminotomy at the desired entry level enabled the insertion of the paddle array at the spinal thoracic level. For participants of the STIMO-HEMO and HEMO trials, a second skin incision or extended opening caudally was made and a second laminotomy was performed in the lumbar area based on the pre-operative planning to allow for the insertion of the lumbar paddle lead. The paddle lead (or leads; Specify 5-6-5, Medtronic or ARCIM Thoracic Lead, ONWARD Medical N.V) were inserted and placed over the midline of the exposed dura mater and advanced rostrally to the target position guided by repeated fluoroscopies. Electrophysiological recordings were conducted using standard neuromonitoring systems (IOMAX, Cadwell Industries or ISIS Xpress, Inomed Medizintechnik). Single pulses of EES (0.5 Hz) were delivered at increasing amplitude to elicit muscle responses that are recorded from the subdermal (Neuroline Twisted Pair Subdermal, 12 × 0.4 mm, Ambu A/S) or intramuscular (Inomed SDN electrodes, 40 × 0.45 mm, Inomed Medizintechnik) needle electrodes to correct for lateral and rostrocaudal positioning. If the paddles were deviating from a straight midline position, small additional laminotomies were made to remove bony protrusions and guide the paddle to a midline placement. Once the final position was achieved, the leads were anchored to the muscular fascia. In the STIMO-HEMO and HemON trials, the back opening was temporarily closed and the participant was put in lateral decubitus. Subsequently, the back incision was reopened and an abdominal incision of about 5 cm was made per implantable pulse generator (IPG) and a subcutaneous pocket was created. In the HEMO trial, incisions of about 5 cm were made bilaterally in the upper buttocks region and subcutaneous pockets were created. The paddle array cables were then tunneled between the back opening and subcutaneous pockets to be connected to the IPGs (Intellis, Medtronic or ARCIM IPG, ONWARD Medical). The IPGs were implanted in the subcutaneous pockets and all incisions were finally closed.

Spatial mapping was guided by the preclinical mechanisms previously described6 and from previous clinical mappings40, and was conducted in three steps: (1) intra-operative mapping to identify which rows of electrodes target the haemodynamic hotspot, and elicit the largest pressor response in the thoracic spinal cord (T10, T11 and T12), (2) post-operative imaging and spinal reconstructions were used to estimate the electrodes that maximize recruitment of the haemodynamic hotspots, and (3) a single 2-h, post-operative mapping session was done to test each row of electrodes on the lead and pick the three configurations with the largest pressor responses. These configurations were tested in both multipolar and monopolar settings and were validated by personalized simulations to ensure that we were optimally targeting the haemodynamic hotspots. Stimulation frequency was defined empirically at 120 Hz for the spatial mapping6,40. The pulse width was 300 μs. The amplitude was set by incrementally increasing the current per configuration until the systolic pressure increased by 20 mmHg, the diastolic pressure increased by 10 mmHg, or the patient did not report any discomfort such as muscle contractions or sensations such as tingling. These mappings were done in a seated position to mimic relevant, daily life orthostatic challenges.

Beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate were obtained via finger plethysmography (Finometer, Finapres Medical Systems). Beat-by-beat blood pressure was calibrated to brachial artery blood pressure collected using an arm cuff embedded and synchronized with the Finometer67,68,69,70. Brachial arterial pressure was sampled at 200 Hz, whereas the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were extracted from the calibrated arterial pressure at 1 Hz. The heart rate was also sampled at 1 Hz. Raw data and automatically extracted haemodynamic parameters were saved and exported from the Finometer.

Participants were transferred to a supine position on a table capable of head-up tilt. We applied restraint straps to secure the patient below the knees, across the thighs and the trunk, with the feet stabilized. Resting supine blood pressure was recorded continuously for approximately 5–10 min to establish baseline values. Then, we tilted the patient upright up to a maximum of 70° while recording haemodynamic values and symptoms of orthostatic tolerance. The time to reach the desired tilt angle from supine was achieved in less than 45 s. Participants were tilted until reaching their tolerance threshold or for a maximum duration of 10 min. They were asked not to talk during the test except to inform and grade symptoms. The participant was asked to report any symptoms every 1–3 min. The participant was asked to rank their symptoms between 1–10, 1 being no symptoms at all, and 10 being feelings of dizziness, lightheadedness71 or nausea37,71. The patient was instructed to notify the research team if they needed to be returned to the supine position.

During a tilt test (see the section ‘Orthostatic challenge with the tilt table test'), changes in blood pressure were recorded without stimulation or in response to different types of stimulation (continuous or closed-loop stimulation) using the Finometer (see the section ‘Clinical haemodynamic monitoring'). Change in blood pressure or heart rate was defined as the difference in the average of a 60-s window before the start of the tilt and a 20-s window at 3 min of the challenge. If the participant could not tolerate at least 3 min of the test due to low blood pressure or other symptoms, an average of a 20-s window before the end of the tilt was used. All measurements in seated position were measured with stimulation on for 3–5 min. Change in blood pressure, or heart rate, was defined as the difference in the average of a 20-s window before the start of EES and the average of a 20-s window at 3 min, before stopping stimulation. All signals were smoothed over a 10-s window for illustration. The same processing was used for post-operative, day 1 quantification. In the present study, we report on blood pressure data on the two study participants implanted with the full ARCIM implantable system.

The investigational system used in the STIMO-HEMO and HEMO clinical trials consisted of a set of CE-marked, FDA-approved medical devices used off-label. Two IPGs (lntellis with AdaptiveStim, Medtronic) are connected to their respective paddle leads (Specify 5-6-5 SureScan MRI, Medtronic), both indicated for chronic pain management. A tablet application with a communicator device (Intellis clinician programmer, Medtronic) was used by the clinical team to wirelessly set up the system and optimize the stimulation parameters. A remote control device and transcutaneous charger device (Patient Programmer and Recharger, Medtronic) were used by the participants to charge the IPGs and wirelessly turn the stimulation on and off during daily life and adapt a subset of stimulation parameters defined by the clinical team.

The investigational system used in the HemON was purpose-built for restoring haemodynamic stability. A step-wise approach was followed. All participants were implanted with a purpose-built IPG (ARCIM Thoracic System, ONWARD Medical) that communicates with a purpose-built ecosystem of control devices. The first four participants of the HemON clinical trial received an off-label paddle lead (Specify 5-6-5 SureScan MRI, Medtronic), whereas all other participants were implanted with a novel, purpose-built, paddle lead (ARCIM Thoracic Lead, ONWARD Medical).

The purpose-built ARCIM IPG developed by ONWARD Medical is a novel 16-channel IPG developed to deliver targeted EES. It controls and delivers current-controlled stimulation pulses according to predefined stimulation programmes or through commands received in real time to monopolar or multipolar electrode configurations on 16 channels. The IPG consists of a hermetically sealed, biocompatible can that surrounds the electrical components and a rechargeable battery that enables its function. The IPG is composed of two main components: the header containing the connector block that enables connection with two eight-contact lead connectors as well as two coils for charging and communication, and the can with a rechargeable battery and electronics circuits. The IPG was developed according to all applicable standards for medical device development. Conventional biomedical technologies were used to fabricate the IPG and extensive bench, and in vivo testing was performed to verify its performance. The IPG was implanted subcutaneously at the abdominal level and communicates wirelessly with the ARCIM Hub with near-field magnetic induction. This wearable device was worn on a belt over or in proximity to the IPG location and was responsible for wirelessly charging the IPG's battery and for programming the IPG with stimulation settings received from several user interfaces. The communication between the hub and IPG provides real-time control of stimulation parameters (as fast as approximately 25 ms between command and stimulation execution), allowing integration with a fast closed-loop neuromodulation system. The ARCIM Hub contains a Bluetooth low-energy chip to enable fast, reliable wireless communication with external programmers such as the ARCIM Clinician Programmer, an Android app designed for clinicians to configure and test the implanted system and personalized stimulation programs. When a stimulation program was deemed safe for personal use, the Clinician Programmer can be used to make this stimulation program available to the patient. The patients, or their caregivers, can control the system through the ARCIM Personal Programmer. This Android watch application allows users to select, start and stop stimulation programs, as well as modulate stimulation amplitudes within predefined safety limits ad hoc. Device errors, paddle lead impedances and daily stimulation utilization were extracted from usage logs across all devices. Furthermore, the Clinician Programmer includes an application programming interface (the ARCIM API) that enables other programming softwares to control the stimulation, for example, for closed-loop control of the stimulation. All devices and softwares are adherent to the applicable standards and their performance was extensively tested. The entire system, including the IPG, received the equivalent of an investigational device exemption from the competent Swiss authorities.

The ARC-IM Thoracic Lead developed by ONWARD Medical is a new 16-electrode paddle lead that is designed for selective recruitment of the dorsal root entry zones of the low-thoracic spinal cord with optimal coverage of the T10–T12 spinal levels. More detailed information about this paddle lead can be found in other publications40.

Ethical approval was obtained from an independent ethics board (Veritas Independent Review Board) and the Research Ethics Board of Université Laval (principal investigator's institution). Ethical approval from local research ethics boards was also obtained to recruit from SCI centres across Canada. Individuals with SCI (n = 1,479) across Canada were recruited using a national consumer awareness campaign and provided written informed consent43,44. The survey consisted of a series of variables identified by health-care and service providers, researchers and individuals with SCI, including demographics, secondary health complications, comorbidities, SCI-related needs, health-care utilization, community participation, quality of life and overall health ratings43,44. Participants were asked how often they had experienced symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia in the past 12 months and responses were ranked on a six-point ordinal severity scale ranging from 0 (‘never') to 5 (‘every day'). Participants were also asked whether they received or sought out treatment concerning these symptoms on a two-point scale (‘yes' or ‘no'), along with the degree to which it limited activities from 0 (‘never') to 5 (‘every day'). Participants were also asked whether they had experienced specific problems, such as heart disease, in the past 12 months. Participants' American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale was estimated using responses to questions about lesion level and sensorimotor and/or mobility capabilities. A binary approach was used for the evaluation of outcome variables including the level of injury (cervical SCI versus non-cervical SCI), the severity of injury (complete versus incomplete), the presence of autonomic dysreflexia (yes versus no) and autonomic dysreflexia symptoms (yes versus no). For variables ranked on a six-point ordinal scale, lower scores (0–3) were categorized as ‘no' and higher scores (4–5) were categorized as ‘yes'.

The ADFSCI is a 24-item questionnaire divided into four sections: demographics, medication, autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension. The autonomic dysreflexia section consists of seven items. Each item used a five-point scale to measure the frequency and severity of symptoms related to autonomic dysreflexia, including headaches, goosebumps, heart palpitations, sweating and anxiety, across different situational contexts. Participants were categorized as experiencing symptoms if the item score was higher than 2 or not experiencing symptoms otherwise. For data collection related to the ADFSCI of individuals not involved in the ongoing clinical studies, Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board approval (REB21-0045) was obtained from the University of Calgary. All participants provided written informed consent before providing their responses.

a, Experimental model of autonomic dysreflexia in mice with SCI and timeline of the experiment and final assessments. Blood pressure responses were monitored beat-by-beat using a blood pressure catheter inserted into the carotid artery. Autonomic dysreflexia was elicited using controlled colorectal distension in mice with upper-thoracic SCI. b, Baseline systolic blood pressure measured at different timepoints after SCI. Raw data and statistics provided in Supplementary Table 1. c, Blood pressure recording before, during and after a controlled colorectal distension. d, Pressor responses (Left; bold line represents mean trace ± sem for each group and individual line traces are from each animal) and severity of autonomic dysreflexia (Right) measured by the change in systolic blood pressure during colorectal distension at different timepoints after SCI (n = 5 per timepoint). Raw data and statistics provided in Supplementary Table 1. e, Overview of experimental protocol to identify the regions of the spinal cord activated during autonomic dysreflexia. Thirty days after receiving SCI, mice underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia over 90 min, consisting of 30 s, and then deflated for 60 s. Tissues were collected one hour after the exposure to autonomic dysreflexia, and then processed to visualize the expression of cFos in neurons. Bottom, CLARITY-optimized light sheet microscopy of the cleared spinal cord enabled visualisation of cFos immunoreactivity over the entire thoracolumbosacral spinal cord9,47 in mice with SCI and mice with SCI that underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. f, Quantification of cFos immunoreactivity in mice with SCI only and mice with SCI that underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia (mixed effect linear model; t = 6.60; p-value = 0.000213). g, Quantifications of cFos expression over the whole spinal cord were confirmed with immunohistochemistry and labelling for cFos on longitudinal sections of spinal cord, as illustrated in the representative photomicrographs of spinal cord sections from mice with SCI and mice with SCI that underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia (mixed effect linear model; t = 6.11; p-value = 0.000287). h, Schematic overview of experiment to assess blood pressure responses to colorectal distension in mice with SCI after bilateral dorsal rhizotomies at T11-T13. i, Severity of autonomic dysreflexia measured by the change in systolic blood pressure during colorectal distension in injured mice with and without bilateral dorsal rhizotomies at T11-T13 (n = 4; independent samples two-tailed t-test; t = 2.1255; p-value = 0.079). j, Quantifications of cFos expression over the whole spinal cord were confirmed with immunohistochemistry and labelling for cFos on longitudinal sections of spinal cord, as illustrated in the representative photomicrographs of spinal cord sections from mice with SCI and mice with SCI that underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia (mixed effect linear model; t = 14.082; p-value < 0.0001).

a, Schematic overview of experiments to reveal the phenotype of the neurons that are activated during autonomic dysreflexia. We subjected Vglut2Cre::Ai9(RCL-tdT), VgatCre::Ai9(RCL-tdT) and ChatCre::Ai9(RCL-tdT) to repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia at 30 days post-injury. Longitudinal sections of the spinal cord from T9 to L3 and L4 to S4 were immunohistochemically stained for cFos. Right, Quantification of colocalisation of cFos-labelled neurons and endogenous fluorescence-tagged neurons (Vglut2ON, VgatON and ChatON) was performed with automated spot detection (Imaris, Bitplane v.9.8.2). b, We next performed experiments to determine the role of these neuronal subpopulations in triggering autonomic dysreflexia. To manipulate the activity of Vglut2ON and VgatON neurons, AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4D(Gi)-mCherry was infused in either the lower thoracic spinal cord (T11-T13) or lumbosacral spinal cord (L5-S1) of either Vglut2Cre or VgatCre mice prior to performing the SCI to express DREADDs in glutamatergic or gabaergic neurons. Photomicrographs of coronal sections from either the lower thoracic or lumbosacral spinal cord in Vglut2Cre and VgatCre mice reveal the robust expression of mCherry and thus DREADDs in the targeted neurons. c, Chemogenetic inactivation restricted to Vglut2ON neurons located in the lumbosacral (n = 5; paired samples t-test; t = −10.4; p = 0.00048) or lower thoracic spinal cord (n = 5; paired samples t-test; t = −17.5; p = 0.00001) blunted autonomic dysreflexia. In contrast, chemogenetic silencing of VgatON neurons in the lumbosacral (n = 3; paired samples t-test; t = −1.53; p = 0.267) or lower thoracic spinal cord (n = 4; paired samples t-test; t = 0.269; p = 0.805) failed to modulate the severity of autonomic dysreflexia. Pressor responses (Left; bold line represents mean trace ± sem for each group and individual line traces are from each animal) and severity of autonomic dysreflexia (bar graph, Right) measured by the change in systolic blood pressure during colorectal distension. d, We next aimed to expose the projections from Vglut2ON neurons located in the lumbosacral spinal cord to the Vglut2ON neurons located in the lower thoracic spinal cord. For this, we labeled the axons and synapses of Vglut2ON neurons with infusions of AAV-DJ-hSyn-flex-mGFP-2A-synaptophysin-mRuby into the lumbosacral spinal cord of Vglut2Cre. The cell bodies in the lumbosacral spinal cord in both intact and injured mice were quantified (n = 4; independent samples two-tailed t-test; t = 0.473; p-value = 0.654). Photomicrographs of the lower thoracic spinal cord from representative mice demonstrate increases in the density of axons (Left; n = 4; independent samples two-tailed t-test; t = 5.92; p-value = 0.0047) and synaptic puncta (Right; n = 4; independent samples two-tailed t-test; t = 3.47; p-value = 0.027) emanating from Vglut2ON neurons located in the lumbosacral spinal cord after SCI.

a, Scheme illustrating our experimental protocol followed by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Mice received upper-thoracic SCI. After 30 days, half of the mice underwent repetitive episodes of autonomic dysreflexia during 90 min. The lumbosacral spinal cord and the lower thoracic were dissected from the mice according to standard procedures. b, We obtained high-quality transcriptomes from 64,739 nuclei that were evenly represented across experimental conditions and spatial locations. c, Quality control from 64,739 single-nucleus transcriptomes.

Justin Farris, a longtime product leader at Zillow and GitLab, joined Seattle startup Read AI as vice president of product. 

Farris spent more than five years in a similar role at GitLab, the publicly traded DevOps company, and was director of product development at Zillow. 

Founded in 2021, Read AI got its start with a meeting notetaker and has added various other enterprise productivity tools. It raised a $50 million Series B round last year.

In a press release, Farris called Read AI the “Cursor for productivity.”

“Just as GitLab is the go-to place for the entire software development process, Read AI is the go-to place where work comes together,” he said. “I saw first-hand what's happening in the developer tools space, and see even larger opportunities in the productivity and AI assistant category.”

Read AI on Wednesday rolled out a new “Agentic Workflow Suite.” The company is led by David Shim, who won CEO of the Year honors at the GeekWire Awards in May. 

— Lisa Gurry is stepping down from Seattle health data startup Truveta. 

Gurry spent more than 23 years at Microsoft before helping launch Truveta as its chief marketing officer in 2020. She later served as chief operating officer and chief growth officer. 

“I embraced my role as the only female co-founder and worked hard to create a successful company and a positive experience for all Truvetans,” Gurry wrote on LinkedIn.

Gurry said that she is “so excited for my next grand adventure” but didn't reveal more details. 

Truveta reached unicorn status earlier this year after raising $320 million. The company aims to aggregate medical records data from partner institutions to link treatments with outcomes and underlying health. It is led by CEO Terry Myerson, a former Microsoft executive vice president.

— Hossein Nowbar, chief legal officer at Microsoft, is stepping down after nearly three decades at the Redmond tech giant.

Nowbar graduated from the University of Washington in 1993, worked at Davis Wright Tremaine for four years, and then joined Microsoft in 1997. 

He was named chief legal officer in 2023.

“I helped clear antitrust hurdles for transformative acquisitions like Nuance and Activision Blizzard King, supported product and service launches that reshaped the way we work, and introduced the Customer Copyright Commitment to help our customers realize the promise of AI,” Nowbar wrote on LinkedIn.

Nowbar didn't share details of his next gig. Jonathan Palmer, a corporate vice president and 15-year veteran of Microsoft, will serve as the company's new chief legal officer.

— Edwin Miller, CEO of Seattle-based Marchex, is stepping down after two years leading the publicly traded call and conversation analytics company. Marchex also announced a series of other exec changes:

Miller will serve as a senior advisor to Russell Horowitz, chairman at Marchex.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.                                


In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

by Todd Bishop on Sep 17, 2025 at 6:25 amSeptember 17, 2025 at 9:52 am

Amazon this morning unveiled a new wave of agentic AI tools designed to act as proactive partners for the independent sellers who generate more than 60% of its online retail sales. 

The upgrades to Amazon's Seller Assistant and Creative Studio promise to automate everything from monitoring inventory to producing polished ad campaigns. Amazon says they're meant to further empower the businesses that operate on its 25-year-old third-party marketplace.

Amazon's partnership with those sellers has turned into “probably the most compelling and substantial collaboration in the history of retail,” CEO Andy Jassy told the crowd during a Tuesday appearance at the company's Accelerate seller conference in Seattle.

Some sellers see a more complicated reality, where the benefits of access to Amazon's giant marketplace come with rising costs, restrictive policies, and a sense of unequal treatment, as reflected in independent surveys from analysts, vendors, and consulting firms. 

Meanwhile, an ongoing FTC antitrust case alleges that Amazon has illegally leveraged its power over third-party sellers through a variety of practices that the company strongly denies. 

Bloomberg News reported last week that the FTC is separately looking into new questions about whether Google and Amazon gave sufficient disclosures about pricing for search ads that, in the case of Amazon's marketplace, are heavily used by sellers to promote listings.

Those larger issues form a complex yet largely unstated backdrop for Amazon's annual seller conference. Accelerate is taking place this week at the Seattle Convention Center, a few blocks from Amazon's Seattle headquarters, drawing sellers from across the country and the world.

As with much of the tech industry right now, AI is front-and-center at this year's conference. It's part of Amazon's companywide effort to demonstrate leadership in a field where it has sometimes been seen as playing catch-up to OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others.

Amazon says its existing generative AI technologies have been used by 1.3 million sellers. They include tools that automatically generate product listings from a photo or short description, suggest attributes and keywords to include in listings, and draft ad copy, for example.

The new agentic AI tools go beyond those capabilities to serve as broader assistants — in some cases acting proactively, with the seller's permission, according to the company. 

The additions to the Creative Studio, for example, aim to give sellers a built-in creative partner that can research products and audiences, brainstorm concepts, draft storyboards, and generate full video and display ad campaigns from start to finish.

“So rather than clicking a button, you're actually able to have a natural-language conversation with a creative partner that is working with you to help you achieve your goals,” said Jay Richman, vice president of creative products and technology for Amazon Ads, in an interview.

Features of the upgraded Seller Assistant include the ability to actively monitor inventory levels, flag potential compliance or account-health issues, and anticipate shifts in product demand — even generating specific recommendations on pricing, promotions, or restocking. 

With a seller's approval, the tool can then take action by preparing shipments, scheduling replenishment, or adjusting listings directly through Amazon's systems.

Amazon says it's powering the new tools with its Nova AI foundation model and Anthropic's Claude 4 in conjunction with its deep knowledge of shopping, successful seller approaches. 

That broad intelligence is then combined with real-time context about each seller's specific situation and history on the platform — such as inventory levels, seasonal patterns, and promotions, plus the ability to act directly through Amazon's internal systems and APIs.

“So it's not just some generalized knowledge or generalized capability from all the history. It is tailored to their specific situation,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of selling partner services, in an interview about the new tools at the conference this week. 

For example, the tools could create tailored recommendations for a holiday-driven business on exactly how many units to send into Fulfillment by Amazon — and then, if approved, schedule and facilitate the shipments, all the way down to creating the shipping labels.

Amazon's access to confidential merchant data on its e-commerce platform has been a sticking point in other situations, giving rise to accusations that people inside the company have mined individual seller information to launch competing products. Amazon has repeatedly denied these allegations.

With the new AI tools, Mehta said, the company has been careful not to train its models with seller-specific data, ensuring that no confidential information informs its recommendations to a competing seller. Instead, Amazon aggregates broad trends and insights, and combines them with the seller's own context, while keeping that seller's information siloed.

“That's really important for privacy,” Mehta added, noting that no one would want their personal data used to give a competitor an advantage. The goal, he said, is to build trust so that sellers are comfortable letting the AI act on their behalf with their permission. 

The broader financial stakes are huge for Amazon and sellers. 

All of which makes it all the more remarkable that this part of Amazon's business almost never happened. Addressing sellers Tuesday afternoon in an appearance with Mehta on stage, Jassy said the decision to allow independent sellers into Amazon's online store caused “quite an animated debate” inside the company when it was first considered 25 years ago. 

Amazon executives were unsure at the time that third-party merchants could live up to its brand and customer service standards. But ultimately, he said, after weeks of deliberation, they decided that more sellers would mean better selection and lower prices for customers.

“What we're doing together is very unusual,” Jassy said, predicting that the new wave of AI tools are going to make the collaboration even more successful. “I still think it's very early days.”

A new social network has been quietly blowing up with Gen Z and younger, and it's not from Meta. 

San Francisco-based Airbuds offers a mobile, social app that lets people express themselves through their music. Users can share what they're streaming with friends through a smartphone widget that works with a range of streaming services.

On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.

The startup has seen over 15 million app downloads up to this point, and has 5 million monthly active users, 1.5 million of whom launch the app daily. According to app intelligence firm Appfigures, Airbuds also has a 96% positive ratings sentiment over the last 30 days across 9,400-plus ratings.

For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place.

That's a combination that top music providers like Apple and Spotify have yet to figure out. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping, which closed down in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. (Connect also didn't last.)

Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds, comments, polls, and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories, collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more. 

Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable.

Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they've had time to iterate on their ideas.

Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon's Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017.

After the Cappuccio team sold the app and its related IP to a meditation studio called Sociaaal, the startup moved on to a widget-oriented app, resulting in Airbuds.

“Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it's a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. He saw that iOS widgets, which were still relatively new to the iPhone at the time, were popular with teens. That led him to think about building a widget that would show you what songs your friends were streaming.

“Basically, it's effortless. You just connect your Spotify, and then every time you're going to listen to something on Spotify, it's going to be shared on Airbuds in real time,” he says. 

Today, Airbuds supports Spotify, Apple Music, Soundcloud, Musi, Deezer, Amazon Music, and Audiomack.

While Airbuds' core functionality remains the widget, the app has built on top of that experience to offer a range of other social features. 

Users can react to their friends' streamed songs with emojis, stickers, or selfies clipped out from photos with the background removed. As users scroll the app's feed, they can play clips of their friends' streamed songs and even chat with a friend through a simple, built-in messenger. When you want to stream your music but not share it, there's a “ghost mode” option to keep your listening private until it's disabled.

Airbuds will also display friends with similar music tastes and deliver a personalized Weekly Recap of what you streamed, like a miniature version of Spotify's popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it's experimenting with a new feature that would let users join their school on the app to see the music top artists from their schoolmates.

Users can also customize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite artists, songs, albums, lyrics, pictures, text, and more, or let the app automatically design it for them.

This self-expression feature is key to the app's traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app's features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming. 

The streamers, he said, “gave us access to 100 million songs, but nobody really cracked the identity piece, the self-expression piece…and this is exactly how they use it,” referring to Airbuds' young users, who are mostly high schoolers and college students in the U.S. (The app also has some traction in the U.K., Australia, Brazil, and Mexico.)  

However, some of Airbuds' traction can be chalked up to its feature-gating, which requires users to invite friends to gain access to some of the app's functionality. For example, you have to invite friends to see more than your top 3 artists in the recap. But Poupardin stresses it's not just for growth — the app only really works if you add your friends.

With the new funding in hand, Airbuds is planning other ways to expand its app, potentially by supporting other types of streaming services, providing artist-to-fan connections, or designing features to attract older users. The team is also testing a subscription feature.

 To date, the startup has raised a total of $10 million from investors including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital.

Airbuds is available on iOS and Android.

Zoom on Wednesday launched new products at its Zoomtopia conference, including an upgraded AI companion that can work across meeting apps, as well as the ability to add your own notes, AI-powered meeting scheduling, and AI avatars that resemble users. With these features, the company aims to compete with verticalized meeting startups and productivity suites.

The company has long offered an AI bot that can record and transcribe Zoom meetings. However, cross-application meeting notetakers like Read AI, Otter, Fireflies, Granola, and Circleback have made great progress. To tackle that, Zoom is making its AI companion work with other platforms such as Meet and Microsoft Teams, along with a feature to take notes during in-person meetings.

The company is taking a page out of Granola's book to let users jot down their own notes during meetings, then have AI expand and structure them later. Zoom is also adding cross-platform search so users can retrieve information from across Google and Microsoft's platforms.

New calendar-related features are also on the way. Through its AI Companion, the company will allow users to find time slots that work for all attendees. Plus, it can suggest meetings you can skip through a new “free up my time” request. (Notably, calendar tool Clokcwise launched a similar tool last year to resolve meeting conflicts.)

The company is also rolling out proactive meeting recommendations, such as suggested tasks and agenda items for meeting prep, and a group AI assistant for a group.

Zoom will introduce photorealistic avatars to its platforms, too — something it's talked about for some time. Earlier this year, the company's CEO, Eric Yuan, used one during its quarterly call. The avatars will mime your actions on video and are useful when you are not “camera-ready,” Zoom said. However, there are deepfake risks involved with the misuse of personas that could see corporate IT departments scrambling to turn them off. 

The feature is expected to be available to consumers by the end of the year. 

The update will introduce the ability for hosts to use Zoom Clips, its asynchronous video tool, and AI avatars to greet people in waiting rooms and to explain the purpose of the meeting. 

AI will also aid in new live translation features.

What's more, Zoom is launching an upgraded web interface to feature its AI companion more prominently, and other AI-powered features like a writing assistant to draft emails and documents, and a deep research feature, are being added.

Plus, Zoom will allow for the creation of custom AI agents with support for Model Context Protocol (MCP), support for higher bit rate and 60fps for Zoom meetings, and a new Zoom video management tool to manage video assets.

KPop Demon Hunters is a huge hit—both the record-breaking movie itself and its record-breaking soundtrack album. No doubt Netflix has already started having Oscar dreams, with nominations all but guaranteed in the Best Animated Feature as well as Best Original Song categories. The biggest hit is even titled “Golden,” just like the statuette! But another musical on the horizon would like you to remember the votes aren't tallied yet.

That would be Wicked: For Good, the follow-up to last year's very successful Wicked—which notched 10 Oscar nominations and picked up a pair for its lavish costumes and production design. (It also answered fan demand by holding “singalong” screenings, as KPop Demon Hunters also did recently.)

But one category it didn't enter into was Best Original Song, since Wicked‘s numbers all came from the long-running Broadway musical. That didn't stop the Academy Awards from bringing stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo out to sing onstage, and now it seems Wicked: For Good is hoping for a return visit.

As Variety reports, confirming remarks Jon M. Chu made to Entertainment Weekly last week, Wicked: For Good‘s soundtrack will feature two new songs, one for each of its witchy leads. Stephen Schwartz, who wrote the original Wicked songs for the 2003 musical, penned both; today their titles were confirmed as “No Place Like Home,” for Erivo's Elphaba, and “The Girl in the Bubble,” for Grande's Glinda.

As Variety notes, both songs “are expected to be Oscar-eligible, unlike any of the songs from the first movie, which had added verses but did not feature any completely new songs.”

In a statement to the trade, Schwartz said, “In addition to two brand new songs, there is a lot that's new in several other existing songs. So not only listeners coming to the score for the first time, but long-time fans of the original Broadway cast album, will have a great deal to discover.”

Don't expect to get more than teases of the new material before the movie, though: Wicked: For Good and its soundtrack both release November 21. Do you predict either of the new songs will be a threat to KPop Demon Hunters when awards season rolls around?

Mark Zuckerberg, man of the (digital) people, demigod of the Metaverse, founder of the almighty Meta, is looking to get just a little bit more politically involved over the next few election cycles, a new report shows. The Verge has revealed that, in an exceedingly unusual move, Zuck has created his own personal super PAC, dubbed the Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across California, or META. In the near term, the org plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on political advertising while also backing various political candidates.

Why is Zuck getting more politically involved?

You might be tempted to think it's because many of his rivals—like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and soon-to-be-a-trillionaire Elon Musk—have been cozying up to political gatekeepers. Or you might imagine it's because the man who is currently president has frequently threatened to throw Zuck in prison. In fact, it seems to be because the race for AI supremacy is heating up, and, as companies vie for leadership, it pays to have a toehold in the regulatory process.

In a statement shared with The Verge, Meta's VP of public policy, Brian Rice, said that Meta launched the super PAC so that it could support “candidates regardless of party who recognize California's vital role in AI development and embrace policies that will keep the state at the forefront of the global tech ecosystem.” Rice added: ”As home to many of the world's leading AI companies, California's innovation economy has an outsized impact on America's economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness. But Sacramento's regulatory environment could stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California's technology leadership at risk.”

Sacramento, seat of the California government, is certainly notorious for passing legislation that actually defends the public interest against giant data-sucking tech companies (or, as Meta would have it, “stifles innovation”), so it certainly makes sense that the company would want a new lobbying arm that could defend its profits as it builds out its new AI business.

Zuck and Meta are, of course, in good company. Silicon Valley has become increasingly political lately, and many of the industry's top executives contributed significantly to last year's Trump victory. Still, Meta's new PAC would appear to be unique in that it is exclusively lobbying on behalf of its own needs, which is a fairly unusual way of going about things. Most PACs at least pretend to be working on behalf of an entire industry or set of values. Meta's META is just all about Meta. The Verge writes:

…while corporations and individual billionaires have donated to super PACs, campaign finance experts tell The Verge that to their knowledge, it is exceedingly rare for a company to create its own super PAC — especially a company controlled by one person. Thanks to a unique corporate ownership structure that gives him complete control of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg has essentially created his own personal California super PAC, allowing him to spend Meta's money on politically protecting his priorities in the heart of the tech industry — and, possibly, against the interests of his corporate rivals.

Gizmodo reached out to Meta for more information. We will update this story if we receive a response.

Meta's AI business is a little bit behind other industry giants, although the company has been playing catch-up with a vengeance. In recent months, the company has raised eyebrows and made headlines by offering gargantuan financial offers to top AI researchers.

Netflix hit KPop Demon Hunters has stayed in the conversation in large part because of its blockbuster soundtrack, but now one of those songs has come under scrutiny for potentially getting an assist from ChatGPT.

Update 9/17 9am ET: The English-language article released by Joongang Daily has been updated to include a correction and remove the original quote about “Soda Pop”, bringing it more in line with the Korean-language piece. The original piece is as follows.

In a recent discussion in Seoul for OpenAI's newly opened Korean office, songwriter Vince reportedly claimed he used the controversial technology to help pen the song “Soda Pop,” performed in the movie by the demonic Saja Boys. He is credited as one of several co-writers on the track, according to a Netflix blog post.

A now-deleted tweet (preserved in a screengrab on Reddit) said to be penned by an OpenAI exec read: “Fav moment from the launch celebration was hearing singer/songwriter Vince share that ChatGPT helped him write ‘Soda Pop' from KPop Demon Hunters! It apparently gave him ideas to make it sound ‘more bubbly.'”

Here's where things get complicated. The alleged use of AI to help write “Soda Pop” was first reported in the English-language version of Joongang Daily—but the original Korean text of the article makes no mention of ChatGPT being used specifically during the production of KPop Demon Hunters' music.

A translator on Gizmodo's staff revealed Vince instead made a far broader statement—”I sometimes use ChatGPT to get some inspiration while producing K-Pop”—while discussing how AI technology is already being used in the K-Pop industry.

As Kotaku has pointed out, KPop Demon Hunters has previously had to fend off allegations surrounding its characters being made with AI. Rei Ami, one of the singers for the movie's girl group Huntr/x, has also had to insist that she and co-singers Ejae and Audrey Nuna are real human beings.

io9 has reached out to Netflix for clarification and will update should we hear back.

Back to BASIC


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, BASIC, is where I started my coding journey. Sat, aged four or five in front of a Commodore 16, I typed in lines of words and numbers which made up an application or sound effect. Sometimes they worked, often they did not. The words that I typed, along with “syntax error,” meant nothing to a five-year-old child who wanted sugar-coated cereal and Transformers cartoons, but I persevered.

Fast forward to the 21st century, and I still use BASIC from time to time. I write BASIC on a Commodore 64 and a ZX Spectrum that I recently renovated. I've even written BASIC on a Raspberry Pi Pico to control a series of NeoPixels.

Recently, Microsoft open-sourced its MOS,6502 BASIC from 1978, and that got me thinking about writing BASIC on a PC. Sure, I remember QBasic and the gorillas.bas game. I loved tweaking that game on my 486 DX33 back in the 1990s, but I wanted to write BASIC on my Windows 10 PC in 2025.

I can't use MOS6502 BASIC without spending a lot of time getting it to work on my PC, so what can I use instead? It turns out that there is, and it is called QB64 Phoenix Edition, and it looks and feels just like QBasic, but with many more features.

QB64 Phoenix Edition (QB64 PE) is a fresh offshoot of the original QB64 project, which seemed to die out in the early 2020s. The project's goal is to keep the spirit of the old application alive and to provide more people with access to running BASIC on their computers. QB64 PE is cross-platform and it has compatibility with QBasic and QuickBasic 4.5 code. But QB64 PE also gives us an extended BASIC and OpenGL, meaning that we can create applications/games with graphics and sound.

So let's take a look at QB64 PE and create our own BASIC project.

It really couldn't be any simpler to get started with QB64 PE.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

1. Go to the QB4 PE project page and download the package for your operating system.

 




2. Extract the file to a directory.

3. Navigate to that directory and double left click on the qb64pe.exe application.

The QB64 PE user interface is very much like QBasic. We have the menu at the top, the coding area in the middle, and a status/output/debugging area at the bottom. Our project will see us working with the File and Run menu.

 




On first boot, QB64 PE will tell us that the application and any executables made by it can be falsely identified by your anti-virus package. You can optionally whitelist the directory, but I have not had any issues in my testing.

 




QB64 PE is an awesome application, and I urge you to dig into the gloriously in-depth documentation (which is where I found how to show images) and learn more about QB64 PE.

The BASIC language has been with us since 1964, and it was developed as a high-level (easy-to-read) language by John G Kemeny, chairman of the Dartmouth College Math Department. The name BASIC came from Thomas Kurtz.

The structure of BASIC is meant to be over-simplified on purpose. Each line of BASIC is read by the compiler and turned into bytecode, which the machine can then run. But BASIC can be compiled or interpreted, depending on the version you are using. For example, on the Commodore 64, we see Commodore 64 BASIC V2, a version of Microsoft BASIC, which has a limited number of keywords.

Learning BASIC, or any coding language, really, is best done by creating a project. I could sit here and teach you about core programming concepts, or we could have some fun and make a simple game. The game in question is inspired by Usborne's 1980s BASIC coding books, specifically Computer Space Games, which I adored as a child.

The game is “Escape from planet LXF329,” and the goal of the game is to take off and escape a group of aliens who are trying to capture the spaceship. Essentially, this is a number-guessing game, but with a sci-fi theme.

You may have spotted “Learn how to display images,” and yes, I will show you how to display a static image on the screen using QB64 PE. In the interest of full disclosure, the images used in the game were generated using Adobe Firefly, an AI service. Why? I could've used stock images or spent some time in GIMP and Inkscape, but I didn't have the time, nor the talent, so Adobe Firefly did the work for me.

We'll start by creating the starting screen, an image that advertises the game and sets the scene.

1. Create a new blank document and click on File >> Save and save the project as space.bas. Remember to save often.

2. Create a new screen object, setting the screen to 1024 x 1024 pixels and 32-bit color, then set the window title to ESCAPE FROM PLANET LXF329”.

3. Create a variable, myImage& and store your image.

4. Create an error handler to check that the image has been loaded correctly. This is basically a conditional check that checks for the loaded file in the variable. If there is nothing there, 0, then it will print an error message.

5. Put the image onto the screen at position 0,0 (top left) then pause the code, waiting for the user to press a key.

6. Save the code, and click on Run >> run Only (no EXE) to start the code. Click OK in the dialog to start. You should see the image appear on the screen. Press any key to close the window.

 




7. Create a label, START: Labels enable us to write code that can jump around to different sections by using a Go To command. You may be familiar with using numbers and jumping to a numbered line. Here ,we are not using numbers, so labels will do the same job.

8. To begin the game code, clear the screen (CLS) and then use a series of print statements to print a narrative to get the reader up to speed on the game mechanics and story.

9. Ensure that the game uses pseudo-random numbers. If we don't do this then the game will pick the same numbers each time.

10. Create two variables, g (gravity) and w (weight), which are random integers, multiplied by 20 and 40, respectively. BASIC uses LET to create variables.

11. Create a third variable to store the correct thrust to leave the planet.

12. For debug purposes, print the answer to the screen. Later, comment this out using the REM (remark) keyword.

Change to this for the final game

13. Print the planet's gravity and then ask the user to make their thrust calculation.

14. Using a for loop, we give the player ten guesses before the aliens enter the ship.

15. Stored the player's guess in a variable, f. That value is compared to the answer, r. If the thrust is too high or low, the for loop repeats until the player runs out of guesses. If the guess is correct, then the game goes to the ENDGAME label.

16. Print “the bad ending” to the screen. This section runs if the player fails to make the correct calculations, and then the for loop ends, throwing the user into this nightmare scenario.

17. Add a graphic to show your ship losing against the alien onslaught. You will need to create a PNG file, stored in the same directory as the game file. This is the same code as used for the start screen. Sleeping for 5 is important; otherwise, there is a bug where the screen automatically closes and ends the game.

18. Using a GoTo, send the player to the REPLAY section of code.

19. Print a message to the user to say that they have won. Then show an image on the screen. The ENDGAME label is where the successful player is sent. They are rewarded with a message and an escape image showing them blasting off into space!

20. Create a means to ask the player if they would like to try again. The player's input is stored as a variable, a. But note that the variable contains a string ($) which can be y or n. If it is y, the game goes back to the START label. Otherwise, the game stops. We use the REPLAY label to identify what the code is for and to direct the player through the game.

21. Save the code, and click on Run >> run Only (no EXE) to start the code. Click OK in the dialog to start.

22. Run the game a few times, win and lose. Remember that the answer is printed to the screen, so make sure to comment that out when letting your friends have a go.

If you want to share the game with your friends, then you can! Just bear in mind that the resulting executable is bound to the OS it was created with. Additionally, as QB64 PE notes, your executable may be flagged as a false positive by your antivirus.

1. Click on Run >> Make EXE Only. You can also click on Run >> Start to compile and run the code. This way you get both the executable, and the code will run in the editor.

 




2. Click OK to compile the executable into the qb64pe folder, the same folder where QB64 PE is being run.

 




3. Wait for the code to compile. Check the status bar at the bottom of the screen to monitor the progress. On modern systems this will take seconds.

 




4. Navigate to the folder with the compiled game code. I scanned my compiled code using Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes, and nothing nasty was found.

 




5. Double click on the executable to run the game.

VIENNA — Adults with obesity but without diabetes who took the investigational, oral GLP-1 receptor agonist orforglipron for 72 weeks lost significantly more weight than those on placebo, according to results of the ATTAIN-1 trial, the first completed phase 3 trial of the novel agent in this population.

The findings may mark an important advance in the obesity treatment landscape, said study lead, Sean Wharton, MD, from McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, who presented the results at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2025 Annual Meeting. 

As an oral therapy, orforglipron could offer broader access and appeal to patients who prefer pills over injections. And, unlike current injectable GLP-1 agents, the drug does not require special storage, distribution, or restrictions around food and liquid intake, Wharton explained.

“This could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications,” he noted. 

For patients, what drug they take and the form they take it in “depends on what they can access, what's available in the pharmacy, what they can afford, and maybe, what their friend is taking, and what they think will work well,” he added.

The findings of the study were simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. 

Orforglipron is a small-molecule, nonpeptide oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, said Wharton, who explained that they didn't know if they could stimulate the GLP-1 receptor without a large peptide analogue.

“The answer is yes,” he said. “This nonpeptide, small molecule activates the receptor, can be taken without food or water restrictions, and is not affected by time of day. Its small chemical structure gives it 79% bioavailability, and with a terminal half-life of 29-49 hours, it's suitable for once-daily dosing.”

The trial enrolled 3127 participants from nine countries across four continents with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) or overweight (BMI ≥ 27) and at least one weight-related comorbidity but excluded individuals with type 1 or 2 diabetes, although 36% had prediabetes.

Of the study participants, 56.5% were White, 28.6% were Asian, and 8.6% were Black individuals; more than 35% were men, and the mean age was 45. Participants were randomized in a 3:3:3:4 ratio to receive 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg orforglipron or placebo, respectively. All participants received professional guidance on a healthy diet (without caloric restriction) and physical activity. Treatment continued for 72 weeks.

The primary endpoint was mean percent change in body weight from baseline to week 72, assessed using the treatment-regimen estimand (the intention-to-treat population). Other measures included mean changes in waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Study completion rates ranged from 80% to > 87% across groups, with a rate of 87.5% at the highest dose (36 mg), which “is a very good result for weight management trials,” Wharton noted.

At week 72, the primary endpoints were -2.1%, -7.5%, -8.4%, and -11.2% with placebo and 6 mg, 12 mg, and 36 mg of orforglipron, respectively (P <  .001).

Turning to metabolic outcomes, mean changes in systolic blood pressure were -1.4 and -5.7 mm Hg in the placebo and pooled orforglipron groups, respectively (P < .001 for both). Among lipids, triglycerides decreased by 14.8% with pooled orforglipron compared to 3.8% with placebo, and non-HDL cholesterol decreased by 6.7% and 1.9%, respectively. 

“These were significantly different, and all remaining parameters also moved in the right direction,” Wharton reported.

Rates of adverse events and serious adverse events were similar across groups, though discontinuations due to adverse events increased with dose (2.7%, 5.3%, 7.9%, and 10.3% for placebo and the three drug doses, respectively). Gastrointestinal events were the most common, were generally mild to moderate, and occurred mainly during dose escalation. “There was no hepatic safety signal. Overall tolerability and safety were in line with expectations for GLP-1 therapies in obesity,” said Wharton.

In their publication, the authors noted that the highly diverse, large population from nine countries on four continents was a key strength of the trial.

Asked to comment on the study by Medscape Medical News, Rasmus Sandsdal, MD, from the University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark, said, “This new flurry of drugs coming out” raises questions “from the patient's perspective about what's the right fit for them.”

“It's good to have a choice between injection and pill because some people will naturally think a pill is more comfortable,” he added. “But it is once daily.”

Sandsdal explained that he thought some patients who have “become familiar with the once-weekly injection” might find it less invasive compared to having to take a daily medication, which can come with a certain “illness” stigma.

He's also previously noticed that the heart rate increase has been pronounced with some small-molecule GLP-1 drugs. “I'd like to see more specific details on the side effects because results were not as detailed here,” he said. “Future findings may tell us more about these small molecules which may have propensity to bind to off-targets.”

And “it will be interesting to see if they confer similar reductions in cardiovascular events as seen with established incretin therapies as big trials have also shown around a 20% reduction in MACE (major adverse cardiovascular events),” Sandsdal commented. 

Wharton highlighted that access to care was key. “I see this changing the way people live with obesity,” he told Medscape Medical News, ""not because of the weight change or the cardiovascular benefits” but because people who desperately need it will have access to care they didn't have before.

Wharton disclosed receiving honoraria, serving on advisory boards, and conducting research for Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Amgen, Bausch Health, Metsera, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Pfizer. The study was sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of orforglipron. Sandsdal reported receiving funds from the Danish Diabetes and Endocrine Academy, which is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) who underwent colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery had a higher risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) within a year than those without IBD, with the risk being especially elevated in those aged 60-69 years and in those with active IBD within the first 30 days post-surgery.

“These findings emphasize the need for increased awareness of VTE risk in high-risk IBD patients and underscore the importance of optimizing disease control to reduce VTE risk in those undergoing CRC surgery,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by Gencer Kurt, MD, Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Center for Population Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital and Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark. It was published online in The American Journal of Gastroenterology.

The small number of VTE events in the IBD group, particularly in Crohn's disease, may have led to imprecise estimates. Clinical remission vs active disease could not be distinguished owing to overlapping treatment indicators. Proxies such as hospitalization and corticosteroid use may not capture mild disease activity.

The study did not receive any specific funding. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

An intensive 1-day overview course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) continues to attract large numbers of first-year gastrointestinal(GI) fellows across the country.

Results from the initial pilot program in 2019, called “IBD 101: Physicians and Patients Providing Pearls and Perspectives” are outlined in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases by Lisa Malter, MD, a professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at NYU Langone Grossman School of Medicine, New York City, and colleagues.

The course, conducted by Malter at NYU Langone's simulation center, was designed to increase fellows' early exposure to the complexities of IBD and its diagnosis and management in the context of rapidly changing therapies and variability across US GI training programs. The authors reported that the 2019 program was well received, with attendees showing “increased comfort and sustained benefit” in discussing IBD management with patients. Notably, participants' increased comfort levels in broaching IBD topics persisted 3 years after the course compared with that of nonparticipating peers, pointing to potential improved patient care after completion of training.

“At this point, 1 in every 100 GI patients has IBD. It's one of the more complex GI conditions and its incidence and prevalence are increasing globally,” Malter told Medscape Medical News. Prevalence rates in the US are reportedly as high as 464.5 per 100,000 persons.

“In addition, its management has become more complicated with newer medications and treatments coming on stream,” she said. “An educational gap exists.”

The course provided an intimate, interactive format with national experts in the field serving as faculty. Course objectives included basic, introductory information on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of IBD; early exposure to IBD as a subspecialty to allow registrants to make informed career decisions; and information about other educational opportunities.

The course was designed to raise participants' comfort levels in discussing seven topics with patients, including the need for surgery, IBD in pregnancy, treatment escalation in different disease scenarios, and lack of treatment response.

The three-part course, featuring case scenarios, was offered in person to 60 fellows selected by regional GI fellowship program directors and course faculty, which consisted of a director, three codirectors, and 14 local and national IBD experts. A half-day training session for faculty was held immediately before the course.

In September 2019, the first 32 fellows from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited programs participated in IBD 101. A total of 49 (89%) of 55 participants completed presession and immediate postsession surveys.

In the 3-year follow-up survey, among 36 fellows, of whom 21 (58%) attended IBD 101 and 15 (42%) did not, attendees reported overall IBD confidence and equivalent or higher levels of comfort in discussing each of seven topics.

Among the specific survey findings: 

• 100% said the course had improved their ability to effectively treat and manage patients

• A higher proportion of attendees strongly agreed with having comfort in discussing pregnancy in IBD (43% vs 13%; P = .08) 

• A statistically significant proportion strongly agreed with having comfort in discussing loss of response to biologics (62% vs 27%; P = .049)

• 98% reported increased interest in exploring IBD during fellowship

• 100% noted improved understanding of supplemental opportunities to learn about IBD

• 96% would strongly recommend this course to future GI fellows

Further testimony to the effectiveness of the ongoing course, said Malter, is that the most recent one, held in 2024, attracted 425 GI fellows from across the country. “That's about 90% of US GI fellows,” she said.

Offering an outsider's perspective on the results of the course, Gastroenterologist Ashwin N. Ananthakrishnan, MBBS, MPH, a director or the Crohn's and Colitis Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said, “It's a useful update. It's always good to see benefits from educational courses.” He expressed caution, however, “in that a small subset of GI fellows always selects toward those with greater IBD interest. Consequently, they likely have participated in several other IBD education activities in the intervening 3 years — so one can't attribute benefit to this course alone.”And while one effect of such courses may to increase the number of IBD-interested trainees, their role in providing IBD education to gastroenterologists who will not specialize in IBD is more important, Ananthakrishnan added. “These general gastroenterologists are going to be managing a lot of the IBD in the community, so in my opinion, ensuring they are comfortable with caring for IBD patients optimally is more important than training IBD specialists, who have many opportunities for education.”In collaboration with the American College of Gastroenterology, the course is open to all first-year GI fellows training in North America. The most recent program was held on September 13, 2025.This paper received no specific funding. The IBD course has been supported by unrestricted educational grants from Pfizer and Takeda Pharmaceuticals and sponsorships from AbbVie, Janssen, and Prometheus Labs.Malter reported receiving educational grants from AbbVie, Janssen, Pfizer, and Takeda; serving as a consultant for Abbvie and Pharmacosmos; and serving on the advisory boards for AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Celltrion, Janssen, Merck, and Takeda. Multiple coauthors disclosed similar relationships with numerous private-sector companies.

In a study of patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis, ECG abnormalities identified all cases of cardiac involvement, demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 100% negative predictive value.

“Although the 2014 [Heart Rhythm Society] consensus recommends baseline ECG and ROS for all patients with sarcoidosis, specific guidance for those with [cutaneous sarcoidosis] is sparse,” the study authors wrote. “These findings reinforce the value of ECG screening in [cutaneous sarcoidosis] and as a practical tool in dermatologic evaluation.”

The study was led by Eric Xia, MD, Department of Dermatology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and was published online on September 17 in JAMA Dermatology.

Study limitations included missing data and small number of cardiac sarcoidosis cases. Additionally, variations in detection thresholds and cohort composition, including race and ethnicity factors, could have influenced the observed cases.

This work was supported by awards from Brigham and Women's Hospital. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

A novel study aims to determine whether making UPFs more difficult to chew and slower to eat can reduce energy intake and improve metabolic outcomes, shedding light on how texture may influence overeating.



The Effect of Eating Rate of Ultra-Processed Foods on Dietary Intake, Eating Behaviour, Body Composition and Metabolic Responses—Rationale, Design and Outcomes of the Restructure Randomised Controlled Trial. Image Credit: designium / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journal Nutrition Bulletin, researchers in the Netherlands outlined a clinical trial called “Restructure,” designed to investigate how the eating rate (ER) of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) affects energy intake and metabolic health.

UPFs have been linked in epidemiological studies to higher energy intake, weight gain, and diet-related diseases. Their sensory properties, particularly texture, can influence how quickly they are eaten and how much is consumed. Soft, energy-dense foods that require little chewing are often consumed rapidly, which encourages higher intake. While debate continues over whether the harms of UPFs stem from their processing or their nutrient profiles, this study aims to isolate texture-induced eating rate as a possible mechanism.

The Restructure trial will test whether altering the texture of UPF meals, and thus their eating rate, can change daily energy intake. It is a single-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover study involving two 14-day diet phases separated by a 14-day washout. One diet features slowly eaten, hard-textured UPFs (97% Nova category 4 by energy), while the other uses soft-textured UPFs consumed more quickly (94% Nova category 4). Each participant will complete both diets in random order, with the washout period intended to minimize carryover effects on the microbiome, body composition, and metabolic outcomes.

Participants will be healthy adults aged 21–50 years with a BMI of 21–27 kg/m², normal appetite, and a habitual UPF intake of no more than half of their total energy. Those with restrictive diets, food allergies, high alcohol intake, smoking habits, extreme physical activity, recent major weight change, or any metabolic, gastrointestinal, or eating disorders will be excluded.

Baseline assessments will include a UPF food frequency questionnaire, a “carrot test” to gauge natural eating rate, and a set of psychometric tools to profile eating behaviors. Participants will then complete two tightly controlled diet phases. They will consume three meals a day on-site during weekdays, while standardized meals for weekends will be prepared for consumption at home. Participants will photograph meals before and after eating, return leftovers for weighing, and receive snacks after meals. Seven unique menus will be presented twice during each phase of the diet.

The diets will be matched for portion size, visual volume, familiarity, and liking, but differ in texture and macronutrient composition. The slower-eating diet will offer chewier, harder foods and provide 21% of energy from protein, 53% from carbohydrate, and 22% from fat. The faster-eating diet will consist of softer, more lubricated foods and provide 16% protein, 47% carbohydrates, and 33% fat.

Energy intake will be measured at every meal, while body composition will be assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline (T1), after the first diet (T2), during washout (T3), and after the second diet (T4). Metabolic responses will be evaluated at T1, T2, and T4. Physical activity will be tracked using wearable devices and questionnaires. Participants will undergo a mixed meal tolerance test at the same time points, using a standardized UPF meal consisting of rice porridge and chocolate milk.

Eating behavior will be analyzed from video recordings coded for bites, chews, and swallows, with eating rate calculated from meal duration. On weekends, meal duration will be recorded via an online appetite questionnaire. Blood samples collected at T1, T2, and T4 will be analyzed for inflammatory cytokines (including IL-6, TNF-α, and hsCRP), gut permeability markers (e.g., zonulin and LBP), and appetite hormones (such as GLP-1, ghrelin, and PYY). Participants will also wear continuous glucose monitors and provide weekly stool samples for microbiome and metabolite profiling using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and targeted metabolomics.

Energy and nutrient intakes will be calculated from food weights and packaging data. A repeated measures mixed model will compare daily average energy intake between the two diets, using both per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is powered to detect differences in energy intake but not secondary outcomes, and the statistical plan has been pre-registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05996874).

To preserve blinding, participants are told the study focuses on “protein sources and body composition” and will be debriefed on its true purpose afterward. The order of the two diet phases will be randomized using sealed envelopes.

This study will investigate whether slowing the eating rate of UPFs through texture modifications can reduce energy intake, regardless of the level of processing in the foods. Understanding how sensory properties shape eating behavior could help design strategies to reduce excess energy intake and its related health risks.

Secondary analyses will also explore how these dietary patterns affect metabolic health and body composition. However, the researchers note limitations including the semi-residential design's lower ecological validity, the different macronutrient profiles of the two diets, and the focus on a narrow, healthy population.

Ruben Amorim is under mounting pressure to keep his job at Manchester United. The Portuguese coach has overseen the club's worst start to a Premier League season for 33 years, and has faced widespread criticism for his rigid tactics, with a £200m summer spending spree doing little to improve the Red Devils' fortunes.

It has been reported that Amorim only has three games left to save his job, and some are calling for club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be drafted back in as his replacement. Solskjaer guided United to a second-place Premier League finish in 2020-21, while embracing the counter-attacking style that garnered so much success in the Sir Alex Ferguson era.

Bayern Munich has stormed out of the gates to kick off the 2025/26 campaign, racking up five wins in five competitive matches. Bayern will kick off the Champions League group stage with a home game against an undefeated challenger from the Premier League, Chelsea. Bayern has been the best team in the group stage for the last two decades.

Historically, Bayern and Chelsea have eliminated each other once in the knockout rounds. Chelsea infamously claimed victory in the 2012 final with a penalty kick shootout. Bayern won the 2013 UEFA Super Cup and also beat Chelsea in the 2020 Round of 16 with a dominating 7-1 aggregate scoreline.

Chelsea has not won the Premier League since 2016/17 but has managed to earn trophies in the Champions League (2020/21), Conference League (2024/25), and FIFA Club World Cup (2021, 2025).

Odds: Bayern (-150), Draw (+320), Chelsea (+375)

Prediction: Bayern draws 2-2. This game will be lackluster and scoreless in the first half. In the 58th minute, Michael Olise will finally break down his set of defenders and find Luis Díaz on the back post. Harry Kane will pad the lead in the 70th minute with a firecracker from outside the box. Bayern's defense will wear out and concede a quick counterattack, ending in Cole Palmer finishing on a wide open shot at the top of the box. In stoppage time, a very debatable penalty will be awarded to Chelsea and Palmer will make it a brace. Both sides will claim victory but neither team will actually earn three points.

It's Bayern time.

 Boateng scored against USA at the 2010 World Cup

FIFA has revisited one of Ghana's most unforgettable World Cup moments by celebrating Kevin-Prince Boateng's only goal at the Mundial for the Black Stars in 2010 on their social media platforms.

The global football body posted the clip with the caption, “When Boateng decided to do it himself”, a fitting tribute to the midfielder's moment of individual brilliance in South Africa in 2010. The goal came in the Round of 16 clash on June 26, 2010, in Rustenburg against the United States of America, just four minutes into the game. After dispossessing Ricardo Clark in midfield, Boateng surged forward and rifled a low left-footed effort past American goalkeeper Tim Howard to give Ghana an early lead.Although the USA equalized through a Landon Donovan penalty, Ghana restored their advantage in extra time thanks to Asamoah Gyan's powerful strike, sealing a 2-1 victory. The result at that time made Ghana the third African nation in history to reach the quarter-finals of the FIFA World Cup.

Jose Mourinho set for dramatic Benfica return FIFA's decision to spotlight the goal underscores its enduring significance, not only for Ghana but for African football. Boateng's strike is remembered as a moment of courage and flair, setting the tone for one of the Black Stars' greatest nights on the world stage.Fifteen years on, the video continues to spark pride among Ghanaian fans.Watch video of the goal below:

Emma Raducanu came from 3-1 down in both sets to defeat Jaqueline Cristian in the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva first round.

No. 8 seed Emma Raducanu withstood a stern test from Jaqueline Cristian to advance to the second round of the Korea Open 2025 presented by Motiva 6-3, 6-4 in 2 hours and 2 minutes. The Briton, who took a last-minute wild card into the tournament, came from 3-1 down to win both sets.

Seoul: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The first-round contest between the pair had originally been scheduled for Tuesday, but postponed to Wednesday due to rain. Raducanu will next face a fellow major champion, Barbora Krejcikova, in another first-time encounter as she bids to return to the quarterfinals for a second straight year.

""It hasn't been easy -- I feel like I've played this match for the last three days,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview. ""So to have pulled through after waiting, I'm super pleased with how I came through. Tough conditions, very slow -- long rallies, long points. So happy to have gotten through.""

Match management key for Raducanu: The 2021 US Open champion was up against it in the early stages of the match. Cristian came out of the blocks with her forehand on song, and had racked up seven winners to zero for Raducanu by the first changeover. Throughout the match, the Romanian was more spectacular off the ground, firing 25 winners overall to Raducanu's 15.

But the statistic from the opening few games that was to set the tone was Cristian's lack of efficiency on big points versus Raducanu's ability to lock in when she needed. Raducanu saved the first seven break points against her before Cristian converted her eighth. Moreover, Cristian was unable to to translate her glut of winners into any real momentum thanks to 38 unforced errors outweighing them over the course of the match.

All but one game of the first set went to at least one deuce, and as Raducanu gradually reeled Cristian in that one straightforward game proved crucial: a break of Cristian's serve to go 5-3 up, courtesy of two double faults and two sprayed forehand errors.

The second set played out in a similar fashion. Cristian broke early again, this time courtesy of a pair of Raducanu double faults. But from 2-0 down, Raducanu found her best tennis of the day. Her forehand had been erratic for much of the first set, but in the second it clicked with a series of superb winners from that wing. At 4-4, Cristian threw in another game full of cheap mistakes, and Raducanu closed out victory after saving one break point in the final game with another forehand winner.

Haddad Maia, Shnaider, Tauson also advance: Defending champion Beatriz Haddad Maia and No. 5 seed Diana Shnaider joined Raducanu in the second round on Wednesday. Shnaider had split sets with qualifier Caty McNally when play was halted the previous day, but took control of the decider to advance 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, despite needing five match points to seal victory.

No. 6 seed Haddad Maia also had to battle to close out her match against Korean wild card Back Dayeon, who made a late charge from 5-0 down in the second set to 5-3 before Haddad Maia sealed a 6-4, 6-3 win on her third match point.

Two second-round matches were also completed. Maya Joint defeated No. 7 seed Sofia Kenin for the second time in 2025 to reach her second WTA 500 quarterfinal of the season, needing just 63 minutes to race past the American 6-3, 6-1. No. 3 seed Clara Tauson defeated Eva Lys 6-2, 7-6(4) to make her seventh quarterfinal of 2025, holding off a late charge by the German after serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set.

Ukraine made history by reaching the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals for the first time after defeating Spain in the quarterfinals. Marta Kostyuk and Elina Svitolina secured singles victories to lead Ukraine to a 2-0 win. They will now face Italy in the semifinals, while other quarterfinal matches are yet to be played.

Ukraine advanced to the Billie Jean King Cup semifinals for the first time in its history after winning both singles matches against five-time champion Spain on Wednesday.

Kostyuk gives Ukraine a winning start

In the first quarterfinal match, Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk, ranked No. 26, came from a break down in the first set to defeat No. 51 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in straight sets. Bouzas Maneiro broke early to lead 3-1, but the 23-year-old Ukrainian rallied to win the set in a tiebreak. She then cruised through the second for a 7-6 (3), 6-2 victory, giving her nation a 1-0 lead.

Svitolina beats Badosa in three sets to clinch the tie

In the second singles match, Spain's Paula Badosa, playing her first match since Wimbledon after a recurring back injury, claimed a tight first set 7-5 over Elina Svitolina to keep Spain's hopes alive.

But Svitolina, ranked No. 13, answered with a 6-2 second set and raced to a 4-1 lead in the decider. Badosa fought back to level the set before Svitolina earned the decisive break in the 12th game to close out a 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 win that sealed the tie for Ukraine.

The victory avenged Ukraine's only other meeting with Spain in the competition — a 3-1 defeat in a 2013 World Group II tie.

Ukraine to face Italy in semifinals

Ukraine will next face another five-time champion, Italy, which defeated Japan 2-0 in Tuesday's first quarterfinal. The remaining quarterfinals are scheduled for Thursday: Kazakhstan vs. the United States and Great Britain vs. Japan.

""One of the big question marks was if fans were going to go with this idea."" Noah Hawley discusses episode seven — including the show's monster gamble and what Timothy Olyphant's Kirsh is really thinking. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	The xenomorph — as Alien: Earth creator Noah Hawley has rightly pointed out — is probably the greatest cinematic monster of all time.  


	The ink-black H.R. Giger-designed nightmare has long been characterized across numerous films by its ferocious and single-minded murderous instincts; a nearly unstoppable and certainly unknowable force of nature. 




	But what happens when a character seems to tame, and even train, a xenomorph?


	Across the last couple episodes of Alien: Earth, the hybrid Wendy (Sydney Chandler) has been raising and communicating with one of the Prodigy Corporation's alien captives, a xenomorph follows her commands — including to kill a bunch of Prodigy employees.

					Sigourney Weaver Reviews 'Alien: Earth': ""More Profound"" Than an 'Alien' Movie		
			









	We asked Hawley about this bold addition to the franchise's canon and its thorny moral implications, along with some other burning questions we had after watching “Emergence,” the show's seventh debut season episode.


Now we know from James Cameron's Aliens that xenomorphs can communicate with each other. And if they can communicate, then the next iteration of that idea would be someone not of their species attempting to communicate with them. I assume that's the inspiration for Wendy's relationship with the xenomorph, but isn't it always a bit of a risk when you take the scary monster and turn them into something that seems domesticated? 












NOAH HAWLEY: There are a couple of things. Obviously, there's that moment in Cameron's film where the queen communicates with the drones. Is that a pheromone? Is it telekinetic? Is that a frequency we can't hear? We don't know, but that always seemed really interesting as something to explore. 


	The other thing, of course, is that an Alien movie is a two-hour survival story, and a television show has to be an ongoing series. You have to use the monsters in a different way. You certainly want to use them in the classic way, but you also have to figure out how to sustain having monsters in your show when the reality is they would kill everyone, or that you would kill them — and then that would be it. Bringing in other creatures allowed me to take the pressure off the xenomorphs to fill that void. 


	There's also this idea of the hubris of people — that classic Jurassic Park thing of “just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.” And the naiveté of children, as well. There's a romanticism that can happen in kids. She wants to believe that it's not these creatures' fault, that they didn't ask to come here, and we shouldn't experiment on them the way that she's being experimented on. You can understand the rationale. But it doesn't make it safe to make friends with one.


	One of the big question marks was if fans were going to go with this idea. I don't want her to have [a xenomorph as a] pet. But if it seems like an alliance has been struck, what are the interesting possibilities that we can pull out of that? And because this is a horror story, we have to assume that, ultimately, I wouldn't bet on this working out.

	











There's a philosophical debate within this, too. You've talked about the famous Ripley line, how “you don't see [the aliens] fucking each over for a [monetary] percentage.” That debate is playing out within the show as Wendy and her brother (Alex Lawther) discuss whether the aliens are more honorable than messy humans. Perhaps I'm biased as I'm on Team Human, but to me, it's our higher consciousness that makes us want to do better, and, on a day-to-day basis, we largely are better and do overcome our animal instincts, and that does make us better. But what are your feeling about this?


	Well, they are predators. They are very intelligent. They're calculating. But they don't have ulterior motives. One of the most fascinating things to me about the Alien franchise is you never see them eat. None of their killing seems to be about food. They're really about reproducing. So they're kind of fascinating on that level. This all plays into this question driving the Wendy conversation. Humanity is a choice for her now, and the more she chooses to be human, the safer everyone will be. The more alienated and detached she feels from humanity and human morality … well, that's not good. So there is a question of whether she is going to become a monster, too. I think that core tension makes the show really interesting.


In that episode seven, Wendy becomes a killer as she orders the xenomorph to attack. I had that classic geek question of, “How sorry should we feel for the maintenance people on the Death Star?” How is the audience supposed to feel about her decision? 












	Let's not forget she's 12. My son is 12, and I'm like, “Why is there an ice cream wrapper in the closet?” There some things that they do where you're like, “Oh, you haven't thought a few steps ahead here.” There are some executive function issues going on. I don't want to take the moral onus off of it, but I think she's angry at the way that [the hybrids have] been treated and what they did to Nibs [Lily Newmark], and she's lashing out. Part of growing up is learning what consequences are. 


And speaking of that: Nib's freakout over the guard grabbing Mr. Strawberry was extremely satisfying. 


	It's the fun of the genre. A lot my characters and storytelling go back to Stephen King, The Stand and Trashcan Man — this idea that you put these players in motion, and some of them are morally good, and some of them are morally bad, and some of them are crazy, and some of them are wild cards. It's the same way in season five of Fargo with [the mysterious criminal-for-hire Ole Munch character]. He was a wildcard I felt paid off in a very satisfying way. So Nibs can fill this space where you're actually okay with the fact that she might end up being a sociopath, it fills a space in the genre where we always like those characters, in some way. 


Finally, Timothy Olyphant seems to steal every moment he's on screen. And maybe this question is too much of a spoiler that you won't want to get into, but I'm constantly wondering: What does Kirsch want? 


	Yeah, that's interesting to me. And the question of how much is he in control? What are the rules of his programming? Part of what I feel made [Ian Holm's Alien android character Ash] crazy at the end of that movie was that he had this countermanding programming — the crew's lives were expendable, but, somewhere in there, he had been programmed to protect human life. Those two conflicting impulses caused him to malfunction. I think with Tim, there's definitely this question of how much is he autonomous? How much is he controlled by the programming, and how much is his sense of identity? If he is a scientist and experimenting, he doesn't seem to have the human morality that others have. He's probably programmed that he can't harm Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin). He may be programmed that he really shouldn't disagree with him, or argue with him. And in these moments where Boy Kavalier is super patronizing and dismissive, maybe been programmed to smile and bear it. And yet: Is he done?

The pickup comes just a few hours ahead of the show's fourth season premiere.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	Just before season four of The Morning Show goes live, Apple TV+ has extended the show's run.


	The tech giant's streaming service has ordered a fifth season of the drama starring and executive produced by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon as anchors at a fictional TV network. The pickup comes hours ahead of The Morning Show's fourth season premiere on Wednesday.




	Showrunner Charlotte Stoudt and director/executive producer Mimi Leder are set to continue in those roles in season five.

	“The Morning Show has been a standout from the very start, debuting as one of the flagship series on Apple TV+. It's been incredibly rewarding to see it not only entertain but also resonate with audiences worldwide,” said Matt Cherniss, head of programming at Apple TV+. “Thanks to the outstanding cast and creative team — led by Jennifer, Reese, Charlotte and Mimi — The Morning Show continues to deliver addictively entertaining and provocative stories that we've all come to love. We're excited for viewers to experience the next chapter of this Emmy-winning drama.”

	











	Season four is set in early 2024, but Stoudt and Leder said at the show's red carpet premiere last week that it won't feature the presidential election as a central story line, with Stoudt noting that most of the season takes place before Joe Biden dropped his re-election bid in July. “We try to go at it sideways,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “We don't really have, directly, an election story, but we do touch on the idea of: Why were two older white men running for president?”

	











	Along with Aniston and Witherspoon, season four's returning cast inlcudes Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Nestor Carbonell, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Nicole Beharie and Jon Hamm, alongside new additions Aaron Pierre, William Jackson Harper, Boyd Holbrook, Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons. 


	“It's an honor to witness the collective talent, passion and commitment of Jen, Reese, Mimi, Charlotte, our partners at Hello Sunshine and Echo Films, and everyone involved in The Morning Show, and we're excited to embark on a new season that will give this cast and creative team even more room to shine,” said Michael Ellenberg, CEO of studio MediaRes and an executive producer of the series. “We are so grateful to Apple TV+ and the fans around the world who tune in every week, and are so excited for viewers to see this upcoming season and beyond.”


	Stoudt and Leder executive produce The Morning Show with Ellenberg and Lindsey Springer for Media Res; Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter for Hello Sunshine; Aniston and Kristin Hahn for Echo Films; and Zander Lehmann and Micah Schraft.

The Summer I Turned Pretty series may have come to an end, but viewers' time with Lola Tung's Belly and Christopher Briney's Conrad has not.


Prime Video today announced that a feature film installation written and directed by Jenny Han will conclude the story, which based on Han's beloved trilogy of books. Plot details are under wraps. The news was revealed at the red carpet celebration of the Season 3 finale in Paris, France.


	“There is another big milestone left in Belly's journey, and I thought only a movie could give it its proper due,” Han said. “I'm so grateful to Prime Video for continuing to support my vision for this story and for making it possible to share this final chapter with the fans.”

	











	The Season 3 finale arrived Wednesday at midnight, watching Conrad make it to Paris and express to Belly that he still loves her. He also witnesses her life in France and all the new friends she's made, questioning internally if she is dating Benito (Fernando Cattori). It becomes clear that the pair have broken up, and Conrad and Belly finally got together, but she went a bit back and forth before following him to his train to Brussels to tell him she will always choose him.

	Meanwhile, back in Boston and later at the Cousins Beach House, Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) is honing his skills as a chef, and Taylor (Rain Spencer) organized a PR campaign for him. He cooked for a small group to celebrate at the beach house, where Taylor and Steven hashed out their future after Taylor found out that Denise (Isabella Briggs) and Steven got seed money for their videogame development venture — in San Francisco. Taylor heard this from Denise first, but she told Steven she wanted to move to California with him.

	“The Summer I Turned Pretty has struck a chord with audiences everywhere, creating moments of joy, nostalgia, and connection that have made it a global sensation,” said Courtenay Valenti, head of film, streaming and theatrical at Amazon MGM Studios, and Vernon Sanders, Global Head of Television, at Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. “We're proud of the series' extraordinary success and couldn't be more excited to partner again with Jenny Han to bring fans an unforgettable next chapter.”

	











	Season Three was helmed by showrunners Jenny Han and Sarah Kucserka, with both also serving as executive producers alongside Karen Rosenfelt, and Paul Lee, Hope Hartman, and Mads Hansen of wiip. The series is co-produced in partnership by Amazon MGM Studios and wiip.


	With Taylor Swift's new album The Life of a Showgirl on its way, there is hope for yet more needle drops in the feature film. There will more than likely be a song or two from Swift's work in the backdrop, whether or not from her newer albums or the older classics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Gen V returns with bloody black humor and depressingly timely plotlines","https://www.avclub.com/gen-v-season-2-premiere-recap-episodes-1-2-and-3","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:04:30 GMT","

Sophomore seasons are never easy. Neither are sophomore years. And Gen V was put in the unenviable position of trying to thread that fine line while dealing with a loss that now looms over its entire second season: actor Chance Perdomo, who played Andre on the show and died from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident.

This first episode back, “New Year, New U,” is dedicated to Perdomo. And his absence (and that of his superpowered character) is very much front and center in this kickoff to a new year at Godolkin University. Much of that, of course, is clearly some writerly course-correcting, for you can see the places where Andre/Chance's death has been stitched into the show's otherwise quite intricately plotted season ahead.

But that comes later. Let's start at the beginning: Last we saw Andre, Marie (Jaz Sinclair), Emma (Lizze Broadway), and Jordan (London Thor and Derek Luh), they were trapped in some doorless place that was equal parts prison and medical room. “Where are we?” they asked themselves at the end of season one—and season two doesn't quite start there. Instead, we're taken way back to 1967 where a group of men in lab coats are, hilariously , experimenting on themselves. We're back seeing the origins of Compound V and before you're able to remember just how violent Gen V can truly get, you're seeing guts, gore, and plenty of bloodied black humor to firmly remind you that this is a darkly funny show where heads (and asses) explode and no one is ever safe. Except Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater), who's wise enough to steer clear from taking the compound and thus saves himself from the untimely deaths of his colleagues.

Clearly we're going to be digging into the very history of Godolkin U and its namesake. That's always been part of The Boys DNA so it makes sense Gen V would follow suit: Nothing that's happening in 2025 has happened in a vacuum. These supes, their powers, and the political maneuvering—and sociocultural wars they've engendered—have long histories worth excavating.

Which brings us back to the present. Gen V places us squarely in a world reeling from the death of Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit)—and the way God U and The Seven are spinning that “tragedy” into a new pivot from which they can further control the narrative (and the world and presidency, in turn). Enter Dean Cipher (the always deliciously devilish Hamish Linklater), who's eager to get students at God U to feel like they're in a place that will nurture their powers and their god-given right as superpowered beings: He wants God U to be a “campus where you can find freedom from human constraints and the woke agenda and display your powers with pride.” 

Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Sam (Asa Germann), the two Guardians of Godolkin who were still in good graces with Vought and the school, have clearly been fine since we last saw them. And Cate, in particular, has been working hard to get her friends out of Elmira, the institution where they were all kept. And at the start of the episode she's succeeded—only, instead of seeing all four of her friends, she sees Jordan and Emma pissed as all hell. 

Marie, it seems, has been on the run for a while. And no one had felt it fit to tell Cate that Andre had passed away during a foiled getaway attempt. It's an admirable way of honoring Chance even as the Marie escape of it all feels like a forced reset for what the season cliffhanger had first teased.

Alas, Jordan and Emma are both sullen about their imprisonment and now release, which has strings attached: They're required to utter prepared statements and agree to become Guardians once more, another plot contrivance that feels necessary if the show wishes to remain a college-set show still. And while they consider their odds (would they rather go back to Elmira?), they eventually agree and offer the most lukewarm of speeches at some needlessly formal press conference where they're reinstated as Guardians of Godolkin.

That means they're all now tentatively working with/for Dean Cipher, who wastes no time in letting Cate know he doesn't fear her at all. (Who knew a blender could feel so threatening?) And while we don't yet know what his powers are, his cruelty is clearly the point. He's eager to stoke the God U students into not kowtowing to “humankind” and using as incendiary racist rhetoric as a prestige satire show can muster.

Marie may be intent on finding her long-lost sister Annabeth, but even she can't escape the way the world has changed since Neuman's death. Protesters aligned with Starlight clash with folks who insist they're in “Homelander country” (can you guess the racial makeup of each group?), and Marie unwittingly intervenes, saving a nice young Black boy (with an earnest “Fight like a girl” shirt) who'd helped her at a minimart earlier. 

She's the kind of person who can't see injustice being doled out. Yet that's what eventually gets her roped back into God U. (Social media videos of blood-soaked attacks have a way of going viral in this world.) And soon she's tracked by a supe quite literally tracking her scent. Is Dogknott (Zach McGowan) the wackiest Wolverine rip-off character we've seen yet? Probably. He makes quite an entrance, on all fours eventually breaking into her motel room and giving us a thrilling fight scene that would make that famed mutant proud. Marie stands up for herself but eventually needs some help, courtesy of Starlight (Erin Moriarty) herself, who beats up Dogknott and gets the young Marie out of harm's way.

Oh, and she has a mission for the former God U student, only it requires something she may not want to do (but something the show's plot all but requires): The safest place for Marie, Starlight insists, is on campus. Plus, she could do some research there about something called “Project Odessa,” which she believes God U is starting up again. Starlight has a great pep talk prepared that serves as a bit of a thesis for the series. “You're a hero,” she tells Marie. “But you can't stay out of this fight forever.”

And she really can't, for a video of her helping the Starlighters has gone viral and that's enough to get Emma (drunk at a frat party) to figure out where she is. With Jordan in tow, she locates her (in Weehawken of all places), as does Cate, who really wants Marie to return to God U. It's the safest place for her, she insists, unwittingly echoing Starlighter. As a fugitive, she's in constant danger; but if she agrees to return to God U, she'll at least be a visible figure on campus less likely to be targeted or worse.

It's all wrapped in good intentions (and in keeping with what Starlighter hoped Marie would do) but it soon goes sideways. Their conversation gets heated and between Marie itching to stand her ground and Jordan wanting to protect her, their dialogue soon turns deadly—as in, this all ends with Cate bleeding to death when Jordan blasts her.

To which I say: Yikes. I mean, it really can't get worse than accidentally killing your former friend who was maybe trying to help you though maybe not in the best way—and oh yeah, she's quite a public figure whose death will not go unnoticed. How do you get ahead of such an event? Use social media to your advantage, of course. 

The most intriguing aspect of The Boys' first season—and of its entire premise, really—was the idea that superpowered beings weren't (just) good for heroic roles among the rest of us. In fact, as Vought had figured out, they made for better spokespeople than for actual soldiers. Or, rather, they made better soldiers because of their marketability.

Gen V is clearly also born out of that very same framework: If so many young kids have powers, they can't all be supes. But they can all be, especially if Dean Cipher is to be taken at his word, soldiers in the rising fight against anti-superpowered sentiment. There's a race war coming, you can almost hear him saying, and the better prepared God U students are, the easier it'll be to stomp on those pesky humans coming for them. It's incendiary rhetoric, but it's nothing compared to what Emma hears as she slowly adjusts to life back as a Godolkin student required to take classes from a tradwife-esque supe influencer (with wings!) who is all too happy to train her students into using their online platforms to stoke fear regarding the recent attack on Cate. (The latter is recovering and not dead as you may have feared after that first-episode cliffhanger.

The supe-ss-influencer framework is precisely what Emma and Jordan exploit as they bring Marie back into God U: Episode two opens with Marie recording a video for social media where she talks about how she's coming back from a mental-health break and ready to rejoin her peers at God U. And while Dean Cipher allows her back, it's clear he cares little for her bullshit performative atonement. But it's better to keep her close than fight or search for her.

It's Cipher who breaks the news about Cate to Marie. Does he know she and Jordan were the ones who attacked her? Is he baiting her? Playing mind games with her? All of the above? Why else would he share that Andre had died from complications from the rare disease that also afflicted his dad? Is it to gain her trust or to whitewash Andre's selfless death?

Either way, Cipher is clearly not to be messed with. He's as cold and calculating as they come. And as the media around Cate's attack is heard around campus, it's obvious what the line is: This was a hate crime, an excuse to stoke fear and rage against Starlight and those who align themselves with her.

Which is a bit eerie to watch and try to process as a fictional take on a hellish reality. Vought and God U benefit from blaming “Starlighters” for Cate's attack (she's in a coma), and all the students are intent on furthering that narrative, even as we know that's far from the truth. Then again, that word may not have quite the currency it once might have had—in both that fictional college campus and in the very real ones on the other side of the screen.

And yet, the search for the truth—of what happened to Cate, of what Project Odessa is—is what drives the latter half of this episode. Sam, who's grown used to needing Cate to quell his anxiety and to quite literally dull his feelings, is struggling without her. He's intent on figuring out what actually happened. And when he visits her at the hospital, she takes control of one of the nurses nearby and says one word: “Emma,” before leading said nurse into a bloody rampage against another attendant—all collateral damage as the young student struggles with her recovery. Alas, that's all Sam needs to confront Emma—especially once he learns she'd gone to Weehawken the night Cate was attacked. 

Not that Emma cops up to anything. She calls him out for siding with Cate, who she knows has been lying to Sam and keeping him on a short leash. Meanwhile, Emma and Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), newly appointed Dean of Marketing, are set on finding more about Project Odessa. It's an unlikely pair, but they're both eager to find out more about the rot at the heart of Godolkin, and Polarity's grief is fodder enough to have him infiltrating God U and teaming up with his son's kids to avenge his death. His plan is stupidly simple (and also, as Emma fears, perhaps just too stupid in general): “I'm gonna kill Cipher. Then I'm going to burn this school to the ground. Then we're going to Seven Tower and we're gonna strip down to the motherfucking studs.”

Why don't they start with something small, like Project Odessa? And so they go to the best place to get information: the library, where The Rememberer (the hilarious Stephen Guarino) oversees the university's archives. Which are, we're told, off-limits to the likes of Polarity but a very high Emma ingratiates herself with the once-famous supe (whose tagline was “Justice Never Forgets Shhh”) and manages to get them in the special wing of the library archives where all of Thomas Godolkin's papers are kept. And not just that: They find a secret hidden room where his Nazi paraphernalia is on full display that has the info on Project Odessa she was searching for all along.

It's all enough to get Emma so excited that she gets big all by herself. It's a rare feat but also quite inconvenient considering she makes lots of noise and raises suspicion from her new BFF The Rememberer, who finds her naked and gigantic in the room he'd left her at. Phew. But if they thought the threat of being found out in Godolkin's secret Nazi archive lair was bad, they clearly were not in Cipher's super-exclusive (pun intended) new seminar.

“You are not students,” he tells those select few there gathered, which include Jordan and Marie. “You are soldiers.” It's as blunt an assertion as this cravenly cruel Dean has made about how he hopes to reshape the Godolkin U population. That's what his “optimization” seminar is all about; does Marie know how her power works? Does Jordan? How else are they going to level up and rise up in God U's rankings to become better supes, better students, better soldiers?

And if you were fearing they'd sit around and work those kinds of questions out intellectually, know that, instead, Cipher just locks them up with Vikor (Tait Fletcher). The goal of the class? Just hit the button that will open the door—something Vikor and his imposing physique and hammer will make very very hard. Some Hunger Games-style fighting ensues, with the kids (save for Marie and Jordan, really) flubbing the test.

You can see Marie and Jordan, in real time, test new aspects of their powers. (Could Marie really stop Vikor's heart? Are Jordan's booms becoming stronger?) And that's eventually enough to get them to hit the button, get some notes from Cipher, and be told to come back next week (except for that one redhead who'll be moved to the Performing Arts School). 

That said, nothing brings two doe-eyed youths together like that kind of near-death experience. And so, by the time Jordan and Marie make it back to their dorm room, the hormones are clearly doing their work and, scored at first by Olivia Castriota and then by Billie Eillish, the two get physical and give us a welcome take on desire, gender, and sexuality without really making a big deal out of it.

And that's when they hear the ruckus outside: Is it a protest? A celebration? It's a bit of both, as it turns out. “Vought caught the folks who attacked Cate,” they hear. Surprise! Dogknott apparently tracked the Starlighter who did it (the young Black boy Marie had helped, of course) and killed him. Justice was, it seems, served. But only because Emma, Jordan, and Marie did nothing. That's something they can't afford to do anymore—not when innocents will continue to pay the price.

Amid the crowd of rollicking students thrilled at this turn of events, Gen V gives us quite an early season twist: Emma makes her way through the gleeful students on campus and inches up to Marie and Jordan, pushing a folder their way. She knows what Project Odessa is. It's Marie. Yes, it seems we're getting a tried and true “you're the one” trope here. Though immediately (as in, the third episode) we have Marie herself questioning how that feels ill-fitting to her. She's no Neo. No Luke. Those chosen ones so rarely look like her. 

But like many chosen ones before her, she still has to face some family trauma, which leads her to contact Pam, an old friend of her mother's who'd been like an aunt to her and who's oddly cagey about meeting and talking about Marie's birth. That took place at a fertility clinic at Godolkin U, of all places, that's led by “Dr. Gold” who, in photos, looks exactly like Cipher himself.

It's all a lot to process. But it's not as heavy as learning her sister Annabeth had lived with Pam following her parents' death. Marie breaks down (in a clunkily written monologue that has the line, “I was a girl who got her period!”) and insists she wants contact with her sister again. She needs to learn everything that happened to her and that her parents were to blame. She's no monster. 

And as she dwells on that, she also has to come face to face with Cate, who finally wakes up from her coma (with one less arm, a scar on her skull, and an inability to use her powers) and returns to campus an erstwhile hero to the school even as she walks around in a kind of daze, unsure what her life will look like moving forward.

She finds the campus is on edge, especially as “RESIST” posters adorned with Starlight's yellow star keep popping up by an invisible force. As Emma eventually finds out (following the speedster into a locker room full of naked men), it's Harper (Jessica Clement), the rat-tailed girl whose powers are actually chameleon-like. But if Emma was hoping to find a Starlighter resistance at school, all she's found are vandals who want to do little else but paper the campus, which she insists is not enough. They need to sabotage and start breaking stuff.

You know who's really happy to break stuff? Sam. Once he learns Cate can no longer drug him out of his feelings, he's left adrift and aggressive, punching everything in his room in utter despair—until Jordan arrives, fights him, and eventually calms him down.  (An episode or two of Avenue V helps.) He'll need to sort out his demons in earnest. He can't hide anymore from his guilt or his grief.

That's also enough of a wake-up call for Jordan, who was waffling as to how to respond to Marie's “I love you” following their first intimate night together (Marie's actual first, it turns out). And they finally realize they have to say it back, which they do on Thomas Godolkin Day right before they're set to give a speech celebrating their newfound position as the No. 1 on campus.

At the propagandist-leaning event, Jordan may start openly following the cringe-inducing, PR-approved script, but they soon go for a more candid approach: They tell the gathered students how Andre died and insist that Cate wasn't attacked by Starlighters. As Cipher looks disappointed onstage, the crowd quickly turns on Jordan. It's clear they won't be holding to that No. 1 spot much longer. What will this do to the campus, Cipher's master plan to continue turning students into soldiers, and the budding resistance Emma is now coaching?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ben & Jerry are breaking up","https://www.avclub.com/ben-and-jerrys-jerry-greenfield-quits-gaza-unilever","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:13:00 GMT","

Jerry Greenfield, one of the co-founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, is leaving the company. His partner Ben Cohen shared Greenfield's announcement of the change to social media. Amid ongoing tensions with parent company Unilever regarding the war in Gaza, Greenfield cited a loss of independence and feeling “silenced” as his reason for exiting the company after nearly half a century.

“It's with a broken heart that I've decided I can no longer, in good conscience, and after 47 years, remain an employee of Ben & Jerry's. I am resigning from the company Ben and I started back in 1978. This is one of the hardest and most painful decisions I've ever made,” the 74-year-old wrote in his statement. Greenfield wrote that what made the company and the work of its employees so important “was the independence to pursue our values, which was guaranteed when Unilever bought the company. For more than twenty years under their ownership, Ben & Jerry's stood up and spoke out in support of peace, justice, and human rights, not as abstract concepts, but in relation to real events happening in our world. That independence existed in no small part because of the unique merger agreement Ben and I negotiated with Unilever, one that enshrined our social mission and values in the company's governance structure in perpetuity. It's profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone.”

Ben & Jerry's was sold to Unilever in 2000 because “the business was publicly owned, and there was another company that wanted to own it, and they were offering so much money for the stock that the board of directors felt that they had no choice but to accept the offer,” Cohen explained in 2003. Greenfield described the partners' role in the company afterwards as “goodwill ambassadors” helping to “promote the values of the company, not simply to sell more ice cream, but the other things that the company stands for and works for.” However, he said, “we're not involved in operations or management. So we have no responsibility, no authority, and very little influence.”

In recent years, the founders have clashed with Unilever over activism regarding Gaza. In 2024, Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever, stating the company of trying to dismantle Ben & Jerry's independent board in order to silence the company “from calling for a cease-fire and safe passage for [Palestinian] refugees, from supporting U.S. students protesting civilian deaths in Gaza, and from urging an end to U.S. military aid to Israel,” per The New York Times. In March of this year, Ben & Jerry's filed a federal complaint accusing Unilever of firing its CEO and replacing him without approval from Ben & Jerry's advisory board, going against the companies' merger agreement. “Unilever has repeatedly threatened Ben & Jerry's personnel, including C.E.O. David Stever, should they fail to comply with Unilever's efforts to silence the social mission,” Ben & Jerry's said in the filing. 

This alleged silencing from Unilever is “happening at a time when our country's current administration is attacking civil rights, voting rights, the rights of immigrants, women, and the LGBTQ community. Standing up for values like justice, equity, and shared humanity has never been more important, yet Ben & Jerry's has been silenced and sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power. It's easy to stand up and speak out when there's nothing at risk. The real test of values is when times are challenging and you have something to lose,” Greenfield wrote in his exit announcement.

Per The New York Times, Unilever is currently in the process of spinning off its ice cream unit into a new entity, Magnum Ice Cream Company. Cohen—who wrote on social media that Greenfield's “legacy deserves to be true to our values” amid his departure from the company—has been leading protests against Unilever and the new spun-off company. He and other Ben & Jerry's employees continue to spearhead the #FreeBenandJerrys campaign to make the company independent again. Meanwhile, Magnum Ice Cream Company issued a statement contradicting Greenfield's message, just as Unilever “[rejected] the claims” made in Ben & Jerry's lawsuit. “We disagree with his perspective and have sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position in the world,” Magnum Ice Cream Company stated in response to Greenfield's letter, adding that it will remain committed to “Ben & Jerry's unique three-part mission—product, economic and social—and remain focused on carrying forward the legacy of peace, love, and ice cream of this iconic, much-loved brand.” 

“Love, equity, justice. They're part of who Ben and I are, and they've always been the true foundation of Ben & Jerry's. From the very beginning, Ben and I believed that our values and the pursuit of justice were more important than the company itself. If the company couldn't stand up for the things we believed, then it wasn't worth being a company at all,” Greenfield declared in his letter. “It was always about more than just ice cream; it was a way to spread love and invite others into the fight for equity, justice and a better world. Coming to the conclusion that this is no longer possible at Ben & Jerry's means I can no longer remain part of Ben & Jerry's. If I can't carry those values forward inside the company today, then I will carry them forward outside, with all the love and conviction I can.”

“American Pickers” star Mike Wolfe and his girlfriend, Leticia Cline, were hospitalized following a car accident on Friday, September 12. The incident took place on Highway 7 in Columbia, Tennessee, while the two were driving in a vintage vehicle. Now, just days following the crash, Wolfe has been released from the hospital.

Wolfe has been “discharged and is remaining by Leticia's side as she recovers,” Wolfe's representatives told People on September 16. The reps also noted that the star had been treated for a broken nose, an injured knee and facial lacerations that required stitches.

A post shared by Leticia Cline (@leticiacline)

While Wolfe has been released from the hospital, Cline needs more time and care to deal with the injuries she suffered during the car accident.

She initially noted that her “mouth will be wired shut,” according to People. Now, Wolfe's representatives have explained the full extent of her injuries. They said that she's healing from “fractures to her jaw, sternum, and ribs, as well as a partially collapsed lung.”

“She remains hospitalized and will undergo several surgeries once the swelling subsides,” the statement to People also said.

Cline has been updating her Instagram followers via her Stories. In various pics shared on September 16, she can be seen with her sister having her hair done, playing Backgammon, drinking tea to try to speed up her recovery and walking in the hospital hall with Wolfe by her side.

A post shared by Mike Wolfe (@mikewolfeamericanpicker)

Despite the fact that Wolfe and Cline were involved in a car accident, the two are feeling “grateful.”

Indeed, the star's representatives said that “the couple and their families are grateful for the swift response of first responders and the outpouring of support they have received during this difficult time.”

Fans have certainly stepped up to show that they care about the star and are thinking about him and Cline. One person took to Wolfe's latest Instagram post to express their support, writing, “Were all praying for you and your amazing woman Mikey 🙏🏼 speedy recovery!!!”

“Get well soon! There will always be another 🚙,” someone else wrote. Yet another social media follower added, “Sending thoughts and prayers….wishing you and your partner a speedy recovery. 💔”

“Sorry to hear about Leticia's crash,” another fan wrote. “Glad you're by her side. It's important for us to support [our] partners. Good to hear you're still a good man.”

Beyond the update on Wolfe and Cline, the reps noted that the pair “ask for privacy as Leticia continues her recovery.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Corey Feldman Was Previously Married to DWTS Alum's Ex","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/corey-feldman-ex-wife-girlfriend-brian-austin-green/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:09:42 GMT","

Corey Feldman was a beloved figure in the 1980s, starring in popular movies such as “The Goonies” and “Stand by Me.” He is also well-known for his friendship with Corey Haim and Michael Jackson. When he stepped onto the stage for “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 on September 16, he wowed fans with his Jackson-inspired moves. 

Feldman is an interesting character, and his relationship history is also fascinating, including a brief marriage to a fellow actor. 

Feldman and Vanessa Marcil had a short romance that lasted from 1989 to 1993, People reports. They got married after knowing each other for only a few months. Feldman has been married three times. In an October 2013 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where he discussed his management company, Corey's Angels. He also briefly shared insight into his relationship history. 

“Before I met Courtney, I was a bit of a playboy,” he said, referring to his third wife, Courtney Anne Mitchell, whom he married in 2016 and divorced in 2023. “And, you know, certainly not in a bad way. I was never a player, per se. I was never the guy that would, like, you know, date women and tell them they were the one and only, and then secretly date five other girls.”

Speaking of how his idea for his management company for women started, he said, “A lot of the girls that I was dating, you know, were all kind of telling me the same thing, which is like, hey, I have this passion for art, or, you know, I'm a musician, I'm a singer, I'm an actress. But a lot of them were selling themselves short. They were going and trying to do ‘Playboy,' and that was like their biggest goal — to be a kind of glam girl, T&A model, that type of stuff.”

Marcil's relationship with Feldman is not her only high-profile romance; she has also dated Brian Austin Green. The pair met on the set of “Beverly Hills, 90210.” Green was a star on the show, playing the role of David Silver, and Marcil joined the show in Season 9 as Gina Kincaid.  

Green and Marcil dated and got engaged in 2001. In 2002, their son Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green was born. Then in 2003, they split. Marcil and Green's relationship has been complicated, and she has made some public comments about him that many would feel were unkind. 

“[I was] always honest with him about that, I did, however, feel sorry for him. I still do,” she wrote on Instagram in 2020, Us Weekly reports. She also claimed she never loved Green, Us Weekly reports. “He's a very angry/sad human being who still has too much shame to take full responsibility for his actions as a father.”

“Dancing with the Stars” fans will remember that Green competed on the show in Season 30 in 2021. His partner at the time was professional dancer Sharna Burgess, who is now his romantic partner.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Beloved Golden Globe-Winning Actress Passes Away at 91: Tributes Pour In","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/patricia-crowley-passes-away-tributes/","Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:09:51 GMT","

Patricia Crowley, who was known for her roles in “Please Don't Eat the Daisies” and “Dynasty,” has passed away at the age of 91, The Hollywood Reporter reports. 

She died from natural causes in Los Angeles, her son Jon Hookstratten, who serves as the Executive VP of Administration & Operations for Sony Pictures Entertainment, announced. Crowley tragically passed two days before her 92nd birthday.

She is survived by her husband, television producer and executive Andy Friendly, with the two having gotten married in 1986. She is also survived by her two children, five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. Crowley was previously married to sports and entertainment attorney Ed Hookstratten.

Fans spoke highly of Crowley's impressive career, paying tribute after her passing.

“What a wonderful career she had Patricia Crowley brought so much charm and talent to every role. A true Hollywood gem,” one fan wrote.

“Patricia Crowley's talent and grace will always be remembered! Her iconic roles brought joy to many,” another fan commented.

“Grace, grit, and generations of screens, Patricia Crowley didn't just act, she anchored eras. What a legacy,” a fan said.

“Sad news to wake up to. Condolences to Patricia's family,” one fan wrote.

Crowley's acting career seemed written in the stars as she decided to follow her sister to New York City and went on to attend the High School of Performing Arts. She made her Broadway debut in 1950 in “Southern Exposure.”

Crowley starred in numerous different projects throughout her career, but one of her most well-known roles was Joan Nash in Please Don't Eat the Daisies. The sitcom ran from 1965 to 1967, in which she portrayed a newspaper writer who was married to a college professor, and the couple had four boys. Oh, and you can't forget about the family's Old English sheepdog named Ladadog.

“I thought the writing was very intelligent and very sweet,” she told Pioneers of Television of Please Don't Eat the Daisies in a past interview.

Crowley went on to have a recurring role in the sixth season of the ABC primetime soap Dynasty, starring as Emily Fallmont in 1986. Her time on Dynasty came to an end when her character was hit by a taxi and died.

She also won the Golden Globe for New Star of the Year for her performances in Forever Female and Money From Home in 1953.

She also had stints on The Twilight Zone, Friends, The Love Boat, General Hospital, and Beverly Hills, 90210, along with so many others. Her final onscreen appearance was in 2012 in the film Mont Reve.

Francis Ford Coppola‘s 2024 “Megalopolis” went off like a bomb — a succès d'estime, film maudit, or total disaster, depending on your perspective.

For his first feature in 13 years, and one decades in the making, the Oscar-winning “Apocalypse Now” and “The Godfather” filmmaker plunged more than $120 million of his own money into reimagining 21st-century New York City as a new Roman empire over which preside a visionary architect (Adam Driver) and a corrupt mayor (Giancarlo Esposito). Production began in earnest at Georgia's Trilith Studios in November 2022, where Coppola bought out a Days Inn to convert into the production headquarters and the sprawling cast's (which included Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Jon Voight, Shia LaBeouf, and more) living quarters for a four-month-long shoot.

Controversy followed, crews tussled, the trades reported mass exodus and creative disagreement on set. If you're reading this, you know the rest of the story — all the way up to the film's divisive Cannes 2024 premiere in competition, and the long road to Lionsgate eventually distributing “Megalopolis” in the fall to little noise and less box office ($14 million worldwide).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Filming all the while was Oscar-nominated “Leaving Las Vegas” and “Timecode” filmmaker Mike Figgis, who previously directed five documentaries of his own including one about a flamenco dance troupe. The result, with cameras rolling on set from production and onto quite literally the red carpet heading into the Palais des Festivals for the “Megalopolis” Cannes premiere, is the Venice-premiering documentary “Megadoc.”

Closer in spirit to the 1991 documentary about the making of “Apocalypse Now,” “Hearts of Darkness,” though certainly with less ruination and despair, “Megadoc” is hardly your typical behind-the-scenes feature-length featurette. A film IndieWire called “a riveting documentary about the making of a visionary disaster,” it's an intimate look at Coppola's mercurial artistic process and the shifting temperaments and on-set weathers experienced (and created) by everyone below and above the line — such as a canny episode that witnesses a frustrated LaBeouf unable to meet his grandmaster's demands. “I don't know what you want!” LaBeouf yells.

“The minute you turn on a camera, whether you're filming a rehearsal, a documentary, a feature film or anything, the minute the camera turns on, reality clicks into another level, always,” Figgis told IndieWire. That's to say there is a level of performance going on, whether Aubrey Plaza wooing or dismissing the camera or Nathalie Emmanuel requesting that Figgis not film her while eating. It's a fascinating portrait of celebrity ego and of the inner workings of a movie the outside world deemed doomed from the start.

 










Ahead of “Megadoc” hitting theaters, Figgis, while smoking a roll-your-own cigarette over Zoom, talked the making of his own making-of documentary, which actors were the prickliest or most giving, and what he actually thinks of the end product, the movie “Megalopolis.”

The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity and length.

IndieWire: How did you first come to meet Francis Ford Coppola? Was it through Nicolas Cage and “Leaving Las Vegas”?

Mike Figgis: The first time I sat down and had a conversation with Francis was probably the night at the Oscars, at the Governors Ball. I was with the Coppola family. Nic [Cage's] mother was there, aunties, and things like that. There was so much food, and no one was eating, and I think one of the aunts went, “This is all going to waste.” She got a napkin and said, “I'm taking this home.” That's how I met the extended Coppola clan. I knew Sofia a little bit when she was younger, through a different crowd. 

Francis and I seemed to hit it off quite well. We stayed in touch over the years. I did some work for the magazine he runs, that is edited by someone else, Zoetrope. I was guest editor on one of those, kept in touch with Michael [Ray] the editor, and then something came up, we were having a conversation, and I said, “Give my regards to Francis.” He said, “He's really happy. He's going ahead with ‘Megalopolis.'” I had no idea what “Megalopolis” was. I wrote to Francis and said congratulations, and cheekily put at the end, “P.S. If you need a fly on the wall, let me know.” Nothing for a while, then I suddenly got an email from him that said, “Do you have a visa? Could you get on a plane quite soon?” Wow, OK. I didn't have a feature, so I said OK.

 










The film ends at the Cannes premiere. There's nothing about the aftermath or the reception. Were you by Coppola's side when the movie kind of went off like a bomb at the festival?

Which was on the cards by then, because obviously it had done a preview in Los Angeles, and I'd had feedback from that. I wasn't there. That was a long way to go, and I felt Cannes would be more filmically exciting, and so I pushed for the Cannes thing and said, “I'd love to come, but can I get on the red carpet?” They said, “No, that's never been allowed before.” Francis made a phone call and said, “OK, you're the exception. The [festival] says you can stick with me on the red carpet.” 

I was very nervous because it was just me, no assistant, and you've got to have batteries charged. What if a camera doesn't work? I stuck a GoPro on top of the camera as a second camera just in case, and I ran that the whole time. I used some of the footage.

Has he seen the final version of the documentary?

Yes. We had a conversation [that was] pretty much [positive]. He let me do what I want. Obviously, the whole thing with the art department and all that, he had very strong views about that from his point of view. I said, it's a documentary. You're a grandmaster. You're above all this. Just let me show my balance and my frame from how I saw it because I got friendly with the art department. I was following them as it unfolded. Everybody was trying to do the best thing they could because they love Francis and respect him so much. Everyone's just trying to give him what he wants all the time, and that's tricky with Francis historically. I interviewed his wife at the very beginning, and I said, “Any advice?” And she said, “Just keep your eyes open because he'll change his mind all the time.” That was really valuable advice.

 










Was he concerned about the financial success of the movie? Even though he put $120 million of his own money into this—

More!

Was he expecting it to make that back?

That's a good question because, in the past, historically, he's been proven right obviously with “Apocalypse Now,” which is a good parallel. He held out and eventually did get his money back. Primarily, he wants to make a film the way he wants to make it. What historically he's proved is making money for him was never a huge issue. He lost it, then he got it back, then he diversified into wine and hotels and all that stuff. He has a remarkably healthy attitude towards money. He says, “Look, I'm in my eighties. It's only money. The kids are OK. It's fine.” At a certain point, he did get a bit nervous because he took out a loan as well on the wine business. In answer to your question, no, that wasn't a dominating factor for him.

Early in the documentary, the art department points out how the film's look was still being developed during production, so she says it's “equal parts exciting and distressing.” Could you feel that contradiction on set?

He was changing his mind every day, and then he was trying things, so his idea of fun is that if I have an idea on Friday morning, as I'm driving to work, I'm paying for this, I'll do it. So he might turn up and say, “I've changed my mind, I don't want to do it like that. Let's try it old school.” He was having so much fun: Look at it this way. That generation of actors, and I would include myself, the fun is in the process of making the film, full stop. I remember years ago working with Albert Finney, who's a great actor but also had directed and was very much involved in the process of filmmaking. At the end of the film, he said, “I just want to tell you I will never see this film. I had a ball making it, and I hope we do another one together, but that's all I'm interested in.”

 










The fun part is in the process, so let's try something, as opposed to the contemporary, what has become the lockdown way of making movies: Everything is locked down before you even shoot the first day, and particularly if you go for Marvel universe type stuff, it has to be locked down, hence the panic in the art department because they thought that's what Francis wanted. And then he changed his mind because it was boring for him. It wasn't fun. He's not a green screen, blue screen kind of guy. And he comes from theater, so he's from that generation. He wants to fuck around with stuff and try props and theatrical reality as opposed to Marvel reality.

That was unfortunate for the art department because they were definitely not prepared for that. Had they known he wanted to do it that way, they would have pre-planned differently. He wanted some of that stuff, but the balance was off for them, and they were ducking and diving trying to catch up.

This Hollywood Reporter story broke during production detailing crew exits and creative differences. Then you had Adam Driver rushing to the movie's defense, and in “Megadoc” you see Coppola reacting to that news break. Was that exciting to you, as a filmmaker who is trained to chase drama?

The Hollywood Reporter thing was a story, and for a story to be a story, it has to be dramatic. There wasn't, as they say, this kind of total group feeling of “it's a disaster.” It was basically a clash between him and the art department, which he then solved by getting rid of them. As I say in the documentary, his mood immediately elevated. He was so cheerful because, in a way, he was back in control of what he understands as the filmmaking process, and the contrast was he was incredibly happy. The art department was kind of really sad because they felt they hadn't been able to give him what he wanted. There are no villains in this piece. It's just creative tensions which will always emerge when you work with someone like Francis. Historically, it's been the same with Kubrick and all kinds of people. Different forms of that, but that kind of filmmaking on that kind of scale inevitably will throw up something.

 










There are candid moments with Shia LaBeouf, who talks about his persona non grata status, but also he had a prior, bruised relationship with Jon Voight that the movie helped him repair. Shia is volatile in person, and this movie doesn't shy away from that. Were you prepared for that?

It was all new to me. I didn't know much about him but, in the first days of turning up in the rehearsal, he was one of the first people I started talking to who was very open. People were cautious of me when I turned up, which I understand. They're in a nervy situation where they've read the script, they don't quite understand it. They aren't quite sure what's going to happen.

He had no idea who I was, and he said, “Who are you? What are you doing here? How do you know Francis?” It was a very funny conversation. I said, “I know him through Nic.” “Nic who?” I said, “Well, Coppola.” “How do you know Nic?” I said through the movie. “What movie?” I said, “Leaving Las Vegas.” “What was your connection with that?” I said, “Oh, I directed it, wrote it, did the score, and produced it,” and he went, “Holy fuck, well then what are you doing here with your little video camera?'” 

From then on, we had a really good relationship. He was very open talking about the process, his process, and how that can work and as you observed yourself, his volatility within this framework, obviously, he was polite and nervous whether he was going to get fired, but quite ballsy when it came to politely questioning, “What do you want?” There's that lovely moment in the thing where Francis loses it completely and says, “Just give me what I want,” and he goes, “I don't know what you want.”

 










Nathalie Emmanuel didn't want to be filmed eating, and Adam Driver is known for being camera-shy and prickly toward press, but it seemed like you were able to work around these celebrity behaviors.

I had to keep reminding myself, “It's not my movie.” It's very easy when you're on a set like that, you have freedom to go anywhere you want, you've got your camera to fall into the trap of thinking somehow this is your film. At a certain point, you are cautioned by Adam or Nathalie or whoever, the people who want to be left a little bit alone, or in Adam's case completely alone, so I thought, OK that's an interesting problem to work around. As I say at the beginning of the film, I've never watched another filmmaker at work before, so that was a revelation. After years of making a film myself, you fall into the trap of going, “Oh, that's how we make films.” That's bullshit. How I make films has got nothing to do with how anybody else makes a film. Quentin Tarantino makes a film or Scorsese makes a film, they've all got their own style.

Aubrey Plaza seemed very open with you and also someone who is turned on by the camera, even as it's meant to be on-the-fly and nonfiction. It seemed like you developed a good relationship.

 










We were in rehearsal, and I was filming it. It was a couple days in, and they got used to me being there. I also am polite initially. I try and find who's going to respond and who's not going to respond, and Aubrey clearly as a personality has got that kind of interactive potential. What happened was, when they were rehearsing, she plays a TV reporter, and they were doing a scene, and she went, “You're my camera man,” and she grabbed me and took me into the rehearsal as her cameraperson and started bossing me around, and said, “Here, come here, film this,” and it was Shia doing all his push-ups. At that point, Francis goes, “Mike, there's a better angle over there.” I said, I'm on a wide lens, and he went, oh, and I suddenly thought, I've been commandeered into the process now, which was funny but really useful in the sense that it established this kind of thing — your question before, are they performing? Yes. of course they're performing. I had a deal with the actors and said to all of them, once we start shooting, I will be everywhere. If I'm in your face, do this [makes throat-cutting gesture], and I'll go away. If you want to play that I'm in your face, do this [holds palm out]. Aubrey was very good at playing the part of “you're in my face, go away.”

 










There were reports about and a video showing Coppola exhibiting what people ascribed to old-school directorial behavior. Did you observe any of that?

No. Put it this way: I was there and my job was literally just to watch everything like a hawk, so that's my job. I'm looking for, not bad things, but things that would work well in the documentary. So I'm watching and I'm trying to find stuff, and I didn't see any of that. Either I'm not a very good filmmaker or I'm quite good. I was watching everything. I used to wake up in the morning and go, “Why am I so cheerful?” It was like, “It's not my film. It's not my problem. I don't have to fix anything. All I have to do is be awake, alert, and have enough batteries so that if something happens, I get it.” There was so much interesting stuff happening that was for me really interesting.

Lastly, what do you think about “Megalopolis”?

I'd seen all the scenes being shot, so as they were shooting, I was thinking, that's interesting, how are they going to cut that? How's that going to fit into the sequence? The first time I saw it was in Cannes, it was the only time I've seen it. A couple of factors I have to add: I was very nervous because I was shooting, and I was just thinking of my batteries. Do I have enough light to shoot?

 










There are some scenes where I thought, that's interesting what he's done with that. I was still a little bit confused about the sequential, the timeline of it, and one of my feelings was there's so much material, he's shot so much stuff, and the story is so complicated that to get it into feature length, whatever it was at Cannes, underlines for me one of the problems that we have with film right now, since serial became such a big deal as a respected way of telling stories over five hours, six hours, that maybe this would work better in more of a serial kind of context. 

I really liked when they did that with “The Godfather,” where there's much more time with character. I felt that just getting the story into that box was slightly at the disservice of the characters. I wanted to know more about the characters, actually, personally, and about the love story and so on.

We talk about how serialized TV is impacting filmmakers and their theatrical projects, where the impulse to stuff in more material is heightened. Most movies at the Venice Film Festival this year are 150 minutes.

Since “Sopranos,” “The Wire,” etc. etc., that was such a gamechanger, and the attempt now by filmmakers to make the films longer and longer, I think there was kind of a rule about feature films, which is to do with your bum and the point when you start wriggling in your chair, it's just too long. One of my favorite films is “Notorious,” and it's something like 93 minutes, and it's a perfect film, but it's been written for that format. We're still trying to write feature films because we love the idea of the cinema, and the feature, and sometimes there's just too much stuff.

 










“Megadoc” opens in theaters on Friday, September 19 from Utopia.

							By 

	David Fear



	These are curious and perilous times we live in, the kind that call for courage and perseverance on all fronts. It can be exhausting, even if you're not trying to take down the establishment or have long since given up the righteous fight. Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another is a lot of things: a parable about fathers and daughters, a conspiracy thriller for the ICE age, an ensemble comedy that encourages all-stars to get their best eccentricity on, the single greatest film of 2025, a movie that's less a VistaVision adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland than a passing nod to the author on the way to its own profound insights.


	Above all, it's an act of resistance, both the lower-case and capital-R type, that suggests it may have an answer as to how we battle through this onslaught against our better angels. But first, a few things need to get blown the fuck up. 


	Luckily, this woozy, winding epic has a handful of people on deck who are willing to do exactly that. They're the French 75, a loose organization of self-appointed urban freedom fighters led, more or less, by Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor). The group has targeted an immigration holding center in San Diego, in what they hopes will be the first salvo in a revolution. They need to make an “announcement,” which is where “the Rocketman” comes in. He's Pat, a.k.a. Ghetto Pat (Leonardo DiCaprio), and specializes in weapons, bombmaking, creating a big noise. After the 75 slip into the camp under the cover of darkness, he's tasked with providing the fireworks. It's a display of pageantry designed to complement Perfidia's war-cry mantra: “Free borders, free bodies, free choices and free from fuckin' fear!” You could say the same thing about the sequence itself, which Anderson stages like a spectacle in miniature, complete with a rallying, second-hand rush. We're only 10 minutes in, and already at a full gallop.

	











	Meanwhile, Perfidia needs to neutralize the person in charge, a military colonel named Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn). He's a hardass with a hard-on for power — this is not a colloquialism; Lockjaw is in a priapic state when we meet him — and takes the indignity of being imprisoned in his own prison extremely personally. The gent with the bad alt-right haircut is also a Neo-Nazi who nonetheless recognizes a fellow warrior in Perfidia, and a mixture of contempt and lust envelopes the rat bastard like a shroud. Lockjaw vows that they will meet again, and makes good on his promise. He's one third of a triangle that will involve him, Perfidia and Pat. It ends with a baby, a bank robbery gone bad, and the French 75's leader being put in the Witness Protection Program before flying that particular coop to parts unknown.

	This is merely One Battle After Another's appetizer course, a way of setting the stage for the struggle and the stakes to come. Fast-forward 16 years later and, as the voiceover tells us, “the world has changed very little.” Still, times moves forward. Perdidia remains in the wind. Pat has become an every-stoner named “Bob,” having lived underground in the fictional Northern California town of Baktan Cross and raised his baby in peace for well over a decade. That infant is now a teenager named Willa (Chase Infiniti), practicing her martial-arts moves in a dojo as Steely Dan's “Dirty Work” plays on the soundtrack.


	[A quick aside about the music: Johnny Greenwood's score could not be better suited to PTA's vision of a broken America or the constant forward momentum of the film's pacing, whether he's arranging symphonic bursts of strings or utilizing a single, insistent piano note plunked for maximum tension. These two continue to have the sort of divinely simpatico creative relationship that ranks up there with Spielberg and John Williams, or Hitchcock and Bernard Hermann. And yet, when you see this introduction scene set to the Can't Buy a Thrill track, you're reminded that this is same filmmaker who gave us that pitch-perfect “He Needs Me” cue in Punch Drunk Love and a whole K-Tel compilation's worth of hits to reflect the ever-changing moods of Boogie Nights. It's enough to make you weep. Nobody knows how to utilize a needle-drop better.]

	And Lockjaw? He's trying to gain entry into the rancid elite via a group known as the Christmas Adventurers' Club, made up of millionaire string-pullers yearning for a world of racial purity and those “American-born by gentile,” yadda yadda yadda. First, however, he has to track down Bob and Willa, and tie up loose ends. And blessed with a lot of soldiers and firepower that may be from one of many independent militias or may be from the U.S. government itself — six of one these days — Lockjaw is determined to see his mission through. The character's name is not just highly Pynchonesque but very well-earned, by the way; Penn plays this obsessive man as a walking, talking balled fist, with ramrod posture and a permanent expression of distaste. It's an expert portrait of self-loathing and redirected rage, and a reminder that though the actor has been more selective about taking on screen gigs, he's still a strong contender for GOAT status. Penn knows exactly how to walk the line between caricature and the truthful cracking open of someone determined to stay locked on target. This is best-in-show work.

	











	We've barely even skimmed the surface of this heady mix of father figures and bad dads, underground railroads and war machines, secret societies and state-sanctioned violence. One Battle After Another is truly one stunning, thrumming bit of business after another, blessed with DiCaprio's manic take on paranoid parental guidance, understated supporting turns from Regina Hall and Benicio Del Toro as allies to the cause, and enough detours through the source material to capture the literary giant's vibe. (A trip to the weed-growing convent run by the Sisters of the Brave Beaver comes straight from the text, with near-verbatim exchanges.) There's a serious flexing of chops on display, notably during some cross-cutting between two opposing camps before a raid and two different, equally kinetic car chases. Yet it's never virtuosity for virtuosity's sake. Anderson is intent on telling a story, not blithely showing off. If this ambitious tale of familial bonds and institutional might also offers a rebuke to the idea that the movies are a thing of the past and should just go gently into the night, that's a bonus. It's a giant, fit-to-burst attempt to be as intimate as possible.

	PTA has, of course, tackled T. Pynchon before, and nailed the writer's signature funky absurdism — one part motormouthed Fred Allen, three parts the Furry Freak Brothers — with his 2014 film Inherent Vice. Here, he's using the book as a springboard for what feels like his own fixations and preoccupations, his personal feelings of empathy and outrage. Vineland takes place squarely in Reagan's 1980s, with burnt-out 1960s radicals. Battle is not tied to any particular era, any particular revolution. The filmmaker has both stripped the narrative down and somehow exponentially complicated things by unmooring it from the period — it's set in a timeless, perpetual present that feels uncomfortably like America circa right now. That's why the first half feels like a declaration of war, bustling with a sense that some sort of flip-the-bird action is needed, and the back half makes you sympathize with everyone's frazzled, desperate exhaustion.


	And yet: there's hope in them thar Northern California hills, which brings us back to that aforementioned answer. In its sprawling attempt to partially wrap its arms around the Great-Step-Backward Age we find ourselves in, One Battle After Another shares a slight kinship with another shoot-the-moon auteur work of recent vintage: Eddington. Ari Aster's film stared directly into the abyss and, shuddering, worried about how we could or should fight back. Anderson's humanistic masterpiece of a movie says: You fight it with love. That's the end game. That's how you retain your decency and sanity. That's the only way you protect the future, and change it. That's how you live to battle another day.

Season 3 of Paranormal Prison is upon us and our first victims (oops, sorry — guests) are Five Finger Death Punch bassist and Beardo and Weirdo podcast co-host Chris Kael and Micah Moody, son of the band's singer Ivan Moody.

The two join hosts Josh Bernstein (The Power Hour, Z2) and Katrina Weidman, who you may be familiar with if you've ever watched the paranormal investigative TV show Portals to Hell with Jack Osbourne. Together, they traverse the haunted grounds of the infamous Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, also home to the annual Inkarceration Music & Tattoo Festival.

For the third year, some of the fest's biggest stars explore various areas of the prison, which has a rich history of being haunted. This time, the crew has leveled up, bringing some new spirit-seeking equipment to the investigations.

Here, they make use of the ""dead bell"" and the ""spirit box"" to connect with the other side. While the spirit box picks up some clear vocal communications, the dead bell leaves no room for interpretation — it either rings or it doesn't when prompting unknown souls still wandering the prison with some basic questions. Ring once for yes, two for no!

""There are definitely outside energies,"" Kael says, a firm believer in, for lack of a better words, ghosts.

In the episode, the spirit is absolutely fixed on Kael and, at one point, one of the camera lights dies. Coincidence or some shenanigans from beyond? The spirit box even detects the word ""snake"" and the spirit says ""it's one of you."" Any guesses which one of these four is ""the snake""?

Watch the episode below and find out!

All nine new episodes of Paranormal Prison will air each Wednesday at 3PM ET, exclusively on Loudwire's YouTube channel.

This year's lists of special guest paranormal investigators includes members of Five Finger Death Punch, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Kittie, Acid Bath, Three Days Grace, Attila, Nothing More, Drain and Alpha Wolf.

Inkcarceration Music & Tattoo Festival is held each year at the historic Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield.

Construction began back in 1886 and the prison was operational from 1896 through 1990 and it was also used in a scene in the classic movie, The Shawshank Redemption. While the prison remains open to tourism, the most exciting moment of the year is certainly when the fest rolls into town for a long weekend of rock and metal.

Inkcarceration is one of many of Danny Wimmer Presents' premiere festivals. Since its formation in 2011, DWP has become a leading promoter in heavy music and beyond, building up the U.S. festival circuit that dominates the spring, summer and fall months.

New research suggests that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are incredibly rare, with plate tectonics and CO2 levels playing a crucial role in their development.

In the vast Milky Way, billions of planets may harbor life, but new research presented at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting suggests that alien civilizations capable of communication are likely rare. Led by Dr. Manuel Scherf and Professor Helmut Lammer from the Space Research Institute in Graz, Austria, the study links the scarcity of extraterrestrial civilizations (ETIs) to key factors like plate tectonics and CO2 levels.

Plate tectonics is a fundamental process on Earth, responsible for recycling carbon and regulating the planet's climate over geological time scales. This process allows Earth to maintain a stable atmosphere conducive to life. As tectonic plates move and interact, carbon dioxide is sequestered into the Earth's mantle, which reduces the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. This reduction is essential for stabilizing the global climate over millions of years and making Earth a habitable environment.

For extraterrestrial civilizations to thrive, a planet must exhibit similar tectonic activity. Without this, carbon dioxide may build up in the atmosphere, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that would make the planet inhospitable. On Earth, plate tectonics has been crucial not only for maintaining a livable climate but also for enabling the evolution of intelligent life. As Dr. Scherf points out, the tectonic process is so vital to regulating conditions that “extraterrestrial intelligences—ETIs—in our galaxy are probably pretty rare.”

In the early stages of a planet's development, carbon dioxide plays an important role in supporting a biosphere. It is the raw material for photosynthesis, a process vital to life as we know it. Over time, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere needs to decrease, a change that typically happens due to plate tectonics. Earth's journey from a high-carbon atmosphere with approximately 6% CO2 to the current levels of less than 0.04% took billions of years. This long transformation allowed life to evolve, culminating in the development of complex organisms and, eventually, technological civilization.

For intelligent life to emerge on other planets, a similar sequence of events would need to occur. A stable atmosphere, conducive to life, depends on a planet's ability to regulate CO2 and other gases. Without this process, it is unlikely that the conditions required for the development of advanced technology—such as oxygen levels sufficient for metal smelting—would be met. Scherf highlights this dependency, stating that, “For 10 civilizations to exist at the same time as ours, the average lifetime must be above 10 million years,” indicating that civilizations need stable environments to survive long enough for technology to develop.

The development of intelligent life requires both favorable conditions and vast amounts of time. Earth itself took over 3 billion years to produce complex life forms capable of developing technologies. This long timeline makes the chance of two civilizations developing simultaneously very slim. The likelihood of multiple civilizations thriving at the same time depends heavily on how long each civilization persists. Scherf's research emphasizes that the existence of civilizations is not just about the emergence of life but also about how long a civilization can endure before it becomes extinct, making the window of overlap between two civilizations incredibly narrow.

The study concludes that civilizations capable of advanced technology are probably rare due to this long and complex process. Even if life is common across the galaxy, “the numbers of ETIs are pretty low and depend strongly upon the lifetime of a civilization.” In other words, even if life evolves, the chances of it advancing to the level of technological civilization—and sustaining that advancement—are slim.

Given the rarity of intelligent life, Scherf and Lammer argue that the only way to confirm or deny the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is through ongoing searches, such as those conducted by the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). If SETI fails to detect any signs of alien civilizations, it would lend further credence to the theory that intelligent civilizations are extremely rare. However, if a signal were to be detected, it would be one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in history. Scherf succinctly states, “Although ETIs might be rare there is only one way to really find out and that is by searching for it. If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved as we would know that we are not alone in the universe.”

            When President Donald Trump enters St. George's Hall for the grand finale of his state visit at Windsor Castle Wednesday night, someone he is suing will be seated at the end of the dinner table: Rupert Murdoch.
    


            Murdoch, a familiar face at state dinners in the past, is currently locked in a major legal battle with Trump, who is suing the powerful owner of the Wall Street Journal after it reported on a suggestive birthday letter given to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name. Trump has denied that it's his signature and said at the time of the report that he personally warned Murdoch he'd sue if the newspaper published it.
    


            The Journal did so anyway, and Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit seeking $20 billion in damages and Murdoch's testimony.
    


            Despite that, according to a preview of the dinner given to reporters, Murdoch and his fifth wife Elena will be present at Windsor Castle Wednesday night. They are part of an intimate guest list that includes only about 160 guests, according to royal officials, and was compiled by the Royal Family and the White House.
    


            It is the Royal Family that designates the seating arrangement. Trump will be seated in between King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales, while first lady Melania Trump will be across the table next to Queen Camilla and William, Prince of Wales.
    


            One face who won't be at the dinner: The recently ousted British ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, who was fired by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer days before the state visit after his extensive ties to Epstein were revealed in media reports. Warren Stephens, the US ambassador to the Court of St. James, will be present.
    


            Other attendees include White House officials, British dignitaries and business executives like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Nvidia CEO Jensuen Huang, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy, Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan and Softbank Board Director Rene Haas.
    


            As UK officials seek a favorable trade standing with the US, one of Trump's top officials has a notable seat. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will sit next to Queen Camilla. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his wife are also attending the dinner.
    


            Over 100 staff will serve the meal, with guests seated at a long, ornate table decorated with multiple arrangements of bright flowers in differing sizes. There are approximately 130 candles stretched across the table, which takes an entire week to put together. Each setting has three forks, three knives, a single spoon and five drinking glasses. A mix of English, French and American wine will be served to guests. A perfectly folded napkin completes the lavish table setting.
    


            The menu includes a panna cotta de cresson starter, with parmesan shortbread and a quail egg salad. Guests will then be served organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savory infused jus. Dessert is a vanilla ice cream bombe with a Kentish raspberry sorbet interior, alongside lightly poached Victoria plums.
    


            The royal chef was in contact with the White House chef as they curated the menu, though it's ultimately designed with King Charles in mind, whom officials described as having an “eclectic palate.”

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed lower in choppy trading on Wednesday, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by an expected 25 basis points and Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the weak job market.

The Dow closed higher after meandering during Powell's speech. The TSX ended with a very small gain after trading in and out of the red this afternoon.

The central bank indicated it will steadily cut rates for the rest of the year as policymakers signaled concerns about weakness in the labor market. The Fed projected two more quarter-percentage-point cuts this year.

In a press conference, Powell talked about the rising downside risks of employment compared to inflation, but said inflation risks still need to be assessed and managed.

This rate cut was already priced in by investors, according to data compiled by LSEG.

“Powell tempered some of the initial enthusiasm in the markets for a more aggressive path of monetary easing. He noted the softness in the labor market, but reserves a larger cut for more serious conditions that are not present today,” said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investments.

“The Fed also raised its inflation forecast, highlighting the delicate balance between setting monetary policy to offset a weaker labor market versus bringing inflation lower,” he said.

According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 6.63 points, or 0.10%, to end at 6,600.13 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 73.10 points, or 0.33%, to 22,260.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 262.26 points, or 0.56%, to 46,012.75.

The Fed's decision and outlook will test Wall Street's recent rally, which has been supported by rate-cut expectations and revived enthusiasm around AI-stock-linked trading.

Powell fielded several questions about the Fed's independence from the executive branch.

On Tuesday, White House economic adviser Stephen Miran was sworn in as a Fed Governor and an appeals court rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's attempt to sack Governor Lisa Cook.

Meanwhile, Nvidia weighed on the Nasdaq. Shares fell after a report said China's internet regulator had instructed the country's biggest tech companies to stop buying all of the AI leader's chips.

Workday jumped after a report that activist investor Elliott Management took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider.

Lyft popped on the news that Alphabet's Waymo would launch autonomous cab rides in Nashville next year in collaboration with the ride-hailing firm. Shares in rival Uber fell.

The massive drone attacks on Ukraine in September 2025, and the appearance of a cluster of drones over Polish territory, have highlighted the threat posed by the rapid advancement of autonomous and uncrewed aerial vehicles.

Drones offer militaries around the world a unique advantage. Inexpensive and easy to produce, they have been used in major conflicts, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Read more about the methods that exist to help nations defend against drone incursions.

A young Ukrainian man is set to be deported by Poland back to Ukraine after he caused a security scare by flying a drone over government buildings in Warsaw, according to police.

On Monday, an unidentified drone was spotted flying over a government complex that houses one of Warsaw's presidential residences, as well as offices used by the prime minister and defense minister.

Police ""neutralized"" the drone and arrested two individuals, a 21-year-old Ukrainian man and a 17-year-old Belarusian woman.

Warsaw police spokesman Jacek Wisniewski told AFP news agency that the young man violated Polish aviation law and would be fined, expelled to Ukraine, and banned from the Schengen travel area in Europe for five years.

""Today, he will be handed over to the Ukrainian border guards,"" said Dagmara Bielec, a spokeswoman for the Polish border police.

The Belarusian citizen was questioned by police and released without charge, Wisniewski said.

Poland's air defenses are on high alert after around 20 military drones incursions into Polish airspace last week, which Warsaw alleged was a deliberate Russian provocation.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the first set of US weapons being sent under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) mechanism, paid for by non-US allies, included missiles for Western air defense systems.

""We received more than $2 billion (€1.7 billion) from our partners specifically for PURL. We will receive additional funds for October, I think we will have another $3.5-$3.6 billion,"" he said at a joint press conference with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, who is visiting Kyiv.

""The first two packages of $500 million... will definitely include missiles for Patriot and HIMARS,"" Zelenskyy added, referring to air defense and multiple rocket launcher weapons systems. 

Earlier, Reuters reported that, according to a senior NATO representative in Ukraine, the first batches of US military equipment purchased for Ukraine under the PURL mechanism are ""already flowing.""

Russia's State Duma, the country's lower house of parliament, backed a bill to withdraw from the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture.

According to Russia, the Council of Europe has blocked its participation in the Committee for the Prevention of Torture, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, leaving Moscow unable to fully participate in the committee's monitoring activities.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine over three years ago, Ukrainian investigators have repeatedly accused Russia of torturing and killing prisoners of war in custody.

Denmark announced that it would acquire ""long-range precision weapons"" for the first time, citing the need for deterrence capabilities in light of the threat from Russia.

At a press conference, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the move was ""a paradigm shift in Danish defense policy."" 

She added that Russia would continue to threaten Denmark and Europe ""for years to come,"" so a decision was made to establish ""credible deterrence.""

The acquisition could include missiles and drones capable of hitting targets in enemy territory, said Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen. However, he did not specify how much the government would spend or which weapons it would purchase.

Last week, Denmark announced that it would spend 58 billion Danish Krone (€7.8 billion or $9.2 billion) on European-made air defense systems, the largest arms purchase in the country's history.

Ukraine and the US International Development Finance Corporation announced they would each commit $75 million to a joint investment fund that is part of Kyiv's minerals deal with Washington.

""The US Development Finance Corporation has made a pilot commitment of $75 million, which Ukraine will match,"" Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X.

She added that this joint step launches the fund's practical activity, with an initial focus on projects in energy, infrastructure, and critical minerals. ""Until the end on 2026, we plan to implement three large-scale projects,"" Svyrydenko said.

Meanwhile, the International Development Finance Corporation announced in a statement that the investment would support Ukraine's reconstruction and long-term economic recovery, as well as strengthen US natural resource supply chains.

The first batches of US military equipment purchased for Ukraine under a new financial agreement with allies are already flowing, according to the NATO senior representative in Ukraine.

""Four packages under the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) have already been funded and equipment is already flowing,"" Patrick Turner told Reuters.

Kyiv's foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi confirmed that the US has approved the first military aid packages for Ukraine under a new mechanism.

Last week, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius noted that the US began supplying Ukraine with weapons through the PURL initiative, which is coordinated by NATO.

Under this program, other NATO countries pay the United States for defense systems and munitions stored in US warehouses. These items are then shipped to Ukraine, which has been battling a Russian full-scale invasion since February 2022.

Polish Energy Minister Miliusz Motyka said he had sent a letter to the energy ministers of other EU states calling on those that are still buying Russian energy to end imports by the end of 2026 and offering to help them do so.

This would be ""a clear signal that Europe is capable of acting in solidarity and decisively against Russian aggression,"" he wrote on X.

The Druzhba oil pipeline delivers Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, both of which continue to purchase energy supplies from Russia, despite other EU nations having cut ties following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Earlier, following a conversation with US President Donald Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an initiative to achieve a faster halt to all European oil and gas imports from Russia (see entry below).

Trump recently tied further US sanctions on Russia to European partners imposing high tariffs on Chinese imports and halting purchases of Russian oil.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola announced that the EP would establish a permanent representation in Kyiv to facilitate daily cooperation with Ukraine.

Addressing the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament, Metsola said that she had come to Kyiv to ""further strengthen our cooperation.""

""We are opening a permanent representation of the European Parliament here in Kyiv so that we can be present in Ukraine and work alongside you every day,"" Metsola said.

She also promised that Ukraine would ""never walk alone,"" and that the EU would continue to stand with the country as it recovers and rebuilds when peace comes.

Latvia's State Security Service (VDD) announced that it had arrested a man suspected of spying for Russia.

According to the authorities, the suspect, who is a Latvian citizen, is accused of revealing the locations and security measures of Latvian and allied NATO troops on Latvian territory to his handlers in Moscow.

He is also accused of providing information on the construction of new military facilities and military exercises.

""According to information at VDD's disposal, the male has also shared other information with the Russian intelligence and security service which could be used against the national security interests of Latvia and other Baltic region states,"" the VDD said.

Although the suspect has not been publicly identified, a criminal investigation has been opened and four properties have been searched. He has been detained since late August.

Latvia and its fellow Baltic states have been NATO members since 2004. They are staunch allies of Ukraine in its fight against full-scale Russia's invasion.

Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has said that laboratory tests on biological samples obtained from her husband showed that he had been poisoned.

In a video posted on X, she said that biological material from Navalny had been smuggled abroad in 2024 and examined by two laboratories.

""These labs in two different countries reached the same conclusion: Alexei was killed. More specifically, he was poisoned,"" said Navalnaya.

Navalny died suddenly on 16 February 2024 in a Russian prison beyond the Arctic Circle, leaving the opposition without its most charismatic and popular leader.

Yulia Navalnaya has repeatedly accused the Russian government of killing him, a claim that the Kremlin denies.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia's violation of Polish and Romanian airspace last week was part of a long-running trend of boundary-testing and sabotage by President Vladimir Putin.

""Putin has been testing the limits for a long time,"" Merz told the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, as he was addressing lawmakers as part of the budget week debate. ""He sabotages, he spies, he murders, he tries to unsettle people.""

Merz also warned that Putin was looking to destabilize German society. 

""We will not allow that to happen,"" the chancellor stressed, adding that Germany is strengthening its resilience and defense capabilities for that very reason.

""We must deter our opponents from further aggression and at the same time bring allies and partners closer together,"" Merz said.

The chancellor added that a peace deal in the war in Ukraine cannot come at the expense of Kyiv's political sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""A dictated peace, a peace without freedom, would encourage Putin to seek his next target,"" Merz said.

Germany has been one of Ukraine's strongest supporters since the Russian invasion in 2022. According to Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, the country surpassed the United States last week and is now the biggest supplier of military aid.

The $893 billion defense policy bill that passed the House of Representatives last week would grant the Department of Defense unprecedented new authority to deploy private military contractors to the United States' southern border.

A provision in the legislation, tacked on in a July amendment, for the first time gives the Defense Secretary authority to outsource the agency's work at the border, a proposal that critics warn could prove a bonanza for the shadowy mercenary and private security firms that work with the Pentagon, often with little public transparency. 

The provision was drafted by a lawmaker who has received significant contributions from defense industry giants, including Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon). While the language was included in the final text of the House bill, the Senate has yet to pass a final version, so it's not clear whether the proposal will advance to President Donald Trump's desk.

The push comes as the lines between military operations and immigration enforcement — historically a hazy distinction — become further blurred under Trump. The Trump administration has sent thousands more active-duty troops to aid border operations and established several so-called “national defense areas” along the southern border, granting military personnel new arrest powers from Arizona to Texas, all while deploying the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles to quell resistance.

For the moment, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection, is the agency granted the authority to outsource border operations to private vendors, like the private security firms transporting immigrants around the country and the defense technology companies that sell border surveillance tech. 

The new proposal could further expand the role of private contractors in border operations — this time under the watch of the Defense Department, which has a long history of wasteful, unaccountable spending on private vendors.

Already, the use of private contractors by the Department of Homeland Security to run ICE's deportation machine has invited scrutiny. The private firms profiting from ICE's raids and sprawling detention system  are often shadowy, offering little transparency to the public even as they are accused of misconduct and abuses. 

Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the director of government affairs at the federal watchdog group Project on Government Oversight called the provision “extremely dangerous.”

“It's already bad enough that we're increasing the actual military footprint at the border,” he told The Lever. “If you start to privatize and outsource that, you have even less accountability, less transparency, and less recourse to do anything about it.”

For most of the 20th century, the military's formal role in border enforcement was limited, in part due to a long-standing federal statute that bars the United States military from enforcing domestic laws (a doctrine Trump has been accused of flouting in recent weeks). This began to change in the 1980s with the war on drugs, which offered a pretext for lawmakers to authorize military collaboration with immigration authorities, ostensibly to crack down on drug trafficking.

In the decades since, the U.S. southern border has become ever more militarized. The Department of Defense, through decades-old operations like Joint Task Force North, collaborates directly with immigration authorities. National Guard troops have regularly been deployed to the southern border.

But some provisions in this year's National Defense Authorization Act, the annual must-pass defense spending bill, would further entrench the military's role at the border. And the bill would, for the first time, allow the Department of Defense to outsource its border security work to private contractors. 

The language authorizes the Defense Secretary to enter into contracts in order to “secure the southern land border of the United States,” including for the provision of intelligence analysis, surveillance, and transportation. 

This provision was added to the bill as an amendment in a July committee hearing by Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas), who defended it to fellow lawmakers as a “common sense” cost-saving measure. The military is already involved in all sorts of border operations, Fallon explained, and “many of these roles currently filled by military personnel could be filled by contractors for, here's the key, a fraction of the cost.”

Fallon claimed the Department of Defense had proposed a similar measure under the Biden administration. The agency, he said, estimated that outsourcing its border operations roles — “logistics, monitoring, transportation, data entry, and more” — would save the military hundreds of millions a year. 

Yet despite Fallon's lip service to savings, critics say such a provision would likely be a windfall for the defense industry. 

“It's just another stream of money for companies,” said William Hartung, senior research fellow at the nonprofit Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which analyzes defense policy and spending. Among the firms poised to benefit, he said, are Palantir and Anduril, two defense contractors that work closely with the Department of Homeland Security on border surveillance.

Other defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin already take in hundreds of billions from the Pentagon; the agency paid out an estimated $2.4 trillion to its private vendors between 2020 and 2024, more than half of its discretionary spending. The cash flow has, in turn, created a powerful lobby that is constantly looking to expand opportunities to drain the government's coffers.

Fallon has received tens of thousands in campaign contributions from defense industry firms, including, just this year, thousands from RTX, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics, three of the Pentagon's biggest vendors. 

Fallon's amendment drew some opposition from Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) warned at the hearing that the provision would “grant the Pentagon open-ended authority to hire troops and private military contractors for routine border enforcement,” as well as divert even more federal dollars to border operations amid Trump's historic immigration enforcement spending blitz.

Despite protests from Jacobs and others, the amendment passed and was included in the final bill that passed by the House in a 231-196 vote on Sept. 10, winning the support of 17 Democrats. 

The Senate has not yet passed its own version of the legislation, and recent versions of the bill, Hedtler-Gaudette said, did not include a twin provision. This leaves open the possibility that the proposal could be excised in a final version.

If Fallon's amendment does end up in the final bill, critics worry the provision could open a Pandora's box. 

“It's pretty novel,” said Hedtler-Gaudette of the Project on Government Oversight. The Pentagon has a long history of working with unaccountable defense contractors, particularly overseas, he explained. Now, this could be a situation of “Blackwater on the border,” he said, referencing a private military contractor accused of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, warned that if such a provision were enshrined into law, it might be difficult to roll back.

“Inviting private companies into border security efforts would create a powerful lobby for perpetuating this unprecedented and ever-expanding level of border militarization that we are seeing under this administration,” she said. This would make it “much harder to bring that level back down in the future.”

Other provisions in the House bill would also expand the Pentagon's role in border operations, including one provision that would bolster the Department of Defense's ability to collaborate with agencies like the Department of Homeland Security on “counterterrorism” operations, further entrenching the military in domestic law enforcement operations.

Business Insider Edition 

Since the 2021 coup in Mali, the West African nation and the United States have suffered a strained relationship. Nevertheless, a shared adversary has prompted a renewal of partnership between the two countries.


        The junta-led state of Mali and the United States have, within the last few months, embarked on a campaign to strengthen their military ties.
    


        This unlikely cooperation is a result of the terrorist threats prevalent in the Sahel region and the change in the U.S. administration.
    


        DON'T MISS THIS: Mali draws inspiration from Russia during the Nazi era



        Under America's current president, Donald Trump, both countries have resolved to work together to face a threat they are all too familiar with, despite Mali being ruled by a junta government.
    


        As seen in the Washington Post, U.S sources close to this development revealed that American intelligence has been vital in repelling the advancement of terrorist groups in West Africa.
    


        Mali's military has utilized information from the U.S to conduct strikes against extremist groups around its region.
    


        “The administration is making it clear: We don't believe it is for us to judge how you came into power,” said one of the former U.S. officials, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity.
    


        “The message is … we are here if you are.”
    


        Mali's current administration, led by General Assimi Goïta, took power through successive coups in 2020 and 2021, removing the previous civilian-led government amid growing dissatisfaction and instability.
    


        Mali, like fellow junta states Burkina Faso and Niger, decided after its successful coup to begin ridding itself of any Western influence.
    


        The country wasted no time in expelling military forces belonging to its former colonial ruler, France, noting that the years of military cooperation had done very little to bring stability to the region.
    


        Subsequent to the decision, the country pushed for a stronger relationship with Russia, sidelining most Western states in its affairs, including the United States.
    


        The controversial deployment of Russian paramilitary forces, first through the Wagner Group and now through its successor, the Africa Corps, has supported the army's counterinsurgency operations while eliciting criticism from Western governments and human rights organizations.
    


        However, much like France, the use of Russian forces to assist in combating terrorism has not been as successful as originally envisioned.
    


        The report by The Washington Post showed that last year, more than 10,000 people were killed by extremist organizations in the Sahel region.
    


        Additionally, a study last month revealed how Russian private mercenary (Wagner) activities in Mali brought about deep divisions within the country's army and transitional military administration, raising concerns about Moscow's position in West Africa.
    


        During the tenure of the previous U.S. President, Joe Biden, efforts to democratize the country were unsuccessful.
    


        The administration not only failed to persuade Mali to enact democratic reforms, but it also imposed sanctions on several high-ranking officers for their collaboration with Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group.
    


        Consequently, the relationship between the countries deteriorated.
    


        However, under Donald Trump's administration, discussions of collaboration have emerged, with reported developments regarding intelligence sharing.
    


        In a July meeting with Malian authorities in Bamako, Trump's deputy senior director for counterterrorism, Rudolph Atallah, told local media that the United States intended to back Mali in its fight against extremists if Mali was a cooperative partner.
    


        Officials from both the US and Mali confirmed that Atallah presented a proposal, encompassing intelligence sharing, U.S. equipment, and training, in an effort to foster a partnership with Mali.

        Current U.S. visits to Mali have been well-received, as Malian officials, including Moussa Ag Acharatoumane, a member of Mali's transitional government, have indicated that U.S. officials ""respected our sovereignty"" and have not expressed concerns regarding the country's close relationship with Russia.
    


        “They recognize that we have the same enemy,” he added, referring to the extremists.
    


        Biden “had a more traditional approach to U.S. norms and democracy in this part of the world,” said Franklin Nossiter, the International Crisis Group's Sahel analyst. “With Trump, everything is on the table.”

The Federal Reserve gave investors a lot to chew on Wednesday as the central bank lowered the benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point and indicated two more rate cuts could be made by the year's end.

While this latest decision had only one dissent, newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran, opinions diverge further heading into next year. At the moment, the so-called dot-plot predicts one more quarter-point cut next year. However, some members of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee see a path to three rate reductions in the coming year.

During a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday's decision reflects a desire to keep risks to the economy in check.

""You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut,"" Powell said. He added that a ""very different picture"" of risks has emerged as the labor market has begun to cool off versus the threats on the inflation front.

The central bank had been holding firm on interest rates as inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Powell has expressed concern that tariffs put in place by the Trump administration could led prices to surge.

The Fed chair said companies have been slow to pass costs from the levies on to consumers, but he expects the impact will build ""over the course of the rest of the year and into next year.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that he expects the effects of inflation on goods prices ""to continue to build"" through the rest of this year and into 2026, shortly after the monetary policymaker cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. 

""We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation, and actually the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year,"" Powell said in a press conference.

He added, ""those are not very large effects at this point, and we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into next year.""

CPI rose 2.9% on an annual basis last month, marking the largest gain since January. Since April, inflation has mostly accelerated on a month-to-month basis. 

Asked whether he will leave as chair of the central bank after his term ends in May 2026, Powell said there's ""nothing new"" to say on this topic.

The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Powell, including Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Chris Waller are also under consideration.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said President Donald Trump's tariffs have mainly appeared to be covered by importing companies, meaning consumers haven't seen major price increases tied to the levies yet.

""To the consumer, the passthrough has been pretty small,"" Powell said. ""It's been ... slower and smaller than we thought.""

To be sure, Powell noted that companies have said they eventually plan to pass more of the cost increases onto shoppers, which can result in higher price tags.

— Alex Harring

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he doesn't prefer that the labor market loosen any further.

""The labor market is softening and we don't need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to,"" Powell said.

Powell cited rising unemployment among minorities as one reason for concern.

— Alex Harring

Despite President Donald Trump's demand for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell said there was little support for large rate cuts at this week's meeting.

""There wasn't widespread support at all for a 50 basis point,"" Powell said at his post-meeting news conference. ""I think we've done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and we tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place. That's not at all what I feel certainly now, I feel like our policy has been doing the right thing so far this year.""

The Fed instead opted for a quarter-percentage point reduction.

—Jeff Cox

Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday's interest rate decrease as a way to keep risk in check.

""You can think of this, in a way, as a risk management cut,"" Powell said.

Powell added that there's a ""very different picture"" of risks tied to the labor market and that it is ""really cooling off.""

— Alex Harring

One surprise out of the Federal Reserve's meeting was that only one rate cut is projected in 2026. But opinions on this path are varied with two voting members seeing as many as four cuts. 

A single quarter-point reduction next year is significantly more conservative than current market pricing. Traders are currently pricing in at two to three more rate cuts next year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, updated shortly after the decision.

Recent data has suggested a softening in the labor market, while inflation has risen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said.

""While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen at the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated,"" he said in the post-meeting news conference.

— Michelle Fox

The majority of the Federal Reserve now targeting two further rate cuts this year indicates that the doves on the committee are now in the driver's seat, said Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

""We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory,"" he said.

— Michelle Fox

It is really important that there was just one dissent in the Federal Reserve's rate-cut decision, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

While Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman may each want the job of Federal Reserve chair, they weren't willing to go against the consensus, he said in an interview with CNBC.

""To me, the fact that they are not going to fall over themselves to say 50 basis points now, even if they want more Fed easing, I think that is a very positive sign because it says the Federal Reserve as an institution regards its independence as tremendously important and they are not going to fall over themselves to do what the administration wants right now,"" Kelly said.

— Michelle Fox

The Fed's rate cut will have a trickle-down effect on many types of consumer loans and savings rates.

The federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate at which banks borrow and lend to one another overnight. Although that's not the rate consumers pay, the Fed's move will pave the way for relief from some of the high borrowing costs that have weighed on consumers.

Credit cards, for example, have a variable rate, so there's a direct connection to the Fed's benchmark. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, are more influenced by Treasury yields and the economy so there's less of an immediate impact.

Here's the breakdown of all of the ways the Fed's decision to lower its benchmark could affect your finances in the months ahead.

— Jessica Dickler

In its statement, the Fed acknowledged slight increases in the unemployment rate and a ""shift"" in the balance of risks. Click here to see CNBC's comparison of the September and July statements.

— Alex Harring

The Federal Open Market Committee vote was 11 to 1, with Governor Stephen Miran the sole dissenting vote. At the July meeting Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller had wanted to trim rates by 25 basis points, but the pair appeared satisfied by the reduction the policymakers approved at the September meeting.

All three governors were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has been actively pushing for the central bank to bring down interest rates as quickly as possible.

—Christina Cheddar Berk

Central bank policymakers voted to cut the key interest rate by 0.25%, or 25 basis points, putting the benchmark rate in the range of 4.00% to 4.25%.

With signs of the labor market weakening, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points. However, there are some who want the central bank to go further faster.

The critical questions investors will want to answer are: How far will interest rates fall this year and how divided is the central bank?

The July meeting was notable for its two dissenters, Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. This time around the tension could be heightened even further. President Donald Trump has appointed Stephen Miran to the group. Miran, who replaced Adriana Kugler, has been a Fed critic and he is expected to push for deep cuts.

If the majority opts to ease rates by 25 basis points, it is possible Waller and Bowman will once again dissent. This time, joined by Miran.

In addition, there also could be pressure to keep the benchmark rate steady between 4.25% and 4.50%. That could put two other Federal Open Market Committee members in the opposition. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are seen by some as wanting to keep rates where they are.

— Christina Cheddar Berk

The three major averages were mixed around 1:50 p.m. ET as the Federal Reserve's rate decision loomed.

The S&P 500 was last down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was toting a 210-point gain, or up about 0.5%.

The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 4.045%, up nearly 2 basis points. The rate on the 2-year Treasury was last up 3 basis points at 3.541%.

—Christina Cheddar Berk 

Savers and investors who look for attractive yields on fixed income assets have faired pretty well since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022.

As of the week ended Sept. 12, the annual percentage yield on a five-year certificate of deposit sat at 1.7%, up from 0.5% in March 2022, according to Haver. Yields on savings accounts are also currently higher: 0.4% as of Sept. 12, versus the 0.06% paid in March 2022, per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC.

Rates haven't been so great for borrowers, however, even as the Fed cut by a full point in 2024. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage stood at 6.29% last week, compared with 4.29% in March 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Credit card annual percentage rates also remain high, standing at 20.12% as of a week ago, versus 16.34% in March 2022, according to Bankrate.

—Christina Cheddar Berk, Nick Wells

With the market so sure that a rate cut is coming, some have suggested Wednesday's news could put pressure on stocks. 

""As we look toward month-end, Fed Day may act as a 'sell-the-news' event as investors take time to consider the Fed future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning Retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing,"" JPMorgan's trading desk wrote. 

Others fear the interest rate cut will itself do more harm than good, with longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni saying it's ""throwing gasoline on a fire.""

He's in the camp that believes the economy is still on solid footing even as inflation has remained above the central bank's 2% target and job growth has slowed. 

—Christina Cheddar Berk, Fred Imbert

What do we do now?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The first law of thermodynamics is undergoing a huge renovation.

A team lead by researchers at West Virginia University released a paper detailing how the fundamental law can be applied more broadly than ever before—a finding that has the potential to rewrite the way we understand complex energetic systems. 

The first law of thermodynamics is one of the bedrock laws of physics. Even if you're not gung-ho for physics research, you might have heard the simplified version: energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but it can be converted into different forms.  

“Suppose you heat up a balloon,” said Paul Cassak, lead author on the paper, in a press release. “The first law of thermodynamics tells you how much the balloon expands and how much hotter the gas inside the balloon gets. The key is that the total amount of energy causing the balloon to expand and the gas to get hotter is the same as the amount of heat you put into the balloon.”

This law has been an incredibly helpful tool for physicists since its discovery in the 1850s. But there's a catch—it has historically only worked when things are in or near a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. At its core, that means the temperature of a system is consistent throughout. There aren't big hot and cold spots; it's all basically the same temperature, which means it all has pretty much the same amount of energy. 

And because it's no longer 1850 and we're trying to answer more detailed questions about the universe around us, researchers have long been trying to find a way to apply the first law to systems that are not in equilibrium. While you might not have to reckon with many of these systems in your day-to-day existence, they're very common throughout the universe in such substances as space plasma—found everywhere from the tails of comets to the outer layers of stars.

The breakthrough for this team of researchers came in the form of a lot of complicated math. Basically, the energy conversion in systems that are in thermodynamic equilibrium can be described almost entirely by their density and pressure. 

But the behavior of the energy conversion in more complicated systems is determined by a lot more than just density and pressure. 

“Out of equilibrium, the first law of thermodynamics continues to only describe energy conversion during a process that changes the density and temperature,” Cassak tells Popular Mechanics. “What we discovered is that all of the other quantities describing the gas, liquid, or plasma when it is not in equilibrium are left out of the first law of thermodynamics.”

What the team needed was a way to quantify all of the energy conversion that wasn't described by density and pressure. And they found it. 

To the untrained eye, the solution will probably just look like a dense and confusing group of equations. But to a physicist, the mathematical description of these additional properties looks like opportunity. Potential applications of this work range from chemistry to circuitry and quantum computing to space weather. 

This kind of adjustment in our understanding of the basic building blocks of physics doesn't happen often, so when it does, it has the potential to hugely influence the field and those associated with it. It just goes to show that even centuries-old laws can become new again if we look at them hard enough.

A lot of the stuff is coming out of my pocket,” she said in 2019. “I have to be very financially smart with where I go, where I travel, what makes sense. This is a very expensive sport. I think that a lot of people don't really see that side of it.”

I have had nothing but the most amazing experience and time here at the tournament, and everyone has been so kind and so gracious. The things that I said were not representative of that at all, and I just truly wanted to apologize.

On Wednesday morning, Townsend returned to Instagram with a video message apologizing for her comments amid the growing backlash:""Hi everybody, I just wanted to come on here and apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences—which is one of the things that I love so much about what I do. I have had nothing but the most amazing experience and time here at the tournament, and everyone has been so kind and so gracious. The things that I said were not representative of that at all, and I just truly wanted to apologize.""There is no excuse, there are no words... I will be better. I'm really, really thankful to my country and to be able to represent them and be better. That's all I can do. I just truly apologize.""
