                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boateng scored against USA at the 2010 World Cup FIFA has revisited one of Ghana's most unforgettable World Cup moments by celebrating Kevin-Prince Boateng's only goal at the Mundial for the Black Stars in 2010 on their social media platforms. The global football body posted the clip with the caption, “When Boateng decided to do it himself”, a fitting tribute to the midfielder's moment of individual brilliance in South Africa in 2010. After dispossessing Ricardo Clark in midfield, Boateng surged forward and rifled a low left-footed effort past American goalkeeper Tim Howard to give Ghana an early lead. Although the USA equalized through a Landon Donovan penalty, Ghana restored their advantage in extra time thanks to Asamoah Gyan's powerful strike, sealing a 2-1 victory. Jose Mourinho set for dramatic Benfica return FIFA's decision to spotlight the goal underscores its enduring significance, not only for Ghana but for African football. Boateng's strike is remembered as a moment of courage and flair, setting the tone for one of the Black Stars' greatest nights on the world stage. Fifteen years on, the video continues to spark pride among Ghanaian fans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bayern Munich has stormed out of the gates to kick off the 2025/26 campaign, racking up five wins in five competitive matches. Bayern will kick off the Champions League group stage with a home game against an undefeated challenger from the Premier League, Chelsea. Historically, Bayern and Chelsea have eliminated each other once in the knockout rounds. Chelsea infamously claimed victory in the 2012 final with a penalty kick shootout. Bayern won the 2013 UEFA Super Cup and also beat Chelsea in the 2020 Round of 16 with a dominating 7-1 aggregate scoreline. This game will be lackluster and scoreless in the first half. In the 58th minute, Michael Olise will finally break down his set of defenders and find Luis Díaz on the back post. Bayern's defense will wear out and concede a quick counterattack, ending in Cole Palmer finishing on a wide open shot at the top of the box. In stoppage time, a very debatable penalty will be awarded to Chelsea and Palmer will make it a brace. While you're waiting for the game, why not check out our preview podcast?

The Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) has announced a groundbreaking move to honor the vital role of clubs across the world for nurturing talents with a huge 70% increment in its Club Benefit Programme.

On Tuesday, 16, 2025, FIFA injected a record £260 million ($355 million) into the coffers of football clubs worldwide. This increased payout marks a rise from the £153 million ($209 million) distributed during the 2022 Qatar World Cup cycle.
This amount will for the first time be giving to teams that are releasing players not only for the finals but also for the demanding qualifiers leading to the expanded 48-team 2026 tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
FIFA announces changes to international football calendar With this initiative, FIFA has demonstrated a commitment to globalizing the sport.
Smaller clubs, particularly those outside Europe, often incur losses due to limited compensation, and this adjustment seeks to correct those imbalances.

"Details on the distribution model will be released soon, including eligibility criteria and application deadlines," part of the statement read.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA distributed $209 million amongst 440 clubs for players released to the 32 competing nations. While the $144 million increase in payments in 2026 is a significant 70% increase in payments to clubs, the money has to go a lot further and is not an increase of 70% for clubs releasing players for the finals. In 2026 the number of nations at the finals has increased from 32 to 48 while close to 200 nations will have competed in qualifiers. FIFA has given no indication as to how the money will be split between clubs globally. While being trumpeted by Infantino as “a groundbreaking and globally inclusive edition” of the World Cup, there will still be a huge financial contribution made by the world's biggest clubs to provide their players that will not come close to being met by FIFA's projected record breaking $10 billion+ revenue take. The club compensation agreement was launched in 2010 as part of an agreement between Sepp Blatter's FIFA and the European Club Association. “At ECA we are pleased to have collaborated with FIFA to support the development of this innovative new FIFA Club Benefits Programme. It will ensure even more clubs across the world are rewarded for releasing players and highlights exactly how ECA's Memorandum of Understanding with FIFA supports the ongoing growth of the global club game,” said ECA chairman Nasser Al-Khelaïfi. “Clubs play a pivotal role in the success of national team football and this initiative recognises every element of it, from early development through to release for the most important games. What is currently unknown is whether Al-Khelaifi – who is by far the most compromised executive in global football with his club, confederation, media, national and ECA positions – has actually done a good deal for the clubs or actually just agreed a sweet deal for FIFA and his own ambitions. English clubs received more than those in any other country – $37.7 million – while the $158.9 million total handed over to European teams accounted for 76% of the overall sum distributed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like many others across North America, to double his family's chances in the random draw, he and his wife both signed up for FIFA IDs and entered. Then, via social media, they learned of a little-known rule that has sparked confusion as the Sept. 19 application deadline nears: “entries are limited to only one (1) entry per household.” It was not, however, communicated to media or fans prior to the opening of this first sales phase, the “Visa Presale Draw,” last Wednesday. So it startled some fans whose spouses, parents, children or roommates had applied. The revelation triggered flurries of questions on Reddit, TikTok, Instagram and elsewhere. As millions of applications rolled in — FIFA said there were over 1.5 million in the first 24 hours, and demand was “extraordinary!” — fans worried that their attempts to increase their lottery odds might backfire. “Everybody wants to maximize their opportunities,” said Jason Daley, a longtime fan who runs The World Cup Guide, “but nobody wants to risk their entire application being ignored.” Zara Pira, a fan in Toronto, told her apartment roommate to withdraw an entry because she was worried they'd both be disqualified. “I don't want to get stuck in this limbo and lose my chances.” None of them, though, had seen any guidance from FIFA. Another FIFA spokesperson eventually told Travel Futbol Fan, a content creator who's been explaining World Cup ticket intricacies to his TikTok followers, that households who'd submitted multiple applications didn't need to take any action, but FIFA would only consider the first application. In other cases, specific details — such as credit cards, names and contact information — will be “taken into consideration,” the spokesman said, “and fans should not be concerned.” When asked whether unrelated roommates, such as Pira and her friend, were allowed to apply separately, the spokesman confirmed that they can. Much of this, he admitted, is “complex,” with many “different nuances.” Ticket limits have become commonplace at major sporting events as a means to shut out scalpers and broaden access. At the 2018 men's World Cup, according to FIFA, a given household could buy up to four tickets per match and 28 across the entire tournament. “Household limits have been introduced to ensure fair and equitable ticket access for all fans,” the FIFA spokesman said. For the 2026 World Cup, an expanded 48-team tournament set to be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer, FIFA lowered the cap back to four per household per match, and 40 tickets per household across all 104 games. When asked about options for large families or groups, the FIFA spokesman mentioned hospitality packages. Separately, in theory, families could buy additional tickets, beyond the four-per-match limit, on unauthorized resale sites like StubHub. On FIFA's official resale platform, household limits will apply, though it's unclear how they'll be enforced in later phases. There were people wondering if they could apply twice with the same card. There were people wondering whether sons, daughters and parents could apply, essentially on their behalf. “There's definitely high interest in trying to maximize opportunities,” he said. Initially, he didn't have clear answers to those questions. FIFA's “Visa Presale Draw Explainer” video on YouTube noted that “households can purchase up to four tickets per a match,” but said nothing about a limit on applications. “I think most people are fine with one entry per household,” Daley said. Nick, who was feeling pessimistic about his chances of being selected for a ticket-buying opportunity in this first phase, agreed. With the help of technology, it will weed out bots and other improper entries. It will then select applicants at random and begin notifying some on Sept. 29 that they have an opportunity to purchase tickets on specific dates, in specific time slots, starting Oct. 1. It's unclear how many people will be chosen in this first lottery phase. The second phase will be open to people who entered this first lottery, whether or not they were chosen and purchased tickets, FIFA has said. After the second phase, and after the Dec. 5 World Cup draw places teams into groups and host cities, there will be a third lottery phase, during which ticket buyers can select specific matchups. FIFA will also operate a resale platform where fans can buy tickets on the secondary market at uncapped prices. The four-per-household-per-match and 40-per-household limits will apply across all phases — meaning, for example, that if someone purchases four tickets to a given group-stage match next month, they cannot purchase four more tickets to that same match next spring.

Tim Weah made U.S. soccer history on Tuesday, but it wasn't enough for Marseille, which lost at 10-man Real Madrid, 2-1, in the UEFA Champions League in Spain. Weah, who connected for his first goal in the UCL, followed in the footsteps of his father, former Liberian international George Weah. His father tallied for Paris Saint-Germain in a 2-1 win over Real at Bernabeu in the 1994 UCL semifinals. USMNT teammate Christian Pulisic was the first, recording a goal for A.C. Milan in 2023. It was also the first goal from one of the 11 American players participating in this year's Champions League. “I grew up in Rosedale [Queens, N.Y. neighborhood], playing on a small turf pitch. Coming here was definitely a dream come true. "I grew up in Rosedale, playing on a small turf pitch so coming [to the Bernabéu] was a dream come true. French international Kylian Mbappe converted a pair of penalty kicks for the Spanish side in its comeback. Real Madrid played the final 18 minutes of the match with 10 men after Dan Carvajal was sent off after headbutting Marseille goalkeeper Gerónimo Rulli.
