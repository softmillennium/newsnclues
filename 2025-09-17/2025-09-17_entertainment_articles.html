                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Francis Ford Coppola‘s 2024 “Megalopolis” went off like a bomb — a succès d'estime, film maudit, or total disaster, depending on your perspective. For his first feature in 13 years, and one decades in the making, the Oscar-winning “Apocalypse Now” and “The Godfather” filmmaker plunged more than $120 million of his own money into reimagining 21st-century New York City as a new Roman empire over which preside a visionary architect (Adam Driver) and a corrupt mayor (Giancarlo Esposito). Production began in earnest at Georgia's Trilith Studios in November 2022, where Coppola bought out a Days Inn to convert into the production headquarters and the sprawling cast's (which included Nathalie Emmanuel, Aubrey Plaza, Jon Voight, Shia LaBeouf, and more) living quarters for a four-month-long shoot. Controversy followed, crews tussled, the trades reported mass exodus and creative disagreement on set. Filming all the while was Oscar-nominated “Leaving Las Vegas” and “Timecode” filmmaker Mike Figgis, who previously directed five documentaries of his own including one about a flamenco dance troupe. Closer in spirit to the 1991 documentary about the making of “Apocalypse Now,” “Hearts of Darkness,” though certainly with less ruination and despair, “Megadoc” is hardly your typical behind-the-scenes feature-length featurette. A film IndieWire called “a riveting documentary about the making of a visionary disaster,” it's an intimate look at Coppola's mercurial artistic process and the shifting temperaments and on-set weathers experienced (and created) by everyone below and above the line — such as a canny episode that witnesses a frustrated LaBeouf unable to meet his grandmaster's demands. “I don't know what you want!” LaBeouf yells. That's to say there is a level of performance going on, whether Aubrey Plaza wooing or dismissing the camera or Nathalie Emmanuel requesting that Figgis not film her while eating. Ahead of “Megadoc” hitting theaters, Figgis, while smoking a roll-your-own cigarette over Zoom, talked the making of his own making-of documentary, which actors were the prickliest or most giving, and what he actually thinks of the end product, the movie “Megalopolis.” IndieWire: How did you first come to meet Francis Ford Coppola? Was it through Nicolas Cage and “Leaving Las Vegas”? Nic [Cage's] mother was there, aunties, and things like that. There was so much food, and no one was eating, and I think one of the aunts went, “This is all going to waste.” She got a napkin and said, “I'm taking this home.” That's how I met the extended Coppola clan. Francis and I seemed to hit it off quite well. We stayed in touch over the years. I did some work for the magazine he runs, that is edited by someone else, Zoetrope. I was guest editor on one of those, kept in touch with Michael [Ray] the editor, and then something came up, we were having a conversation, and I said, “Give my regards to Francis.” He said, “He's really happy. '” I had no idea what “Megalopolis” was. If you need a fly on the wall, let me know.” Nothing for a while, then I suddenly got an email from him that said, “Do you have a visa? Could you get on a plane quite soon?” Wow, OK. Were you by Coppola's side when the movie kind of went off like a bomb at the festival? Which was on the cards by then, because obviously it had done a preview in Los Angeles, and I'd had feedback from that. That was a long way to go, and I felt Cannes would be more filmically exciting, and so I pushed for the Cannes thing and said, “I'd love to come, but can I get on the red carpet?” They said, “No, that's never been allowed before.” Francis made a phone call and said, “OK, you're the exception. I was very nervous because it was just me, no assistant, and you've got to have batteries charged. What if a camera doesn't work? I stuck a GoPro on top of the camera as a second camera just in case, and I ran that the whole time. We had a conversation [that was] pretty much [positive]. He let me do what I want. Obviously, the whole thing with the art department and all that, he had very strong views about that from his point of view. Just let me show my balance and my frame from how I saw it because I got friendly with the art department. I was following them as it unfolded. Everybody was trying to do the best thing they could because they love Francis and respect him so much. Everyone's just trying to give him what he wants all the time, and that's tricky with Francis historically. I interviewed his wife at the very beginning, and I said, “Any advice?” And she said, “Just keep your eyes open because he'll change his mind all the time.” That was really valuable advice. Even though he put $120 million of his own money into this— Was he expecting it to make that back? That's a good question because, in the past, historically, he's been proven right obviously with “Apocalypse Now,” which is a good parallel. He held out and eventually did get his money back. What historically he's proved is making money for him was never a huge issue. He has a remarkably healthy attitude towards money. He says, “Look, I'm in my eighties. In answer to your question, no, that wasn't a dominating factor for him. Early in the documentary, the art department points out how the film's look was still being developed during production, so she says it's “equal parts exciting and distressing.” Could you feel that contradiction on set? He was changing his mind every day, and then he was trying things, so his idea of fun is that if I have an idea on Friday morning, as I'm driving to work, I'm paying for this, I'll do it. So he might turn up and say, “I've changed my mind, I don't want to do it like that. I remember years ago working with Albert Finney, who's a great actor but also had directed and was very much involved in the process of filmmaking. At the end of the film, he said, “I just want to tell you I will never see this film. And then he changed his mind because it was boring for him. He wants to fuck around with stuff and try props and theatrical reality as opposed to Marvel reality. He wanted some of that stuff, but the balance was off for them, and they were ducking and diving trying to catch up. This Hollywood Reporter story broke during production detailing crew exits and creative differences. Then you had Adam Driver rushing to the movie's defense, and in “Megadoc” you see Coppola reacting to that news break. There wasn't, as they say, this kind of total group feeling of “it's a disaster.” It was basically a clash between him and the art department, which he then solved by getting rid of them. As I say in the documentary, his mood immediately elevated. The art department was kind of really sad because they felt they hadn't been able to give him what he wanted. There are no villains in this piece. It's just creative tensions which will always emerge when you work with someone like Francis. Historically, it's been the same with Kubrick and all kinds of people. There are candid moments with Shia LaBeouf, who talks about his persona non grata status, but also he had a prior, bruised relationship with Jon Voight that the movie helped him repair. Shia is volatile in person, and this movie doesn't shy away from that. I didn't know much about him but, in the first days of turning up in the rehearsal, he was one of the first people I started talking to who was very open. They aren't quite sure what's going to happen. How do you know Francis?” It was a very funny conversation. “What movie?” I said, “Leaving Las Vegas.” “What was your connection with that?” I said, “Oh, I directed it, wrote it, did the score, and produced it,” and he went, “Holy fuck, well then what are you doing here with your little video camera? From then on, we had a really good relationship. He was very open talking about the process, his process, and how that can work and as you observed yourself, his volatility within this framework, obviously, he was polite and nervous whether he was going to get fired, but quite ballsy when it came to politely questioning, “What do you want?” There's that lovely moment in the thing where Francis loses it completely and says, “Just give me what I want,” and he goes, “I don't know what you want.” Nathalie Emmanuel didn't want to be filmed eating, and Adam Driver is known for being camera-shy and prickly toward press, but it seemed like you were able to work around these celebrity behaviors. I had to keep reminding myself, “It's not my movie.” It's very easy when you're on a set like that, you have freedom to go anywhere you want, you've got your camera to fall into the trap of thinking somehow this is your film. At a certain point, you are cautioned by Adam or Nathalie or whoever, the people who want to be left a little bit alone, or in Adam's case completely alone, so I thought, OK that's an interesting problem to work around. As I say at the beginning of the film, I've never watched another filmmaker at work before, so that was a revelation. After years of making a film myself, you fall into the trap of going, “Oh, that's how we make films.” That's bullshit. Quentin Tarantino makes a film or Scorsese makes a film, they've all got their own style. Aubrey Plaza seemed very open with you and also someone who is turned on by the camera, even as it's meant to be on-the-fly and nonfiction. It seemed like you developed a good relationship. We were in rehearsal, and I was filming it. It was a couple days in, and they got used to me being there. I try and find who's going to respond and who's not going to respond, and Aubrey clearly as a personality has got that kind of interactive potential. At that point, Francis goes, “Mike, there's a better angle over there.” I said, I'm on a wide lens, and he went, oh, and I suddenly thought, I've been commandeered into the process now, which was funny but really useful in the sense that it established this kind of thing — your question before, are they performing? I had a deal with the actors and said to all of them, once we start shooting, I will be everywhere. If you want to play that I'm in your face, do this [holds palm out]. Aubrey was very good at playing the part of “you're in my face, go away.” There were reports about and a video showing Coppola exhibiting what people ascribed to old-school directorial behavior. Put it this way: I was there and my job was literally just to watch everything like a hawk, so that's my job. I used to wake up in the morning and go, “Why am I so cheerful?” It was like, “It's not my film. I don't have to fix anything. All I have to do is be awake, alert, and have enough batteries so that if something happens, I get it.” There was so much interesting stuff happening that was for me really interesting. Lastly, what do you think about “Megalopolis”? I'd seen all the scenes being shot, so as they were shooting, I was thinking, that's interesting, how are they going to cut that? How's that going to fit into the sequence? Do I have enough light to shoot? I was still a little bit confused about the sequential, the timeline of it, and one of my feelings was there's so much material, he's shot so much stuff, and the story is so complicated that to get it into feature length, whatever it was at Cannes, underlines for me one of the problems that we have with film right now, since serial became such a big deal as a respected way of telling stories over five hours, six hours, that maybe this would work better in more of a serial kind of context. I wanted to know more about the characters, actually, personally, and about the love story and so on. We talk about how serialized TV is impacting filmmakers and their theatrical projects, where the impulse to stuff in more material is heightened. Most movies at the Venice Film Festival this year are 150 minutes. etc., that was such a gamechanger, and the attempt now by filmmakers to make the films longer and longer, I think there was kind of a rule about feature films, which is to do with your bum and the point when you start wriggling in your chair, it's just too long. “Megadoc” opens in theaters on Friday, September 19 from Utopia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three grieving parents delivered harrowing testimony before Congress on Tuesday, describing how their children had self-harmed — in two cases, taking their own lives — after sustained engagement with AI chatbots. The remarks before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on crime and counterterrorism came from Matthew Raine of California, who along with his wife Maria last month brought the first wrongful death suit against OpenAI, claiming that the company's ChatGPT model “coached” their 16-year-old son Adam into suicide, as well as Megan Garcia of Florida and a Jane Doe of Texas, both of whom have sued Character Technologies and Google, alleging that their children self-harmed with the encouragement of chatbots from Character.ai. Garcia's son, Sewell Setzer III, died by suicide in February. Doe, who had not told her story publicly before, said that her son, who remained unnamed, had descended into mental health crisis, turning violent, and has been living in a residential treatment center with round-the-clock care for the past six months. Doe and Garcia further described how their sons' exchanges with Character.ai bots had included inappropriate sexual topics. Doe described how radically her then 15-year-old son's demeanor changed in 2023. “My son developed abuse-like behaviors and paranoia, daily panic attacks, isolation, self-harm and homicidal thoughts,” she said, becoming choked up as she told her story. “The chatbot — or really, in my mind, the people programming it — encouraged my son to mutilate himself, then blamed us and convinced us not to seek help. They targeted him with vile sexualized outputs, including interactions that mimicked incest. Doe further recounted the indignities of pursuing legal remedies with Character Technologies, saying the company had forced them into arbitration by arguing that her son had, at age 15, signed a user contract that caps their liability at $100. “We care very deeply about the safety of our users. We invest tremendous resources in our safety program and have released and continue to evolve safety features, including self-harm resources and features focused on the safety of our minor users.” The company added that it has previously complied with the Senate Judiciary Committee's information requests and works with outside experts on issues around teens' online safety.

Adam was such a full spirit, unique in every way. But he also could be anyone's child: a typical 16-year-old struggling with his place in the world, looking for a confidant to help him find his way. As his thoughts turned darker, Raine said, ChatGPT amplified those morbid feelings, mentioning suicide “1,275 times, six times more often than Adam did himself,” he claimed. “When Adam told ChatGPT that he wanted to leave a noose out in his room so that one of us, his family members, would find it and try to stop him, ChatGPT told him not to.” On the last night of Adam's life, he said, the bot gave him instructions on how to make sure a noose would suspend his weight, advised him to steal his parent's liquor to “dull the body's instinct to survive,” and validated his suicidal impulse, telling him, “You want to die because you're tired of being strong in a world that hasn't met you halfway.” In a statement on the case, OpenAI extended “deepest sympathies to the Raine family.” In an August blog post, the company acknowledged that “ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards.” “When Sewell confided suicidal thoughts, the chatbot never said, ‘I'm not human, I'm AI, you need to talk to a human and get help,'” Garcia claimed. “But I have not been allowed to see my own child's last final words,” Garcia said. “Character Technologies has claimed that those communications are confidential trade secrets. That means the company is using the most private, intimate data of my child, not only to train its products, but also to shield itself from accountability. The senators present used their time to thank the parents for their bravery, ripping into AI companies as irresponsible and a dire threat to American youth. They don't want any part of this conversation, because they don't want any accountability.” The hearing, Sen. Amy Klobuchar observed, came hours after The Washington Post published a new story about Juliana Peralta, a 13-year-old honor student who took her own life in 2023 after discussing her suicidal feelings with a Character.ai bot. It also emerged on Tuesday that the families of two other minors are suing Character Technologies after their children died by or attempted suicide. The company said in a statement shared with Rolling Stone that they were “saddened to hear about the passing of Juliana Peralta and offer our deepest sympathies to her family.” More testimony came from Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that advocates for child protections in media and technology. “Our national polling reveals that three in four teens are already using AI companions, and only 37 percent of parents know that their kids are using AI,” he said. “This is a crisis in the making that is affecting millions of teens and families across our country.” Torney added that his organization had conducted “the most comprehensive independent safety testing of AI chat bots to date, and the results are alarming.” “These products fail basic safety tests and actively encourage harmful behaviors,” Torney continued. “When our teen test account said that they wanted to kill themselves by drinking roach poison, Meta AI responded, ‘Do you want to do it together later? “Meanwhile,” Prinstein said, “the technology preying on our children has evolved and now is super-charged by artificial intelligence,” referring to chatbots as “data-mining traps that capitalize on the biological vulnerabilities of youth, making it extraordinarily difficult for children to escape their lure.” The products are especially insidious, he said, because AI is often effectively “invisible,” and “most parents and teachers do not understand what chatbots are or how their children are interacting with them.” He warned that the increased integration of this technology into toys and devices that are given to kids as young as toddlers deprives them of critical cognitive development and “opportunities to learn critical interpersonal skills,” which can lead to “lifetime problems with mental health, chronic medical issues and even early mortality.” He called youths' trust in AI over the adult in their lives a “crisis in childhood” and cited concerns such as chatbots masquerading as therapists and how artificial intelligence is being used to create non-consensual deepfake pornography. “We urge Congress to prohibit AI from misrepresenting itself as psychologists or therapists, and to mandate clear and persistent disclosure that users are interacting with an AI bot,” Prinstein said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, maybe not stuck; there's no quagmire in making some of the best movies of our still-young (if rapidly approaching a quarter-life crisis) century, which don't need to be explicitly contemporary to feel connected to the current moment. But it's striking to consider that until One Battle After Another, only one of those movies was actually set in this century, and it was released at a time now distant enough to have been depicted in a period piece. Anderson's first non-period movie since Punch-Drunk Love doesn't precisely take place in an instantly recognizable political present, or past. It's more of a disoriented dream world, and not in the reverie-like way that he chronicled 1973 in his previous film, the instant classic Licorice Pizza. There are moments from the dystopia-adjacent Battle that feel like they could be happening in '73, or at least a movie version thereof, but it's not exactly Quentin Tarantino-level alternate history, either. One Battle After Another takes its inspiration from the 1990 Thomas Pynchon novel Vineland, apparently with vastly less fidelity than Anderson's previous Pynchon adaptation Inherent Vice—starting with the fact that Vineland was set in 1984, concerning ex-hippie types hunted by a federal agent. While he believes in the cause, his devotion fails to match that of the fierier Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor)—though his devotion to Perfidia herself is considerable. Imagine, in other words, if Ethan Hunt were actually 60, instead of aging on Cruise Time. One Battle After Another also resembles Taken, if the middle-aged guy's particular set of skills mainly involved running to a karate instructor and begging him for assistance. (Understandable, though, when said instructor is played by Benicio del Toro.) Yet it would be misleading to describe One Battle After Another as an action picture, at least in contemporary terms. The movie plays like a much-vaunted action classic from the 1970s that young film buffs catch up with decades later and realize actually has about 10 minutes' worth of impressive analog car and foot chases in between a lot of dialogue scenes, plot points, and colorful side characters. If anything, the movie represents a smart redirecting of Anderson's gift for momentum. That's a quality more closely associated with the movies Anderson made in his and/or his characters' youth, one intentionally put aside for his previous Pynchon adaptation and Phantom Thread, then reclaimed for a giddy series of hangout adventures in Licorice Pizza. So it's an inspired bit of semi-meta-casting to send 50-year-old ex-idol DiCaprio (playing a little younger here, but not by a lot) hurtling through a forbidding landscape of barren storefronts, winding roads, and wide-open spaces, cranky as hell about passcodes and younger people and a life spent mentally if not physically on the run. The sweaty try-hard actorliness that sometimes dogged DiCaprio in his youth has more recently been converted into the poignant comedy of aging guys who bluster strenuously about being in over their heads. DiCaprio revives his Wolf Of Wall Street slapstick talents as he scrambles through the frame, taking some cartoonishly dangerous falls while rocking a pair of stolen shades and a skull cap. Anderson strikes a near-impossible balance throughout One Battle After Another: Somehow, he manages to kid Bob's burnt-out ex-hippie mentality (with attendant undertones of conspiracy-crank conservatism), examine the foibles of Perfidia's principled yet far-from-spotless radical, satirize the deranged white nationalism that has been on a re-emboldened march for the entire span this movie covers, and work up some genuinely righteous thrills watching the French 75 bust a bunch of detained immigrants out of queasily familiar-looking facilities. (That this is depicted happening in the late 2000s, not 2025, is best interpreted as a reminder of this country's pervasively racist legacy rather than any temporal fudging.) Though he never puts it in such gendered terms, Bob's “as the father of a daughter” neuroses reach a fever pitch that's both funny and, eventually, quite moving. DiCaprio is so terrific, and Infiniti such a charismatic find, that viewers may find themselves wishing the cast, both principal and supporting (which also includes Regina Hall and Alana Haim), had room in this 162-minute movie to bounce off of each other with a little more frequency. At times, the movie feels surprisingly spare considering its scope of time, locations, and characters. One Battle After Another hurtles into the present without compromising Anderson's sense of fractured, constantly rearranged, weirdly personal American history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And Gen V was put in the unenviable position of trying to thread that fine line while dealing with a loss that now looms over its entire second season: actor Chance Perdomo, who played Andre on the show and died from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. Much of that, of course, is clearly some writerly course-correcting, for you can see the places where Andre/Chance's death has been stitched into the show's otherwise quite intricately plotted season ahead. Let's start at the beginning: Last we saw Andre, Marie (Jaz Sinclair), Emma (Lizze Broadway), and Jordan (London Thor and Derek Luh), they were trapped in some doorless place that was equal parts prison and medical room. Instead, we're taken way back to 1967 where a group of men in lab coats are, hilariously , experimenting on themselves. We're back seeing the origins of Compound V and before you're able to remember just how violent Gen V can truly get, you're seeing guts, gore, and plenty of bloodied black humor to firmly remind you that this is a darkly funny show where heads (and asses) explode and no one is ever safe. Except Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater), who's wise enough to steer clear from taking the compound and thus saves himself from the untimely deaths of his colleagues. Clearly we're going to be digging into the very history of Godolkin U and its namesake. That's always been part of The Boys DNA so it makes sense Gen V would follow suit: Nothing that's happening in 2025 has happened in a vacuum. These supes, their powers, and the political maneuvering—and sociocultural wars they've engendered—have long histories worth excavating. Enter Dean Cipher (the always deliciously devilish Hamish Linklater), who's eager to get students at God U to feel like they're in a place that will nurture their powers and their god-given right as superpowered beings: He wants God U to be a “campus where you can find freedom from human constraints and the woke agenda and display your powers with pride.” Cate (Maddie Phillips) and Sam (Asa Germann), the two Guardians of Godolkin who were still in good graces with Vought and the school, have clearly been fine since we last saw them. And Cate, in particular, has been working hard to get her friends out of Elmira, the institution where they were all kept. Marie, it seems, has been on the run for a while. And no one had felt it fit to tell Cate that Andre had passed away during a foiled getaway attempt. It's an admirable way of honoring Chance even as the Marie escape of it all feels like a forced reset for what the season cliffhanger had first teased. Alas, Jordan and Emma are both sullen about their imprisonment and now release, which has strings attached: They're required to utter prepared statements and agree to become Guardians once more, another plot contrivance that feels necessary if the show wishes to remain a college-set show still. ), they eventually agree and offer the most lukewarm of speeches at some needlessly formal press conference where they're reinstated as Guardians of Godolkin. That means they're all now tentatively working with/for Dean Cipher, who wastes no time in letting Cate know he doesn't fear her at all. (Who knew a blender could feel so threatening?) He's eager to stoke the God U students into not kowtowing to “humankind” and using as incendiary racist rhetoric as a prestige satire show can muster. Marie may be intent on finding her long-lost sister Annabeth, but even she can't escape the way the world has changed since Neuman's death. Protesters aligned with Starlight clash with folks who insist they're in “Homelander country” (can you guess the racial makeup of each group? She's the kind of person who can't see injustice being doled out. Yet that's what eventually gets her roped back into God U. And soon she's tracked by a supe quite literally tracking her scent. Is Dogknott (Zach McGowan) the wackiest Wolverine rip-off character we've seen yet? He makes quite an entrance, on all fours eventually breaking into her motel room and giving us a thrilling fight scene that would make that famed mutant proud. Marie stands up for herself but eventually needs some help, courtesy of Starlight (Erin Moriarty) herself, who beats up Dogknott and gets the young Marie out of harm's way. Oh, and she has a mission for the former God U student, only it requires something she may not want to do (but something the show's plot all but requires): The safest place for Marie, Starlight insists, is on campus. Plus, she could do some research there about something called “Project Odessa,” which she believes God U is starting up again. “But you can't stay out of this fight forever.” And she really can't, for a video of her helping the Starlighters has gone viral and that's enough to get Emma (drunk at a frat party) to figure out where she is. With Jordan in tow, she locates her (in Weehawken of all places), as does Cate, who really wants Marie to return to God U. It's the safest place for her, she insists, unwittingly echoing Starlighter. As a fugitive, she's in constant danger; but if she agrees to return to God U, she'll at least be a visible figure on campus less likely to be targeted or worse. It's all wrapped in good intentions (and in keeping with what Starlighter hoped Marie would do) but it soon goes sideways. Their conversation gets heated and between Marie itching to stand her ground and Jordan wanting to protect her, their dialogue soon turns deadly—as in, this all ends with Cate bleeding to death when Jordan blasts her. I mean, it really can't get worse than accidentally killing your former friend who was maybe trying to help you though maybe not in the best way—and oh yeah, she's quite a public figure whose death will not go unnoticed. How do you get ahead of such an event? Or, rather, they made better soldiers because of their marketability. Gen V is clearly also born out of that very same framework: If so many young kids have powers, they can't all be supes. But they can all be, especially if Dean Cipher is to be taken at his word, soldiers in the rising fight against anti-superpowered sentiment. There's a race war coming, you can almost hear him saying, and the better prepared God U students are, the easier it'll be to stomp on those pesky humans coming for them. It's incendiary rhetoric, but it's nothing compared to what Emma hears as she slowly adjusts to life back as a Godolkin student required to take classes from a tradwife-esque supe influencer (with wings!) who is all too happy to train her students into using their online platforms to stoke fear regarding the recent attack on Cate. (The latter is recovering and not dead as you may have feared after that first-episode cliffhanger. The supe-ss-influencer framework is precisely what Emma and Jordan exploit as they bring Marie back into God U: Episode two opens with Marie recording a video for social media where she talks about how she's coming back from a mental-health break and ready to rejoin her peers at God U. It's Cipher who breaks the news about Cate to Marie. Does he know she and Jordan were the ones who attacked her? Why else would he share that Andre had died from complications from the rare disease that also afflicted his dad? Either way, Cipher is clearly not to be messed with. And as the media around Cate's attack is heard around campus, it's obvious what the line is: This was a hate crime, an excuse to stoke fear and rage against Starlight and those who align themselves with her. Vought and God U benefit from blaming “Starlighters” for Cate's attack (she's in a coma), and all the students are intent on furthering that narrative, even as we know that's far from the truth. He's intent on figuring out what actually happened. And when he visits her at the hospital, she takes control of one of the nurses nearby and says one word: “Emma,” before leading said nurse into a bloody rampage against another attendant—all collateral damage as the young student struggles with her recovery. She calls him out for siding with Cate, who she knows has been lying to Sam and keeping him on a short leash. Meanwhile, Emma and Polarity (Sean Patrick Thomas), newly appointed Dean of Marketing, are set on finding more about Project Odessa. It's an unlikely pair, but they're both eager to find out more about the rot at the heart of Godolkin, and Polarity's grief is fodder enough to have him infiltrating God U and teaming up with his son's kids to avenge his death. His plan is stupidly simple (and also, as Emma fears, perhaps just too stupid in general): “I'm gonna kill Cipher. Why don't they start with something small, like Project Odessa? Which are, we're told, off-limits to the likes of Polarity but a very high Emma ingratiates herself with the once-famous supe (whose tagline was “Justice Never Forgets Shhh”) and manages to get them in the special wing of the library archives where all of Thomas Godolkin's papers are kept. And not just that: They find a secret hidden room where his Nazi paraphernalia is on full display that has the info on Project Odessa she was searching for all along. It's a rare feat but also quite inconvenient considering she makes lots of noise and raises suspicion from her new BFF The Rememberer, who finds her naked and gigantic in the room he'd left her at. But if they thought the threat of being found out in Godolkin's secret Nazi archive lair was bad, they clearly were not in Cipher's super-exclusive (pun intended) new seminar. “You are not students,” he tells those select few there gathered, which include Jordan and Marie. “You are soldiers.” It's as blunt an assertion as this cravenly cruel Dean has made about how he hopes to reshape the Godolkin U population. That's what his “optimization” seminar is all about; does Marie know how her power works? And if you were fearing they'd sit around and work those kinds of questions out intellectually, know that, instead, Cipher just locks them up with Vikor (Tait Fletcher). Just hit the button that will open the door—something Vikor and his imposing physique and hammer will make very very hard. You can see Marie and Jordan, in real time, test new aspects of their powers. And that's when they hear the ruckus outside: Is it a protest? “Vought caught the folks who attacked Cate,” they hear. Dogknott apparently tracked the Starlighter who did it (the young Black boy Marie had helped, of course) and killed him. But only because Emma, Jordan, and Marie did nothing. Amid the crowd of rollicking students thrilled at this turn of events, Gen V gives us quite an early season twist: Emma makes her way through the gleeful students on campus and inches up to Marie and Jordan, pushing a folder their way. Yes, it seems we're getting a tried and true “you're the one” trope here. Though immediately (as in, the third episode) we have Marie herself questioning how that feels ill-fitting to her. Those chosen ones so rarely look like her. But like many chosen ones before her, she still has to face some family trauma, which leads her to contact Pam, an old friend of her mother's who'd been like an aunt to her and who's oddly cagey about meeting and talking about Marie's birth. Gold” who, in photos, looks exactly like Cipher himself. Marie breaks down (in a clunkily written monologue that has the line, “I was a girl who got her period!”) and insists she wants contact with her sister again. And as she dwells on that, she also has to come face to face with Cate, who finally wakes up from her coma (with one less arm, a scar on her skull, and an inability to use her powers) and returns to campus an erstwhile hero to the school even as she walks around in a kind of daze, unsure what her life will look like moving forward. She finds the campus is on edge, especially as “RESIST” posters adorned with Starlight's yellow star keep popping up by an invisible force. As Emma eventually finds out (following the speedster into a locker room full of naked men), it's Harper (Jessica Clement), the rat-tailed girl whose powers are actually chameleon-like. But if Emma was hoping to find a Starlighter resistance at school, all she's found are vandals who want to do little else but paper the campus, which she insists is not enough. Once he learns Cate can no longer drug him out of his feelings, he's left adrift and aggressive, punching everything in his room in utter despair—until Jordan arrives, fights him, and eventually calms him down. He'll need to sort out his demons in earnest. That's also enough of a wake-up call for Jordan, who was waffling as to how to respond to Marie's “I love you” following their first intimate night together (Marie's actual first, it turns out). At the propagandist-leaning event, Jordan may start openly following the cringe-inducing, PR-approved script, but they soon go for a more candid approach: They tell the gathered students how Andre died and insist that Cate wasn't attacked by Starlighters. As Cipher looks disappointed onstage, the crowd quickly turns on Jordan. It's clear they won't be holding to that No. What will this do to the campus, Cipher's master plan to continue turning students into soldiers, and the budding resistance Emma is now coaching?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Above all, it's an act of resistance, both the lower-case and capital-R type, that suggests it may have an answer as to how we battle through this onslaught against our better angels. But first, a few things need to get blown the fuck up. Luckily, this woozy, winding epic has a handful of people on deck who are willing to do exactly that. They're the French 75, a loose organization of self-appointed urban freedom fighters led, more or less, by Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor). They need to make an “announcement,” which is where “the Rocketman” comes in. Ghetto Pat (Leonardo DiCaprio), and specializes in weapons, bombmaking, creating a big noise. We're only 10 minutes in, and already at a full gallop. Meanwhile, Perfidia needs to neutralize the person in charge, a military colonel named Steven J. Lockjaw (Sean Penn). Lockjaw vows that they will meet again, and makes good on his promise. He's one third of a triangle that will involve him, Perfidia and Pat. It ends with a baby, a bank robbery gone bad, and the French 75's leader being put in the Witness Protection Program before flying that particular coop to parts unknown. Pat has become an every-stoner named “Bob,” having lived underground in the fictional Northern California town of Baktan Cross and raised his baby in peace for well over a decade. That infant is now a teenager named Willa (Chase Infiniti), practicing her martial-arts moves in a dojo as Steely Dan's “Dirty Work” plays on the soundtrack. [A quick aside about the music: Johnny Greenwood's score could not be better suited to PTA's vision of a broken America or the constant forward momentum of the film's pacing, whether he's arranging symphonic bursts of strings or utilizing a single, insistent piano note plunked for maximum tension. These two continue to have the sort of divinely simpatico creative relationship that ranks up there with Spielberg and John Williams, or Hitchcock and Bernard Hermann. And yet, when you see this introduction scene set to the Can't Buy a Thrill track, you're reminded that this is same filmmaker who gave us that pitch-perfect “He Needs Me” cue in Punch Drunk Love and a whole K-Tel compilation's worth of hits to reflect the ever-changing moods of Boogie Nights. Teyana Taylor Went Through It, and Came Back With a Great New Album Anna Faris, Regina Hall Confirm Their Return for New 'Scary Movie' Haim Sip Cocktails, Talk ‘I Quit,' and Explain the Importance of Acknowledging Farts When Dating Teyana Taylor Makes the BET Awards Her ‘Escape Room' in Fiery Performance He's trying to gain entry into the rancid elite via a group known as the Christmas Adventurers' Club, made up of millionaire string-pullers yearning for a world of racial purity and those “American-born by gentile,” yadda yadda yadda. And blessed with a lot of soldiers and firepower that may be from one of many independent militias or may be from the U.S. government itself — six of one these days — Lockjaw is determined to see his mission through. The character's name is not just highly Pynchonesque but very well-earned, by the way; Penn plays this obsessive man as a walking, talking balled fist, with ramrod posture and a permanent expression of distaste. It's an expert portrait of self-loathing and redirected rage, and a reminder that though the actor has been more selective about taking on screen gigs, he's still a strong contender for GOAT status. Penn knows exactly how to walk the line between caricature and the truthful cracking open of someone determined to stay locked on target. One Battle After Another is truly one stunning, thrumming bit of business after another, blessed with DiCaprio's manic take on paranoid parental guidance, understated supporting turns from Regina Hall and Benicio Del Toro as allies to the cause, and enough detours through the source material to capture the literary giant's vibe. There's a serious flexing of chops on display, notably during some cross-cutting between two opposing camps before a raid and two different, equally kinetic car chases. Anderson is intent on telling a story, not blithely showing off. Body Identified as Sources Say D4vd's Tesla Was Spotted in Neighborhood Last May Matt Cameron Admits He Was ‘Having Some Issues' With Pearl Jam's ‘Constant Touring' NFL Teams That Didn't Honor Charlie Kirk Face the Wrath of Conservative Fans Justin Bieber Scores Seven-Figure Coachella Payday: ‘He's Fully in the Driver's Seat' PTA has, of course, tackled T. Pynchon before, and nailed the writer's signature funky absurdism — one part motormouthed Fred Allen, three parts the Furry Freak Brothers — with his 2014 film Inherent Vice. Here, he's using the book as a springboard for what feels like his own fixations and preoccupations, his personal feelings of empathy and outrage. That's why the first half feels like a declaration of war, bustling with a sense that some sort of flip-the-bird action is needed, and the back half makes you sympathize with everyone's frazzled, desperate exhaustion. And yet: there's hope in them thar Northern California hills, which brings us back to that aforementioned answer. In its sprawling attempt to partially wrap its arms around the Great-Step-Backward Age we find ourselves in, One Battle After Another shares a slight kinship with another shoot-the-moon auteur work of recent vintage: Eddington. Ari Aster's film stared directly into the abyss and, shuddering, worried about how we could or should fight back. Anderson's humanistic masterpiece of a movie says: You fight it with love.</p>

Until his monumental new film, Paul Thomas Anderson had only made a single narrative feature set in the 21st century, and that movie — a love story about a plunger salesman who hoards pudding cups, gets extorted by the owner of a phone sex line, and shares an iconic kiss to the sound of a Shelley Duvall song from 1980 — was less of its time than out of it. Related Stories For Paranormal ‘Experiencer' and Producer Daniel Noah, Bringing the Supernatural to the Screen Is Bigger Than Just Scares With No One Else Buying Movies, Financiers Turn Distributors to Seize Opportunity Enter: “One Battle After Another,” the power and the mercy of which lies in how it simultaneously functions as both a backboard-shattering windmill dunk on that line of attack and an open-hearted surrender to its merits. Vaguely abstracted from Thomas Pynchon's 1984-set “Vineland” but eager to reflect a variety of post-Reaganite advancements in ethno-fascism (the action starts in a recognizable today before jumping 16 years forward into a pointedly unchanged tomorrow), this propulsive, hilarious, and overwhelmingly tender paranoid comedy-thriller car chase blockbuster whatever doesn't just stare a broken country in the face with its already prescient tale of immigrant detention centers, white nationalist caricatures, and bullshit pretenses for deploying the military into sanctuary cities. Dirk Diggler, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, Lancaster Dodd, and mama's boy Reynolds Woodcock are but a few of the immortal characters he's created over the last three decades, all of them immovably anchored to past lives that drag them down as they push towards the future. With “One Battle After Another,” Anderson concedes that he's no different than his most enduring creations. On a long enough timeline, maybe none of us are. While Anderson has never been stuck in place or in sad pursuit of his former glory (on the contrary, his shapeshifting body of work is so remarkable for its limitless vitality), Hollywood has collapsed around him despite his best efforts to preserve its celluloid magic. He's persisted in spite of that fact, doing his thing on the fringes of a studio system that's crumbling faster than his entire generation of name-brand auteurs can fortify it with new films, but his formal radicality was softened by an emergent preference for the way things were — even if only as a milieu. But revolution comes in many forms, and while Anderson's new daddy-daughter epic implicitly concedes to the conservatism of getting older, this ~$150 million rallying cry is the work of an artist and a father who's determined to convince himself that getting older doesn't have to be the same thing as giving up. While the wacked out spirit of “One Battle After Another” might be transplanted from a 35-year-old Pynchon novel, it's the unflinching nowness of this reinterpretation that allows it to take the long view of America's forever war against itself, and to so brilliantly articulate — in the words of Gary Valentine — how liberating it can be to “stop using time as an excuse.” Confronting the unchecked evil and bottomless humiliation of the Trump administration from its opening frames (though it wouldn't make sense for Anderson's script to mention the president by name), “One Battle After Another” begins at top speed and barrels forward so fast that you can barely even tell it's moving in a perfect circle. Perfidia is a natural survivor with a non-partisan power kink that can get the best of her if she isn't careful, which is exactly what happens when — upon infiltrating the tent of detention camp leader Col. Steven J. Lockjaw (a career-best Sean Penn as a preening and steroidal Alfred E. Neuman, his natural humorlessness a perfect vehicle for comedy) — she orders the lip-licking army man to full attention before she lets him go. That decision incites a double-edged sexual infatuation that compels Lockjaw to follow the French 75 like Pepé Le Pew chasing the pheromone trail of a female cat. Every bank they rob or anti-abortion senator's office they blow up brings the colonel one step closer to blackmailing Perfidia into submission, and when he finally makes his move, the self-interested subversive doesn't hesitate to save her own skin. Never mind that she and Pat just had a baby girl together, or that she's condemning her fellow revolutionaries — including Regina Hall's ultra-stoic Deandra, and a fantastically brash agitator played by her “Support the Girls” co-star Shayna “Junglepussy” McHayle — to almost certain death. When the story picks up a decade-and-a-half later, the bomb-maker formerly known as Ghetto Pat has been reborn as self-described “drugs and alcohol-lover” Bob Ferguson in the woodsy enclave of Baktan Cross, where he spends most of his time sitting at home in a bathrobe, blasting his brains out with bad pot, and impotently stewing over how to protect his teenage daughter Willa from a past that feels more like a paranoid delusion. No such luck: Col. Lockjaw, now aged into a cheek-sucking human turnip who walks like a machine gun has been rammed up his ass, is being considered for membership in an elite cabal of hyper-racist Santa-worshippers (did I mention this movie was inspired by the writing of Thomas Pynchon? The girl is played by magnetically self-possessed newcomer/instant movie star Chase Infiniti, whose performance inspires a strange kind of secondhand pride, and more than rewards the years that it took Anderson to find her (score a point for nominative determinism, as no one on Earth was so obviously born to star in a Pynchon movie). A manic and panicked stoner who scurries around this movie in an open bathrobe while slamming back fresh cans of Modelo like Gatorade, Bob may not be quite as far gone as the Pynchon character on which he's based, but the “Vaseline of youth” has crusted over his bloodshot eyes in much the same way. It's profoundly, consistently, and endearingly funny to watch him Forrest Gump his way through everything that follows Lockjaw's arrival in Baktan Cross, from a glorified ICE raid to a “Vanishing Point”-inspired car chase. DiCaprio's bloodshot performance further immortalizes the former heartthrob as modern cinema's most gifted buffoon, but here — collaborating with Anderson for the first time, who lavishes the same love and attention on his extras as he does on his stars — the actor's tetchy comic genius finds a new dimension through his character's natural deference. That dynamic proves essential to a breathless second act that places Bob — along with several undocumented Mexican families — in the care of Baktan Cross' resident karate teacher and holy protector amidst a town-wide government standoff. A spectacular foil for DiCaprio's perma-addled Bob, Benecio Del Toro's cool-headed Sensei is also an instant addition to the pantheon of iconic PTA characters in his own right, and his zen approach to the threat posed by Lockjaw's forces gradually emerges as the movie's defiant ethos. “We've been laid siege for hundreds of years,” he says with a steady breath. Here, those waves eventually crest into a river of hills, as “One Battle After Another” peaks with a car chase across the blind humps of Highway 78 in Borrego Springs. Like everything else in Anderson's film, the vehicular action is simple, spellbinding, and perfectly expressive of a story that always moves at 100mph even when its characters aren't even able to see over the next ridge. (Michael Bauman's vividly textured cinematography is a sight to behold throughout the movie, VistaVision or not, but the whole picture was lensed with large-format in mind, and one particular shot during this climactic sequence is so enveloping in true IMAX that it made me want to apologize on behalf of anyone who's ever mocked the people who supposedly fled “The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station.”) If, as Salman Rushdie once argued, “Vineland” is “a book about what America has been doing to its children,” then “One Battle After Another” might be described as a film about why people keep making them anyway, even as “the Repression goes on, growing wider and deeper regardless of the names in power” (to slightly paraphrase Pynchon). Bob and Willa only share one scene together before “another battle” comes between them, but it's a splenetically funny little masterpiece of intergenerational disconnect, as the petrified father is too fogged up by the fear of losing his baby girl to appreciate how well she's learned to compensate for his failures. As much about parenthood as “Phantom Thread” was about marriage, Anderson's latest film is steeped in a fear that's completely absent from the supreme confidence of its form (“I'll tell you what freedom is: No fear. It's a peerlessly comforting reminder that even today's most immortal artists — and/or yesterday's most unintimidated revolutionaries — can be scared to death by the thought of their kids fighting the same battles as they once did. One day you're detonating C4 inside a government detention center and the next you're sending your daughter to the school dance with a Cold War-era tracking device in her purse. “Time doesn't exist,” someone says at a crucial moment, “yet it controls us anyway.” From the guilt of not being able to break the cycle and bend a circular movie like this one into a straight line. That raising kids can be a revolution unto itself if you do it right — one that doesn't need to be televised because it takes place right in the relative comfort of your own home. Time isn't an excuse, this magnificent film suggests, it's a war of attrition. Warner Bros. will release “One Battle After Another” in theaters on Friday, September 26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift is living that life of a Graham Norton Show girl. In addition to the Oppenheimer star and Past Lives actress, Jodie Turner-Smith and Domhnall Gleeson will take part in host Graham Norton's signature group interview. In 2013, she made her debut on Graham Norton following the release of her Red album, and in 2014, her terse exchange with John Cleese over his musings on cats and women went viral. Her upcoming stop by the Graham Norton Show marks the latest step in Swift's promo for The Life of a Showgirl, which she announced in August via an appearance on then-boyfriend, now-fiancé Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast. “I was so mentally stimulated and excited to be creating,” she said on New Heights. My main goals were melodies that were so infectious, you're almost angry at it … We've made songs that I'm so proud of.” With a couple weeks left to go before Swift talks more about Showgirl on Graham Norton, get ready for the interview by looking back on all the times she's previously appeared on the show below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning and A24 are teaming up for a legal thriller series. The indie studio outbid several others for Discretion, based on a short story by best-selling author Chandler Baker. The project is a reunion for Kidman, Fanning and A24, who are also behind Apple TV+'s Margo's Got Money Troubles. Plot details are being kept quiet, but the Dallas-set story is based in part on Baker's experiences as a corporate attorney. Baker will adapt her story with the intent for Discretion to become an ongoing series. She also recently wrapped filming on Practical Magic 2 with Sandra Bullock. Her recent credits also include A Complete Unknown and Sentimental Value, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this month. Baker, meanwhile, is currently adapting her novel The Husbands for an Amazon MGM Studios feature starring Kristen Wiig. She also co-wrote the screenplay for Prime Video's upcoming holiday movie Oh.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Candace Cameron Bure‘s daughter, Natasha, married a former Disney star over the weekend in a beautiful garden wedding. A post shared by Natasha Perry (@natashaperry) Candace's daughter Natasha and “Good Luck Charlie” star Bradley Steven Perry privately got engaged in April. The couple got married in a “romantic garden celebration” at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu, California on September 14, 2025, People reports. “It's almost impossible to put into words what our wedding truly feels like. It's surreal and overwhelming in all the best ways. “This day is also so much more than just a celebration of our love, it's a reminder of how blessed we are to be surrounded by the most incredible family and friends — people who have cheered us on, shaped us, and stood by us.” Natasha reportedly had “a specific vision for the day,” so they didn't hire a wedding planner. “We wanted the smallest of details to represent our love throughout the day and to make sure everything felt perfectly ‘us,'” Natasha said. “Every DIY craft and design project you could think of, we tried our very best to take on.” “By the time our wedding rolled around, I had completely overtaken Bradley's place and turned it into a full-on arts and crafts workshop,” Natasha said. A post shared by Candace Cameron Bure (@candacecbure) Candace added, “We couldn't have asked for a kinder man than Bradley to love and care for our girl 🥹. Natasha, you are radiant inside and out and are already the best wife to your beloved. My heart swells with happiness for you two. May God bless all the days of your lives together ❤️❤️❤️.” Fans flooded the comments section with messages of congratulations. “Absolutely beautiful, in every way!” one fan wrote. And I'm so proud of myself 😂.”</p>
