Cadillac boss on Colton Herta's F1 ambitions - F1 Beyond The Grid Podcast

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

IndyCar winner and F1 TV analyst James Hinchcliffe explains what Herta will bring to the new Cadillac team – and why he's given up a front-running seat in IndyCar to chase his F1 dream.

If you are even a remote Formula 1 fan you've no doubt heard the recent news about IndyCar star Colton Herta forfeiting his place as a front runner in the American championship to take on a role as Cadillac F1's new test and development driver.

His role with Cadillac will be dovetailed with a season racing in F2, with the aim of getting a better grasp of the circuits, the cadence of F1 weekends and the very particular traits of Pirelli racing rubber. Herta's ultimate goal is a race seat in F1 with the General Motors-backed outfit.

Cadillac boss on Colton Herta's F1 ambitions - F1 Beyond The Grid Podcast

David Coulthard on McLaren team orders

In this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

Six months before their first race, the new Cadillac Formula 1 Team is already moving fast. The drivers have been signed, the car is being developed on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and engineers are running simulations to prepare for Grand Prix racing.

Leading Cadillac to the Formula 1 grid is Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, who knows how to launch a brand-new team. He did it in 2010 with Virgin Racing, which raced at the back of the grid and was graced by the talent of the late Jules Bianchi.

And in this week's Beyond The Grid podcast, Graeme tells pod host Tom Clarkson how his experience led to a job with Cadillac, how the team won its place in F1, and the incredible preparation work happening as the clock ticks towards the new team's debut at the 2026 Australian Grand Prix.

He explains why Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez are the perfect drivers for the team, and why he admires Cadillac reserve driver Colton Herta for swapping IndyCar for a shot at racing in F1.
