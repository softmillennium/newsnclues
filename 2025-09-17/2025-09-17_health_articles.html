                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An artificial neuron made of conductive plastics that can perform advanced functions similar to those of biological nerve cells has been demonstrated by researchers at Linköping University, Sweden. The results, published in Science Advances, pave the way for a new generation of body-integrated sensors, medical implants, and robotics. Mimicking the behaviour of biological neurons has long been a major goal in so-called neuromorphic engineering. Simone Fabiano, professor of materials science at Linköping University, LiU Instead of relying on rigid silicon, Simone Fabiano's team at the Laboratory of Organic Electronics at LiU works with a class of soft, flexible materials called conjugated polymers that can transport both ions and electrons. This dual capability allows them to interface more closely with biological systems. "We can imagine using these devices to add a sense of touch in prosthetics or robotics. They show that organic electronics are not just softer alternatives to silicon, but can enable new kinds of neural computing that connect biology with electronics," says Simone Fabiano. In parallel with developing advanced functionality, his research group has also worked to simplify the basic structure of these artificial neurons. In early 2023, the researchers at Campus Norrköping succeeded in creating artificial nerve cells that reproduced 15 of the 22 key properties of biological neurons. However, those plastic nerve cells relied on many different components, which limited their practical use. They have reduced the artificial nerve cell to just a single organic electrochemical transistor, while still reproducing as many as 17 neural properties. This artificial neuron is not only highly functional but also extremely compact, comparable in size to a human nerve cell. "This is one of the simplest and most biologically relevant artificial neurons made to date. It opens the door to integrating synthetic neurons directly with living tissue or soft robots," says Simone Fabiano.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Conference MDAngle offers personal perspectives from conference attendees, showcasing their anticipation, quick takeaways, and insights into how the presented research will affect their patients. The 2025 ECTRIMS meeting will be held from September 24-26 in Barcelona, Spain, and will cover a broad range of topics on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Key topics will include global diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, the role of genetics, novel monoclonal antibodies and CAR T-cell treatments, as well as trial design in MS. Devon S. Conway, MD, MSAssociate Professor, Department of Neurology, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland Clinic, Ohio“The conferences also often have some real-world data, which is really helpful because clinical trial populations tend to be somewhat distilled. And, when we look at these real-world studies, we can get a better idea of how these drugs are working for our patients with RRMS that we see in clinic, patients who maybe are a little bit older or who have comorbidities.” Specifically, in the late-breaking session there will be a number of interesting presentations.” ECTRIMS 2025: Anticipating Key Data on DMTs in RRMS Dr Conway notes that there is considerable anticipation for the ECTRIMS 2025 conference, with expectations for new long-term safety data on B-cell depleting therapies and updated real-world evidence, including on ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, and ozanimod. He is also hopeful for interim results from significant studies on treatments like tolebrutinib and fenebrutinib. The conference is likely to feature new insights into novel approaches such as CAR T therapy for MS, making it an exciting event for the community. Coming soon: Dr Oh highlights new data and progress regarding DMTs for RRMS immediately following ECTRIMS 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have identified a novel way brown fat - an energy-burning form of fat - can rev the body's metabolic engine, consuming cellular fuel and producing heat in a way that improves metabolic health. The study, in mice, reveals new avenues to exploit brown fat to treat metabolic diseases, such as insulin resistance and obesity. Brown fat is known for its ability to turn energy (calories) from food into heat. Brown fat's heat production helps the body stay warm in cold temperatures, and exposure to cold can increase brown fat stores. Researchers have proposed that activating brown fat could support weight-loss efforts by boosting calorie burn. Boosting this kind of metabolic process could support weight loss or weight control in a way that is perhaps easier to maintain over time than traditional dieting and exercise. It's a process that basically wastes energy - increasing resting energy expenditure - but that's a good thing if you're trying to lose weight." Scientists have long known that mitochondria in brown fat have a method of disengaging from fuel production and instead producing heat, via a molecule called uncoupling protein 1. Yet they have also known that mice with brown fat that lack uncoupling protein 1 are still able to burn energy and produce heat, pointing to the existence of back-up burners in cells. The new study implicates cellular parts called peroxisomes as important alternative heat producers in brown fat. This increase is even more dramatic in mice whose mitochondria are deficient in uncoupling protein 1, suggesting that peroxisomes may be able to compensate if mitochondria lose their heat-production ability. Lodhi and his colleagues discovered that peroxisomes consume fuel and produce heat in a metabolic process that centers on a key protein in these cell parts called acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Mice missing ACOX2 in brown fat lost some ability to tolerate cold, showing lower body temperatures after exposure to cold compared with typical mice. In addition, compared with typical mice, their tissues did not make good use of the blood sugar-regulating hormone insulin, and they were more prone to obesity when fed high-fat diets. In contrast, mice genetically engineered to make unusually high amounts of ACOX2 in brown fat showed increased heat production, better cold tolerance and improved insulin sensitivity and weight control when fed the same high-fat diet. Using a fluorescent heat sensor they developed, the researchers found that when ACOX2 metabolized certain fatty acids, brown fat cells got hotter. They also used an infrared thermal imaging camera to show that mice lacking ACOX2 produced less heat in their brown fat. While human bodies can manufacture these fatty acids, the molecules also are found in dairy products and human breast milk and are made by certain gut microbes. Lodhi said this raises the possibility that a dietary intervention based on these fatty acids - such as a food, probiotic or "nutraceutical" intervention - could boost this heat-production pathway and the beneficial effects it appears to have. He and his colleagues also are investigating possible drug compounds that could activate ACOX2 directly. But since correlation is not causation, our long-term goal is to test whether dietary or other therapeutic interventions that increase levels of these fatty acids or that increase activity of ACOX2 could be helpful in dialing up this heat production pathway in peroxisomes and helping people lose weight and improve their metabolic health." Peroxisomal metabolism of branched fatty acids regulates energy homeostasis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Modern lifestyles and dietary changes have significantly increased the consumption of high-fat foods, contributing to a steep rise in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, a high-fat diet (HFD) is linked to cognitive impairments and neurodegeneration and has been shown to worsen the pathology of Alzheimer's disease-a progressive neurodegenerative condition-in mouse models. Autophagy, a crucial cellular recycling process, helps maintain neuronal health. Recent studies have shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. To bridge this gap, the researchers used Drosophila, given its ease of genetic manipulation, short lifespan, conserved metabolic and neural pathways with mammals, and well-validated memory assessments. Associate Professor Ayako Tonoki and her team, including doctoral students Tong Yue, Minrui Jiang, and Kotomi Onuki from the Graduate School of Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, along with Professor Motoyuki Itoh from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Japan, recently published their findings in Volume 21, Issue 8 of the journal PLOS Genetics on August 18, 2025. "Our findings suggest that diet-induced cognitive decline is not irreversible and may be improved by lifestyle interventions that promote autophagy, such as exercise or intermittent fasting. This research may raise public awareness about the cognitive risks of HFD and provide new insights into potential preventive strategies against metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders," explains Dr. Tonoki. The researchers maintained the flies on a normal diet or an HFD for seven days and examined their lipid-triacylglycerol (TAG) and circulating glucose levels. Notably, HFD-fed flies had significantly higher levels of TAG and glucose as well as higher intestinal lipid accumulation, suggesting that HFD altered glucose and lipid metabolism. Next, the researchers examined the effects of HFD on memory formation by conditioning the flies to various odors and assessing their short-term (3 minutes following exposure), intermediate-term (3 hours following exposure), and long-term (24 hours following exposure) memory (STM, ITM, and LTM, respectively). Specific odor tubes were paired with an electric shock apparatus for behavioral reinforcement. Notably, HFD-fed flies exhibited impaired ITM and LTM, while STM remained unaffected. They found that the levels of Ref(2)p-a protein normally degraded by autophagy-were significantly increased in HFD-fed flies. Further, temporary suppression of the autophagy protein Atg1 in adult neurons selectively reduced ITM without affecting STM, consistent with the effects observed under HFD feeding, suggesting that a temporary reduction in neuronal autophagic activity during adulthood is sufficient to cause memory decline. These findings suggest that HFD-induced memory deficits can be reversed by enhancing autophagic activity. To better understand how HFD disrupts autophagy, the researchers examined the final stage of autophagy-the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes into autolysosomes, where cellular contents are degraded and recycled. Notably, HFD-fed flies showed abundant autophagosomes and lysosomes, but no change in autolysosome numbers, indicating that the HFD-induced impairment in autophagy was likely due to the defective fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Interestingly, gene expression analysis revealed that lysosome signaling-related genes were significantly downregulated in HFD-fed flies. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into how HFD induces memory deficits through autophagic and lysosomal impairment. Dr. Tonoki concludes by saying, "This research advances our understanding of how dietary habits influence brain health. Our findings may also accelerate the identification of autophagy-enhancing interventions-including specific nutrients and therapeutic agents-to combat diet-induced cognitive decline and preserve cognition in the aging population." High-fat diet impairs intermediate-term memory by autophagic-lysosomal dysfunction in Drosophila. Discover how real-time Raman monitoring enhances API control and quality during hot melt extrusion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By linking wearable data with pregnancy hormones, researchers show how everyday devices could one day help detect risks like miscarriage or preterm birth long before symptoms appear. Study: Association between wearable sensor signals and expected hormonal changes in pregnancy. A recent study in eBioMedicine investigated the effectiveness of wearable sensors in tracking physiological and behavioral changes during pregnancy and assessing their association with pregnancy-related hormonal fluctuations. In the U.S., adverse pregnancy outcomes are increasing, and disparities in maternal mortality persist between White and non-White women. These trends highlight the urgent need for better ways to monitor and address pregnancy risks. Early detection of complications could enable timely clinical interventions and reduce adverse outcomes. Researchers are exploring digital health technologies and artificial intelligence to meet this need to track maternal and fetal health. Pregnancy hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), progesterone (P), oestrogens like oestrone (E1), oestradiol (E2), and oestriol (E3), relaxin, prolactin, human placental lactogen, oxytocin, and cortisol (C), are essential for supporting and maintaining a healthy, full-term pregnancy. Their levels naturally fluctuate at specific stages throughout gestation. Many pregnant women experience difficulties in accessing healthcare, which could be attributed to geographic limitations and socioeconomic disparities. In addition, many working mothers, despite not having financial difficulties, also experience challenges in attending regular prenatal appointments due to lack of paid leave, employment demands, and childcare responsibilities. Many of these difficulties could be addressed through remote monitoring and mobile health technology. Previous research has confirmed that remote monitoring and mobile health have enhanced patient empowerment and home pregnancy care, effectively reducing pregnancy stress. However, further research is needed better to understand the impact of remote monitoring on health outcomes. The current observational study obtained data collected in PowerMom, a bilingual digital research platform that allows participants to remotely self-assess and report survey data. It also enables real-world data collection by integrating digital health technologies, such as wearable sensors. Participants who were pregnant or within eight weeks postpartum, 16 years or older, living in the US or its territories, and had access to devices supporting the PowerMom application were recruited. During the study period, participants completed a biweekly “Health and Well-being” survey and a bimonthly “Pregnancy Support” survey. Since resting heart rate (RHR) changes are associated with expected pregnancy-related hormone changes, multivariable linear regression was used to model the expected RHR curve in live birth pregnancies using the expected hormone curves. Out of 5612 participants, whose average age was 31.1 years, enrolled in the PowerMom study, only 697 agreed to share data. Only 108, 108, and 56 participants provided sufficient RHR, number of daily steps (STEPS), and total minutes of daily sleep (SLEEP) data, respectively, during their pregnancy. On average, participants with RHR wearable data were older than the overall cohort. The average duration of pregnancy for enrolled participants was 276.2 days, and for RHR participants, it was 275.2 days. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of access to maternity care between enrolled and RHR participants. Notably, no significant difference was observed in the RHR, STEPS, and SLEEP subsets among participants. Most participants who shared wearable data had singleton pregnancies, except for two candidates. Approximately 93% of the cohort had live birth pregnancies, while 6.9% indicated pregnancy loss, either miscarriage or stillbirth. After week 5, the decrease reached a minimum around week 9; subsequently, RHR increased during the second and third trimesters. After the baby's delivery, RHR decreases below pre-pregnancy levels and stabilizes about 6 months post-delivery. Although the number of daily steps improved post-delivery, it remained below pre-pregnancy levels even 6 months postpartum. An increase in total sleep minutes of almost 40 minutes compared to pre-pregnancy levels was observed after week 5, peaking between weeks 8 and 9. However, sleep duration decreased in the second and third trimesters and dropped sharply after delivery (about 50 minutes below baseline), before partially recovering. It remained about 20 minutes below the pre-pregnancy levels even after 6 months postpartum. In regression modelling, however, only E1 and cortisol showed positive coefficients, while E2, E3, P, and hCG showed negative associations, indicating that regression analyses can reveal more nuanced hormone effects than simple correlations. In contrast, STEPS curves exhibited a mild negative correlation with E1, E2, E3, P, and C. Multivariable linear regression modeling revealed a high coefficient of determination for the RHR curve, indicating a close relationship between pregnancy hormones and the RHR signal. A robust correlation was observed between RHR fluctuations and pregnancy-induced hormonal changes. Still, these findings are preliminary because of the very small sample size (n=9) and should be considered an exploratory feasibility assessment rather than a definitive conclusion. However, the findings of this study must be validated in the future using a larger cohort of diverse ethnicities. These studies must consider additional parameters influencing RHR, such as age and body mass index (BMI). Priyom holds a Ph.D. in Plant Biology and Biotechnology from the University of Madras, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Indiana University study brings a comprehensive new perspective to a growing body of evidence suggesting that mild to moderate use of prescribed opioid pain medications during pregnancy does not cause an increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. It concludes that other factors, rather than fetal exposure to opioid pain medications, may explain the increased risk for autism and ADHD in the children of individuals who received opioid prescriptions during pregnancy. This study "helps provide more information to pregnant individuals and their physicians who are trying to make complex decisions about how to best manage pain during pregnancy," said first author Emma Cleary, a graduate student in the lab of the study's co-principal investigator, Professor Brian D'Onofrio in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. While they are not able to rule out small increased risks for autism and ADHD with high amounts of exposure, which were rare in our data, the results suggest that there is no causal effect of prescribed opioid analgesics on the risk for these two common neurodevelopmental disorders." Emma Cleary, Study First Author and Graduate Student, Indiana University The study's findings further suggest, as co-author Ayesha Sujan, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine, noted, "that the observed associations between prenatal exposure to opioid analgesics and two major neurodevelopmental disorders-autism and ADHD-are largely driven by factors leading up to opioid analgesic use rather than the opioid exposure itself." The study drew on the extensive data from Swedish population-based registers, including more than 1.2 million births in Sweden from 2007 to 2018, when analyzing the risk of ASD, among whom 4.4% were exposed to prescribed opioid medications during pregnancy. Analyses of ADHD risk included more than 900,000 births from 2007 to 2015. By analyzing the data from a variety of perspectives, the study also accounted for a range of possible confounding factors. However, when they statistically adjusted for factors such as parental age and psychiatric conditions, and used a narrower set of comparison groups to account for shared characteristics between the groups, the observed risks decreased. Notably, when comparing exposed children to unexposed children whose birthing parent had been prescribed opioids in the year before conception but not during pregnancy, the increased risk for autism and ADHD in the exposed children was markedly diminished. Similarly, the risk for these neurodevelopmental conditions disappeared when comparing differentially exposed siblings. As Cleary explained, "The way we take our findings together, is that yes, initially, we observe this increased risk for high dose and low doses. Cleary added, "And when doing so, the risks that we initially observe go away. As previous studies have explored, these background characteristics would make you both more likely to be exposed to prescribed opioids and increase risk of ASD and ADHD." One of the study's innovative features was the use of text-mining algorithms, a novel technique previously used by some of the authors to study ADHD medication use but not yet applied to prescribed opioid use. "With these pharmacy-based dispensations," said Cleary, "there's always some uncertainty, but with text-mining of the 'as needed dosages' or prescriptions with a range, such as 1-3 pills a day, we were able to test different possible versions of exposure – and across those analyses we found converging results." The study also entailed work across several fields and disciplines. As D'Onofrio added, "This is a great example of how collaborations among researchers, clinicians, and data engineers can leverage large datasets to help answer key clinical questions, especially when it is not feasible to conduct randomized controlled trials." The findings ultimately provide greater clarity for those seeking to treat pain during pregnancy insofar as they suggest that opioid pain medication does not cause substantially increased risk of autism and ADHD. But people who may be more likely to be prescribed an opioid may also need more support to help manage symptoms throughout their pregnancy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Importantly, people with lived experience of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were active members of the Guideline Development Panel from the outset. Their contributions helped shape the clinical questions, interpretation of evidence, and formulation of recommendations, ensuring that the final guideline is firmly grounded in the real-world needs and priorities of adults with diabetes. The publication of this first EASD guideline is a landmark moment for our Association and for the international diabetes community. The launch of this guideline marks a turning point in recognising and addressing the emotional challenges of living with diabetes. Although major advances in treatment and technology have transformed care, many people continue to experience significant emotional and psychological burden in managing the relentless demands of the condition. Professor Richard Holt, University of Southampton & University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust in the United Kingdom and Co-Chair of the Guideline Development Panel, said: "We are proud that the EASD has chosen diabetes distress for its first-ever evidence-based clinical guideline. Professor Jane Speight, The Australian Centre for Behavioural Research in Diabetes, Diabetes Victoria and Deakin University in Australia and Co-Chair of the Guideline Development Panel, said: "We hope that this guideline will empower healthcare professionals to routinely assess and address the emotional burden of living with diabetes, ultimately improving outcomes for adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes across Europe and beyond." Professor Chantal Mathieu, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium and President of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, added: "Despite huge advances in therapies and technologies, the emotional burden of diabetes has not diminished – and for many, it has increased. This guideline recognises that reality, reminding us that good diabetes care must address both glucose levels and the lived experience of managing the condition. I am immensely proud to present this first EASD clinical guideline, which reflects the best available evidence and the hard work of many colleagues. Successful implementation of the guideline will require training, system-level support, and integration into routine care. The EASD plans to support dissemination through peer-reviewed publication, open-access availability, and plain-language summaries designed for accessibility by people living with diabetes and the wider public. The publication of this first guideline not only addresses an urgent and unmet need in diabetes care but also establishes a framework for future EASD guidelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research presented at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, Austria (Sept 15-19) and simultaneously published in NEJM shows that daily treatment with the new once-daily GLP-1 agonist orforglipron results in substantial weight loss in people living with obesity who do not have type 2 diabetes. The study is by Dr Sean Wharton, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada and Wharton Weight Management Clinic, Burlington, ON, Canada, and colleagues. Orforglipron is a small-molecule, oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. In this phase 3, multinational, randomised, double-blind trial, the authors examined the safety and efficacy of once-daily orforglipron at doses of 6 mg, 12 mg, or 36 mg, as compared with placebo (assigned in a 3:3:3:4 ratio) as an adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity for 72 weeks. A total of 3127 patients in 9 countries / jurisdictions (USA, China, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Taiwan) underwent randomisation. Other outcomes such as waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly improved with orforglipron treatment (see table 3 full paper). The most common adverse events with orforglipron were gastrointestinal effects, which were mostly mild to moderate, consistent with the GLP-1 class of medications. The authors note that the use of medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide) are reported to result in mean weight reductions of approximately 15% to above 20% and have shown additional health benefits, including decreased cardiovascular risk. However, most available GLP-1 based medications are administered as a subcutaneous injection, which may limit treatment initiation and adherence. The patients who received the highest dose of orforglipron had an average 11.2% weight reduction; more than one third had a reduction of at least 15%, and nearly one fifth had a reduction of at least 20%." They added, "All measured cardiometabolic levels improved with orforglipron treatment as compared with placebo… A weight reduction of 10% or more is a recognised therapeutic threshold, one that has been linked to meaningful cardiometabolic benefits. In our current trial, patients who received orforglipron had a mean weight reduction of as much as 11.2%, and such reductions were associated with improvements in levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as blood fats, blood sugar profiles, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein – a marker of systemic inflammation." The authors note the trial's limitations include the lack of comparison with currently approved obesity-management medications, the use of cutoffs for BMI inclusion criteria that have been developed in White populations and that exclude patients with lower BMI values who may also have adiposity-related risks, and the increasing availability of obesity-management medications, which could have an effect on treatment adherence and efficacy results. The strengths of the trial include a highly diverse, large population from nine countries and jurisdictions on four continents, including more than 35% enrolment of men. They concluded, "In patients with obesity, the use of orforglipron resulted in statistically and clinically significant weight reductions and an adverse-event profile that was consistent with findings regarding other GLP-1 receptor agonists." Orforglipron is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other similar agencies worldwide. Orforglipron, an Oral Small-Molecule GLP-1 Receptor Agonist for Obesity Treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new machine learning model developed by The George Institute for Global Health can successfully predict heart disease risk in women by analyzing mammograms. Developed in collaboration with the University of New South Wales and University of Sydney, this is the first deep learning algorithm based on only mammographic features and age to predict major cardiac events with comparable accuracy to traditional cardiovascular risk calculators. Associate Professor Clare Arnott, Global Director of the Cardiovascular Program at The George Institute said that new ways to identify women at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were needed, given that many women are not accessing or being offered CV risk screening in the community. By integrating CV risk screening with breast screening through the use of mammograms - something many women already engage with at a stage in life when their cardiovascular risk increases - we can identify and potentially prevent two major causes of illness and death at the same time." Researchers then compared the model to traditional models that require multiple data points based on known CV risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol. "We found that our model performed just as well without the need for extensive clinical and medical data," said A/Prof Arnott. Previous research to date has focused on certain mammographic features such as breast arterial calcification (BAC), which has been found to be associated with cardiovascular risk in some populations. For example, BAC is less accurate at predicting CVD risk in older women. Our model is the first to use a range of features from mammographic images combined simply with age - a key advantage of this approach being that it doesn't require additional history taking or medical record data, making it less resource intensive to implement, but still highly accurate." Clare Arnott, Global Director, Cardiovascular Program, The George Institute Globally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in women, amounting to around 9 million deaths annually, or approximately one third of all deaths in women. Despite the high burden of disease, multiple studies internationally have shown that cardiovascular disease symptoms and risk factors are under-considered in women, leading to fewer diagnostic tests, specialist referrals and prescriptions in women compared to men. Dr Jennifer Barraclough, Research Fellow at The George Institute, said that leveraging an existing risk screening process already widely utilized by women, means this model could serve as a cardiovascular risk prediction tool for women in diverse communities across Australia and around the world. "We hope this technology will one day provide greater, and more equitable access to screening in rural areas, as many women already benefit from mobile mammography units free of charge," she said. "We have shown the potential of this innovative new screening tool, so we now look forward to testing the model in additional, diverse, populations and understanding potential barriers to its implementation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INTEGRA Biosciences is part of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a scheme that provides independent assessment and approval of companies' carbon-reduction targets according to 3 scopes. The latest report shows that INTEGRA has already reduced its scope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (from the production of purchased energy) emissions by 57 percent - well ahead of schedule - and is on track to achieve all of its ambitious green goals. It's also on track to reach its scope 3 target - for all other indirect emissions within the supply chain, both upstream and downstream - having already reduced these emissions by 28 percent by the end of 2024. However, this good news won't stop INTEGRA from implementing additional measures to further reduce its environmental impact! The company's remaining emissions hotspots are product materials and transport, and INTEGRA is already working on many more green initiatives to meet its sustainability goals.
