                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zoom on Wednesday launched new products at its Zoomtopia conference, including an upgraded AI companion that can work across meeting apps, as well as the ability to add your own notes, AI-powered meeting scheduling, and AI avatars that resemble users. The company has long offered an AI bot that can record and transcribe Zoom meetings. However, cross-application meeting notetakers like Read AI, Otter, Fireflies, Granola, and Circleback have made great progress. To tackle that, Zoom is making its AI companion work with other platforms such as Meet and Microsoft Teams, along with a feature to take notes during in-person meetings. The company is taking a page out of Granola's book to let users jot down their own notes during meetings, then have AI expand and structure them later. Zoom is also adding cross-platform search so users can retrieve information from across Google and Microsoft's platforms. Through its AI Companion, the company will allow users to find time slots that work for all attendees. The company is also rolling out proactive meeting recommendations, such as suggested tasks and agenda items for meeting prep, and a group AI assistant for a group. Zoom will introduce photorealistic avatars to its platforms, too — something it's talked about for some time. Earlier this year, the company's CEO, Eric Yuan, used one during its quarterly call. However, there are deepfake risks involved with the misuse of personas that could see corporate IT departments scrambling to turn them off. AI will also aid in new live translation features. What's more, Zoom is launching an upgraded web interface to feature its AI companion more prominently, and other AI-powered features like a writing assistant to draft emails and documents, and a deep research feature, are being added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No doubt Netflix has already started having Oscar dreams, with nominations all but guaranteed in the Best Animated Feature as well as Best Original Song categories. That would be Wicked: For Good, the follow-up to last year's very successful Wicked—which notched 10 Oscar nominations and picked up a pair for its lavish costumes and production design. But one category it didn't enter into was Best Original Song, since Wicked‘s numbers all came from the long-running Broadway musical. That didn't stop the Academy Awards from bringing stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo out to sing onstage, and now it seems Wicked: For Good is hoping for a return visit. As Variety reports, confirming remarks Jon M. Chu made to Entertainment Weekly last week, Wicked: For Good‘s soundtrack will feature two new songs, one for each of its witchy leads. Don't expect to get more than teases of the new material before the movie, though: Wicked: For Good and its soundtrack both release November 21. Do you predict either of the new songs will be a threat to KPop Demon Hunters when awards season rolls around?

The Saja Boys tune has come under scrutiny because of a seemingly mistranslated report. After the recent release of its full soundtrack, 'KPop Demon Hunters' is leading Billboard's Top 100 and 200 charts with no end in sight. The director also revealed that Glinda and Elphaba will both have to come to terms with what Oz means for them. It's Netflix's biggest hit ever but 'KPop Demon Hunters' was a Sony movie first.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Francisco-based Airbuds offers a mobile, social app that lets people express themselves through their music. On Wednesday, Airbuds is announcing its raise of $5 million in funding from early-stage venture capital firm Seven Seven Six, founded by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. For users, the app offers a way to socialize and connect with their friends, engage in self-expression, and discover new tunes, all in one place. Apple has tried and failed multiple times to integrate a social experience inside its music apps. That effort began with its disastrous music social network Ping, which closed down in the early 2010s, and was followed by a revamped attempt known as Connect, aimed at connecting artists and fans. Spotify, meanwhile, has been working to make its music streamer a more social app with additions like its TikTok-inspired feeds, comments, polls, and Q&As for podcasts, artist stories, collaborative playlists, a messaging feature, and more. Yet neither company has found the sweet spot when it comes to offering a true social network, because building popular consumer social experiences can be difficult and unpredictable. Fortunately for Airbuds co-founders Gilles Poupardin and Gawen Arab, they've had time to iterate on their ideas. Poupardin has been building products for consumers since his college days, including a Pinterest-like music bookmarking tool, a voice-controlled smart speaker (arriving just ahead of Amazon's Echo debut), and a social audio app called Cappuccino that let friends make mini-podcasts together. Arab, meanwhile, had worked on the smart speaker with Poupardin and then later did a stint at Zenly, the social app maker that sold to Snap for $350 million in 2017. “Because I built all of these music products in the past, I knew that when you ask the users to create a playlist or to do something, it's a lot of effort,” explained Poupardin, in an interview with TechCrunch. While Airbuds' core functionality remains the widget, the app has built on top of that experience to offer a range of other social features. As users scroll the app's feed, they can play clips of their friends' streamed songs and even chat with a friend through a simple, built-in messenger. When you want to stream your music but not share it, there's a “ghost mode” option to keep your listening private until it's disabled. Airbuds will also display friends with similar music tastes and deliver a personalized Weekly Recap of what you streamed, like a miniature version of Spotify's popular year-end review, Spotify Wrapped. And it's experimenting with a new feature that would let users join their school on the app to see the music top artists from their schoolmates. Users can also customize their profile (or “Space”) by adding favorite artists, songs, albums, lyrics, pictures, text, and more, or let the app automatically design it for them. This self-expression feature is key to the app's traction, Poupardin believes, as around 30% of users now engage with the app's features beyond just seeing what friends are streaming. But Poupardin stresses it's not just for growth — the app only really works if you add your friends. With the new funding in hand, Airbuds is planning other ways to expand its app, potentially by supporting other types of streaming services, providing artist-to-fan connections, or designing features to attract older users. To date, the startup has raised a total of $10 million from investors including a16z, SV Angel, Dream Machine, Nikita Bier, Antoine Martin, Uncommon, and Night Capital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last month, Webtoon announced a major new deal with Disney to bring a litany of original licensed stories and past comics from across a whole host of past Disney-branded comics, including the Marvel Comics library, to the scrolling format that has made Webtoon a significant force in the comics space. Today Webtoon Entertainment confirmed that Disney would be acquiring a 2% equity interest in the company as part of a non-binding term sheet that will also see the two companies develop a brand new digital comics platform that will be home to “current comic book runs and include decades of past comics from across Disney's portfolio, including Marvel, Star Wars, 20th Century Studios, and more,” according to a press release. The new, currently unnamed platform will host over 35,000 comics and is framed in the announcement as “an expansion upon Marvel Unlimited.” It's currently unclear whether or not the new platform, which will be operated by Webtoon, will be set up to replace Marvel Unlimited, the publisher's digital comics platform and subscription service that first launched in 2007. That said, further information provided by the companies says that the new platform will “provide decades of iconic comics for current Marvel Unlimited subscribers and bring in even more fans to experience storytelling from across the Disney portfolio along with a selection of Webtoon Original stories,” suggesting that the Unlimited subscription will continue to exist in some capacity alongside the new platform. Subscribers to Disney+ will also be able to read a curated selection of comics in the new app as part of the streaming service's perks program, and the new app is described as including “a mix of vertical and traditional formats” across its library of archived comics, current runs, and original content made by Disney and Webtoon, similar to how Marvel Unlimited currently includes scrolling-format exclusive series as part of its Infinity Comics line as well as standard digital comic formats. The new platform will also feature select translations of material for Korean and Japanese audiences. “With a new platform that will combine our product and technical expertise with Disney's full comic catalog, we're giving new and longtime fans all over the world a new way to discover these legendary characters and stories,” Junkoo Kim, Webtoon Entertainment's CEO, said in a provided statement. This is a powerful next step for our growing global business, and a strong foundation for even greater collaboration with Disney in the years ahead.” Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

For the 'Tron' fans feeling nostalgic for the first two films, Disney's giving them shiny new re-releases in Ultra 4K HD this September. A pivot to video and a recent major deal with Disney means Webtoon wants to expand its reach even further. 'Andor' fans living in Los Angeles can get their hands on a propaganda-heavy zine to help it gain Emmy attention. The CEO is also well aware sequels, reboots, and animation-to-live-action titles remain popular with audiences, so don't expect those to go away anytime soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia just can't seem to catch a break. After beating a ban on China sales imposed by the Trump administration, the tech giant is now facing a ban on its products by Chinese regulators. Chinese internet regulator Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) ordered top Chinese tech companies like Bytedance and Alibaba to end their testing and orders of Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chips, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday citing people with knowledge of the matter. Nvidia unveiled the RTX Pro 6000D chip, a lower tech chip designed just to be sold in China under compliance with American export control rules, earlier this year. Last month, Chinese authorities started questioning and cautioning industry titans like Tencent over their purchases of Nvidia's H20 chips, according to Reuters. The Biden administration was first to enforce export restrictions on Nvidia chips sold to China, in an effort to curb the entry of high-tech chips into China off of national security and competitive fears. The restrictions expanded for a while before they were relaxed again under Trump after Beijing landed a big blow to domestic AI confidence earlier this year with DeepSeek's R1, an AI model that rivaled the best of American companies offerings using lower cost chips, inadvertently showing Americans that Chinese innovation did not require the top Nvidia chips. The trade dispute has since gone beyond just chips to include discussions over TikTok and rare earth metals, of which China controls roughly 90% of the world's supply. China's AI industry was largely dependent on American chipmaker Nvidia's chips but that might all be changing soon. After Trump's blanket ban earlier this year choked off the Chinese industry from access to Nvidia chips, Chinese chip development has ramped up. China chip stocks have experienced a major boom so big that the Beijing-based company Cambricon had to warn investors recently. Now it's all hands on deck to build the domestic system.” Although no chip, Chinese-made or otherwise, has been considered up to par with Nvidia's offerings, the Financial Times article paints a different picture. After talking to top Chinese tech companies Huawei, Cambricon, Alibaba, and Baidu about their chip development, Beijing has concluded that Chinese AI processors are now comparable or even better than the downgraded Nvidia products that are allowed into China, according to the FT, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. The Chinese chip industry is having a good day. Alibaba shares rose after the company secured a prominent Chinese customer, state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom, for its new AI chips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Our agentic AI capabilities are designed to work seamlessly throughout the entire selling experience, which means sellers can go from handling every task themselves to collaborating with an intelligent assistant that works proactively on their behalf around the clock, while always keeping sellers in control,” Amazon wrote in a press release. “Seller Assistant will be able to handle everything from routine operations to complex business strategy, so sellers can focus on innovation and growth.” Seller Assistant can now not only monitor account health and inventory, but also help develop strategies and take action when authorized, Amazon says. For example, when a seller is reviewing their inventory, Seller Assistant will flag slow-moving products before they incur long-term storage fees and recommend whether it would make sense to leave the item as it is, lower the price, or remove it altogether. Seller Assistant will also be able to analyze demand patterns and prepare shipment recommendations. Seller Assistant continuously monitors a seller's account and flag potential issues and actions, such as inventory listings that might violate new product safety regulations. Agent-driven commerce is an area of intense interest for tech companies, which imagine a future in which agents can initiate deals or make purchases on behalf of their clients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. SMIC's test platform from Yuliangsheng involves a DUV machine that uses immersion lithography and is reportedly designed for 28nm-class fabrication technologies, though it could be used for 7nm or even 5nm production nodes by applying multipatterning. The Yuliangsheng tool is mostly made from components sourced within China, although some parts are still imported. Once that is achieved (though it is unclear when), it would allow China to operate outside the influence of the U.S. or European export policies in this segment of chip production. If the description of the tool by Financial Times is accurate, then the Yuliangsheng immersion DUV system currently being tested by SMIC resembles ASML's Twinscan NXT:1950i from 2008, which was designed for 32nm-class process technology in one exposure. While theoretically the NXT:1950i could be used to make chips on 7nm and 5nm-class nodes, ASML has developed NXT:2000i for such fabrication technologies, which is generations ahead of the NXT:1950i. It is unclear whether the Yuliangsheng tool is being tested within SMIC's production flow (i.e., they are producing actual chips or patterns) or if the company is just beginning to test the scanner and has merely reached first light on the wafer or first patterning milestones (a more likely scenario). Indeed, the goal is reportedly to integrate domestic immersion DUV lithography machines into production lines starting in 2027, after their qualification. Before that, SMIC will continue to rely on tools from ASML. It should be noted that while SMIC (and probably Yuliangsheng) believes that it is possible to build chips on 7nm and 5nm-class process technologies on the same tools that are used for 28nm-class production nodes, it remains to be seen whether this is possible without a dramatic improvement of a 28nm-class tool when it comes to overlay performance, precision, control, and complexity. Essentially, after the existing tool matures and gets inserted into SMIC's 28nm flow in 2027, it will take Yuliangsheng years to jump to 16nm and then to 7nm fabrication nodes with a significantly redesigned scanner, so do not expect SMIC's sub-10nm fabrication processes on domestic lithography systems earlier than in 2030. Interestingly, but SiCarrier also tends to call its WFE projects after mountains, which perhaps proves that SiCarrier and Shanghai Yuliangsheng Technology Co. are not only affiliated (SiCarrier is reportedly an investor of Yuliangsheng), but likely belong to the same group working on the same goal. It is noteworthy that Shanghai Yuliangsheng Technology Co. is already known to the U.S. Department of Commerce, which put it into its Entity List in late 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is in London, standing in front of a room full of journalists, outing himself as a huge fan of Gemini's Nano Banana. “How could anyone not love Nano Banana? I mean Nano Banana, how good is that? Tell me it's not true!” He addresses the room. I was just talking to Demis [Hassabis, CEO of DeepMind] yesterday and I said ‘How about that Nano Banana! It looks like lots of people agree with him: The popularity of the Nano Banana AI image generator—which launched in August and allows users to make precise edits to AI images while preserving the quality of faces, animals, or other objects in the background—caused a 300 million–image surge for Gemini in the first few days of September, according to a post on X by Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs and Google Gemini. Huang, whose company was among a cohort of big US technology companies to announce investments in data centers, supercomputers, and AI research in the UK on Tuesday, is on a high. Speaking ahead of a white-tie event with UK prime minister Keir Starmer (where he plans to wear custom black leather tails), he's boisterously optimistic about the future of AI in the UK, saying the country is “too humble” about the country's potential for AI advancements. “No one fries food better than you do,” he quips. Nvidia announced a $683 million equity investment in data center builder Nscale this week, a move that—alongside investments from OpenAI and Microsoft—has propelled the company to the epicenter of this AI push in the UK. Huang estimates that Nscale will generate more than $68 billion in revenue over six years. “As AI services get deployed—I'm sure that all of you use it. The leather-jacket-wearing billionaire, who previously told WIRED that he uses AI agents in his personal life, has expanded on how he uses AI (that's not Nano Banana) for most daily things, including his public speeches and research. “I really like using an AI word processor because it remembers me and knows what I'm going to talk about. I could describe the different circumstance that I'm in, and yet it still knows that I'm Jensen, just in a different circumstance,” Huang explains. “In that way it could reshape what I'm doing and be helpful. Frankly, I think the quality of work is better.” His favorite one to use “depends on what I'm doing,” he says. “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If it's very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT,” Huang says. “When I am doing something serious, I will give the same prompt to all of them, and then I ask them to, because it's research oriented, critique each other's work. In the end though, all topics lead back to Nano Banana. There should be no person who is left behind, it's not sensible to me that someone should be left behind on electricity or the internet of the next level of technology,” he says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon this morning unveiled a new wave of agentic AI tools designed to act as proactive partners for the independent sellers who generate more than 60% of its online retail sales. Amazon says they're meant to further empower the businesses that operate on its 25-year-old third-party marketplace. Some sellers see a more complicated reality, where the benefits of access to Amazon's giant marketplace come with rising costs, restrictive policies, and a sense of unequal treatment, as reflected in independent surveys from analysts, vendors, and consulting firms. Meanwhile, an ongoing FTC antitrust case alleges that Amazon has illegally leveraged its power over third-party sellers through a variety of practices that the company strongly denies. Bloomberg News reported last week that the FTC is separately looking into new questions about whether Google and Amazon gave sufficient disclosures about pricing for search ads that, in the case of Amazon's marketplace, are heavily used by sellers to promote listings. Those larger issues form a complex yet largely unstated backdrop for Amazon's annual seller conference. As with much of the tech industry right now, AI is front-and-center at this year's conference. It's part of Amazon's companywide effort to demonstrate leadership in a field where it has sometimes been seen as playing catch-up to OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others. Amazon says its existing generative AI technologies have been used by 1.3 million sellers. They include tools that automatically generate product listings from a photo or short description, suggest attributes and keywords to include in listings, and draft ad copy, for example. “So rather than clicking a button, you're actually able to have a natural-language conversation with a creative partner that is working with you to help you achieve your goals,” said Jay Richman, vice president of creative products and technology for Amazon Ads, in an interview. Features of the upgraded Seller Assistant include the ability to actively monitor inventory levels, flag potential compliance or account-health issues, and anticipate shifts in product demand — even generating specific recommendations on pricing, promotions, or restocking. With a seller's approval, the tool can then take action by preparing shipments, scheduling replenishment, or adjusting listings directly through Amazon's systems. Amazon says it's powering the new tools with its Nova AI foundation model and Anthropic's Claude 4 in conjunction with its deep knowledge of shopping, successful seller approaches. It is tailored to their specific situation,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of selling partner services, in an interview about the new tools at the conference this week. With the new AI tools, Mehta said, the company has been careful not to train its models with seller-specific data, ensuring that no confidential information informs its recommendations to a competing seller. Addressing sellers Tuesday afternoon in an appearance with Mehta on stage, Jassy said the decision to allow independent sellers into Amazon's online store caused “quite an animated debate” inside the company when it was first considered 25 years ago. Amazon executives were unsure at the time that third-party merchants could live up to its brand and customer service standards. But ultimately, he said, after weeks of deliberation, they decided that more sellers would mean better selection and lower prices for customers. “What we're doing together is very unusual,” Jassy said, predicting that the new wave of AI tools are going to make the collaboration even more successful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contract prices jump by up to 20% as AI build-outs drive aggressive cloud procurement and tip the balance of supply. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Contract prices for both NAND and DRAM have jumped by an estimated 15-20% in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to numbers published by DigiTimes on September 17, an off-season surge the publication ties directly to AI infrastructure build-outs and supply tightness. “Supply shortages led to aggressive procurement from cloud service providers, with high-stack 3D NAND products nearly sold out,” writes DigiTimes, adding that, “3D NAND… has attracted strong priority purchasing interest from CSP customers,” citing demand for faster read speed and larger die capacities. This is a stark difference from the normal Q4 pattern, when component prices typically drift lower. TrendForce says SanDisk pushed for a roughly 10% NAND hike in September, while Micron temporarily suspended DRAM and NAND price quotations to reassess allocations after customer forecasts pointed to shortages. DigiTimes goes further, saying Samsung's next-gen V9 NAND for 2026 is “nearly sold out”, with cloud customers locking in capacity early due to its improved density and cost advantages. A separate TrendForce brief from this week, however, says Samsung has delayed V9 QLC to the first half of 2026, which suggests customers may be reserving capacity ahead of firm volume timing. Either way, it's clear to see that cloud buyers are aggressively securing supply well into the future. This could easily have a knock-on effect on consumer prices. If hyperscalers are absorbing more wafers for enterprise SSDs while DRAM makers prioritize server parts and HBM, retail pricing is going to lose some of its slack. TrendForce has already warned that legacy DRAM types remain under the most pressure as capacity is reallocated, and if cloud orders continue to rise, the familiar winter bargains on NVMe drives could be thinner than expected. The bottom line is that multiple data points now converge on a common theme: AI is rewriting cloud storage hierarchy while HDD supply is constrained and flash makers have more pricing power than they usually do in the year's final quarter. If you're planning an upgrade, watch retail memory prices closely and move quickly when a good price pops up, because it probably won't stick around for long.

I had just gotten used to the featherweight feel of Apple's new iPhone Air after several days of use, but it was time to switch to the iPhone 17 Pro. Suddenly, I didn't want to let the Air go. There isn't much to grab on the edges, but the Air's design is whimsical and somewhat paradoxical. It feels like a twig that can snap in a heartbeat, but the sturdy titanium frame dispels any notion of fragility. I was prepared to hate the iPhone Air. Why make a thin phone with lackluster battery life? After spending some time with it, I'm pleasantly surprised. The iPhone Air is just 5.6 millimeters thick and 165 grams; contrast that with the iPhone 17 Pro, which has a smaller screen yet weighs 206 grams and is 8.75 mm thick. Initially, you might feel like the lighter weight makes the Air seem “cheap,” but that notion quickly disappears. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I watched Apple perform a bend test on the iPhone Air, and it was able to withstand more than 130 pounds of force with no damage. We'll need to see how this phone performs in the hands of a wider audience, but I think you can put your pitchforks away—no #bendgate here. Apple says this mixture makes the Air more durable than any prior iPhone. I can't imagine buying this ultrathin phone and putting a case on it, but I didn't mind Apple's bumper case. Annoyingly, despite using a horizontal camera bar like Google's Pixel phones, the camera still sticks out enough that the Air rocks on a table when you tap a corner—a small nitpick. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The 6.5-inch OLED screen once again feels improbable in this thin and light design. The display now gets brighter, and I had no issues reading it in direct sunlight on clear, sunny days in California and New York. The inclusion of a 120-Hz screen refresh rate on a non-Pro iPhone is long overdue, and it helps this phone feel even more lively. It's not wrong to say that the Air's thin and light design is pretty much all it has going for it, but that quality shouldn't be undervalued. Using this phone has genuinely been a treat over the usual bulky handsets that come my way. However, just how much you're able to enjoy it depends on what kind of battery life you're used to. Apple is not using a silicon-carbon battery in the iPhone Air, despite rumors leading up to the September event. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Air was generally able to last a full day with average use for me. This worked for me, but my expectations were also very low. Heavy users will undoubtedly need to top up this phone during the day. On one travel day, I took the phone off the charger at 5:30 am and used it extensively for navigation, music streaming, phone calls, and Instagram Reeling, and I hit 2 percent by 4:30 pm. If that sounds like a very normal day for you, you'll most certainly feel the limits of this phone's battery life. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I also tested Apple's iPhone Air MagSafe Battery, and it's nice that it snugly fits the Air's body, but it awkwardly has to sit horizontally on other iPhone models. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver a full charge. It took around an hour and 20 minutes to completely deplete the thing, returning 68 percent to the Air from 0 percent. You don't get millimeter-wave 5G support—that's the ultrafast flavor of 5G you'll find in some locations, like dense urban areas, airports, and stadiums. That means the iPhone Air is limited to sub-6 5G, which is what you connect to most of the time, but it's not as speedy as mmWave. It's a little bizarre to spend $999 on a phone and not get both versions of 5G, considering that's just about standard today, but the omission wasn't noticeable in my day-to-day use. I didn't run into any connectivity issues. In my internet speed tests, the C1X modem delivered download and upload speeds that were sometimes faster than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple spent a great deal of time talking about the new vapor chamber cooling system on the iPhone 17 Pro models, but you'll find none of that here. I didn't deal with any thermal issues during normal use because most of what I do on my phone doesn't require immense processing. But my benchmark testing delivered interesting results. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Mind you, all of these iPhones still got hot, but the iPhone 17 Pro's heat was spread out, so it didn't feel as though one spot was very hot. That extra heat throttled performance a tiny bit, making the game a little more stuttery than on the Pro Max. However, Assassin's Creed Mirage performed significantly worse on the iPhone 17 at max graphical settings. It had far more stutters and, dare I say, was a little too annoying to call playable. Most people aren't going to notice any of this because the A19 and A19 Pro are plenty powerful to handle most apps and games with ease. However, folks who play games with demanding graphics will probably want to look to the iPhone 17 Pro models for the best graphical experience (they also have the best battery life, allowing for longer play times). All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Even Samsung was able to stuff an extra ultrawide on the similarly thin Galaxy S25 Edge. In some low-light shots, I found that the iPhone 17's main camera delivered sharper images than the Air sometimes, too. While the iPhone 17 can enjoy macro photography, the iPhone Air can't get as close to subjects. You can snap some great photos with the Air—the upgraded 24-MP selfie camera (binned to 18 MP) is nice—but the camera is just not a focal point. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The Air does have the new square-shaped selfie sensor, which lets you hold the phone in portrait orientation and snap photos in either portrait or landscape without changing your grip! Annoyingly, when you manually tap the landscape button to take a landscape selfie, it turns off Center Stage (the auto-zoom-out and auto-rotate). As usual, video quality on the iPhone Air remains excellent. Dual Capture is another fun new addition that lets you capture video with the front and rear camera simultaneously, and while Samsung has had this feature for years, the video quality is so much better on the iPhone. Most people will be better served by the iPhone 17, which has a better balance of power, battery life, and a more versatile camera system. For anyone who wants a thicker phone with better battery life, well, Apple has given you exactly that in the form of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max. (Also, why does the iPhone Air still only support USB 2 data transfer speeds?) The Air showcases just what Apple is capable of when it controls the chips, hardware, and software, in a thin and light design that might be a bedrock for a potential folding iPhone. I don't doubt that there will be a demographic of people who don't take many photos or don't need heaps of battery life that will enjoy the thin and lightweight iPhone Air, much like the devoted group that loved the iPhone Mini. We'll have to wait and see if the Air sticks around, or if it will shortly be replaced by (a folding) something else. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

The Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code, BASIC, is where I started my coding journey. Sat, aged four or five in front of a Commodore 16, I typed in lines of words and numbers which made up an application or sound effect. The words that I typed, along with “syntax error,” meant nothing to a five-year-old child who wanted sugar-coated cereal and Transformers cartoons, but I persevered. Fast forward to the 21st century, and I still use BASIC from time to time. I write BASIC on a Commodore 64 and a ZX Spectrum that I recently renovated. I've even written BASIC on a Raspberry Pi Pico to control a series of NeoPixels. Recently, Microsoft open-sourced its MOS,6502 BASIC from 1978, and that got me thinking about writing BASIC on a PC. Sure, I remember QBasic and the gorillas.bas game. I loved tweaking that game on my 486 DX33 back in the 1990s, but I wanted to write BASIC on my Windows 10 PC in 2025. I can't use MOS6502 BASIC without spending a lot of time getting it to work on my PC, so what can I use instead? It turns out that there is, and it is called QB64 Phoenix Edition, and it looks and feels just like QBasic, but with many more features. QB64 Phoenix Edition (QB64 PE) is a fresh offshoot of the original QB64 project, which seemed to die out in the early 2020s. The project's goal is to keep the spirit of the old application alive and to provide more people with access to running BASIC on their computers. QB64 PE is cross-platform and it has compatibility with QBasic and QuickBasic 4.5 code. But QB64 PE also gives us an extended BASIC and OpenGL, meaning that we can create applications/games with graphics and sound. So let's take a look at QB64 PE and create our own BASIC project. It really couldn't be any simpler to get started with QB64 PE. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Go to the QB4 PE project page and download the package for your operating system. Extract the file to a directory. Navigate to that directory and double left click on the qb64pe.exe application. The QB64 PE user interface is very much like QBasic. Our project will see us working with the File and Run menu. On first boot, QB64 PE will tell us that the application and any executables made by it can be falsely identified by your anti-virus package. You can optionally whitelist the directory, but I have not had any issues in my testing. QB64 PE is an awesome application, and I urge you to dig into the gloriously in-depth documentation (which is where I found how to show images) and learn more about QB64 PE. The BASIC language has been with us since 1964, and it was developed as a high-level (easy-to-read) language by John G Kemeny, chairman of the Dartmouth College Math Department. The name BASIC came from Thomas Kurtz. The structure of BASIC is meant to be over-simplified on purpose. Each line of BASIC is read by the compiler and turned into bytecode, which the machine can then run. But BASIC can be compiled or interpreted, depending on the version you are using. For example, on the Commodore 64, we see Commodore 64 BASIC V2, a version of Microsoft BASIC, which has a limited number of keywords. Learning BASIC, or any coding language, really, is best done by creating a project. I could sit here and teach you about core programming concepts, or we could have some fun and make a simple game. The game in question is inspired by Usborne's 1980s BASIC coding books, specifically Computer Space Games, which I adored as a child. The game is “Escape from planet LXF329,” and the goal of the game is to take off and escape a group of aliens who are trying to capture the spaceship. You may have spotted “Learn how to display images,” and yes, I will show you how to display a static image on the screen using QB64 PE. In the interest of full disclosure, the images used in the game were generated using Adobe Firefly, an AI service. I could've used stock images or spent some time in GIMP and Inkscape, but I didn't have the time, nor the talent, so Adobe Firefly did the work for me. Create a new blank document and click on File >> Save and save the project as space.bas. Create a new screen object, setting the screen to 1024 x 1024 pixels and 32-bit color, then set the window title to ESCAPE FROM PLANET LXF329”. Create a variable, myImage& and store your image. Create an error handler to check that the image has been loaded correctly. This is basically a conditional check that checks for the loaded file in the variable. If there is nothing there, 0, then it will print an error message. Save the code, and click on Run >> run Only (no EXE) to start the code. Click OK in the dialog to start. Press any key to close the window. Create a label, START: Labels enable us to write code that can jump around to different sections by using a Go To command. You may be familiar with using numbers and jumping to a numbered line. Here ,we are not using numbers, so labels will do the same job. To begin the game code, clear the screen (CLS) and then use a series of print statements to print a narrative to get the reader up to speed on the game mechanics and story. Ensure that the game uses pseudo-random numbers. If we don't do this then the game will pick the same numbers each time. Create two variables, g (gravity) and w (weight), which are random integers, multiplied by 20 and 40, respectively. BASIC uses LET to create variables. Create a third variable to store the correct thrust to leave the planet. Later, comment this out using the REM (remark) keyword. Change to this for the final game Print the planet's gravity and then ask the user to make their thrust calculation. Add a graphic to show your ship losing against the alien onslaught. You will need to create a PNG file, stored in the same directory as the game file. Sleeping for 5 is important; otherwise, there is a bug where the screen automatically closes and ends the game. Then show an image on the screen. They are rewarded with a message and an escape image showing them blasting off into space! Create a means to ask the player if they would like to try again. But note that the variable contains a string ($) which can be y or n. If it is y, the game goes back to the START label. Save the code, and click on Run >> run Only (no EXE) to start the code. Click OK in the dialog to start. Run the game a few times, win and lose. Remember that the answer is printed to the screen, so make sure to comment that out when letting your friends have a go. If you want to share the game with your friends, then you can! Just bear in mind that the resulting executable is bound to the OS it was created with. Additionally, as QB64 PE notes, your executable may be flagged as a false positive by your antivirus. Click on Run >> Make EXE Only. You can also click on Run >> Start to compile and run the code. Wait for the code to compile. On modern systems this will take seconds. I scanned my compiled code using Microsoft Defender and Malwarebytes, and nothing nasty was found.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Located 700 meters underground near the city of Jiangmen in southern China, a giant sphere—35 meters in diameter and filled with more than 20,000 tons of liquid—has just started a mission that will last for decades. This is Juno, the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory, a new, large-scale experiment studying some of the most mysterious and elusive particles known to science. They are fundamental particles, meaning they don't break down into smaller constituent parts, which makes them very small and very light. All of this means that they very often don't interact with other matter they come into contact with, and can pass right through it without affecting it, making them difficult to observe. It's for this reason that they're sometimes referred to as “ghost particles.” They also have the ability to shift (or “oscillate”) between three different forms, also known as “flavors”: electron, mu, and tau. (Note that electron-flavored neutrinos are different from electrons; the latter are a different type of fundamental particle, with a negative charge.) An explainer on neutrino oscillations from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. If physicists had a better understanding of neutrino mass, this could help better describe the behavior and evolution of the universe. Neutrinos can't be seen with conventional particle detectors. Instead, scientists have to look for the rare signs of them interacting with other matter—and this is what Juno's giant sphere is for. One of the main features of Juno, Ranucci explains, is that Juno can “see” both neutrinos and their antimatter counterpart: antineutrinos. The former are typically produced in Earth's atmosphere or by the decay of radioactive materials in Earth's crust, or else arrive from outer space—coming from stars, black holes, supernovae, or even the Big Bang. Antineutrinos, however, are artificially produced, in this case by two nuclear power plants located near the detector. “As they propagate, neutrinos and antineutrinos continue to oscillate, transforming into each other,” Ranucci says. Juno will be able to capture all of these signals, he explains, showing how they oscillate, “with a precision never before achieved.” It's known that the electron-flavored neutrino weighs less than the mu-flavored neutrino, but it's not yet understood whether the third neutrino flavor, tau, weighs more than the other two (in which case, we would speak of a direct hierarchy) or not (in which case, an inverse hierarchy). The collaboration expects that after about six years of data collection, it should have something approaching a statistically significant finding in answer to the question. At a still later stage, it could help solve an even deeper mystery concerning the so-called Majorana neutrino—a theorized particle that has never been observed. (Majorana particles are particles that are simultaneously also their own antiparticles; a Majorana neutrino is therefore both a neutrino and its antineutrino.) Being able to understand whether or not neutrinos are Majorana particles would possibly mean getting to the bottom of one of the most complex questions in modern physics, namely why more matter is observed in the universe than antimatter, for which there is still no complete, coherent, and definitive explanation.
