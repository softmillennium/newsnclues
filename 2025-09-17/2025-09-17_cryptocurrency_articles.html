                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's top adviser on crypto, David Sacks, is working under a "special government employee" status that's meant to be for officials serviing an important but temporary duty with the federal government, and Senator Elizabeth Warren penned a letter with other Democrats in Congress asking him whether he's overstepped that window. Under the rules, any day in which he's done work counts against that 130, though in some agencies, the limit has commonly been governed by a "good faith" estimate of how long the official expects to serve. "If you have worked every business day, your 130th day was July 25, 2025," according to the letter signed by Warren and several other members of the Senate and House of Representatives, including Bernie Sanders. It is only because of your designation as an SGE that you have been able to continue working for and being paid by Craft Ventures during your time in government," read the letter. There have been more than 170 business days since Trump took office. Since then, Sacks has been running the president's aggressive pro-crypto agenda, which has so far celebrated one major new law to regulate U.S. stablecoin issuers — leading to a White House signing ceremony that Sacks attended. He's also acted as the boss of the administration's day-to-day crypto adviser, which had originally been Bo Hines until he left to work for Tether as its top U.S. executive. Patrick Witt replaced Hines as executive director of the President's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, and he told CoinDesk he's still working closely with Sacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dubai/Hong Kong,  September 17, 2025 – MANTRA, the Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for real world assets (RWAs), today announced that its latest mainnet upgrades are now live. With this release, MANTRA has become the first blockchain to support both EVM and CosmWasm smart contracts natively, thereby making it the first true MultiVM layer 1 built specifically for real world assets (RWAs). Coupled with MANTRA Finance's Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the upgrade further strengthens MANTRA's position to compliantly capitalize upon the expanding tokenization market. The upgrades also prepare the network for future enhancements such as permissioned liquidity pools, institutional compliance frameworks, and deeper interoperability with other blockchains. These changes make it easier for developers, investors and asset owners to bring traditional assets onchain and for global investors to access them in a secure, transparent way. As the $16 trillion tokenization opportunity accelerates, institutional adoption has converged on EVM infrastructure. MANTRA has responded by fully embracing EVM compatibility to meet developers and institutions where they are. “With this EVM upgrade, we're not just improving performance, we're further embedding compliance into the protocol, opening the door to a new era of accessibility, trust, and regulatory clarity when tokenizing real world assets. It's another important step toward making the future of finance more open and efficient for everyone.” “This evolution of MANTRA Chain will further our position to meet the market where it is, and where we believe it is headed. Two critical factors that distinguish MANTRA from the competition are our Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), and our compliance-driven infrastructure. Unlike most blockchains, which add compliance via smart contracts, MANTRA enforces regulatory requirements at the protocol level, which provides a significantly higher level of confidence as to compliance versus smart contracts. For developers, it couples the full set of EVM opcodes and precompiles, with low fees, and infrastructure that's been truly optimized for RWA applications. Developers can now deploy Solidity-based dApps directly on MANTRA Chain with no changes required. They can also fork and customize DeFi protocols for RWAs. Soon after they'll be able to bridge funds seamlessly from other EVM chains. Institutions gain access to a chain that is both EVM compatible and self-sovereign, coupled with MANTRA Finance's VASP license from VARA in Dubai  – covering exchange, broker-dealer, and investment services. The mainnet upgrade builds upon a period of rapid momentum for MANTRA. On 21 and 22 October, MANTRA will host Agentic., a two-day summit in Abu Dhabi – the ‘capital of capital' – designed for  leaders driving the next wave of markets, trading, tokenization, and deep financial innovation. With these critical foundations now in place , MANTRA is entering its next chapter,  focusing on scaling adoption, onboarding new asset issuers, and demonstrating how tokenized finance can operate in a secure, transparent, and compliant way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This decision comes after a previous attempt in July to include Anti-CBDC language in the defense spending bill. This adjustment reflects ongoing efforts to regulate the crypto market and curb the development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Both parties in Congress have signaled strong bipartisan support for anti-CBDC measures. This move is designed to align both pieces of legislation in a single package, pushing forward the prohibition of a U.S. CBDC. According to Eleanor Terrett, a business journalist, the merger aims to make the regulatory process more efficient. Well, now they just voted to retroactively combine it back into CLARITY before sending it over to the Senate.… https://t.co/NHMLUq8Gph They argued that it does not mark a major policy shift but reflects a procedural move to facilitate the bill's passage. House Financial Services Chairman French Hill's spokesperson emphasized that the combined bill reflects the chamber's commitment to advancing both priorities. Senate lawmakers are already working on their own version of the legislation, which also includes anti-CBDC language. Senate Democrats have expressed support for the CLARITY Act framework, which further strengthens bipartisan momentum for crypto reforms. This alignment between the two chambers signals growing political backing for tighter digital asset regulations. Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott and Senator Cynthia Lummis are expected to work closely with House lawmakers on advancing the bill. Both sides are focused on ensuring that the final version of the bill can be signed into law. The CLARITY Act aims to provide clearer guidelines for the digital asset industry, which has been facing regulatory uncertainty. This move reflects a broad consensus in Washington on the potential risks of CBDCs. Both the House and Senate are working toward a unified approach to digital asset oversight, though final passage is still uncertain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fintechs like Robinhood and Stripe are building blockchains as Wall Street explores digital assets, but execution bottlenecks still stand in the way of institutional adoption. Financial services app Robinhood recently announced that it is building its own layer-2 blockchain to support tokenized stocks and real-world assets, while Stripe followed with plans for Tempo, a payments-focused chain built with Paradigm. “The fintechs in Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets that have looked into this for many years now are also getting ready to make more moves.” Huang has lived through the stages of crypto's gradual courtship with Wall Street. After starting her career trading foreign exchange and rates in New York, she joined Amber Group in Hong Kong as its managing partner and helped scale it into one of Asia's largest crypto liquidity providers during the decentralized finance (DeFi) boom. Since leaving Amber Group, Huang has turned her focus to solving the execution bottleneck. With Altius Labs, she is building a modular execution layer designed to plug directly into existing blockchains, boosting throughput without forcing projects to rebuild their entire stack. Related: Firedancer will speed up Solana, but it won't reach full potential On June 27, 2025, Wall Street showed just how big the performance gap is between modern blockchains and traditional finance infrastructure. The exchange's INET system is advertised to handle more than 1 million order messages per second with sub-40-microsecond latency. By contrast, blockchains still operate at a fraction of that speed. Ethereum processes about 15 transactions per second with block times of around 12 seconds. Solana — one of the fastest major networks — has a roughly 400-millisecond block time and handles several thousand transactions per second in practice. Even at their best, those figures don't meet the benchmarks institutions expect before shifting meaningful trading activity onchain. Blockchains have improved scaling, with Ethereum L2s offloading traffic to rollups. Solana's next-generation validator client, Firedancer, aims to narrow the gap further. Huang claimed that the industry should not expect more “Ethereum killers” or general-purpose blockchains to emerge, adding that users prefer to consolidate around a few dominant platforms rather than scatter across dozens of new chains. Though the next wave of institutional adoption calls for improvements on existing blockchain networks, Wall Street hasn't waited for these technical upgrades before piling into the digital gold rush. For many large investors, exposure has come indirectly through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or corporate treasuries. Throughout 2025, struggling firms latched onto the “Bitcoin treasury” narrative as a last-ditch way to spark investor enthusiasm. Some briefly saw their stock prices surge, only to retrace soon after. Huang said these pivots can be risky, especially for retail investors, because not all corporate Bitcoin strategies are structured the same way. Related: Bitcoin treasury flops: These firms fumbled their BTC bets But if you look closer, investors still prefer MicroStrategy over an ETF for a few reasons,” Huang said. “First, because Michael Saylor has been accumulating for a longer period, their average cost basis is lower. Second, they've done several rounds of fundraising through convertible bonds, which introduces leverage. Huang also said that while ETF options exist for Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), investors who want altcoin exposure often turn to debt strategies instead. Fintechs like Robinhood and Stripe are becoming the next stage of institutional blockchain commitment. Rather than adding crypto tickers to trading apps, they are now investing in their own blockchains — a step toward embedding digital assets into their core infrastructure. Over-the-counter desks, once discreet on-ramps for hedge funds to buy Bitcoin off-exchange, are now positioning themselves as regulated liquidity providers. In practice, that means offering the compliance, settlement and reporting standards that institutional clients expect, bringing crypto one step closer to Wall Street norms. “What we're seeing now — and I expect even more going forward — is a trend of institutions adopting stablecoins or even building their own blockchains for specific use cases,” Huang said. These are conversations she was having with institutional players four years ago at Amber Group.

RELI enters crypto market with initial Ethereum purchase as part of new treasury diversification strategy, signaling significant strategic shift. RELI's initial Ethereum purchase marks a substantial strategic pivot for an insurance-focused company. This treasury diversification into digital assets represents more than just a financial move—it signals the company's belief in blockchain's transformative potential for both finance and insurance industries. By planning incremental purchases across multiple cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana), RELI is taking a measured approach to building exposure while managing volatility risks inherent to digital assets. This suggests a potential future integration between their InsurTech operations and decentralized finance capabilities, which could create competitive differentiation if executed effectively. However, investors should recognize the significant risk profile shift this represents. The company is allocating capital reserves to highly volatile assets, introducing new regulatory uncertainties, custody challenges, and potential accounting complexities. LAKEWOOD, NJ, Sept.  17, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reliance Global Group, Inc. (Nasdaq: RELI) (“Reliance”, “we” or the “Company”) today announced that it has completed its first digital asset purchase under its recently launched Digital Asset Treasury (“DAT”) initiative, acquiring Ethereum (ETH). The purchase represents the initial step in Reliance's broader plan to build a diversified digital asset portfolio, with future investments expected to include leading cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. The Company plans to fund these activities through a combination of cash reserves and other approved corporate financing tools. Reliance's DAT initiative is structured to pursue long-term capital appreciation through blockchain-based participation. Ezra Beyman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Reliance Global Group, stated, “This first Ethereum transaction is an important milestone for Reliance as we expand into digital assets. It demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our operational systems – covering custody, governance, accounting, and compliance – are equipped to support this strategy on a larger scale. Reliance expects to continue purchasing Ethereum and other digital assets in measured increments, applying a disciplined approach to capital allocation as the treasury position develops over time.” With the added oversight of our Crypto Advisory Board, we are confident this strategy provides shareholders with a forward-looking opportunity while maintaining our focus on responsible execution and risk management.” Reliance has a longstanding history of leveraging artificial intelligence, data mining, and innovative distribution models to deliver competitive, technology-enabled insurance solutions through RELI Exchange and 5MinuteInsure.com.

The move comes amid debate about whether mainland China should follow Hong Kong's footsteps and embrace stablecoins

Shanghai, mainland China's financial centre, has become one of the first cities in the country to use an overseas cryptocurrency trading platform to reprice and sell more than 90,000 filecoins – a blockchain-based storage token – that were seized in criminal cases.

A district-level court partnered with a third-party institution in mainland China, which sold the cryptocurrency on a licensed platform in Hong Kong, according to an announcement by Shanghai's Supreme People's Court on Tuesday.

The proceeds from the sale were transferred to a court-controlled bank account and will be allocated to the national treasury or refunded to the victims, in line with legal procedures.

But there have been discussions among market players and academics about whether mainland China should emulate Hong Kong – which introduced its first stablecoin ordinance on August 1 – to promote the offshore adoption of the yuan.

Handling crypto assets in cases involving Chinese citizens and companies also presents new challenges for the judiciary.

The Anti-CBDC Act, which delivers a direct signal barring the Federal Reserve from creating a retail central bank digital currency, was first introduced by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer. The bill, however, passed largely along party lines, reflecting Republican concerns that a digital dollar could expand government surveillance of financial transactions. By contrast, the CLARITY Act, which aims to settle disputes between the SEC and CFTC by clearly defining how digital assets should be classified, whether as securities, commodities, or stablecoins, won broader bipartisan support. Meanwhile, committee leaders initially resisted efforts to merge the bills, fearing that doing so would weaken Democratic support for the market structure reforms.

With cyber attacks regularly in the news, we are reminding businesses to check they have the appropriate security measures in place to protect personal information.

Businesses experienced an estimated 7.7 million cyber crimes over the past year, according to government figures. Most small businesses hold personal information and conduct business digitally, so cyber security must be a priority.

Ian Hulme, Executive Director for Regulatory Supervision at the ICO, said:

“Cyber attacks have been hitting the headlines again recently, serving as a timely reminder for all businesses to check their own security measures. When people share their personal information with your company, they need to feel confident you'll do as much as possible to keep that information secure.

“While cyber attacks can be very sophisticated, we find that many organisations are still neglecting the very foundations of cyber security. As the data protection regulator, we want to support organisations to get this right and these simple steps will help to protect both your customers and your business.” 

Here are some practical steps businesses and their staff can take to improve their data security and resilience:

If an organisation experiences a data breach as a result of a cyber attack, they should report it to us within 72 hours of becoming aware of it.

For more advice on protecting personal information, visit our security guidance for organisations.

For further support on cyber security, visit the National Cyber Security Centre's website and the Cyber Essentials programme, a Government-backed certification scheme that helps keep your organisation's - and your customers' - data safe from cyber attacks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This innovation builds on a combination of ZKP and IronCAP™, 01 Quantum's NIST approved post-quantum cryptography. This is important for crypto as it allows multiple complicated verifications combined into a single fast and compact verification. This dual-layer approach allows for secure validation of quantum-resistant transactions on existing blockchains, without requiring a new Layer 1 chain or a dedicated validator network. According to CoinMarketCap the global crypto market is now valued at $3.8 trillion (including stablecoins) and with quantum-resistant timelines for financial infrastructure being accelerated at regulators, ensures the long-term security of digital assets is becoming an even more critical concern. This is significant as the GENIUS Act passed in July 2025 in the U.S. requires stablecoins to be backed 1-for-1 with cash or short-term debt making stablecoins a major source for U.S. Treasuries. Although the market has reached significant maturity, it remains exposed to quantum threats due to reliance on classical cryptographic algorithms like ECDSA. 01 Quantum and qLABS are addressing this vulnerability by delivering QCW that integrates seamlessly with existing blockchain infrastructure, improving security without sacrificing interoperability or performance. For Technical details refer to the QCW white paper https://qlabs.gitbook.io/quantum-crypto-wrapper-by-01-quantum-inc./. "Combining years of experience in post-quantum cybersecurity, collaboration with NIST, and commercial software engineering, we are excited providing to qLABS our QCW technology for the crypto industry including stablecoins. Combining ZKP with enterprise-grade post-quantum cryptography for blockchain security is very novel and secure," said Andrew Cheung, CEO of 01 Quantum. It is important to understand that encrypted data being harvested today can be stored with the intent to decrypt it once quantum capabilities mature. Without proactive defenses, today's assets could be compromised tomorrow." "qLABS is not waiting for quantum attacks to arrive, we are preparing the crypto industry now," said Tony G, President of qLABS. In anticipation of this, and the growing risk of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks where encrypted data is stockpiled for future quantum decryption, global technology leaders are already adopting post-quantum cryptographic methods. Yet crypto remains largely exposed, with most public blockchains vulnerable to quantum-based key extraction techniques. 01 Quantum Inc., formerly 01 Communique Laboratory Inc., (TSXV: ONE) (OTCQB: OONEF), is known for its innovative work in post-quantum cybersecurity and remote access solutions. IronCAP™'s technologies are patent-protected in the U.S.A. by its patents #11,271,715 and #11,669,833. The Company's remote access business unit provides its customers with a suite of secure remote access services and products under its I'm InTouch and I'm OnCall product offerings. qLABS is the first quantum-native crypto foundation, developing blockchain solutions that are resistant to quantum computing threats. With a focus on post-quantum security, qLABS builds infrastructure that will protect Web3 from Q-Day and beyond.

Signatories included The City of London Corporation, The Payments Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, and UK Crypto Business Council. In August, former Chancellor George Osborne warned that the country risked “being completely left behind” by other countries that have forged ahead with dedicated legislation for the sector. In its defence, the Labour government has signalled its intent to integrate crypto into the U.K.'s financial system with new regulation. Draft legislation  published earlier this year would establish a clear framework for digital assets and stablecoins. Ultimately, however, success will rest on how the proposed changes are implemented. One key question is where the U.K.'s crypto regulation will sit within emerging international frameworks. firms could face fragmented regulatory environments, reduced access to deep transatlantic markets, and increasing competitive pressures.” According to the Times, Chancellor Rachel Reeves discussed closer coordination on digital asset regulation with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday. If it materializes, a transatlantic crypto deal could be announced after Prime Minister Kier Starmer meets with President Trump on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Students are responsible for most school data breaches in the United Kingdom, according to a new report by the U.K. Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Alarmingly, nearly a third (30%) of the cyber incidents stemmed from leaked, compromised, or weak credentials, of which students were responsible for 97%. Nevertheless, the U.K. privacy regulator warned that students involved in school data breaches could be on the path to cybercrime. As to how the students obtained these passwords, the ICO says that they either guessed them or found them written on pieces of paper. Nevertheless, the ICO warned that breaking into school computer systems was setting up teenagers for a life of cybercrime. The study follows a damning report by the U.K.'s National Crime Agency (NCA) stating that one in five minors between 10 and 16 years was engaging in illegal online activity. “Teen hackers are commonly English-speaking males, and around 5% of 14-year-old boys and girls admit to hacking,” the privacy regulator stated. Reasons for hacking include dares, gaining notoriety, financial gain, revenge, and teen rivalries. However, some students expressed genuine interest in IT and cyber security. Meanwhile, the report also found that negligence played a significant role in school data breaches, including some involving students. For example, the ICO reported that nearly a quarter (23%) of school data breaches stemmed from poor data protection practices, such as staff illegitimately accessing data, unattended devices, and students using staff computers. Similarly, a fifth (20%) of data breaches occurred due to staff sending private data to personal devices, while 17% stemmed from poor access rights configuration. “There are a couple of takeaways from this news,” said Pete Luban, Field CISO at AttackIQ. “The most important is that educational institutions must do a better job of protecting sensitive information. Proper cyber hygiene protocols, such as strengthening passwords and removing student access to them, would solve a large portion of the problems.” However, 5% of school data breaches stemmed from insiders using sophisticated attacks that circumvent security and network controls. “For the smaller portion of incidents that required more advanced technical skills, schools need to evaluate their cyber defense systems and implement proactive measures that are able to close the gaps that students were exploiting,” Luban added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shane Molidor, founder of crypto investment bank and advisory firm Forgd, told DL News that the cyclical nature of Bitcoin and altcoin markets means investors “will likely rebalance incrementally, allocating capital to altcoins.” The comments come as Bitcoin has dominated this cycle with roaring record prices and hype on Wall Street. Investors have ploughed almost $10 billion into Bitcoin exchange-trading funds so far this year, according to SoSoValue. Those funds are run by the likes of investment behemoth BlackRock. At the same time, CoinMarketCap's alt season index is at 71, up from just 44 last month, while Coinglass' tracker reached 80 out of 100, suggesting that altcoins are gaining momentum. Investors see an interest rate cut as all but certain, according to the CME FedWatch tool. As risk appetite grows, “we are likely to see a drill-down approach, whereby the top-ranking layer 2 and ecosystem tokens by TVL, volume, and protocol revenue become prime candidates for [treasury] inclusion,” Molidor said. While most traders are betting that the US central bank will slash borrowing costs by 0.25%, there is a small chance that it goes even deeper with a 0.5% cut. A bigger cut may trigger “a significant rally in crypto since no one is truly expecting it,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV global, said in comments shared with DL News. By issuing debt and buying crypto, digital asset treasuries, or DATs, create a reflexive flywheel for price action, Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive, said. Annabelle Huang, founder of execution layer Altius, told DL News that momentum behind altcoin treasuries “will likely continue for high quality altcoins with sustainable revenue, at least as long as the DATs themselves have a sound structure, and continue to have access to cheap funding.” Treasury firms are likely to pick tokens from battle-tested blockchains with sustainable tokenomics, an active ecosystem, and healthy user metrics, Huang argued But “momentum will fizzle quickly for firms that don't meet these two requirements,” she added. The alts most likely to benefit from treasury firms seeking to capture extra upside are household-names like “Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Sui, along with their top performing ecosystem tokens,” Molidor said. Last week, crypto got its biggest endorsement yet from the US government. Paul Atkins, Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, declared that “crypto's time has come” and vowed to end years of hostility from the oversight agency. The SEC's Project Crypto initiative “will clarify that most crypto tokens are not securities, create a unified regulatory umbrella for trading, lending, and staking platforms,” dispelling years of controversy on altcoins. The agency is currently reviewing more than 90 exchange-traded products, including altcoin applications for cryptocurrencies such as Solana, XRP, and Litecoin. The SEC's decision deadline for several of those applications begins in mid-October, with analysts like Balchunas predicting high approval chances for major altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. For a full-scale altcoin rally like in past cycles, both profit rotation and confidence are key, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of crypto exchange Bitpanda, told DL News. “Once Bitcoin consolidates and investors begin rotating capital into higher-risk assets, we tend to see altcoins move more aggressively,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump signs the GENIUS Act into law in July 2025. On both sides of the Atlantic, regulated stablecoin issuers must also hold reserves in a conservative, one-for-one ratio against all stablecoins in circulation. Deposits are held in a bankruptcy-protected structure on issuers' balance sheets. This prevents payment stablecoins and e-money tokens from straying into securities or capital markets territory, which would necessitate a separate set of rules to regulate broader crypto markets and market conduct. Each framework also imposes obligations on crypto exchanges and the broader value chain through which stablecoins reach end users. In Europe, for example, exchanges faced a stablecoin “fiscal cliff” deadline requiring the de-listing of non-compliant tokens by 30 December 2024. In the US, GENIUS introduces criminal penalties for falsely advertising non-compliant products. As with MiCA, compliance under GENIUS requires would-be stablecoin issuers to establish a locally regulated entity subject to the full spectrum of rules. In key respects, the GENIUS Act is even more conservative than MiCA. It eschews bank-related risks by prohibiting issuers from holding longer maturity bonds in their reserves. It also doesn't require either 30 or 60% of reserves to be held in banks, which could introduce credit risks from banking into stablecoin activities. Moreover, under GENIUS, banks are required to issue payment stablecoins from a separate entity and balance sheet that's set apart from its core banking business. And when it comes to oversight, in the EU, e-money token issuers can be licensed and supervised by national competent authorities, but once they surpass certain thresholds of size, circulation or reach, they must “graduate” to pan-European co-supervision by the European Banking Authority. In all cases, payment stablecoin issuers are held to a common set of rules. However, GENIUS goes one step further than MiCA in this area by empowering and encouraging the US Department of the Treasury to pursue regulatory passporting and harmonization with comparable jurisdictions. This opens the door for US-regulated issuers to expand internationally with the backing of a home-court regulator, while international issuers from credible jurisdictions with substantially similar regimes – like the EU – may gain continued access to US markets without having to establish separate US entities. The original concerns that gave rise to MiCA, GENIUS, and the broader central bank digital currency (CBDC) space race were fears of big tech taking over money. But both EU and US regimes are unequivocal: Public authorities on both sides of the Atlantic will not permit another big tech vanity coin such as the ill-fated Libra project, which animated concerted global efforts at crypto rulemaking. The GENIUS Act goes further by creating a special committee, chaired by the Treasury Secretary and other banking principals, with authority to approve or block any big tech or commercial payment stablecoin structure.

However, only a handful of altcoins have risen alongside them. At a glance, it seems all's right with the crypto world. In reality, many altcoins, which are essentially any cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin (BTC), have not recovered. If you'd invested $200 in each of the top 20 altcoins four years ago, your original $4,000 investment would be worth around $2,840 today, per CoinMarketCap data. Let's dive into why so many altcoins have underperformed, and whether they may yet recover. Bitcoin may be soaring, but if we compare crypto prices from Sept. 9, 2021 with the same day four years on, only five of the top 20 altcoins have gained in value. The five altcoins that have gained value since September 2021 are: Stellar and XRP are both blockchain payment solutions providers that could benefit from a surge in stablecoin usage. Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Solana are all smart-contract cryptos with ecosystems where stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications get built. Another positive driver was the SEC's decision to drop its cases against Ripple Labs and Binance. This move lifted a lot of uncertainty around the XRP and BNB tokens connected to each company, and, to some degree, explains why these two cryptos have seen the biggest returns. In cryptocurrency's short history, we've seen two big altcoin seasons. The first was in 2017 and 2018, after thousands of projects used ICOs -- initial coin offerings -- to raise capital. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot Ethereum ETFs was a game changer, as it made it easier for both institutions and retail investors to add the top two cryptos to their portfolios. According to CoinGlass, there's $170 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs right now. The focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum is one reason that other crypto hopefuls from 2021 have struggled to regain momentum. Some have also had technical difficulties or leadership issues. Others lost ground to competitors, while Terra (LUNA) collapsed completely. Here are the altcoin leaders from September 2021 that have lost value since then: Two of the rallying cries you'll often find on crypto channels are "Buy the dip," and "HODL -- Hold On For Dear Life." Similarly, holding is often a great strategy, but if you no longer see potential in the project, it may be time to sell your crypto. The coins above tell different stories and have to be evaluated in their own right. Just one of the original founders remains, and it will take some nifty footwork to get it back into the top 20 cryptos. In contrast, Chainlink could be on the edge of an exciting new chapter. There are good reasons to think it might benefit from a surge in stablecoin and DeFi activity. It's unlikely we'll see another altcoin season per se. Today's economy is very different from what it was four years ago, as is the crypto market -- not least because there are so many more cryptocurrencies. Coinbase (COIN -2.25%) CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that there are around a million new tokens created every week. The sheer volume makes it hard to imagine a repeat of 2021's crypto frenzy, where cash flowed into every corner of the market. Projects with utility and active user communities may succeed, particularly as cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream. What's more likely is that we'll see a different type of altcoin season later this year, based on quality projects and, potentially, driven by increased institutional investment into altcoin ETFs. That risk is even higher with less established projects. They tend to have less liquidity, a shorter track record, and can be speculative. Several projects that looked promising four years ago now look unlikely to recover. If you want to buy altcoins, make sure that crypto only accounts for a small part of your overall portfolio, and that your crypto investments themselves are diversified.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"We are talking about a very dystopian future if we allow central banks to issue central bank digital currencies. You know, even if the original designers and heads of central banks who are launching this are super well-meaning, you know, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, we just know what human nature is like and history is the best guide... The micromanaging decision [about your spending] will then be automated and... you have no right to appeal the algorithm... You just won't be able to use your money for certain things and then there is nothing that you can do... That by definition ends freedom...." -- Richard A. Werner, German economist, 2024, The Biden administration was actively working towards an American CBDC, but in May 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prevent the Federal Reserve from introducing a CBDC. Shortly after coming into office, President Donald Trump banned the establishment of a CBDC in the United States. In Europe, the European Union is barreling ahead at full speed towards a central bank digital currency for those EU countries that are part of the eurozone, which includes the majority of EU countries. Yet, the dangers of this euro CBDC are nowhere near being discussed in mainstream European media. Meanwhile, real crimes, such as the mass-rape of thousands of children over the past 20 years, in Rotherham and other cities, remain rampant and largely unaddressed. In Canada, during Covid-19 when the truckers went to Ottawa peacefully to protest government pandemic restrictions, then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau simply invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to force banks to freeze the truckers' bank accounts. Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, has admitted that CBDCs will give governments total control: "[I]n cash, we don't know, for example, who is using a $100 bill today; we don't know who is using a 1000 peso bill today. Your money will no longer be yours, but more like a credit or account that you will have with the government and that you will only have access to on condition that you follow the rules, whatever they might be. Globalist leaders are working at full speed to introduce central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Several of those dreams are already a reality, including shutting down dissent and free speech, as in Europe, where people are routinely fined and arrested for saying things their governments do not like. A host of other controlling measures are already in the works, including herding people into "15-minute cities" where it is easier to monitor them, keep tabs on their use of private cars, decide what they can and cannot eat – ideally "ecologically preferable" bugs and lab-grown meat, no beef or cheese -- track their "carbon footprints", determine where and how they can travel, oversee their vaccines and so on. The Oxford-educated, German economist Richard A. Werner said in an interview last year. This is the ultimate step because the powers of CBDCs are so extraordinary that, I mean, even the worst dictators of past centuries could only have dreamt of having such enormous power over the lives of so many people. "We are talking about a very dystopian future if we allow central banks to issue central bank digital currencies. You know, even if the original designers and heads of central banks who are launching this are super well-meaning, you know, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, we just know what human nature is like and history is the best guide... "The micromanaging decision [about your spending] will then be automated and... you have no right to appeal the algorithm... You just won't be able to use your money for certain things and then there is nothing that you can do... That by definition ends freedom.... "Dictators like Stalin and other dictators, they could only have dreamt of, you know, the enormous power that central bank digital currencies give to central planners... We are talking about dystopian digital prisons that will be created through central bank digital currencies, because the programmability – and this has been mentioned in the studies by the central banks – include of course geography, and there is this proposal for climate change, whatever reasons, that people... should stay within their 15-minute walking small local area... and there will be digital controls... when you walk with all your RFID chips in your cards and your CBDC anyway, of course you will be immediately recognized if you're out of the area and you will be punished. CBDCs will indeed be "programmable": In 2021, the Bank of England asked for ministers to have the final word on whether a central bank digital currency should be "programmable", meaning that the central bank would have a veto over how people would spend their money, the Telegraph reported: "Tom Mutton, a director at the Bank of England, said during a conference on Monday that programming could become a key feature of any future central bank digital currency, in which the money would be programmed to be released only when something happened." "There could be some socially beneficial outcomes from that, preventing activity which is seen to be socially harmful in some way. But at the same time it could be a restriction on people's freedoms. Not only is such a scenario horrifying beyond words, but half the world is already hurtling towards this nightmare: A study by the Atlantic Council last year found that 134 countries – including the U.S. at the time – were pursuing central bank digital currencies, with almost half of those countries at an advanced stage in this process. The Biden administration was actively working towards an American CBDC, but in May 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill to prevent the Federal Reserve from introducing a CBDC. Shortly after coming into office, President Donald Trump banned the establishment of a CBDC in the United States. In Europe, the European Union is barreling ahead at full speed towards a central bank digital currency for those EU countries that are part of the eurozone, which includes the majority of EU countries. Yet, the dangers of this euro CBDC are nowhere near being discussed in mainstream European media. Meanwhile, real crimes, such as the mass-rape of thousands of children over the past 20 years, in Rotherham and other cities, remain rampant and largely unaddressed. Those who control CBDCs will not only be able to fine and arrest you, as they do today, but also to simply cut off your money. Are you eating beef or cheese beyond your carbon allowance? You will have to buy bugs or fake meat instead, as the state will cut off your purchasing freedom. In Canada, during Covid-19 when the truckers went to Ottawa peacefully to protest government pandemic restrictions, then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau simply invoked the Emergencies Act, which allowed the government to force banks to freeze the truckers' bank accounts. Carbon trackers already exist, 15-minute cities are being implemented, in the UK, for example, and the Covid-19 vaccine passports proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that governments will take harsh measures to exclude from society those who refuse to comply with whatever madness du jour the governments seek to impose on its citizens. Agustin Carstens, General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, sometimes known as the bank of all central banks, has admitted that CBDCs will give governments total control: "[I]n cash, we don't know, for example, who is using a $100 bill today; we don't know who is using a 1000 peso bill today. Last year, British MP Danny Kruger asked a representative of the UK Treasury what a CBDC is good for and what problem it is meant to solve. It's to keep track with the reality of how we all purchase and save and do our work with our goods." Notably, there is at least some coordination among governments across the West on this totalitarian agenda. In order to introduce CBDCs you need digital IDs, and digital IDs were meant to be introduced with the vaccine passport or health passport, which is a form of digital ID... The Covid policies... every country in the world seemed to have the same policies, well mostly certainly in Europe and North America, and so there was an extraordinary degree of coordination that was revealed to us, and clearly that did not come from any democratic process, but somehow top-down from behind the scenes... and that's really another reason why we should be against CBDCs; they've shown us what they're going to do... "There is already various credit and debit cards that have the functionality that your spending will be analyzed and you get a report on an ongoing basis of how much CO2 emissions are involved in your spending... Mastercard... is offering that." CO2, however, will more than likely turn out to be just a tiny excuse for the extreme power that governments will be wielding if they get CBDCs into our hands. Your money will no longer be yours, but more like a credit or account that you will have with the government and that you will only have access to on condition that you follow the rules, whatever they might be. In his "Manifesto of the Communist Party," published in 1848, Karl Marx actually called for a national bank, as something that would help bring about "socialism-communism": "Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly," he wrote of the "fifth measure" necessary to bring about Communism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Move Industries, the company behind the Movement project, revealed plans on Tuesday to transition into a Layer 1 network from a sidechain, aiming to deliver performance improvements and enable native token staking. In a thread of X posts on Tuesday, Move Industries said it has hit its ceiling as a sidechain, and a Move-based L1 can help reach 10,000 transactions per second at sub-second latency. It allows for enum types, index notation, compound statement, and more," the company added. The planned L1 network is set to feature native staking, supported by a validator network that helps secure Movement. Under this new design, locked MOVE tokens would be excluded from staking eligibility. The project noted that the migration is expected to be seamless for users, requiring no action on their part. All existing funds, smart contracts, and network activity are set to carry over unchanged. Onchain activity on Movement has accelerated in recent months. Movement's total value locked climbed to $200.6 million as of Wednesday, up from $156.2 million at the start of September, according to Defilama data. MOVE, the native token of Movement, climbed 1.9% in the past 24 hours to trade at around $0.13 as of 3:30 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to The Block's price page. It has a market capitalization of $349 million. In May, Movement Labs dismissed co-founder Rushi Manche after revelations of a controversial market-making scandal involving 66 million MOVE tokens, about 5% of the supply. The company then restructured under new leadership as Move Industries, led by early employees Torab You and Will Gaines, pledging greater transparency and stronger community engagement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weak passwords and poor data protection practices are often the way in When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has warned that students are increasingly behind insider cyber attacks in UK schools and colleges. It found 57% of incidents were caused by students. Nearly a third stemmed from stolen or guessed login details, with pupils responsible for 97% of these cases. While Hollywood has portrayed teenage hackers with a degree of glamour in films such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off or Hackers, the reality described by the ICO is both more mundane and more damaging. Children are not breaking into systems but rather logging in, often by exploiting weak passwords or taking advantage of poor data protection practices. One case highlighted by the ICO showed how quickly curiosity can turn into a serious breach. “A student unlawfully accessed a college's information management system, then viewed, amended or deleted personal information belonging to more than 9,000 staff, students and applicants. The ICO found 23% of incidents in the education sector were caused by poor data protection practices, such as staff accessing records without a legitimate need, leaving devices unattended, or allowing pupils to use staff devices. Another 20% involved staff sending data to personal accounts, while 17% came from poorly configured access rights. “Whilst education settings are experiencing large numbers of cyber attacks, there is still growing evidence that ‘insider threat' is poorly understood, largely unremedied and can lead to future risk of harm and criminality,” Heather Toomey, Principal Cyber Specialist, said. Parents are also being encouraged to talk openly with their children about online behavior, with the aim of steering curiosity into positive channels rather than criminal activity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This move merges the previously separated bills and sets the stage for their next step: Senate review. Although this action may be largely symbolic, it serves as an ongoing effort by the House to advance the Anti-CBDC bill alongside broader crypto regulations. The Anti-CBDC bill, introduced by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), is intended to prohibit the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. This bill passed largely along party lines, with most Republican members supporting it. On the other hand, the bipartisan CLARITY Act, designed to overhaul cryptocurrency market regulation, gained support from both parties, including 78 Democrats. Well, now they just voted to retroactively combine it back into CLARITY before sending it over to the Senate.… https://t.co/NHMLUq8Gph Their concerns stemmed from fears that merging the two bills could jeopardize bipartisan support for the CLARITY Act. Despite these objections, a faction of GOP hard-liners pushed for combining the Anti-CBDC bill with the CLARITY Act to advance both measures. A spokesperson for House Financial Services Chairman French Hill stated that this combination was a significant move in advancing the goals of both bills. “By combining both measures and sending them to the Senate, the House continues to advance both priorities,” said Brooke Nethercott, Hill's spokesperson. While this action is intended to send a strong message to the Senate, it may not change much in terms of legislative impact. The Senate's bill, called the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, will likely be debated separately and will require broad support to pass. The combined Anti-CBDC bill and CLARITY Act will be sent to the Senate, where its fate will be determined. With both chambers of Congress working on separate but related legislation, the ultimate resolution on the Anti-CBDC bill may take time to unfold.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital asset treasuries face pressure as market values decline, but Ethereum-focused vehicles could benefit from staking advantages and sustain growth. Digital asset treasuries have come under renewed pressure after a sharp drop in their market net asset values, or mNAVs, raising doubts about their ability to sustain continued crypto purchases, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered. Listed companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheets, known as digital asset treasuries, or DATs, have seen share prices decline in recent weeks as investors reassess the sustainability of their strategies. Kendrick said that an mNAV above 1 is essential for DATs to expand their holdings, while values below that threshold signal weaker balance sheets and potential consolidation. Factors such as access to low-cost funding, scale advantages, and yield from staking or DeFi are expected to separate stronger players from weaker ones. Ethereum-focused DATs are seen as the most sustainable, partly because staking returns can directly enhance mNAVs. Bitmine strategist Tom Lee has estimated that staking alone could add 0.6 points to the mNAV of Ethereum-based DATs. This dynamic positions Ethereum vehicles more favorably than those tied primarily to Bitcoin or Solana, which lack similar yield mechanics. Kendrick said consolidation is more likely among Bitcoin treasuries, leading to coin rotation rather than net new buying. By contrast, Ethereum DATs are poised to keep accumulating, providing a stronger tailwind for ether prices relative to rivals. Key players in the sector include Bitmine, SharpLink, and The Ether Machine, all of which have become closely watched by investors who track the intersection of corporate balance sheets and digital assets.
