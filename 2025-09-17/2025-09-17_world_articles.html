If you like this story, sign up for The Lever's free newsletter. The provision was drafted by a lawmaker who has received significant contributions from defense industry giants, including Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon). The push comes as the lines between military operations and immigration enforcement — historically a hazy distinction — become further blurred under Trump. The Trump administration has sent thousands more active-duty troops to aid border operations and established several so-called “national defense areas” along the southern border, granting military personnel new arrest powers from Arizona to Texas, all while deploying the National Guard and the Marines to Los Angeles to quell resistance. The private firms profiting from ICE's raids and sprawling detention system  are often shadowy, offering little transparency to the public even as they are accused of misconduct and abuses. For most of the 20th century, the military's formal role in border enforcement was limited, in part due to a long-standing federal statute that bars the United States military from enforcing domestic laws (a doctrine Trump has been accused of flouting in recent weeks). The Department of Defense, through decades-old operations like Joint Task Force North, collaborates directly with immigration authorities. National Guard troops have regularly been deployed to the southern border. This provision was added to the bill as an amendment in a July committee hearing by Rep. Pat Fallon (R-Texas), who defended it to fellow lawmakers as a “common sense” cost-saving measure. The military is already involved in all sorts of border operations, Fallon explained, and “many of these roles currently filled by military personnel could be filled by contractors for, here's the key, a fraction of the cost.” The agency, he said, estimated that outsourcing its border operations roles — “logistics, monitoring, transportation, data entry, and more” — would save the military hundreds of millions a year. Yet despite Fallon's lip service to savings, critics say such a provision would likely be a windfall for the defense industry. “It's just another stream of money for companies,” said William Hartung, senior research fellow at the nonprofit Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which analyzes defense policy and spending. Among the firms poised to benefit, he said, are Palantir and Anduril, two defense contractors that work closely with the Department of Homeland Security on border surveillance. Other defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin already take in hundreds of billions from the Pentagon; the agency paid out an estimated $2.4 trillion to its private vendors between 2020 and 2024, more than half of its discretionary spending. The cash flow has, in turn, created a powerful lobby that is constantly looking to expand opportunities to drain the government's coffers. Fallon has received tens of thousands in campaign contributions from defense industry firms, including, just this year, thousands from RTX, Lockheed Martin, and General Dynamics, three of the Pentagon's biggest vendors. Fallon's amendment drew some opposition from Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) warned at the hearing that the provision would “grant the Pentagon open-ended authority to hire troops and private military contractors for routine border enforcement,” as well as divert even more federal dollars to border operations amid Trump's historic immigration enforcement spending blitz. “It's pretty novel,” said Hedtler-Gaudette of the Project on Government Oversight. The Pentagon has a long history of working with unaccountable defense contractors, particularly overseas, he explained. Now, this could be a situation of “Blackwater on the border,” he said, referencing a private military contractor accused of war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Inviting private companies into border security efforts would create a powerful lobby for perpetuating this unprecedented and ever-expanding level of border militarization that we are seeing under this administration,” she said. This would make it “much harder to bring that level back down in the future.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

Israel has “already begun negotiations with the Americans” on a “business plan” to make Gaza, home to 2.2 million Palestinians, into a real estate investment. The plan is on President Donald Trump's desk, he claims. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. He said that, because of these proposals, the genocide “pays for itself,” saying that Israel has “paid a lot of money” to wage its assault. The U.S. has been considering a plan, called the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust, or GREAT Trust, to relocate and potentially expel the entire population of Gaza to other countries. This token could be used for relocation or “eventually redeemed for an apartment in one of six to eight new ‘AI-powered, smart cities' to be built in Gaza,” the Washington Post reported this month. BCG calculated that the plan would be extremely lucrative financially, turning back four times its initial investment of $100 billion, according to the plan. However, Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) and Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) recently said in a report that that is a lie, and that it was clear from their visit to Israel and Palestine last month that Israel is preparing to expel the entire population of Palestinians from Gaza in an ethnic cleansing campaign.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When President Donald Trump enters St. George's Hall for the grand finale of his state visit at Windsor Castle Wednesday night, someone he is suing will be seated at the end of the dinner table: Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch, a familiar face at state dinners in the past, is currently locked in a major legal battle with Trump, who is suing the powerful owner of the Wall Street Journal after it reported on a suggestive birthday letter given to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Trump's name. The Journal did so anyway, and Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit seeking $20 billion in damages and Murdoch's testimony. Despite that, according to a preview of the dinner given to reporters, Murdoch and his fifth wife Elena will be present at Windsor Castle Wednesday night. They are part of an intimate guest list that includes only about 160 guests, according to royal officials, and was compiled by the Royal Family and the White House. Trump will be seated in between King Charles III and Catherine, Princess of Wales, while first lady Melania Trump will be across the table next to Queen Camilla and William, Prince of Wales. One face who won't be at the dinner: The recently ousted British ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, who was fired by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer days before the state visit after his extensive ties to Epstein were revealed in media reports. As UK officials seek a favorable trade standing with the US, one of Trump's top officials has a notable seat. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will sit next to Queen Camilla. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his wife are also attending the dinner. Over 100 staff will serve the meal, with guests seated at a long, ornate table decorated with multiple arrangements of bright flowers in differing sizes. There are approximately 130 candles stretched across the table, which takes an entire week to put together. A mix of English, French and American wine will be served to guests. A perfectly folded napkin completes the lavish table setting. Guests will then be served organic Norfolk chicken ballotine wrapped in courgettes with a thyme and savory infused jus. The royal chef was in contact with the White House chef as they curated the menu, though it's ultimately designed with King Charles in mind, whom officials described as having an “eclectic palate.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IDF says the operation emphasizes “security over speed” – a gradual entry accompanied by heavy fire support to protect advancing troops. While the assault didn't surprise Gazans – Israel has spoken about it for weeks – for many, the invasion was a moment of paralyzing dread. “I was at home in Gaza City with my family,” Mahdy Kamal, 38, a father of five from the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood, said. “We were all sitting in the living room with no electricity, following the updates on a small battery-powered radio. Huda Abu Ramadan, a 54-year-old mother of four, was also paralyzed by the news of the invasion: “I was outside my house, trying to get some water from a nearby tank. People around me were whispering that the invasion had started. Later, I confirmed it through neighbors who had radio sets. My daughter burst into tears when I broke the news to her.” According to estimates, more than 350,000 have evacuated to the designated areas of Mawasi and Khan Yunis, two rather small strips of land that make up around 15% of the territory, where Israel says it has accumulated more water, food, shelters, and medications. Yet, 600,000 Gazans still remain in the city, reluctant to leave. Kamal and Abu Ramadan were among those who decided to stay – each for their own reasons. For Abu Ramadan, the reason was simple: She could not afford it. “I tried to go to Khan Yunis, but I do not have enough money for transportation and buying a tent. I think about going to Mawasi, but I heard the conditions there are terrible – too crowded, no water, no shelter. I don't want my kids to live in that dirt.” Mkhaimer Abuseada, an associate professor at Al Azhar University of Gaza, currently residing in Cairo, agrees that the move is a mission impossible for the majority of Gazans. “The trip of moving the entire family with all their belongings from Gaza to the south can cost up to $1,000, and money is scarce now, so this is something many cannot afford,” he said. “Apart from that, the designated area itself is not safe either, and only a few days ago, we saw a family that moved from Gaza to Khan Yunis perishing in an attack. They, too, decided to stay, come what may. But the fate that awaits them there is rather bleak. The majority of roads, commercial and industrial facilities have been eliminated, many schools and hospitals have remained non-operational. While Gaza City has also been severely damaged, the magnitude of the destruction is believed to be less severe. Israel was avoiding maneuvering in the area for fear of harming its hostages allegedly being held in the city and its outskirts. Israel has recruited an additional 60,000 troops for the incursion into the city, believed to be one of Hamas' last strongholds, and the IDF is saying they are not limited in time. For Kamal and his family, this could mean one of two things: Certain death or permanent displacement. “I fear that we will be forced out of Gaza permanently, like what happened to our grandparents in 1948. “Israel will be staying in Gaza City for many months and they will eventually destroy it like they did with all the other cities, but the people will not be conquered,” Kamal believes. We've survived many wars; this one will not erase us either.” The problem is that this war – unlike others witnessed by Gazans – doesn't show signs of winding down. Israel vowed to eradicate all the hardcore Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants hiding in Gaza City, but Abuseada is certain this will not end the resistance. “Israel will take over the whole city, will probably destroy all of the homes, go after Hamas fighters, but that's going to take months and months to do the job. Abuseada struggles to say what the future holds for Gaza. “The Israelis – led by Finance Minister Smotrich and the minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir – have a different plan. They want to evict all Gazans and resettle the entire strip. I don't know which option will eventually be chosen, but something tells me that Israel will be staying in Gaza for quite some time,” he said. Plans to resettle Gaza – promoted by the radical right – have not been a secret either, and prominent activists of the camp have engaged in multiple campaigns to promote that cause, despite the uproar they caused among liberal circles of Israel and abroad. “We have to wait and see,” Abuseada said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mortgages rates below 4 per cent are set to become mainstream as interest rates drop, breaking a psychological barrier for many prospective homebuyers and motivating them to leap into the market. Although the rate drop would make home loans only slightly cheaper, mortgage rates that start with a three are seen as a psychological turning point for would-be buyers. “Today's decision will mean pretty much everyone is getting 3-point-something,” said Shaun Cathcart, senior economist with the Canadian Real Estate Association. August purchases hit their highest volume for the same month since 2021 when the country's real estate market was booming, according to recent CREA data. “Having a three handle on mortgage rates is an important psychological hurdle for buyers,” said Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert with rate comparison website Ratehub.ca “If rates come down, people will come back into the market,” said Shaunese Lawrence, a mortgage agent with Clover Mortgage who has been brokering mortgages in the Toronto region for more than a decade. Since late 2022, the real estate market has been mostly in a slump. Home sales dropped as borrowing costs rose, properties lost value and individual investors disappeared from the new construction market because real estate investments are no longer profitable. Even when the Bank of Canada started cutting its benchmark rate in June, 2024, and made seven consecutive cuts through March, 2025, many buyers remained reluctant to make a purchase. Ahead of the central bank announcement on Wednesday, the average interest rate was 4.1 per cent for a five-year variable-rate product and 3.97 per cent for a five-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to data from MortgageLogic.news. The big Canadian banks – which dominate nearly 60 per cent of the mortgage market – were advertising mortgage rates above 4 per cent, according to their websites. “A mortgage rate starting with a three is helpful,” said Clinton Wilkins, principal broker with Centum Home Lenders Ltd., who has been brokering mortgages in Nova Scotia for more than 20 years. “Once those rates are widely available, it will add some demand in the market,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ex-president says US in ‘dangerous moment', after White House response to killings of Kirk and Melissa Hortman Barack Obama addressed the recent killing of Charlie Kirk and told a crowd in Pennsylvania on Tuesday the country was “at an inflection point”, but that political violence “is not new” and “has happened at certain periods” in US history. He called both incidents “a tragedy” and said Donald Trump had further divided the country rather than work to bring people together. “There are no ifs, ands or buts about it: the central premise of our democratic system is that we have to be able to disagree and have sometimes really contentious debates without resorting to violence,” he said. Obama warned that the response to Kirk's assassination last week, which has kicked off a debate about free speech and the incitement to violence, could serve to deepen political and cultural divisions. “There's been some confusion, I think, around this lately, and, frankly, coming from the White House and some of the other positions of authority that suggest, even before we had determined who the perpetrator of this evil act was, that somehow we're going to identify an enemy,” he said. Obama has kept something of a low profile in his post-presidency. He spoke about his own leadership following the 2015 killings of nine Black parishioners at a Charleston, South Carolina church, as well as George W Bush's decisions following the September 11 terrorist attacks. He said the role of a president in a crisis was “to constantly remind us of the ties that bind us together”. The sentiment among Trump and his aides following Kirk's killing of calling political opponents “vermin, enemies … speaks to a broader problem”, Obama said. Kirk, a dominant figure in conservative politics, became a confidant of Trump after founding Turning Point USA, one of the nation's largest political organizations. “Obama used every opportunity to sow division and pit Americans against each other, and following his presidency more Americans felt Obama divided the country than felt he united it,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement. Obama sought to hold a middle ground in his remarks, praising Utah's governor, Spencer Cox, who he said showed “that it is possible for us to disagree while abiding by a basic code of how we should engage in public debate”. The desire to identify an enemy, Obama indicated, was misplaced. Denouncing political violence and mourning its victims “doesn't mean we can't have a debate about the ideas” that Kirk promoted, he added. Obama on Tuesday also referenced Trump's recent deployment of national guard troops in Washington and ID checks by federal agents in Los Angeles. He urged citizens and elected officials to closely monitor the norm-busting decisions. “What you're seeing, I think, is the sense that through executive power, many of the guardrails and norms that I thought I had to abide by as president of the United States, that George Bush thought he had to abide by as president of the United States, that suddenly those no longer apply,” Obama said. A previous version misspelled the name of Melissa Hortman.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allies of Donald Trump have dismissed claims Charlie Kirk was killed by a lone assassin. The FBI has suggested suspect Mr Robinson may have worked with others, although no one else has yet been charged in connection with the crime. Steve Bannon, Mr Trump's former chief strategist, claimed that Kirk's death was “not a simple murder” and that the truth was “far deeper and far more malignant”. “Antifa needs to be designated as a domestic terrorist organisation,” he continued, referencing the radical Left-wing organisation that has been linked to recent attacks on immigration detention centres. Media reports emerged shortly after Kirk's death that the ammunition used by the assassin was engraved with expressions of transgender and Antifa “ideology”, but authorities later clarified this may have been a misunderstanding. Mr Bannon went on to suggest that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) may have been involved in the incident by allegedly funding to Antifa. Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff and a long-time aide to Mr Trump, claimed a “vast domestic terror network” was responsible for Kirk's death. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have… to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks and make America safe again,” he vowed. Sean Davis, founder of The Federalist, a conservative magazine, wrote on social media: “It's obvious now that Charlie Kirk's assassin was not working alone. “He was clearly operating within a larger terrorist network focused on grooming, recruiting, and training terrorists for the purpose of planning and executing terrorist attacks.” Mr Patel was repeatedly pressed by Republicans about whether Mr Robinson had allegedly acted alone when he testified in front of the Senate judiciary committee for several hours on Tuesday. Asked if others could have been involved in Kirk's death, he answered: “Yes.” “If there was any aiding and abetting, whether it be financial or someone who knew the specifics of it and failed to report that, we're looking into that,” Mr Bongino told Fox News on Monday, and declared: “There's not going to be a stone left unturned.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Influential former Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, is set to become Ottawa's special envoy for Ukraine, Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced. Freeland, a granddaughter of a Nazi-collaborator who long denied awareness of his past, has long faced scrutiny over extensively documented evidence that her grandfather edited a Nazi propaganda newspaper during World War II, before he emigrated to Canada. In a statement on Tuesday, Carney said that Freeland, one of the most prominent figures in Canadian politics for over a decade, who also held posts of International Trade Minister, Foreign Minister, and Transport Minister, has been offered a newly created job of Canada's Special Representative for the Reconstruction of Ukraine, in addition to her responsibilities as an MP. Carney did not provide any details of what Freeland's position would entail. In a separate statement, Freeland did not comment on her new role, but confirmed that she was leaving the cabinet and is not planning to run in the next election. Commenting on the announcement, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova branded Freeland a “hardcore Russophobe,” adding that her appointment would only exacerbate the crisis in Ukraine. Her maternal grandfather, Michael Chomiak, edited the Krakivski Visti newspaper in Nazi-occupied Poland and Austria during WWII. For years, Freeland rejected any claims of Chomiak's collaboration with the Nazis as “Russian disinformation,” although Canadian media, including The Globe and Mail, have reported she had known for decades about her grandfather's work. She also clashed with US President Donald Trump, who labeled her a “terrible person” and a “nasty woman.” When Freeland resigned from the cabinet of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in December, Trump celebrated the news, saying, “She will not be missed!!!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Do we understand what the difference is between a king and a president?” Sotomayor asked at the forum hosted by New York Law School. “And I think if people understood these things from the beginning, they would be more informed as to what would be important in a democracy.” Sotomayor has been a dissenting opinion in many recent supreme court rulings, including the reduction of federal agencies and the termination of officials that are theoretically protected from political influence by Congress. Sotomayor also issued a dissenting opinion when the court ruled last year that Trump had immunity from prosecution for his part in attempting to overturn the 2020 election results. In her comments on Tuesday, Sotomayor did not address the contentious political moment that is playing out, critics say, with the executive branch exerting power over a Republican-led Congress. Recent reports suggest that classroom civics education has become a minefield of educators. Trump issued two executive orders in January – one titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling”, aimed to restrict certain teachings, and “Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families” focused on school choice. Surveys have found that some teachers say they now avoid certain controversial topics but are conversely doing more civics instruction, according to a tracker maintained by CivxNow, the advocacy arm of iCivics, an organization that aims to advance civic learning. “There's free speech and then there's hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society,” Bondi said in an episode of The Katie Miller podcast, referring to the killing of rightwinger Charlie Kirk. In a lengthy post on X Tuesday, Bondi clarified, writing: “Hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. But Sotomayor countered: “Every time I listen to a lawyer-trained representative saying we should criminalize free speech in some way, I think to myself that law school failed.”</p>

This case highlights a broader pattern of Russia recruiting foreigners to fight against Ukraine, sometimes through deceptive methods. I had never served before," Evans said in a video released by the brigade. They told me to get in the car," he added. After just a week of basic training, he was sent to a military camp, where Evans described chaotic conditions, with orders shouted while soldiers were grabbed by their clothes. Fearing for his life, Evans fled to Ukrainian troops, who gave him food and water. Kenya, an East African nation heavily dependent on Ukrainian grain, has faced food market disruptions since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Kenyan President William Ruto has condemned Russia's war against Ukraine, calling it unjust. Moscow has intensified efforts to expand its influence across Africa through propaganda outlets such as TASS and RT, while also recruiting fighters from the continent.

"Today, they are all safe in Ukraine, receiving psychological support, restoring their documents, and taking their first steps toward a peaceful new life," Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. Germany's previously cautious position on seizing the assets has shifted recently, partly as a result of fears that if the U.S. completely pulls aid to Ukraine, the burden to support Kyiv will fall disproportionately on Berlin, according to Bloomberg. President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead a delegation to New York next week to attend the high-level week of the 80th United Nations General Assembly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem says in a press conference that the central bank is prepared to take further action with rate cuts if risks shift.Blair Gable/Reuters The Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point, bringing it down to 2.5 per cent after three straight holds. Money market traders grew a little more doubtful that October will bring another rate cut as the Bank of Canada news conference wore on and Governor Tiff Macklem made it clear the bank would not provide much forward guidance this time around on the trajectory of future rate moves. Implied probabilities in overnight index swap markets now suggest a 40-per-cent probability of a rate cut at the bank's next meeting, on Oct. 29, down from about 50 per cent when the rate decision was announced earlier today, according to LSEG data. So if Mr. Macklem is trying to temper further easing expectations, he's finding some success. Investors must now sit tight for what the U.S. Federal Reserve has to say later today, which is likely to have a much bigger impact on markets overall. “Historically, population growth has evolved pretty smoothly, and so we have sort of certain rules of thumb about what potential growth can be, how many new workers you would expect to be added to the labour market every month. Fiscal policy really is a much better instrument for that.” “The risk for us is that a temporary increase in those prices has knock-on effects to other prices, and then it starts to look like ongoing inflation. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem, right, and Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers are seen during a news conference at the Bank of Canada in Ottawa.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press What tipped the balance really in favour of a cut this time was there was a clear sense that the balance of risk had shifted. The inflation picture hasn't really changed a great deal. … Total CPI inflation came out yesterday at 1.9 per cent. … If you look at our core measures … they remain around 3. If you look under the hood, though, what you can see is that earlier in the year we saw some upward momentum in those core measures. “The reality is tariffs are increasing trade friction with our biggest trading partner and that has efficiency costs. And if the risks tilt further, we're prepared to take more action. But we're going to take it one meeting at a time. Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem is seen during a news conference in Ottawa on Wednesday.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press “From our macro perspective, it's less about individual measures and more about how everything fits together, what the overall macro impact is. And certainly, once we have the budget, we will be assessing the implications of government's plans on the economic outlook, what that means for growth, for inflation and, ultimately, for what we need to do with interest rates.” Prime Minister Mark Carney's government is set to table the federal budget on Nov. 4. Canada shed 66,000 positions in August and the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 per cent – the highest level since 2016, apart from early pandemic years, according to Statistics Canada.Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press Lower interest rates mean the economy may be headed for trouble. This latest Bank of Canada rate cut, in particular, signals that the financial pain of tariffs is starting to get real and spread. Here's how economists are reacting to the Bank of Canada's rate decision: … Crucially, the Bank dropped the line from its previous policy statement that said “if a weakening economy puts further downward pressure on inflation and the upward price pressures from the trade disruptions are contained, there may be a need for a reduction in the policy interest rate.” Nonetheless, the Bank reiterated that it will be assessing the extent to which weakness in exports “spills over into business investment, employment, and household spending,” how “trade disruptions are … passed on to consumer prices” and “how inflation expectations evolve.” That leaves the door to another interest rate cut this year if, as we expect, economic growth remains weak while core inflation pressures remain under control." “Conventional wisdom says that if you're going to cut once, you're probably going to go again (does a single 25-basis-point move the needle in significant fashion?). And while our base case outlook entails a 2.25% terminal rate (i.e., just one more cut), risks have clearly swung towards more easing being delivered. Incoming economic/inflation data, an October Business Outlook Survey, Canada-U.S. trade developments and a fall budget will all help guide that view.” “We don't think this is the beginning of a new cutting cycle that will see rates fall deeply into stimulative territory. We expect the BoC to cut by another 25 basis points in October but then pause and hold rates at 2.25% - the low end of its neutral range estimate - through 2026. That's left markets relatively unchanged after the rate cut announcement. In contrast, our work suggests that those fears about inflation won't materialize. As a result, we continue to believe that the Bank of Canada will cut rates again in October and ultimately take the policy rate down to a terminal rate of 2.00%.” Mortgage rates could soon lower after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today.Matt Rourke/The Associated Press The most common mortgage rate could soon start at 3 per cent instead of 4 per cent after the Bank of Canada cut its benchmark interest rate today. And although home loans will only become slightly cheaper, mortgages that start with 3 per cent can be a psychological turning point for would-be buyers. “A mortgage rate starting with a 3 is helpful,” said Clinton Wilkins, principal broker with Centum Home Lenders Ltd. who has been brokering mortgages in Nova Scotia for more than 20 years “Once those rates are widely available, it will add some demand in the market,” he said. “Having a 3 handle on mortgage rates is an important psychological hurdle for buyers,” said Penelope Graham, a mortgage expert with rate comparison web site Ratehub.ca Some lenders are already advertising mortgages with an interest rate that starts at 3 per cent. So far this month, the average rate was 4.1 per cent on a five-year variable-rate product and 3.97 per cent on a five-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to data from Mortgagelogic.news. There was a little bit of an uptick, though, in the S&P/TSX Composite Index. It's up about 0.25 per cent, versus a nearly unchanged S&P 500. Among stocks seeing some of the most positive gains are dividend stocks, which investors tend to gravitate to when interest rates fall and make returns in competing income products, such as bonds and cash, less attractive. Bond yields softened a bit, too, with the Canadian two-year bond losing about another basis point, to trade about two basis points lower. Unlike today's decision, markets are not really convinced another rate cut will be announced at the next BoC meeting, on Oct. 29. Implied probabilities in overnight index swaps suggest odds are about even on another 25-basis-point cut at that time, according to LSEG data. That said, markets are convinced the rate-cutting cycle won't end with today's decision and are fully pricing in another cut by Jan. 28 of next year. That would bring the overnight rate down to 2.25 per cent. But markets aren't pricing in much further easing over the course of next year. “Tariffs are having a profound effect on several key sectors, including the auto, steel and aluminum industries. Businesses are also concerned that demand in Canada will weaken as the economic fallout broadens.” “We are paying close attention to how exports evolve given the impact of U.S. tariffs and changing trade relationships; how much this spills over into business investment, employment and household spending; how the cost effects of trade disruptions and reconfigured supply chains are passed on to consumer prices; and how inflation expectations evolve.” While the BoC had cut its benchmark rate seven times from June, 2024, through March of this year, many buyers have been reluctant to make a purchase. Mortgage rates and home prices were still relatively high. Now that the central bank's interest rate has been cut to 2.5 per cent from 2.75 per cent, realtors say the pent-up demand could soon be unleashed. “If rates come down, people will come back into the market,” said Shaunese Lawrence, a mortgage agent with Clover Mortgage who has been brokering home loans in the Toronto region since 2013. Ms. Lawrence said she has lost count of the number of people who are saying: “I just want to get something.” Last year she did not broker any mortgages for home purchases; she only worked on mortgage renewals and refinancings. Governor Tiff Macklem said in his opening remarks that there was a “clear consensus” to lower the central bank's policy rate today, but he provided no forward guidance on where rates are headed next. Many economists anticipate the central bank will cut interest rates again this year in response to increasing slack in the economy and easing price pressures. “The disruptive effects of shifts in trade will add costs even as they weigh on economic activity. It is difficult to predict the extent of cost increases, where they will show up and how they could be passed through to consumer prices,” he said. The bank did not release economic forecasts with its interest rate decision today. In its last two quarterly monetary policy reports, it published multiple scenarios of what could happen to the economy based on the state of trade. But with a weaker economy and less upside risk to inflation, governing council judged that a reduction in the policy rate was appropriate to better balance the risks going forward,” Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said in prepared remarks. Mr. Macklem said there was a “clear consensus” for a cut, but he gave few hints about where interest rates will go from here, saying the bank would “look over a shorter horizon than usual and be ready to respond to new information.” The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut on Wednesday afternoon.Ken Cedeno/Reuters After the Bank of Canada rate announcement, attention will shift to Washington, where the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its own interest-rate cut this afternoon amid souring economic indicators and mounting political pressure to ease monetary policy. The Fed has been on hold since December, wary that tariffs could push up consumer prices and unconvinced that the robust U.S. economy needed more support. Financial markets now expect the Fed to lower its policy rate by a quarter-point today, with traders betting on additional cuts through the fall. Any decision to cut, however, will carry a whiff of politics. U.S. President Donald Trump has spent months lambasting Fed Chair Jerome Powell and demanding that the Fed, which is meant to be independent of politics, lower interest rates. The President has also aggressively tried to overhaul the Fed's voting body, appointing Stephen Miran, a close economic adviser, as an interim governor and attempting to fire governor Lisa Cook – a move she is fighting in court. Analysts will be watching for hints about future rate cuts and poring over the quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which will contain a new “dot plot” outlining where Fed committee members see interest rates going over the next three years and in the longer run. What's less clear is where interest rates go from here. Interest rate swap traders put the probability of a quarter-point cut by the Bank of Canada today above 90 per cent, according to LSEG data. Most Bay Street analysts are likewise convinced the BoC is going to resume easing after three consecutive holds. Twenty-five of 32 economists polled by Reuters last week said they expect a quarter-point cut today. Looking further out, swap markets are pricing in only one additional cut after Wednesday, which would leave the policy rate at 2.25 per cent through next year. But they say that in hindsight the higher inflation in the spring was being driven by retaliatory tariffs that Canada had placed on U.S. goods. Prime Minister Mark Carney dropped many of Canada's retaliatory tariffs this month in a bid to further trade negotiations with the U.S. The Bank of Canada is seen in Ottawa, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025.Justin Tang/The Canadian Press After a string of seven rate cuts, the Bank of Canada has been sitting tight since March, waiting to see how global trade disruptions hit the Canadian economy and affect consumer prices. In recent months, the picture has become clearer: Inflation has remained relatively contained, while U.S. tariffs have hammered exports and pushed up unemployment in Canada. Financial markets and Bay Street analysts widely expect a quarter-point cut today, which would take the bank's policy rate down to 2.5 per cent. Until now, the BoC has been wary of cutting interest rates further, given the possibility that U.S. tariffs and Canadian countertariffs could drive up consumer prices and touch off another round of high inflation. But Canada has dropped most of its retaliatory tariffs in recent months, and the Canadian dollar has strengthened, easing upward pressure on the prices of imported goods. Monetary policy is a blunt instrument that can't target the sectors hit hardest by the trade war: steel, aluminum, autos and lumber. But rate cuts could help shore up consumer spending and business investment more broadly, as well as provide a spark to the housing market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Robinson allegedly told his transgender boyfriend he ‘had enough' of the conservative activist's ‘hatred' Prosecutors have revealed text messages that they say prove Tyler Robinson admitted to killing Charlie Kirk. Mr Robinson, 22, has been charged with murdering Kirk, the conservative activist, shot dead at a Utah university last week. The suspect wore an anti-suicide vest, designed to prevent prisoners from turning it into a noose, as he appeared before a judge via video link for the first time on Tuesday. Prosecutors laid out formal charges against Mr Robinson and revealed messages to his transgender roommate, with whom Robinson was in a relationship, which they said amounted to a confession. Spencer Cox, the governor of Utah, said on Sunday: “We can confirm that his roommate was indeed a boyfriend who is transitioning from male to female.” Mr Robinson allegedly confessed to the assassination by hiding a note for his boyfriend. He wrote: “Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard,” the messages revealed by officials said. “Since Trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard Maga,” the suspected killer wrote. Both of Mr Robinson's parents are registered Republicans, according to records seen by The Telegraph.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian forces are preparing two more large-scale offensives after three failed campaigns this year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in an interview with Sky News published on Sept. 16. "They are preparing for two more offensive operations in the fall," Zelensky said. According to Reuters' sources, Putin believes his forces are "winning" despite limited gains. Since November 2022, Moscow has gained less than 1% of additional Ukrainian territory, despite its 2025 summer offensive advancing at one of the fastest rates since late 2024. Zelensky attributed Russian military setbacks to significant manpower and equipment losses. "They lost because there were a large number of casualties among the personnel and a large number of lost equipment," he added. Zelensky also dismissed claims that Russia could capture cities like Sumy in the northeast as "lies and manipulation." In early September, Zelensky said the offensive had been "completely thwarted." "I believe that the Russians are doing worse than they expected," he added. The Economist estimated that Russia lost around 31,000 troops between May 1 and July 9, while Ukraine's General Staff puts total Russian losses since the full-scale war in 2022 at roughly 1,100,000. Zelensky said in August that it would take Russia another four years to fully seize Donbas, a region in eastern Ukraine comprised of mostly occupied Luhansk Oblast and partially occupied Donetsk Oblast. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. "Today, they are all safe in Ukraine, receiving psychological support, restoring their documents, and taking their first steps toward a peaceful new life," Presidential Office head Andriy Yermak said. The Kyiv Independent's Kate Tsurkan sits down with internationally renowned artist and activist Ai Weiwei during his first exhibition in Ukraine dedicated to Russia's full-scale war. U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Sept. 11 that the incident "could have been a mistake." The man, who identified himself as Evans and said he was an athlete in civilian life, said he traveled to Russia as a tourist and was deceived into joining the Russian army. "I can't say right now that they (Russian troops) have all left Belarus, but I hope they will continue moving in the right direction," Ukraine State Border Guard Service spokesperson Andrii Demchenko said. Yulia Navalnaya said Alexei Navalny's team managed to secure biological samples of her deceased husband and transport them abroad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ukrainian authorities rejoiced at the killing of US activist Charlie Kirk, who opposed US military aid to the Kiev government, Verkhovna Rada lawmaker Artem Dmitruk said in an opinion piece for TASS. "The [Ukrainian] government's silence speaks volumes. They do not condemn killings. Sometimes, they rejoice at them, as was the case with Charlie Kirk," he said. Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on September 10 during his speech at the university in Orem, Utah. The activist was a supporter of President Donald Trump and, according to the Associated Press, contributed significantly to his victory in the last presidential election. Kirk has repeatedly opposed American military aid to Ukraine. The suspect in the murder, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was detained on the evening of September 11. He was handed over to the authorities by his father, who said his son confessed to him what he did. Trump stated he hopes Robinson is convicted and sentenced to death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Tehran Has Few Options, but the Best One Depends on China A year of sustained losses has left Iran's grand strategy in ruins. As a result, in June, Israel was able to conduct its 12-day war against Iran unencumbered by worries about regional escalation. Iran's regime will certainly attempt to claw back its lost power. But regional developments since Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and Israel's persistently assertive military footing have made it much harder for Tehran to take steps that could shore up its influence, such as rearming Hezbollah. Until Iran can defend its own territory, it may be impossible for it to rebuild its proxies or sprint for a nuclear bomb in a way that does not put the theocratic regime at further risk of collapse. Until recently, Beijing has resisted backing one faction over another in the Middle East. It may well see fresh opportunities in assisting Iran to regain some of its diminished strength, given the rising tensions between Israel and Arab states—especially following Israel's early September strikes on Hamas's leadership in Qatar. Although that effort met resistance after the outbreak of Syria's civil war as Israel began to regularly conduct strikes on weapons storehouses in Syria and on convoys facilitated by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Iran still managed to keep Hezbollah armed. Ahmed al-Shara, Syria's new president, has made it clear that Iranian influence is no longer welcome in his country. He has sought partnerships with Iran's rivals, particularly Turkey, and blamed Iranian-backed militias for fueling instability in Syria, arguing in a February 2025 interview on state television that Iranian proxies posed a threat to the Syrian people and “the entire region.” Yet despite some early successes, Shara's government has struggled to unify the country. Iran could exploit the latent sociopolitical divisions in Syria by clandestinely aiding factions dissatisfied with the new regime or open to financial inducements, just as it has leveraged divisions in Iraq and Yemen. Iran could have even greater opportunities to interfere in Syrian politics if the U.S. military completes its withdrawal. Both of these methods are vulnerable to Israeli interception, and the degree to which Israeli intelligence has penetrated Iran's military establishment makes it even less likely that Iranian weapons could successfully reach Lebanon. After Israel's 2024 attacks on Hezbollah, the group's leadership structure is in a shambles, and it faces extraordinary pressure to disarm. It may have no choice but to pull back or even abandon its military efforts. Iran may eventually find a way to reconstitute its supply lines to Hezbollah, but the conditions under which it could do so don't yet exist. This means that Iran has lost—perhaps permanently—the one proxy militia whose power had discouraged Israeli attacks on Iranian territory. The Houthis in Yemen have successfully used Iranian weaponry to target shipping in the Red Sea, but they have not helped shield Iran against Israeli aggression. Hezbollah's rockets posed a direct threat to Israeli cities, but the Houthis' arsenal—as well as that of the Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq—constitutes a lesser and more distant threat. If Iran could repair or rebuild adequate enrichment facilities (or if it already has such secret facilities), it could refine that uranium to a weapons-grade level relatively quickly, perhaps in a matter of weeks. But even if Iran's leaders want to pursue nuclear weaponization, taking the necessary steps to do so would be extremely dangerous for the ruling regime. Given Israel's steep intelligence advantage, any moves to further enrich uranium would risk alerting Iran's adversaries and triggering a new and more destructive round of strikes led by Israel, the United States, or both. And even if Iran succeeded in testing a nuclear device and developing a small weapons arsenal uninterrupted, its current inability to defend its skies would render that arsenal tremendously vulnerable. Developing a nuclear weapon, on its own, therefore cannot restore Iranian deterrence. Without strong conventional defenses or proxies to deter foreign aggression, nuclear weapons could simply create a new liability. Before Iran can even begin to restore deterrence, much less recoup some of its regional power, it must address the shortcomings in its conventional military capabilities. Iran did find ways to impose costs on Israel during the 12-day war, particularly by targeting Israeli population centers. But Israel's air defense systems' high intercept rate rendered Iran's missiles an insufficient deterrent; they could not destroy or even reliably hit serious strategic and military targets. And after it eliminated Iran's air defense systems, Israel was able to strike Iranian missile launchers, which further eroded Iran's ability to launch effective counterstrikes. Much remains unknown about how effective different Iranian missiles systems were in the conflict, but Iranian commanders will have undoubtedly acquired a greater understanding of which systems performed best and which operational tactics were most effective, even if Israel's attacks on Iran were always more potent. It may, for instance, invest even more in domestically produced hypersonic or other advanced weapons (such as the Fattah and the Khorramshahr-4 missiles), as well as longer-range systems that could be fired from eastern Iran, a harder target for Israel to hit. Iran's need to bolster its air defenses is even more pressing. Moscow has long been Tehran's closest defense partner, but Russia's complicated relationship with Israel limits the defense assistance it has been willing to provide; its war on Ukraine has also diminished its ability to sell weaponry to outside buyers. In 2023, for instance, Iran announced a deal to purchase Sukhoi Su-35 fighter planes from Russia. That leaves China as Iran's best source of additional military equipment. China has traditionally sought to balance its relationships in the Middle East. China has reaped some benefits from Iran's relative isolation—most important, by exploiting Western sanctions to purchase Iranian oil at a steep discount. In March 2023, Iran began normalizing diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia—a move brokered by China that fundamentally changed a prior driver of Beijing's Middle East policy. Air defense is a crucial gap that China could help Iran fill. China's HQ-9 mobile air defense system is similar to Russia's more advanced S-400 platform. If Beijing sold this system to Tehran, that could help Iran restore some protection of its skies. Iran could also pursue a deal with China to modernize its air force, such as by purchasing Chinese Chengdu J-10 aircraft, which performed well for Pakistan in its brief military escalation with India in May. In the short run, neither better air defenses nor an improved fleet of fighter jets can drastically change Iran's relative disadvantage with respect to Israel and the United States. At the very least, they could buy Iran some time to replenish and refine its domestically produced missile stockpile and better prepare for another conflict. Regardless of how China responds to its predicament, Iran is in a crunch. Or they may opt for the even more dangerous path of nuclear weaponization.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. She was Senior Africa Director at the National Security Council from 2009 to 2011 and U.S. Many analysts blame U.S. President Donald Trump and his sudden fixation on vilifying the country's government. The Trump administration's determination to make an example of South Africa is partly driven by its overall antipathy toward attempts to redress historical racial injustices and has as much to do with the fixations of parts of the MAGA base as it does foreign policy. In truth, however, U.S.–South African relations have been difficult for years, characterized by mutual disappointment and suspicion. But so are South African actions that the United States has found objectionable. U.S. officials anticipated that South Africa would champion pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights around the world after a decades-long liberation struggle toppled white minority rule in 1994. This expectation was informed in part by a 1993 Foreign Affairs essay penned by Nelson Mandela, the country's first Black president, in which he declared that “human rights will be the light that guides our foreign affairs” and that “only true democracy can guarantee rights.” In the post-apartheid 1990s, the United States sought to strengthen ties with and champion South Africa, establishing a high-level binational commission to deepen cooperation and fast-track support for the new democracy. But within a decade, ideology, history, and pressures exerted by South Africa's own domestic politics have conspired to produce a foreign policy that was bound to alienate Washington. Its unexpected stances on human-rights-related votes at the United Nations were early signs of trouble. With its sustained support for Zimbabwe's violently repressive regime, its refusal to condemn human rights abuses in Myanmar, and its silence regarding Beijing's treatment of China's Uyghur population, South Africa has been extremely selective about the injustices it chooses to condemn. Among the grievances that bill cited were South Africa's condemnation of Israel and its willingness to engage with Hamas's leaders, its continued military cooperation with Russia after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, and its close relationship with China. The United States and South Africa could—and should—work closely together, since they share an interest in maintaining successful multiracial democracies. But if the two countries continue to see each other as problems instead of partners, that capacity for collaboration may vanish for good. The African National Congress, South Africa's leading liberation movement under apartheid, became the country's ruling party after its first democratic elections in 1994; for 30 years, it won comfortable majorities in nationwide elections. The capitals that more consistently supported southern African liberation movements, by contrast—such as Beijing, Havana, and Moscow—still enjoy a reputation in South Africa for being on the right side of history. The Chinese Communist Party still provides political training to ANC members. Cold War nostalgia informed the ANC's 2023 statement that the United States “provoked the war with Russia over Ukraine, hoping to put Russia in its place” and former South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor's suggestion that there was nothing notable about South Africa's decision to host joint military exercises with Russia on the one-year anniversary of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, since “all countries conduct military exercises with friends worldwide.” When speaking about the U.S.–South African relationship, ANC officials frequently lament the party's paucity of direct ties with major U.S. political parties, suggesting that this explains at least some of its difficulties with Washington. The party's ideological underpinnings have an outsized influence on policy, and they are also full of contradictions. The ANC defines its foreign policy ideology as “progressive internationalism,” which it regularly describes as “a radical perspective on international relations” that stands in opposition to the “perpetuation of the legacy of global imperialism,” the “dominance of the global North over the global South,” and “structural global inequality and poverty.” It often cites these principles to explain South Africa's enthusiasm for the BRICS platform—the group led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa that, along with new members, positions itself as a champion of multipolarity and an alternative to existing international institutions. The party's professed goal is revolutionary change, but its preferred means are legalistic. That text declares that South Africa should be a “fully independent state which respects the rights and sovereignty of all nations” but also maintains that that it should pursue “upholding the equal rights, opportunities, and status of all.” Whether South Africa, under ANC rule, calls out gross human rights abuses or respects the right of another government to repress its people as it sees fit has, in practice, depended on the degree to which ANC officials understand the government in question to be its partner in combating global power asymmetries. South Africa characterizes its foreign policy as one of active nonalignment. Rather than refrain from taking sides when great powers disagree, the country has sought to capitalize on opportunities presented by geopolitical rifts to advance its principles. Thus concerns about Ukraine's sovereignty and Russia's use of force without a United Nations mandate fell by the wayside in the ANC's rush to maintain solidarity with Moscow. South Africa has often overlooked Iran's support for terrorism and its record of repression at home: in 2024, Pandor, South Africa's former foreign minister, startled attendees of a think tank event in Washington when she pushed back against the characterization of Iran's government as “authoritarian.” But South Africa's decision to bring a case to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in December 2023 came against the backdrop of earlier decisions that reveal a selective concern for oppressed peoples and international legal obligations. (South Africa claimed that its law granting immunity to sitting heads of state overruled the ICC warrant.) South Africa's own domestic political pressures have not helped its relationship with the United States. Decades after its segregationist regime fell, South Africa remains a profoundly unequal society. Some political rivals, such as Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters and former President Jacob Zuma's uMkhonto we Sizwe party, insist that the ANC's failures stem instead from an inadequately radical domestic agenda, particularly when it comes to economic policy. They want to see resources nationalized and wealth redistributed. These left-wing rivals represent a looming threat to the ANC's power: they won nearly a quarter of the vote in national elections last May. In 2025, after reintroducing the bill demanding a review of Washington's policy toward South Africa, U.S. legislators added a call for sanctions on South African leaders implicated in corruption or human rights abuses. South Africa has thus raced to make a deal with the Trump administration to salvage commercial ties, and talks continue behind closed doors. Tripartite military exercises with China and Russia had been slated to occur in South African waters just weeks before November's G-20 summit in Johannesburg, and South African officials have sought to postpone them to avoid further alienating the United States. But the country's foreign policy inconsistencies persist, complicating its charm offensive. In August, the country's top military officer, General Rudzani Maphwanya, visited Tehran. There, he said that his country shares “common goals” with Iran. In an alternate universe, the inconsistencies in both countries' foreign policies would help each one better understand and sympathize with the other. But when two states with different biases and worldviews collide—one enamored with a vision of its exceptionalism and another clinging to its identity as moral authority—pragmatism is in order. The United States does not gain from endorsing racist conspiracy theories that amplify South Africa's caricature of it. And South Africa does not gain by gratuitously alienating the United States. The United States and South Africa have experience with this kind of ground-up repair: during the apartheid era, citizens built connective tissue without waiting on changes in their official governments' policies—acts that, in turn, drove transformative top-level policy changes.
