                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While this latest decision had only one dissent, newly appointed Fed governor Stephen Miran, opinions diverge further heading into next year. During a news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday's decision reflects a desire to keep risks to the economy in check. Powell has expressed concern that tariffs put in place by the Trump administration could led prices to surge. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday that he expects the effects of inflation on goods prices "to continue to build" through the rest of this year and into 2026, shortly after the monetary policymaker cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point. "We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation, and actually the increase in goods prices accounts for most of the increase in inflation, or perhaps all of the increase in inflation over the course of this year," Powell said in a press conference. He added, "those are not very large effects at this point, and we do expect them to continue to build over the course of the rest of the year and into next year." CPI rose 2.9% on an annual basis last month, marking the largest gain since January. Since April, inflation has mostly accelerated on a month-to-month basis. Asked whether he will leave as chair of the central bank after his term ends in May 2026, Powell said there's "nothing new" to say on this topic. The Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to replace Powell, including Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income at BlackRock Rick Rieder. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said President Donald Trump's tariffs have mainly appeared to be covered by importing companies, meaning consumers haven't seen major price increases tied to the levies yet. To be sure, Powell noted that companies have said they eventually plan to pass more of the cost increases onto shoppers, which can result in higher price tags. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he doesn't prefer that the labor market loosen any further. "The labor market is softening and we don't need it to soften anymore (and) don't want it to," Powell said. Powell cited rising unemployment among minorities as one reason for concern. Despite President Donald Trump's demand for more aggressive action from the Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell said there was little support for large rate cuts at this week's meeting. "I think we've done very large rate hikes and very large rate cuts in the last five years, and we tend to do those at a time when you feel that policy is out of place and needs to move quickly to a new place. That's not at all what I feel certainly now, I feel like our policy has been doing the right thing so far this year." The Fed instead opted for a quarter-percentage point reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described Wednesday's interest rate decrease as a way to keep risk in check. Powell added that there's a "very different picture" of risks tied to the labor market and that it is "really cooling off." A single quarter-point reduction next year is significantly more conservative than current market pricing. Traders are currently pricing in at two to three more rate cuts next year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, updated shortly after the decision.

"While the unemployment rate remains low, it has edged up, job gains have slowed, and downside risks to employment have risen at the same time, inflation has risen recently and remains somewhat elevated," he said in the post-meeting news conference. "We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory," he said. It is really important that there was just one dissent in the Federal Reserve's rate-cut decision, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. While Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman may each want the job of Federal Reserve chair, they weren't willing to go against the consensus, he said in an interview with CNBC. "To me, the fact that they are not going to fall over themselves to say 50 basis points now, even if they want more Fed easing, I think that is a very positive sign because it says the Federal Reserve as an institution regards its independence as tremendously important and they are not going to fall over themselves to do what the administration wants right now," Kelly said. The Fed's rate cut will have a trickle-down effect on many types of consumer loans and savings rates. Mortgage rates, on the other hand, are more influenced by Treasury yields and the economy so there's less of an immediate impact.

All three governors were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has been actively pushing for the central bank to bring down interest rates as quickly as possible. Read more here on the Fed's rate decision from CNBC's Jeff Cox. With signs of the labor market weakening, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to reduce its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, or 25 basis points. However, there are some who want the central bank to go further faster. The critical questions investors will want to answer are: How far will interest rates fall this year and how divided is the central bank? The July meeting was notable for its two dissenters, Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman. This time around the tension could be heightened even further. President Donald Trump has appointed Stephen Miran to the group. Miran, who replaced Adriana Kugler, has been a Fed critic and he is expected to push for deep cuts. If the majority opts to ease rates by 25 basis points, it is possible Waller and Bowman will once again dissent. In addition, there also could be pressure to keep the benchmark rate steady between 4.25% and 4.50%. That could put two other Federal Open Market Committee members in the opposition. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid and St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem are seen by some as wanting to keep rates where they are. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was toting a 210-point gain, or up about 0.5%. The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 4.045%, up nearly 2 basis points. Savers and investors who look for attractive yields on fixed income assets have faired pretty well since the Federal Reserve started raising rates in March 2022. As of the week ended Sept. 12, the annual percentage yield on a five-year certificate of deposit sat at 1.7%, up from 0.5% in March 2022, according to Haver. Yields on savings accounts are also currently higher: 0.4% as of Sept. 12, versus the 0.06% paid in March 2022, per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. Rates haven't been so great for borrowers, however, even as the Fed cut by a full point in 2024. Credit card annual percentage rates also remain high, standing at 20.12% as of a week ago, versus 16.34% in March 2022, according to Bankrate. With the market so sure that a rate cut is coming, some have suggested Wednesday's news could put pressure on stocks. "As we look toward month-end, Fed Day may act as a 'sell-the-news' event as investors take time to consider the Fed future reaction function, potentially stretched positioning, a temporarily weaker corporate buyback bid, waning Retail investor participation, and quarter-end rebalancing," JPMorgan's trading desk wrote. Others fear the interest rate cut will itself do more harm than good, with longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni saying it's "throwing gasoline on a fire."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In an 11-to-1 vote signaling less dissent than Wall Street had anticipated, the Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point. Newly-installed Governor Stephen Miran was the only policymaker voting against the quarter-point move, instead advocating for a half-point cut. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, looked at for possible additional dissents, both voted for the 25-basis point reduction. All were appointed by President Donald Trump, who has badgered the Fed all summer to cut not merely in its traditional quarter-point moves but to lower the fed funds rate quickly and aggressively. In the post-meeting statement, the committee again characterized economic activity as having "moderated" but added language saying that "job gains have slowed" and noted that inflation "has moved up and remains somewhat elevated." Lower job growth and higher inflation are in conflict with the Fed's twin goals of stable prices and full employment. Stocks were volatile after the decision was released, with major averages mixed after Chair Jerome Powell characterized the cut as "risk management" rather than something more directed at shoring up a weak economy. Treasury yields also were mixed, falling on short-duration issues but up otherwise. "The marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers is unusual in this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market," he said. Powell added that the decision to cut puts monetary policy in a "more neutral" position as opposed to previous characterizations of moderately restrictive. The grid, however, showed a wide level of disparity, with one dot, possibly Miran's, pointing to a total of 1.25 percentage points in additional reductions this year. The plot is done anonymously, with one dot for each meeting participant, but Miran has been an advocate for much lower rates. Nine of the 19 participants indicated just one more reduction this year, while 10 saw two, which would indicate moves at the October and December meetings. One official did not want any cuts, including Wednesday's. "We think it would take a significant upside surprise in inflation or labor market rebound to take the Fed off its current easing trajectory." The plot indicated one cut in 2026, significantly slower than current market pricing of three. Traders had fully priced in this week's move. Officials also indicated another reduction in 2027, as the Fed approaches a long-run neutral rate of 3%. Projections released following the meeting on general economic conditions saw slightly faster economic growth than was projected in June, while the outlooks for unemployment and inflation were unchanged. A stunning level of political drama preceded the meeting, especially for an institution that generally does its business quietly and with few dissenting voices. A year ago, against similar worries that a gradual rise in the unemployment rate could be signaling broader weakness, the FOMC approved a jumbo half-point reduction that Trump has said was politically motivated to influence the presidential election in favor of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. The president has said lower rates are needed to bolster the moribund housing market and to reduce financing costs for government debt. However, Powell said there was no "widespread support" for a half-point cut at the meeting. There was an additional layer of political intrigue this week as a court blocked Trump from removing Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee under former President Joe Biden. The White House has accused Cook of mortgage fraud involving federally backed loans she received for homes she purchased, though no charges have been brought. Recent signals have shown that economic growth remains solid and consumer spending topping forecasts, though the labor market has been a point of contention. Job creation has been stagnant this year, and a recent update from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the economy created nearly a million fewer jobs than initially reported in the 12-month period prior to March 2025. Governor Waller in particular has expressed concern that the Fed should ease policy now to head off future issues in the labor market. His name also has been in the mix as a potential replacement for Powell, whose term expires in May 2026. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ellis Stephens, a husband, father, and self-proclaimed hustler, wakes up well before dawn most days. He makes his way into his garage, turns on the lights, pulls up a chair, and begins creating one-of-a-kind Labubus. Stephens buys Labubus, the trendy plush monsters designed by Kasing Lung, in bulk from resellers on the street, customizes them with tattoos, piercings, gemstones, and more, and then upsells them for a major profit. He sells standard-sized, customized Labubus for $217 each, but customers can also submit orders for a two-pack or larger-sized Labubus that cost more. For many years, his day job was as a high school art teacher. However, the pay as a teacher wasn't enough to fund the type of art projects he wanted to do with his students, like 3D printing and using CNC routing to cut and engrave wood and plastic. So, he started side hustling to make some extra cash. He's juggled multiple side hustles over the years, from selling burritos on street corners to running a photo booth business and selling custom T-shirts. He completes about 80 Labubu-related orders a month, which amounts to thousands of extra dollars in revenue. So far this year, the Chinese parent company, Pop Mart, has seen a 667% increase year-over-year in sales largely due to its Labubu toys and related merchandise, according to EMARKETER (Business Insider's sister company). Pop Mart is on track to sell $1 billion worth of Labubu merch this year. Stephens is more than happy to ride the little monsters' trend wave. "People say art's not going to take you anywhere. I've heard that my whole life," he said, adding it's now the complete opposite. "I'm able to inspire other lives and show people that art — you don't have to be a starving artist." Stephens started out buying the toys in bulk and reselling them as is, but he was hardly making any profit. However, the masks he sells for about $20 to $30 a piece. The real money is in his customized tattooed Labubus. When Stephens posted his first tattooed Labubu on Instagram for $60 last year, he was quickly flooded with messages from people who wanted to buy it. Soon, he was fielding requests for characters with face tattoos, replicas of rappers like Post Malone and Lil Peep, and designs tied to customers' personal stories. Stephens has been a tattoo artist for years, but said customizing Labubus has pushed him to refine his skills since the toys are so delicate. Labubu hands, for example, are the hardest to tattoo, he said, because they're made of tough vinyl that can sometimes cause the tattoo needle to skip or bend. Aside from fine-line sketching, one of Stephens's challenges is dealing with customers who sometimes change requests mid-order or grow impatient with shipping delays — but to him, it's all worth it. "It's hard to stop now that people are so into it and my work is being recognized," he said. Stephens' Labubu business has taken up a lot of his time. After that, he leaves for work at school, then he comes home, hustles a little more, eat dinner with his family, and there's not much time left before bed. He said he gets around five hours of sleep a night and doesn't plan to stop because the opportunity has finally given him some financial freedom. "Customizing this stuff has seriously changed my life. I could finally invest in an actual workspace," he said, adding: "My goal is to have an art building where I just do art and teach people the power of art."

A Tricolor dealership in Houston.

In the wake of the sudden collapse of subprime auto lender Tricolor Holdings, creditors across the US are scrambling to stake their claim on the company's remaining assets and contain their losses.

In Dallas, the regional bank Triumph Financial Inc. has dispatched teams of employees to used-car lots, where they're identifying and whisking away to safe locations the vehicles they believe are the collateral to their loans. In midtown Manhattan, a boutique investment firm that built a position in Tricolor's asset-backed bonds, Clear Haven Capital Management, has been calling other bondholders, urging them to band together and fight to keep the big banks away from the assets that belong to them. Those banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Fifth Third Bancorp, have begun to forensically examine their own collateral to try to ascertain the magnitude of the losses.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some consumers are cutting back their spending, including on food and dining out. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has a plan to win over cost-conscious customers, though: Offer great customer service. Niccol said Starbucks was trying to draw in customers with a great experience. "Right now, when I ask people to name me a great customer service company, I usually get a blank stare," Niccol said. "When you look at putting those two things together for the price that we will have to charge for it, I think it will turn out to be invaluable," Niccol said. A Starbucks spokesperson directed Business Insider to Niccol's earlier commentary, which suggested customers were finding value from the strategy. "Customer value perceptions are near two-year highs, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennials, who make up over half our customer base," Niccol said on the company's third-quarter earnings call. Under Niccol's leadership, Starbucks has made several changes the company says are directed at improving service. Niccol also said during the third-quarter earnings call that the company was looking to get customers their drinks in cafés and drive-thrus within four minutes of when they order them. The initiatives are part of Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" turnaround effort. Niccol has said he wants each café to be "a welcoming coffeehouse" for patrons. A little over a year after he took the company's top job, some analysts who follow Starbucks have said they're still watching some key indicators — such as foot traffic and customer retention — for evidence that Niccol's strategy is working. Niccol said Tuesday that feedback from customers and store employees so far suggested Starbucks was making progress. "I think we're on our way to being that world-class customer service, customer-experience company," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zimbabwean billionaire Strive Masiyiwa has announced plans to build five artificial intelligence (AI) factories across Africa within the next year, as part of a $720 million investment through his company Cassava Technologies. The factories are expected to be built in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt and Morocco. He described the plan as part of Cassava's “Sovereign AI Cloud” strategy, which aims to allow African countries to host and run their own AI systems locally. “Our AI factory provides the infrastructure for innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, start-ups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure. In recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The first AI factory is already under development in South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). Cassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers. Company officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africa's digital economy. Building local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture. Cassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2. These companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent. Earlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers. If completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>XAI's data annotation team has faced sweeping layoffs and leadership changes this month — and the job of heading up the team training Grok has fallen to a college student who started working at the company eight months ago. Diego Pasini, who graduated from high school in 2023, took over the data annotation team that trains Grok after at least nine high-level employees had their Slack accounts deactivated last week, Business Insider previously reported. On September 15, Pasini led an all-hands meeting with the team's remaining workers and said the company had no plans for further layoffs, three workers told Business Insider. Another group of employees — more than 100 — were laid off shortly after, the workers said. In recent days, Pasini's team has led rapid-fire one-on-one meetings at which employees have been asked to explain their work at the company, 11 current and former workers said. Before the team's layoffs, Pasini also posted an announcement in Slack asking workers to focus on a series of tests that would determine their future position at xAI, BI previously reported. The data annotation team is made up of contract and full-time staff tasked with labeling, categorizing, and contextualizing raw data to teach Grok how to better understand the world. Prior to last week's layoffs, it had a headcount of around 1,500. Pasini and xAI did not respond to requests for comment. Before joining xAI, Pasini attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied computer science and economics, according to his LinkedIn profile. His status at the university is listed as "on leave," per LinkedIn. Pasini was also listed as a 2024 fellow at the investment firm Contrary, which says it has worked with companies including Anduril and Replit. His fellowship profile said he was "excited about the future of robotics and hard tech startups." He graduated in 2023, according to a bulletin from the school. He was on a robotics team and presented research on drones at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2022, according to an Instagram post from the Pingry School. Any person with half a brain knows that all of Elon's companies are in their infancy. On GitHub, Pasini follows several people from Musk's ecosystem, including Andrej Karpathy, Tesla's former director of AI; George Hotz, a self-driving car developer who worked at Twitter during Musk's acquisition in 2022; and Luke Farritor, a 24-year-old staffer at Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Silicon Valley also has a long history of tech stars who didn't graduate from college, including Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg. On his personal website, Pasini lists interests in computer vision and Napoleonic history. That person had joined xAI after working at Tesla for over a decade in a management role on the Autopilot data annotation team. After Pasini took over at xAI, two employees spoke critically about him on Slack. One of the workers questioned how he moved into the role given his credentials, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider.Both workers had their accounts deactivated within hours of posting, screenshots show.Do you work for xAI or have a tip?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jean Frohling always wanted to help her three children buy places of their own. She and her husband, now in their mid-60s, saved for years in hopes of one day pulling their kids onto the property ladder. Eventually, hard work and foresight paid off: They gifted each of their first two children thousands of dollars to pad the down payments on their first homes. The Frohlings figured their then 33-year-old daughter could probably afford the house on her own, but they decided to leave even less to chance this time. Frohling and her husband opted to buy the home outright, paying $186,000 in cash. "We just felt there was some negotiation power in the cash offer, and that it would ease the transition," Frohling tells me. Nepotism is a hot topic these days: So-called "nepo babies" seem to be everywhere, riding the coattails of their rich and famous parents to land starring roles in movies, record Billboard hits, and wield power in Washington. The housing market isn't Hollywood, but as long as families have had a few dollars to pass down from one generation to the next, youngsters have relied on help from parents to get their foot in the door. Over the past three decades, about 30% of first-time homebuyers each year used a gift or loan from family and friends, data from the National Association of Realtors shows. Conditions would appear ripe for nepo buyers' numbers to spike — with prices high and borrowing rates still steep, lots of home shoppers could use a hand. Many baby boomers are sitting on piles of home equity or bulging investment portfolios that they could theoretically tap to aid their millennial and Gen Z offspring. The past few years of NAR data have shown a significant dip from the historical average: In 2024, only a quarter of first-time buyers got help from friends and family. For all buyers, this share has slipped to just 10%. The market has been so brutal for young buyers that it can be hard to imagine someone making it onto the housing ladder without a boost. Has the bank of mom and dad run dry? "This is a different type of first-time homebuyer than we've seen historically," Jessica Lautz, the deputy chief economist at NAR, tells me. For those forced to rely on their humble savings accounts, all of this may sound encouraging: Fewer nepo buyers might mean better odds for everyone else. Ironically, the thinning ranks of nepo buyers may be yet another sign that something's amiss. Like it or not, the bank of mom and dad plays a crucial role in propelling Americans into homeownership. Elder family members with the means to do so may chip in money for a down payment, extend a friendly loan with below-market terms, or simply buy a house and put their kid on the title, like the Frohlings did. In 2019, according to NAR, a whopping 32% of first-time buyers — and 16% of all buyers — leveraged some help from family and friends for their home purchase. "I do think that family has always played a role," Lautz tells me. This kind of assistance isn't limited to the ultrawealthy. Chase Rogers, a mortgage loan officer in Birmingham, Alabama, where the median sale price is about $190,000 — well below the national median of more than $440,000 — says he's recently seen middle-class buyers use family help to slightly level up their purchase. These kinds of buyers, he says, "can qualify for something without help from their families, but then to get something more to their taste, maybe a little bit higher price range, they are getting help." Geoff Black, a mortgage loan officer in Sacramento, California, watched family money pour into the market during the COVID-era frenzy. Back then, he says, the prevailing attitude among parents was, "You need to get in right now." The affordability barriers have only continued to rise. The median home price is up roughly 37% since July 2020. A recent Bankrate study found that the household income required to afford a typical home has surged to nearly $117,000, up from about $78,000 in early 2020. As affordability has only gotten worse over the past few years, purchases with gifts have — bafflingly — faded. Black says gift-giving seemed to peak around 2021 or early 2022, right when NAR's data began showing a decline in nepo buyers' market share. After hovering around 27% in 2020 and 2021, just 22% of first-time buyers got help from family or friends in 2022, the lowest on record. The following year showed only a slight uptick, to 23%. The decline of nepo buyers also coincides with another big shift in the makeup of new homeowners: First-time buyers are older and winning out with less frequency than ever before. First-time buyers' market share also shrank to a new low of just 24%, down from 32% the year prior. Perhaps unsurprisingly, buyers who made it through the door were better funded than in years past — the median household income of first-timers was $97,000, a jump of $26,000 in two years. Family help is less common because the market is dominated by older, more independent buyers who can push forward despite the affordability challenges. Each year that prospective homeowners kick the can down the road, they grow less likely to ask for a family handout. NAR found last year that younger millennials, which it defined as ages 26 to 34, got gifts from family at about twice the rate of the elder cohort, ages 35 to 44. "It becomes more uncomfortable for someone who's 38 years old, which is the median age of today's first-time homebuyer, to ask for mom and dad's help to purchase a home," Lautz says, "as opposed to someone who is in their late 20s or younger 30s." Older first-time homebuyers miss out on years of home-equity building, contributing to what Lautz often refers to as a "housing economy of 'haves' and 'have-nots.'" As I noted in a recent story about homebuyers' cold feet, the fear of missing out that defined the early-COVID market has given way to a different flavor of FOMO. With those on shakier ground hanging back, the buyers forging ahead are older and wealthier than at any point in more than four decades. Of course, parents can pass along privilege in all kinds of ways that aren't clear at the closing table. Paying for college tuition, say, can ensure their child graduates debt-free and ready to stack savings. A growing number of first-time buyers are moving straight out of their parents' places, saving on rent before heading out on their own. Even homebuyers who don't get a financial handout may benefit from the advice and know-how of parents who have already weathered the process. That kind of help doesn't always equate to a free ride, though. Roughly a year after Frohling and her husband purchased the Illinois home, their daughter refinanced to pull equity out of the house to pay her parents back. While nepo buyers' numbers are down, they're far from extinct. Mitchell estimates that about 20% of the first-time buyers he works with use family money to beef up their offers. "When I see that situation, and I see that I've got these clients that have made an offer on one, two, three homes and got beat out by cash offers, that's typically when I'll say, 'Hey, let's think of potential alternative strategies here,'" Mitchell tells me. "'Do you have family that would be willing to help out in a situation like this?'" Frohling says she initially worried she had robbed her daughter of the joy that comes with buying something all on your own after years of saving. But for Frohling's daughter, homeownership didn't come without sacrifice: She and her husband, for example, skipped throwing a big wedding and saved that money instead. Update: September 17, 2025 — This story was updated to clarify that the estimated percentage of Bill Mitchell's clients who use family money only pertains to first-time buyers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DON'T MISS THIS: Mali draws inspiration from Russia during the Nazi era Under America's current president, Donald Trump, both countries have resolved to work together to face a threat they are all too familiar with, despite Mali being ruled by a junta government. Mali's military has utilized information from the U.S to conduct strikes against extremist groups around its region. Mali's current administration, led by General Assimi Goïta, took power through successive coups in 2020 and 2021, removing the previous civilian-led government amid growing dissatisfaction and instability. Mali, like fellow junta states Burkina Faso and Niger, decided after its successful coup to begin ridding itself of any Western influence. The country wasted no time in expelling military forces belonging to its former colonial ruler, France, noting that the years of military cooperation had done very little to bring stability to the region. However, much like France, the use of Russian forces to assist in combating terrorism has not been as successful as originally envisioned. Additionally, a study last month revealed how Russian private mercenary (Wagner) activities in Mali brought about deep divisions within the country's army and transitional military administration, raising concerns about Moscow's position in West Africa. The administration not only failed to persuade Mali to enact democratic reforms, but it also imposed sanctions on several high-ranking officers for their collaboration with Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. However, under Donald Trump's administration, discussions of collaboration have emerged, with reported developments regarding intelligence sharing. In a July meeting with Malian authorities in Bamako, Trump's deputy senior director for counterterrorism, Rudolph Atallah, told local media that the United States intended to back Mali in its fight against extremists if Mali was a cooperative partner. Officials from both the US and Mali confirmed that Atallah presented a proposal, encompassing intelligence sharing, U.S. equipment, and training, in an effort to foster a partnership with Mali.

Biden “had a more traditional approach to U.S. norms and democracy in this part of the world,” said Franklin Nossiter, the International Crisis Group's Sahel analyst.
