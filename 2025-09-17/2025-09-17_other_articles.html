                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research suggests that advanced extraterrestrial civilizations are incredibly rare, with plate tectonics and CO2 levels playing a crucial role in their development. In the vast Milky Way, billions of planets may harbor life, but new research presented at the EPSC-DPS2025 Joint Meeting suggests that alien civilizations capable of communication are likely rare. Plate tectonics is a fundamental process on Earth, responsible for recycling carbon and regulating the planet's climate over geological time scales. This reduction is essential for stabilizing the global climate over millions of years and making Earth a habitable environment. For extraterrestrial civilizations to thrive, a planet must exhibit similar tectonic activity. On Earth, plate tectonics has been crucial not only for maintaining a livable climate but also for enabling the evolution of intelligent life. As Dr. Scherf points out, the tectonic process is so vital to regulating conditions that “extraterrestrial intelligences—ETIs—in our galaxy are probably pretty rare.” Over time, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere needs to decrease, a change that typically happens due to plate tectonics. This long transformation allowed life to evolve, culminating in the development of complex organisms and, eventually, technological civilization. Without this process, it is unlikely that the conditions required for the development of advanced technology—such as oxygen levels sufficient for metal smelting—would be met. Scherf highlights this dependency, stating that, “For 10 civilizations to exist at the same time as ours, the average lifetime must be above 10 million years,” indicating that civilizations need stable environments to survive long enough for technology to develop. Earth itself took over 3 billion years to produce complex life forms capable of developing technologies. This long timeline makes the chance of two civilizations developing simultaneously very slim. Scherf's research emphasizes that the existence of civilizations is not just about the emergence of life but also about how long a civilization can endure before it becomes extinct, making the window of overlap between two civilizations incredibly narrow. The study concludes that civilizations capable of advanced technology are probably rare due to this long and complex process. If SETI fails to detect any signs of alien civilizations, it would lend further credence to the theory that intelligent civilizations are extremely rare. Scherf succinctly states, “Although ETIs might be rare there is only one way to really find out and that is by searching for it. If these searches find nothing, it makes our theory more likely, and if SETI does find something, then it will be one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever achieved as we would know that we are not alone in the universe.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two women who left the occult for Christianity are sounding the alarm on celebrity psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen, warning believers to be cautious about his popular brain scan treatments, books and spiritual influences. Marcia Montenegro, a former astrologer and founder of Christian Answers for the New Age, warned that Amen's work is infused with troubling New Age spirituality, from Hindu meditation practices to involvement with tantric sex teachings. Later, she discovered a video of Amen scanning psychic medium Teresa Caputo, known as the “Long Island Medium,” while she was performing a reading. “I couldn't believe that he would even entertain this,” Nizza said. “Was he trying to show some sort of scientific basis for psychic mediumship?” Montenegro explained that Amen's controversial brain scans are not endorsed by any major medical or psychiatric association. Montenegro explained that the practice involves chanting syllables said to represent birth, life, death and rebirth. “You're engaging in a Hindu practice that is based on the spiritual view about these sounds,” she said. “You are opening yourself up to a spirituality that is not from God.” The pair also highlighted Amen's collaboration on a CD series about tantric sex with an expert in the practice, which draws from Hindu and Buddhist mysticism. Montenegro, who said she practiced similar techniques during her time in the New Age, described it as a spiritual counterfeit. Nizza and Montenegro warned that Amen's large catalog of self-help books, including titles such as Change Your Brain, Change Your Life, You Happier and Memory Rescue, can be especially dangerous because they sound practical and scientific, yet are intertwined with ideas that actually contradict the Christian faith. The duo emphasized that the concern is not about rejecting doctors of different faith backgrounds, but about recognizing worldviews that shape medical advice. “When you're dealing with somebody who engages in the New Age, it encompasses their whole belief system,” Nizza said. Montenegro added that New Age spirituality is particularly aggressive in its cultural influence, often entering through health and wellness trends. “The New Age in our culture right now is one of the most aggressive, predatory spiritualities out there, because it's gone so mainstream and it appears so helpful and good,” she said. “As Christians, we can be deceived very easily,” she said. But the Bible says otherwise, we need to test it.” Our work is made possible by the generosity of supporters like you.

We make genre films, like “Mandy,” “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” and “Color Out of Space,” to name a few. I'm also what's known as an experiencer — that is, someone who has frequent experiences with the paranormal. This has been a condition throughout my life, though I only really began to understand and accept it about ten years ago. As a producer, one always strives to support stories that deal with the trials of our day-to-day lives honestly and accurately, and genre has always been a reliably sneaky way to smuggle those ideas onto the screen. But as I've come to settle into the strange reality of paranormal experience, I've felt an increasing obligation to portray the supernatural elements in film in ways that are equally honest and accurate. Related Stories With No One Else Buying Movies, Financiers Turn Distributors to Seize Opportunity Memo to Distributors: Buy These 2025 Fall Festival Movies It's a unique challenge we sought out in bringing writer/director Bryn Chainey's “Rabbit Trap” to the screen. The film is a sensitive portrait of a marriage in crisis, that of Darcy and Daphne Davenport (Dev Patel and Rosy McEwen), musicians who relocate from London to a cottage in Wales to complete their new album. When they inadvertently record a mystical sound never before heard by human ears, long-dormant Faerie forces are stirred from the ancient forest, and the veil between this world and theirs begins to thin. The Faeries of Celtic myth and folklore as seen in “Rabbit Trap” — also known as “The Fae” — have nothing whatsoever to do with fluttering wings and magic wands. They're a ferocious reclaiming of the natural world, a petulant demand for love and affection, and a mirror that reflects back one's deepest secrets — even the ones you hide from yourself. Bryn has crafted an enchanting sensory experience that's steeped in this folklore, and he breathes life into it. As any experiencer will tell you, the paranormal is beguiling by nature, a plunge into the unknown that offers no easy answers. And it most certainly doesn't unfold in three acts. It then becomes gradually more vast and mysterious as it unfolds, leading eventually to questions so expansive, they make one's head spin. The paranormal is a mystery that never stops unfolding. John Keel was among the first to capture this anti-structure in his seminal 1975 book, “The Mothman Prophecies,” a non-fiction classic detailing a series of small-town encounters with a giant moth-like hominid, which seemed to prognosticate the tragic collapse of the Silver Bridge in 1967. “Rabbit Trap,” haunting in its own right, elegantly captures both the allure and subtle dread one feels when finding oneself the protagonist in an uncanny journey, and as such it forges its own universe of logic, one that falls somewhere between traditional narrative and fable. It is in many ways a movie about longing. In a holistic sense, it's a longing to return to the primordial state of nature from whence we all came. In this way, “Rabbit Trap” is both a searingly compassionate illustration of marriage, and one of the most accurate portrayals of the paranormal experience that I've yet seen committed to film. Like the paranormal itself, this plunge into salty-sweet ambiguity is uncomfortable for some. For folks like me, it represents a profound catharsis — one we hope that others find solace in for years to come. “Rabbit Trap,” a Magnolia Pictures release, is now in theaters. With over 20 feature film credits, Daniel co-wrote and co-created the award-winning video game “Transference” for Ubisoft, and he wrote and directed “Max Rose,” the final starring vehicle of entertainment legend Jerry Lewis, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2013. “High Strangeness,” his original comic book series based on paranormal phenomena, will be released this fall from Oni Press.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We're looking forward to doing a bipartisan meeting with the Russian parliament here pretty soon,” Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, told news anchor Chris Cuomo during an interview on NewsNation last week. Luna said she had “recently” spoken with Russian government officials and asked whether they had information to share on the issue. Neither the U.S. Congress nor Russia's lower-house State Duma has publicly confirmed such discussions. Luna's comments came ahead of a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), where reporter George Knapp claimed the Soviet Union had attempted to reverse engineer UFOs during the Cold War. Her office told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti earlier this month that a U.S.-Russia parliamentary meeting on “neutral territory” was being prepared, though it did not specify the subject of that planned meeting. Russian lawmakers have also spoken of the possibility of talks with their American counterparts following the Aug. 15 summit in Alaska between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Formal congressional engagement with Russia's parliament largely ceased after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and came to a near halt following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A viral CCTV video has gone viral on social media, appearing to show China's military firing a missile at an unidentified object in Shandong province. According to Newsweek, local media couldn't identify the object, and details about the incident remain scarce, but it's believed multiple missiles were fired from an air defence system. Videos on social media appear to capture a fireball being intercepted by a bright light in the sky, resulting in an instant explosion. Multiple clips show the scene from different angles, with the fireball tracing a curved path before being destroyed. The mysterious explosion quickly went viral on social media, sparking speculation that the Chinese military had shot down a drone, meteor, or UFO. Some online users took it a step further, fueling fears that the military might have targeted and destroyed an extraterrestrial spacecraft. UFO researcher, Tom Thompson, wrote, "Defence analysts say this fits a missile-intercept test. Another X user commented, "Can anyone explain this video from China? Don't know what it is, though." Astrophysics expert Dr. Alfredo Carpineti reviewed the footage and expressed scepticism, noting that while the object initially appears to behave like a meteor, its behaviour later raises doubts. Reports of a missile test also haven't been confirmed, and Chinese authorities haven't made an official statement. Notably, China's military expansion is shrouded in secrecy, making it one of the most opaque in the world. Despite having the second-largest defence budget globally, the true extent of its spending remains unclear due to the confidential nature of its tender processes. The Chinese government prioritises secrecy in its top military programs, recently tightening rules around "state secrets" to control online sharing, particularly after images of its newest aircraft carrier surfaced on Western social media.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigators are urging anyone with any information to come forward. Northern Territory police have upped the reward for information in two cold cases involving a teenager's mysterious disappearance and an unsolved hit-and-run to $500,000 each. NT Police Force Acting Commander Drew Slape said 16-year-old Norman James Lawson was on a camping trip with four "associates" in Kakadu National Park in October 1986 when he vanished without a trace. "Norman's associates said that when preparing to leave the camp, he had not returned, and they identified his tracks walking along the road and located large crocodile tracks in nearby watercourses," he said. Drew Slape says "somebody out there, particularly in the case of Kwementyaye Nelson, definitely knows something". "The NT Police Force were formally notified [several days later] and formalised searches of the area but did not uncover any traces of Norman. "They were unable to establish any of his movements after his disappearance, and investigations did not conclude or exclude the possibility of foul play." Despite having injuries "consistent with being struck by [a] motor vehicle", he said no driver or passenger of the vehicle had ever come forward. "What I'd like to reiterate is that both of these men left behind families," he said. Kwementyaye Nelson died in 2014 after suffering injuries "consistent with being struck by [a] motor vehicle". "Across the community, what we're calling on is that if there are any members of the public who may have any information, no matter how small, we urge them to get in contact with police. Bradley John Murdoch's death is not enough to quash the goal of finding Peter Falconio's remains and delivering answers to his family, a cold case forensics expert says. Acting Commander Slape said while both cases were "investigated extensively" at the time, no new leads had emerged in the years since. "However, somebody out there, particularly in the case of Kwementyaye Nelson, definitely knows something. The investigations join those of Peter Falconio and Richard Roe among the NT cold cases now attracting a $500,000 reward for information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Residents of eastern China were left stunned after dramatic videos appeared to capture missiles streaking across the night sky and colliding with unknown objects. The incident took place on 12 September over Weifang, a coastal city in Shandong province. Footage shared online shows a projectile blazing through the darkness before exploding after meeting another fast-moving object. Local witnesses described hearing deafening noises that rattled their windows. One resident filming on his phone could be heard saying a “missile” had been launched. CCTV recordings later posted to Weibo appeared to show two separate launches just minutes apart, both following similar flight paths before detonating high above the city. The videos quickly went viral on Weibo, China's largest social media platform, sparking more than 150 million views by Tuesday. Theories ranged wildly, from alien spacecraft to rogue drones or even a meteorite. Officials in Weifang said they had no knowledge of the event. Neither Shandong's provincial Emergency Management Department nor China's Defence Ministry offered any comment. Just days earlier, China's Maritime Safety Administration had issued navigational warnings for live-fire drills in the Bohai Sea, close to Weifang's Weibei artillery range. Authorities have also tightened rules on what the public can share online, especially following repeated leaks of new military hardware. This lack of transparency has only amplified public curiosity. When official explanations are absent, speculation often fills the gap, whether about new defence systems or, in this case, talk of extraterrestrial visitors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Candace Owens has sparked a row over comments made about Charlie Kirk after the latter's recent death. Owens, who has often spread bizarre misinformation, dropped a bombshell claim on Kirk, based purely on a conversation she claimed to have had with the conservative influencer. Owen's claims revolved around Charlie Kirk's support for Israel. She claimed, though, Kirk was "changing his opinion" on Israel, and billionaire Bill Ackman "pressured him" in a meeting at the Hamptons to visit Israel. Owens also claimed that in one of his last conversations with Kirk, she talked about his faith and how Kirk was moving away from Protestantism and started preferring Catholicism. "I want to simply say this regarding Candace Owens: Charlie Kirk was a friend to Candace and never publicly spoke poorly of her though he disagreed with her. He never operated nor entertained gossip or innuendo concerning Candace. Also read: Texas student re-enacts Charlie Kirk's assassination as onlookers laugh in viral video "My only comment I offer regarding Candace is this: I only wish at this tragic time of mourning she would be the friend to Charlie that he was to her. He would never have treated Candace or her family in such a way had God forbid this tragedy been hers." Their partnership flourished through 2019, with Owens describing Kirk "like a brother". In March 2024, Owens officially parted ways with The Daily Wire, citing disagreements tied partly to her views on Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Planetary alignments may guide the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, boosting chances of detecting alien technosignatures in nearby star systems. For decades, the search for alien intelligence has revolved around the question: if someone out there is listening, how could they hear us? A new study combining data from Penn State and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggests that our own deep space transmissions may provide a roadmap — both for alien observers and for our efforts to find them. Researchers dug into 20 years of NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) transmission logs to analyze how often, and in which directions, our strongest signals travel. The findings highlight that human communication patterns are far from random. Instead, they tend to align with specific planetary movements, offering clues for where astronomers might most effectively search for technosignatures from other civilizations. The Deep Space Network, operated by NASA, is a collection of massive ground-based antennas that keep humanity in touch with spacecraft far from Earth. These transmissions are powerful, steady, and — crucially — detectable far beyond our planet. It sends some of humanity's strongest and most persistent radio signals into space, and the public logs of its transmissions allowed our team to establish the temporal and spatial patterns of those transmissions for the past 20 years.” By matching transmission logs with spacecraft positions, the team mapped out exactly when and where our signals were most likely to spill into the cosmos. Nearly all signals followed this “dinner plate” shape of the solar system, rarely venturing at steep angles. Much of this activity centered on Mars, humanity's most explored neighbor. Communications with probes and rovers on the red planet produced a predictable flow of signals. As Pinchen Fan, lead author of the paper and a graduate student at Penn State, put it: “Humans are predominantly communicating with the spacecraft and probes we have sent to study other planets like Mars. For any hypothetical alien civilization, these windows would be the best time to eavesdrop on Earth. Fan noted the importance of new instruments for broadening this work. “Because we are only starting to detect a lot of exoplanets in the last decade or two, we do not know many systems with two or more transiting exoplanets. With the upcoming launch of NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, we expect to detect a hundred thousand previously undetected exoplanets, so our potential search area should increase greatly.” The study also calculated just how far DSN transmissions might reach. Within this radius lie dozens of nearby stars, many with their own planets. Civilizations in these systems — especially those aligned edge-on with our solar system — would have a much better chance of noticing us. Radio isn't the only way humanity communicates across space. Lasers would reduce spillover, making them harder to detect by accident. Yet if aliens prefer precision over leakage, they might use lasers as their technosignatures. The researchers suggest that their alignment-based strategy could apply here too. While lasers may be narrower, alignments still improve chances of detection. Any civilization sending powerful, directed messages might reveal itself during predictable orbital events. Using our own deep space communications as a baseline, we quantified how future searchers for alien intelligence could be improved by focusing on systems with particular orientations and planet alignments.” In other words, the signals we send today could be the very same kinds of technosignatures we should be looking for tomorrow. SETI researchers often face the daunting task of deciding where to point their telescopes. The sky is vast, and technosignatures could take many forms. Intelligent civilizations, if they exist, may share common technological needs. Just as our spacecraft require robust communication links, theirs might too. And just as our transmissions cluster around planetary alignments, so might theirs. It suggests a new way of thinking about interstellar communication. Rather than searching blindly, astronomers can use the rhythms of planets as guides. Alignments, orbits, and system geometry may act as natural markers where technosignatures are most likely to appear. Research findings are available online in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.
