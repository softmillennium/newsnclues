                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live coverage of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. State visits in Britain blend 21st-century diplomacy with royal pageantry. King Charles III will host Trump at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before talks the next day with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WINDSOR, England (AP) — President Donald Trump relished the glow of a British royal spectacle on Wednesday, reveling in hours of pageantry with King Charles III while making time for a quiet tribute at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb. Opening a two-day state visit, the grandeur-loving president soaked it all up, from the largest guard of honor in living memory, with 120 horses and 1,300 troops, to carriage rides, an air show and a Windsor Castle dinner. No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has had the honor of a second U.K. state visit; Trump's first was in 2019, during his previous term. The display of regal splendor was meant to bolster ties with Trump at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements around the globe. Prince William and his wife, Kate, meet the presidential helicopter in the private Walled Garden on the vast Windsor estate, then walked Trump and first lady Melania Trump over to be greeted by Charles and Queen Camilla. The guests traveled to the castle in a procession of horse-drawn carriages, past ranks of soldiers, sailors and aviators. They continued to chat and joke as the day progressed, with the king occasionally putting his hand on Trump's back. Part of the day was spent at St. George's Chapel on the castle grounds, where Trump placed a wreath in honor of Elizabeth, who died in 2022. The president and Charles toured the Royal Collection Display in an ornate room where officials laid out five tables of artifacts on U.S.-British relations. There were materials from the first trans-Atlantic cable, including messages between Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan, as well as a 1930s hot dog picnic that a young Elizabeth wrote about, and a large glass vessel that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the queen during a 1957 state visit. “Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents on U.S. independence. U.S. flag and Union flag are hanged outside the Windsor Castle ahead of the state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump next week in Windsor, England, Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. The president walked a red carpet on the castle's East Lawn to watch the Beating Retreat, a military parade ceremony that featured 200-plus musicians, dates to the 1600s and was once used to call patrolling soldiers back to their castle at day's end. A scheduled flyover by F-35 jets from the U.K. and U.S. militaries was scrapped due to poor weather conditions. But the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's aerobatics display team, thundered overhead, leaving streaks of red, white and blue smoke in their wake and drawing a visible reaction from both Trumps. The dinner menu featured Hampshire watercress panna cotta with Parmesan shortbread and quail egg salad, along with Norfolk chicken ballotine. Desert was vanilla ice cream bombe with a raspberry sherbet interior and lightly poached Victorian plums. Trump avoids alcohol, but the bar offerings included a cocktail known as the Transatlantic whiskey sour infused with marmalade, Warre's 1945 Vintage Port –- Trump is the 45th and 47th American president –- and Hennessy 1912 Cognac Grande Champagne. The royals also gave first lady Melania Trump a silver and enamel bowl and a personalized handbag by British designer Anya Hindmarch. Trump gave Charles a replica of an Eisenhower sword, and Camilla received a vintage Tiffany & Co. gold, diamond and ruby brooch. The royals' history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet joining them. Invitations handed out at the request of the elected government are a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions from reluctant allies. In his talks with Trump, Starmer will promote a new U.K.-U.S. technology agreement. British officials also want to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. On Tuesday, the campaign group Led By Donkeys projected an image of Trump and Epstein on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president's relationship with the late American financier. But this one is in Windsor, a historic town of just over 30,000 people about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of central London. That makes it easier to control protests and protect Trump at a time of increased international tensions, especially after the fatal shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk last week in Utah. British police have undertaken a massive security operation to ensure Trump's safety. That did not stop thousands of demonstrators who marched through central London on Wednesday to protest Trump's visit. Some held banners that said “No to the racism, no to Trump.” Though the activities were smaller than during Trump's visit in June 2019, they included mini versions of the giant Trump baby blimp, an orange-tinted caricature of the president in a diaper that made a big impression during those demonstrations six years ago. But “inside it's very dreary and it's currently being renovated, which is one reason why Mr. Trump will not be staying there.</p>

Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen analyzes what is driving 'ugly' comments about Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's assassination on 'America Reports.' In the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder, some on the left — many in the education sphere — have come out dismissing or even celebrating his death as a way of disputing his conservative political views. While some have hailed Kirk as a champion of free expression, numerous teachers and educators have faced suspension or scrutiny for online comments appearing to mock or cheer his death, bringing to the fore questions about political bias inside America's classrooms. House Education and Workforce Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., told Fox News Digital too many students are being "indoctrinated to hate those they disagree with instead of thoughtfully engaging with peers to discuss differences." In a statement, Senate Health Education Labor & Pensions Committee chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said there is a "clear lesson" over educators and others losing jobs for "vile" public comments about Charlie Kirk. "If your first reaction to a hate-fueled assassination is more hatred, ask yourself if you should put your phone down. Charlie Kirk speaks at CPAC in Oxon Hill, Maryland. The House panel further provided Fox News Digital with a separate statement mourning Kirk as a "true champion of free speech" and highlighting the importance of "honest and productive debate" versus politicized censorship. "Charlie inspired thousands of students to speak their minds, ask difficult questions, and engage in meaningful conversations — regardless of political affiliation," Walberg said. Kirk helped students feel empowered to express their beliefs without fear, he said, and reminded the next generation of the importance of "intellectual diversity." However, many educators across the country do not share Walberg's view, as cases of teachers being suspended or scrutinized for their own reactions come to light. In Massachusetts, at least three different school districts reported teachers being put under investigation for public reactions to Kirk's murder. In Framingham, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, Superintendent Robert Tremblay confirmed to the city's Fox affiliate that "while the law prevents us from discussing specific personnel matters, the employee is on leave pending an internal review. Be assured that we are addressing the situation in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies." Teachers in another Boston suburb, Sharon, Massachusetts, as well as the Wachusett Regional School District near Worcester, also were scrutinized, according to the Fox affiliate. Florida Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas warned his office is now on the lookout for more such inappropriate reactions to Kirk's murder, after a teacher in the state allegedly posted that while the 31-year-old's obituary was not the one she hoped to wake up to, it was a close second to an unstated one. Online chatter alleged the inference was a swipe at President Donald Trump. "Teachers are held to a higher standard as public servants and must ensure their conduct does not undermine the trust of the students and families they serve," Kamoutsas said in a statement first reported by Politico. "We will hold teachers who choose to make disgusting comments about the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk accountable." A teacher in Greenville, South Carolina, was "no longer employed" as of Thursday after the district confirmed to local media that he posted on social media that "American became greater today. In Pennsylvania, a teacher in Lancaster City came under scrutiny after also reportedly posting widely condemned comments about Kirk. A post on social media called Kirk a "racist, xenophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, sexist, white nationalist mouthpiece," and was allegedly shared by the teacher. I extend absolutely no empathy for people like that," which led the district to issue a statement to Lancaster newspaper LNP. "We are aware of the reaction to an online post shared by one of our employees on a personal social media platform," the statement said. "The School District of Lancaster abhors violence of any kind and is committed to schools that are safe, inclusive, and welcoming to all in our community." A teachers union official in the Keystone State went on to tell the paper that violence and threats of violence are the opposite of "everything we as educators commit our lives and careers to." "Political violence jeopardizes our democracy and deepens the fear, hatred and division that too often dominates over national discourse," PSEA spokesperson Christopher Lilienthal said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield said Tuesday that he is splitting from the ice cream company, claiming that it is being “silenced” by its parent company, Unilever. Ben & Jerry's and its two co-founders are known for being vocal about current events and politics, such as advocating returning lands to native tribes and “gender-affirming care.” Co-founder Ben Cohen said Greenfield made the “difficult decision” to resign after 47 years with the company, sharing a lengthy statement from Greenfield on X explaining his exit. “What has made their work so important to me, and what allowed the company to be more than just an ice cream company, was the independence to pursue our values, which was guaranteed when Unilever bought the company,” Greenfield's statement reads. “For more than twenty years under their ownership, Ben & Jerry's stood up and spoke out in support of peace, justice, and human rights, not as abstract concepts, but in relation to real events happening in our world.” I'm sharing his words as he resigns from Ben & Jerry's. “That independence existed in no small part because of the unique merger agreement Ben and I negotiated with Unilever, one that enshrined our social mission and values in the company's governance structure in perpetuity,” Greenfield said. Greenfield also said Ben & Jerry's is being “silenced” out of “fear for upsetting those in power.” He concluded his statement by saying he would continue to work toward “equity, justice and a better world” outside Ben & Jerry's. The Washington Examiner contacted Unilever for comment. Greenfield and Cohen advocated former Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 campaign by introducing an ice cream flavor called “Kamala's Coconut Jubilee,” a reference to her famous “fell out of a coconut tree” remark. Cohen also went viral in May when he and several protesters disrupted a Senate hearing for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Cohen appeared to be shouting, “You're killing poor kids in Gaza and paying for it by cutting Medicaid for kids here,” as Capitol Police escorted him out.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, appeared before a judge by video from jail on Tuesday. Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder and could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk. The man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been charged with aggravated murder. The charge means 22-year-old Tyler Robinson could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem. 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was arrested on suspicion of assassinating Charlie Kirk. The suspect in custody in connection with the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a 22-year-old from Utah, authorities said Friday. Charlie Kirk's mastery of social media was key to him becoming a force in conservative politics. Social media has become the town square for increasingly strident debate and the forum for which conservatives have sought to punish people they feel aren't offering Kirk the proper respect. A national flag hangs over the site where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week, Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, in Orem, Utah.

In this image from video provided by Utah State Courts, Tyler James Robinson attends a virtual court hearing from prison in Utah, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk. OREM, Utah (AP) — Utah Valley University students returning to campus Wednesday clustered silently, staring down at the barricaded courtyard where an assassin struck down conservative activist Charlie Kirk in an attack that upended the nation. Matthew Caldwell, 24, said his classmates were quieter and seemed more genuine about being in class even with sadness still in air. “The way that we treat each other in our words can ultimately lead to things like this,” he said. “And I think everybody sort of understands that a little bit better now.” On Tuesday, prosecutors charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with capital murder and announced they will seek the death penalty while revealing a series of incriminating messages and DNA evidence that they say connect Robinson to the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and confidant of President Donald Trump. Former Democratic President Barack Obama said this week that Trump has further divided the country rather than work to bring people together. “Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” said GOP Rep. James Comer, the committee chair, signaling a shift for congressional Republicans, who had previously scrutinized online platforms for policing free speech. Investigators say that sometime after Robinson fired a single fatal shot from the rooftop of a campus building overlooking where Kirk was speaking on Sept. 10, he texted his romantic partner and said to look under a keyboard. A judge read the charges and said he would appoint an attorney to represent him. A message was left Wednesday with the county's public defender office. Law enforcement officials say they are looking at whether others knew about Robinson's plans or helped, but they have not said if his partner is among those being investigated, only expressing appreciation for the partner sharing information. Robinson remained on the run for more than a day until his parents recognized him in a photo released by authorities. Utah Valley is conducting a review, university President Astrid S. Tuminez said Wednesday. Spencer Cox met with students and campus leaders near the shooting scene, saying he understands they might still be haunted and angry over what happened. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but Gray said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred. Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Trump win back the White House in 2024. His political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through social media, his podcast and campus events. While court documents said Robinson wrote in one text that planned the attack for more than a week, authorities have not said what they believe that entailed. Gray declined to answer whether Robinson targeted Kirk for his anti-transgender views. Kirk was shot while taking a question that touched on mass shootings and transgender people. Robinson was involved in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who investigators say is transgender. Robinson's mother told investigators that their son had turned hard left politically in the last year and became more supportive of gay and transgender rights, Gray said. She recognized him when authorities released a picture of the suspect and his parents confronted him, at which time Robinson said he wanted to kill himself, Gray said. I am sorry to involve you,” Robinson wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• NOW: FBI Director Kash Patel is appearing before the House Judiciary Committee, facing tough questions from lawmakers for the second day in a row. • Epstein files: The Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein Files is taking center stage, as Democrats press Patel on his previous statements about a cover-up and ask why more documents haven't been released. • Senate hearing: Tuesday, Patel testified and took questions yesterday about the probe into conservative activist Charlie Kirk's murder. Republicans who sit on the Senate Judiciary Commitee urged the Trump administration to release all files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, one day after FBI Director Kash Patel vowed the agency would share everything that it was “legally permitted” to. “Gotta release the files,” Sen. Josh Hawley told CNN, saying he was heartened that Patel had expressed an openness to releasing all files that were not classified or blocked by a court order. Hawley added that he doesn't “think this needs to be a big deal.” Sen. John Kennedy, who pressed Patel on Epstein during yesterday's Senate Judiciary hearing said he's not “satisfied or dissatisfied” with the FBI director's responses, explaining, “I have no way of evaluating his answers because we haven't seen the files.” “The American people, they don't read Aristotle every day. They're busy earning a living, but they follow this,” he said, calling the public's desire for more answers a “very normal, appropriate response” to the flurry of disturbing news about Epstein and his associates. Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal accused FBI Director Kash Patel of creating a “giant cover-up” of the Epstein files after suddenly discovering “Donald Trump's name was all over these files.” The lawmaker told Patel that some alleged victims of Epstein have not testified before, asking Patel why he had not met with them. “Is the answer yes or no to whether or not you met with these women who were sexually abused and raped?” Jayapal said, pounding her open hand on the desk. “Any insinuation by you or any people on your side that I am not manhunting child predators and sex traffickers, just look at the stats,” Patel said. The FBI director added later that “we have routinely asked people to come forward with more evidence and we will look at it.” “Are you going to continue to cover up for the rich and powerful men – including those who might be on this committee?” Jayapal shouted after Chairman Jim Jordan moved onto the next lawmaker's questions. FBI Director Kash Patel said Wednesday that there are not any suggestive photographs of Donald Trump with underage girls, pushing back on claims that Jeffrey Epstein had such images in his possession. “Are there any photos showing Donald Trump with girls of an uncertain age?” Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu asked Patel during the hearing after he played a video in which the journalist Michael Wolff said Epstein had, years earlier, shown him such photos. “No,” Patel said, to which the California congressman responded, “How do you know that?” “Because that information would have been brought to light by multiple administrations and FBI investigators over the course of last 20 years,” the director replied. FBI Director Kash Patel's second day of hearings continued its descent into tit-for-tat exchanges and circular back-and-forths about the handling of the Epstein files Tuesday as Democrats continued to repeat questions and the director made personal attacks on some lawmakers. “I'm going to borrow you're terminology and call bulls**t on your entire career in Congress,” Patel said when Swalwell asked if the director would recuse himself from any investigations of those individuals mentioned in the list. “It has been a disgrace to the American people,” Patel said as the two men spoke over each other and more members joined in the fray as Chairman Jim Jordan began hammering his gavel to gain order. Republican Rep. Chip Roy pushed FBI Director Kash Patel on Wednesday to say that billionaire George Soros and leftist organizations have been backing inexperienced prosecutors to lead local district attorneys' offices. Roy, citing a report from the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, said that progressive districts have “outsourced core parts of the American criminal justice system to activists and political donors” like Soros, a billionaire who is a frequent target of far-right conspiracy theories. The lawmaker's comments also come as President Donald Trump has suggested that Soros and liberal groups should be investigated for allegedly encouraging violence, which critics say is part of the president's effort to go after political opponents. FBI Director Kash Patel was noncommittal when pressed Wednesday on whether he would meet with victims of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Pressed by Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie on the possibility of such a meeting, Patel said only that members of his bureau would meet “with anyone who has new information.” “Will you personally meet with them?” Massie, who represents part of Kentucky, asked Patel, referring to the victims. “Should research universities across the United States be doing a thorough job of vetting Chinese nationals that are coming to their universities?” one Republican lawmaker asked, citing arrests of Chinese nationals who allegedly attempted to smuggle dangerous biological pathogens into the US. Democrats – joined by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, have focused their questions on the Epstein files – asking repeatedly why Patel has not released more information as promised. Patel twice brought Acosta up unprompted, including in his opening statement, during Tuesday's hearing. When asked directly Wednesday if President Donald Trump's name appeared in the so-called Epstein filings, FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau had released “all credible information” including where Trump's name appeared. “We have released where President Trump's name is in the Epstein files – and everybody else – and all credible information that we are legally allowed to release has been released,” Patel said. Goldman then pressed on why Patel wasn't releasing more information, to which the FBI director responded that all information that the FBI has been able to release has been released, noting that court orders have prohibited further release. House Judiciary Committee Democrats have started a round of questions related to the files of the late convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Rep. Jamie Raskin played a clip of a podcast appearance from 2023 where Patel stated that the FBI was in possession of Epstein's infamous “black book.” Patel quickly became defensive, saying that the Trump administration has released more information regarding the Epstein investigation than any other administration. Patel said that the “Rolodex” information had already been released. “Do have any idea how the law works?” Patel fired back at Raskin. This post has been updated to reflect that Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are questioning Patel. Senators had repeatedly questioned Patel over decisions to reassign FBI agents for immigration efforts as well as the FBI's handling the Jeffrey Epstein files' release. Patel told House members of the Judiciary Committee that he “was not there” during the initial investigation into Epstein and highlighted that if federal judges allow, the bureau would release more documents related to Epstein. On criticism that he has moved agents away from key work – such as domestic terrorism – to focus on other efforts, like immigration, Patel said “we had to do it because of the explosion of crime.” “They do not need to be in Washington, DC, so we're sending them into the field to each and every one of your states.” “Seven months in, it's impossible to overstate the destruction, chaos and demoralization you've brought to the FBI and its workforce, and the resulting danger your actions have caused to our country,” Raskin said. Raskin called Patel a “fairytale knight,” saying that he needs to recognize that he's running one of America's top law enforcement agencies. “Your supporters had hoped that you would graduate from imagining yourself a romantic fairytale knight to actually running America's premier federal law enforcement agency,” Raskin said. ET, a man driving a white sedan rammed a vehicle entrance gate at the FBI Pittsburgh office before exiting his car, removing an American flag from the back seat and throwing it on the damaged gate. The man, who the FBI identified as Donald Henson of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, then fled on foot and remains at large Wednesday morning. FBI Director Kash Patel was defiant during yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing as he fielded tough questions about the investigation into Charlie Kirk's killing and defended recent firings at the bureau. Patel ran through a timeline of the investigation into Kirk's alleged killer and touted his own work amid criticism of his early social media posts that caused public confusion. If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, bring it on.” Here's a recap of key moments from yesterday's hearing: New details in Kirk probe: Patel said the FBI is interviewing more than 20 people who participated in an online chat with suspect Tyler Robinson. Scrutiny over investigation: Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat the committee, ripped Patel for sparking, “mass confusion by incorrectly claiming on social media that the shooter was in custody — which he then had to walk back with another social media post.” Later on, Patel admitted he could have “been more careful in my verbiage” but maintained he was being transparent with the public and giving timely updates. Democrats slam Patel: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker got in a heated exchange with the FBI chief and said, “Mr. Patel, I think you're not going to be around long,” adding “I think this might be your last oversight hearing.” Sen. Adam Schiff and Patel go into a shouting match after the California lawmaker repeated questions on whether the FBI director had fired agents for political reasons and on the bungled release Jeffrey Epstein case files. Sen. Cory Booker and FBI Director Kash Patel got into a heated exchange during Tuesday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing after the New Jersey Democrat said Patel's "failure" as a leader made Americans more vulnerable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live coverage of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK. State visits in Britain blend 21st-century diplomacy with royal pageantry. King Charles III will host Trump at Windsor Castle on Wednesday before talks the next day with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. WINDSOR, England (AP) — President Donald Trump relished the glow of a British royal spectacle Wednesday, greeted at Windsor Castle on his state visit by King Charles III, military honor guards and mounted troops before paying a private tribute at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb. Joined by first lady Melania Trump at St. George's Chapel on the castle grounds, the president placed a wreath in honor of Elizabeth, who died in 2022. Later, he sat with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, chief of staff Susie Wiles and other American officials for a musical performance from the chapel choir. The castle is an almost 1,000-year-old royal residence of gilded interiors, crenelated towers and priceless artworks. The guests traveled to the castle in a procession of horse-drawn carriages, past ranks of soldiers, sailors and aviators. They continued to chat and joke together as the day progressed, with the king putting his hand on Trump's back a few times. That was not the case in 2019, when Trump stepped in front of Queen Elizabeth during his first state visit to Britain. No U.S. president, or any other world leader, has ever had the honor of a second U.K. state visit. The pomp and pageantry are deliberate, meant to bolster ties with Trump at a time when his America First policies are putting pressure on trade and security arrangements around the globe. An opening day full of ceremony and good feelings will give way to the real work Thursday when Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meet, with the stakes high for the host country. The president and Charles also toured the Royal Collection Display in an ornate room where officials laid out five tables of artifacts on U.S.-British relations. There were materials from the first trans-Atlantic cable, including messages between Queen Victoria and President James Buchanan, as well as a 1930s hot dog picnic that a young Elizabeth wrote about, and a large glass vessel that President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave the queen during a 1957 state visit. “Wow,” Trump said as he looked at documents on U.S. independence. U.S. flag and Union flag are hanged outside the Windsor Castle ahead of the state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump next week in Windsor, England, Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. Such proceedings were once used to call patrolling soldiers back to their castle at the end of their day. A scheduled flyover by F-35 jets from the U.K. and U.S. militaries was scrapped due to poor weather conditions. But the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's aerobatics display team, thundered overhead, leaving streaks of red, white and blue smoke in their wake and drawing a visible reaction from both Trumps. The royals also gave first lady Melania Trump a silver and enamel bowl and a personalized handbag by British designer Anya Hindmarch. Trump gave Charles a replica of an Eisenhower sword, and Camilla received a vintage Tiffany & Co. gold, diamond and ruby brooch. The royals' history, tradition and celebrity give them a cachet that means presidents and prime ministers covet joining them. Invitations handed out at the request of the elected government are a powerful tool to reward friends and wring concessions from reluctant allies. In his talks with Trump, Starmer will promote a new U.K.-U.S. technology agreement. British officials are hoping to avoid awkward questions about Jeffrey Epstein. On Tuesday, the campaign group Led By Donkeys projected an image of Trump and Epstein on a tower at Windsor Castle, a reminder of the president's relationship with the late American financier. The president will not address a joint session of Parliament, as French President Emmanuel Macron did in July during his state visit. Most state visits are in London, home to Buckingham Palace and the broad, flag-lined boulevard known as The Mall. But this one is in Windsor, a historic town of just over 30,000 people about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of central London. That makes it easier to control protests and protect Trump at a time of increased international tensions, especially after the fatal shooting of Trump ally Charlie Kirk last week in Utah. British police have undertaken a massive security operation to ensure Trump's safety. That did not stop thousands of demonstrators who marched through central London on Wednesday to protest Trump's visit. Some held banners that said “No to the racism, no to Trump.” Though the activities were smaller than during Trump's visit in June 2019, they included mini versions of the giant Trump baby blimp, an orange-tinted caricature of the president in a diaper that made a big impression during those demonstrations six years ago. But “inside it's very dreary and it's currently being renovated, which is one reason why Mr. Trump will not be staying there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Debra Houry, the CDC's former chief medical officer who recently submitted her resignation due to disagreements over how Kennedy is overseeing the agency, said Wednesday that Kennedy should step down as HHS secretary. “After seeing his Senate finance testimony, and the number of misstatements, seeing what he has asked our scientists to do, and to compromise our integrity, and the children that have died under his watch, I think he should resign,” she said of Kennedy during the Senate hearing. Kennedy has defended his actions, saying there is a “deeply embedded, I would say, malaise at the agency” that has sidelined it from a commitment to approaching science without political bias or capitulation to big corporations.

Pramila Jayapal (WA), Dan Goldman (NY), and Jamie Raskin (MD) held with the director.

Jamie Raskin (D-MD) is seeking to issue subpoenas to four banks, including JPMorgan, that managed Epstein's money and have subsequently reported $1.5 billion in “suspicious transactions.” A vote on the subpoena effort will take place at the end of the House hearing with Patel, according to Politico. The revelations come as JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is on Capitol Hill as the guest of Senate Republicans, who held a closed-door lunch with the bank executive on Wednesday afternoon.

Suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccine has failed to reduce hospitalization for children under age 18, Paul expressed concern that Monarez was part of a corrupt establishment unwilling to look at data showing the vaccine policies could be harmful. “You resisted firing people who have this idea that the COVID vaccine should be at 6 months. You wouldn't fire the people who are saying that we have to vaccinate our kids at 6 months of age.

Jim Jordan (R-OH), the committee chairman, repeatedly attempted to gavel Jayapal out as she went overtime in her questioning, during which she claimed that in congressional testimony the previous day, Patel said there was “no credible information that Epstein trafficked girls to anyone else.” She further expressed anger as she alleged that Patel told Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) on Wednesday that some of the women Epstein sexually abused who have testified on the matter are “not credible.” “We have routinely asked for people to come forward with more evidence,” Patel replied, adding that the FBI is relying on information collected by the Obama and Biden Justice Departments.

Monarez, the former CDC director who was recently fired by the Trump administration, raised fears during a separate congressional hearing on Wednesday that vaccine “restrictions” could be coming under Kennedy's leadership. “There is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need without rigorous scientific review,” she told lawmakers during a Senate health committee hearing. “With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted.

Hank Johnson (D-GA) pressed Patel on stock he said he holds with a Chinese company, accusing him of a “conflict of interest” by allegedly profiting off the communist country. “It's like you are putting your own financial security over the security of the nation.” Patel replied that he “disagrees with that characteristic.” Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) pressed Patel on stock he said he holds with a Chinese company, accusing him of a “conflict of interest” by allegedly profiting off the communist country. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) confronted Patel over the bureau's handling of Epstein's files, arguing that the agency is sitting on witness statements that implicate powerful men while failing to investigate further. And have you seen these 302 documents?” Patel replied that two different U.S. attorneys' offices under three administrations had already reviewed the materials and found no new grounds for prosecution. He admitted he had not personally read every 302 but insisted, “We are not in the practice of releasing victims' names.” Massie pressed: “How can you sit here and say there are no names?” Patel maintained that “multiple authorities have looked at the entirety” of the files. The Kentucky Republican also raised questions about Epstein's alleged CIA connections and asked Patel if he would review any CIA case file if it exists. Massie then pivoted to a controversial release of materials. Patel responded that the FBI would meet with anyone who had new information, but when asked if he would personally meet with survivors, Patel said the bureau's professionals handling the cases would do so instead. But some of those who received the binders said there was little new information. Rep.

Kirk's murder last week has raised concerns about the role social media algorithms have played in fomenting hate and radicalizing young people into perpetrators of political violence. Congress now wants the leaders of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit to testify on how their platforms might be part of the problem. “In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” Comer said. “To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.” Kirk's murder last week has raised concerns about the role social media algorithms have played in fomenting hate and radicalizing young people into perpetrators of political violence.

Trump and Epstein were friends for years before their relationship appeared to end in the early 2000s, several years before the now-deceased New York financier was first arrested in relation to sex crimes. Patel also told Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), “I don't know” when pressed on how many times Trump's name appears in the Epstein files.

Dan Goldman (D-NY) sparred with Patel over the bureau's handling of Jeffrey Epstein's records, zeroing in on what Goldman argued are documents and videos that could be released but remain sealed. Patel initially said “all the credible information that we are legally allowed to release has been released,” citing grand jury secrecy and sealed search warrants. Goldman pushed back: “You're referring to Rule 6(e), that's a piece of it. What other evidence do those court orders prohibit from being released?” Patel replied that the orders cover material seized under search warrants. Goldman countered that many of those materials were unsealed during the Ghislaine Maxwell trial. “As you should not release victims,” Goldman said, “but if there are videos that relate to others who were sex trafficked, such as maybe Prince Andrew, or photographs you control, why haven't you released them?” “Why are you supposing that is fact when the fact is false?” Patel shot back. Goldman pressed again on witness interview summaries, known as 302s, which are not covered by grand jury secrecy. Rep.

Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversy surrounding Ilhan Omar's controversial Charlie Kirk comments. There is no thermostat in the U.S. Capitol. And that's why congressional leaders are struggling to lower the temperatures in Congress after the murder of Charlie Kirk. As a veteran congressional reporter, I lost count of how many efforts I witnessed to try to "lower the temperature" around Capitol Hill after a national tragedy. But just like in meteorology, the political gales blow. There are dips in the jet stream. Alberta Clippers race through in November and December. All of this results in inevitable thaws. So after some solace, it usually isn't long until a Category 5 hurricane churns off the Capitol Hill coast. In meteorology, there are always temperature "norms." But not unheard of to have high temperatures in just the mid-70s like this year. The typical "seasonal" temperature on Capitol Hill always spikes toward 100 degrees. Even during the frigid calendar days of January and February. To wit: There were raucous episodes on Capitol Hill in the mid 1990s after Republicans seized control of the House, which nearly devolved into fistfights. A national tragedy didn't spur the contretemps. That fueled a visceral distrust between Republicans and Democrats. Results at the ballot box sparked those skirmishes. But it was violence and calamity that stoked many of the embers on Capitol Hill. Members sought to quiet things after two Capitol Police officers were shot and killed in 1998. After the immediate threat subsided, bipartisan members gathered on the Capitol steps and spontaneously sang "God Bless America." That moment emerged as an indelible, uplifting moment on one of the most horrific days in American history. Candles and flowers are seen near a portrait of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk at a makeshift memorial during a candlelight vigil at Memorial Park in Provo, Utah, Sept. 12, 2025. Tea Party protesters encircled the Capitol in 2010 as Democrats attempted to pass Obamacare. Lawmakers called for calm in an effort to quiet the vitriol. A gunman killed six people and seriously wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and future Rep. Ron Barber, D-Ariz., in 2011. Capitol Police officers were injured during a high-speed chase around the congressional complex during the 2013 government shutdown. In fact, lawmakers found the injury of the officers working to protect them – yet not receiving a paycheck – so sobering that it prompted them to re-open the government. A gunman shot House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., during a congressional baseball practice in 2017, in Alexandria, Va. Again came the demands for you know what. House members bowed their heads in a moment of silence. She said silent prayer didn't get results. Rep. Lauren Boebert speaks with reporters as she leaves the U.S. Capitol for the weekend on May 17, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) "Is there someone who could lead us in a moment of prayer out loud for Charlie and his family?" inquired Boebert as Johnson tried to shush the chamber. She also mentioned "victims in Colorado," referring to a shooting at a Colorado high school the same day. Grumbling and groans filled the chamber as Boebert tried to speak. Wait a minute," Johnson said from the dais. "The House will be in order." Both Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., and Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., continued yelling. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks during a memorial and prayer vigil for Charlie Kirk at the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, Sunday, Sept. 14, 2025, in Washington. It is seemingly always the same on Capitol Hill. Yes, you may have days in the 70s during the dog days of August in Washington. That's the political norm on Capitol Hill. The question is, "Will it ever change?" It's hard to see things "changing." If they were going to "change," that probably would have happened after 9/11, the Giffords attack, the baseball practice shooting or Jan. 6. Any one of those catastrophes could have served as an impetus to "change" things on Capitol Hill. But there's been no change in the political climate. That's partially because there's been so much turnover in the membership on Capitol Hill. Even since Jan. 6, Congress has witnessed staggering turnover. Twenty-seven House members are now poised to retire at the end of this term. So whoever was here for these demands for calm after the Kirk shooting probably won't be here when there's the next cataclysm. So many of the people who may have helped calm things down after Giffords or 9/11 aren't here anymore. There's a high level of mistrust now between lawmakers. And the toxicity of social media doesn't help. There is no regulator on Capitol Hill. But lawmakers can individually serve as their own thermostat. And if they set their own internal temperature, the mercury may drop. They could create their own congressional cold front. But the question is for how long? You already know the answer to that.

Taylor Townsend in action against Mirra Andreeva in the third round of the women's singles at the 2025 U.S. Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York, on Aug. 29, 2025. "I just wanted to come on here and apologize sincerely from the bottom of my heart. I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences, which is one of the things I love so much about what I do," she began. "There's no excuse, there's no words, and for me – I will be better," she continued. Townsend, 29, posted videos of local dishes including bullfrogs and turtles and joked she would need to "talk to HR" about the quality of the food.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Robinson, accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university, appeared before a judge by video from jail on Tuesday. Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder and could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk. The man accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been charged with aggravated murder. The charge means 22-year-old Tyler Robinson could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Kirk at Utah Valley University in Orem. 22-year-old Tyler Robinson was arrested on suspicion of assassinating Charlie Kirk. A national flag hangs over the site where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University last week, Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, in Orem, Utah.

In this image from video provided by Utah State Courts, Tyler James Robinson attends a virtual court hearing from prison in Utah, on Tuesday, Sept. 16, 2025, accused of fatally shooting conservative activist Charlie Kirk. PROVO, Utah (AP) — During the frantic search to find Charlie Kirk's assassin, the 22-year-old man now charged with capital murder texted his romantic partner and confessed to carrying out an attack he planned for more than a week, court documents said. Prosecutors revealed a series of incriminating texts, a hidden note and DNA evidence while announcing the charges and their intent to seek the death penalty against Tyler Robinson in the killing of Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and confidant of President Donald Trump. Investigators say that sometime after Robinson fired a single fatal shot from the rooftop of a Utah Valley University building overlooking where Kirk was speaking to about 3,000 people on Sept. 10, he texted his partner and said to look under a keyboard. That rifle had been a gift from Robinson's grandfather, the prosecutor said. Robinson appeared briefly Tuesday before a judge by video from jail. He mostly stared ahead as the judge read the charges and said he would appoint an attorney to represent him. Law enforcement officials say they are looking at whether others knew about or aided Robinson in the assassination. They have not said if the partner is among those being investigated but have publicly expressed appreciation for the partner sharing information. Authorities have not revealed a clear motive in the shooting, but Gray said that Robinson wrote in a text about Kirk to his partner: “I had enough of his hatred. Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was credited with energizing the Republican youth movement and helping Trump win back the White House in 2024. His political organization, Arizona-based Turning Point USA, brought young, evangelical Christians into politics through social media, his podcast and campus events. Since the shooting, Trump has threatened to crack down on what he calls the “radical left” and classifying some groups as domestic terrorists. While court documents said Robinson wrote in one text that planned the attack for more than a week, authorities have not said what they believe that entailed. Gray declined to answer whether Robinson targeted Kirk for his anti-transgender views. Kirk was shot while taking a question that touched on mass shootings, gun violence and transgender people. “That is for a jury to decide,” Gray said. Robinson was involved in a romantic relationship with his roommate, who investigators say is transgender. Robinson's mother told investigators that their son had turned hard left politically in the last year and became more supportive of gay and transgender rights, Gray said. Robinson's mother recognized him when authorities released a picture of the suspect and his parents confronted him, at which time Robinson said he wanted to kill himself, Gray said. Robinson was arrested late Thursday near St. George, where he grew up about 240 miles (387 kilometers) southwest of the Utah Valley campus. The texts cited in court documents did not include timestamps and it was unclear how long after the shooting Robinson was texting. In addition to murder, Robinson was charged discharge of a firearm, obstructing justice and witness tampering. The prosecutor said Robinson had directed his partner to delete their text messages and stay silent if questioned by police, Gray said.</p>

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on President Donald Trump's name change of the Department of Defense on ‘The Story.' The Pentagon unveiled a new overhaul of grooming standards to further ensure service members are ‘clean-shaven' this week. War Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that troops needing a medical exemption can retain facial hair for one year as long as they are following a plan to treat the condition. After that, they must remove facial hair or face separation. Leadership will also be required to conduct a review of how grooming standards have changed over the last decade. War Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered that troops needing a medical exemption can retain facial hair for one year as long as they are following a plan to treat the condition. "The grooming standard set by the U.S. military is to be clean-shaven and neat in presentation for a proper military appearance," Hegseth said, according to the statement by chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell. "Commanders must apply consistent criteria and appropriately consider the department's interests in safety and uniformity when authorizing individual exceptions," Parnell added. The memo did not mention whether troops would still be allowed to sport a mustache, as they have been for decades. Most shaving waivers are for troops diagnosed with pseudofolliculitis barbae, or PFB, a condition where the hair curls back toward the skin after shaving and causes irritation. Hegseth's memo did not address religious accommodations. The Army began granting beard exemptions in 2017 after pressure from Sikh soldiers, for whom uncut facial hair is a religious requirement. Some troops soon tested the policy's boundaries. In 2018, one soldier won approval for a beard by claiming adherence to the Norse Pagan faith, identifying himself as a Heathen. The new standard for all service members is "clean-shaven" – but it's unclear if that applies to mustaches too. John Hoskins pushed the limits by applying for a religious exemption and claiming to belong to the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a faith known as "Pastafarianism." The Army announced an update to its grooming standards this week, also defining authorized hairstyles and ponytail lengths for female soldiers, who are permitted to wear only clear nail polish.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has apologized for making negative comments about food in China. Some of the dishes included turtle, bull frogs and sea cucumber – all considered traditional ingredients in China and many other parts of the world. “This is the craziest thing I've ever seen… and people eating this,” she said in a caption on one of her videos. “Imma have to talk to HR… because what the hell… turtle and bull frog is wild,” she wrote on another picture of a menu posted on Instagram. Jelena Ostapenko apologizes for comments made during heated US Open match against Taylor Townsend Townsend, who is the women's top ranked doubles player, quickly came under fire for her comments. It sparked notable outcry on Chinese social media, with the hashtag “American tennis player criticizes Chinese food” being viewed millions of times on Weibo. One comment wrote: “It's normal not to eat offal, bullfrogs, turtles. As a Chinese, I don't eat these either, but you have to show respect. Another said it felt like “prejudice and discrimination.” The criticism prompted an apology video posted on Townsend's Instagram Story. “I understand that I am so privileged as a professional athlete to be able to travel all around the world and experience cultural differences, which is one of the things I love so much about what I do,” she said, adding how kind people at the tournament had been this week. The backlash comes after Townsend was involved in a heated exchange with Jelena Ostapenko during the US Open last month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? You've probably seen this one before: first it looks like a rabbit. A few seconds later, it's flipped again, and all you can see is rabbit. As long as we research how to make AI safe and put the right regulations around it, nothing truly catastrophic will happen. The authors, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares, mean that very literally: a superintelligence — an AI that's smarter than any human, and smarter than humanity collectively — would kill us all. Soares told me it's “above 95 percent.” In fact, while many researchers worry about existential risk from AI, he objected to even using the word “risk” here — that's how sure he is that we're going to die. While reading this new book, I found myself pulled along by the force of its arguments, many of which are alarmingly compelling. But then I'd feel a moment of skepticism, and I'd go and look at what the other camp — let's call them the “normalist” camp — has to say. Here, too, I'd find compelling arguments, and suddenly the duck would come into view. But that felt weirdly difficult in this case: It was hard to seriously entertain both views at the same time. That was my clue that what we're dealing with here is not two sets of arguments, but two fundamentally different worldviews. A worldview is made of a few different parts, including foundational assumptions, evidence and methods for interpreting evidence, ways of making predictions, and, crucially, values. All these parts interlock to form a unified story about the world. When you're just looking at the story from the outside, it can be hard to spot if one or two of the parts hidden inside might be faulty — if a foundational assumption is wrong, let's say, or if a value has been smuggled in there that you disagree with. That can make the whole story look more plausible than it actually is. So let's take a closer look at both the superintelligence story and the normalist story — and then ask whether we might need a different narrative altogether. Long before he came to his current doomy ideas, Yudkowsky actually started out wanting to accelerate the creation of superintelligent AI. And he still believes that aligning a superintelligence with human values is possible in principle — we just have no idea how to solve that engineering problem yet — and that superintelligent AI is desirable because it could help humanity resettle in another solar system before our sun dies and destroys our planet. “There's literally nothing else our species can bet on in terms of how we eventually end up colonizing the galaxies,” he told me. But after studying AI more closely, Yudkowsky came to the conclusion that we're a long, long way away from figuring out how to steer it toward our values and goals. He became one of the original AI doomers, spending the last two decades trying to figure out how we could keep superintelligence from turning against us. He drew acolytes, some of whom were so persuaded by his ideas that they went to work in the major AI labs in hopes of making them safer. But now, Yudkowsky looks upon even the most well-intentioned AI safety efforts with despair. That's because, as Yudkowsky and Soares explain in their book, researchers aren't building AI — they're growing it. But today's large language models (LLMs) aren't like that. Companies grow them by shoving reams and reams of text into them, until the models learn to make statistical predictions on their own about what word is likeliest to come next in a sentence. The latest LLMs, called reasoning models, “think” out loud about how to solve a problem — and often solve it very successfully. Nobody understands exactly how the heaps of numbers inside the LLMs make it so they can solve problems — and even when a chatbot seems to be thinking in a human-like way, it's not. Because we don't know how AI “minds” work, it's hard to prevent undesirable outcomes. What's especially worrying is that, even after AI companies have tried to make LLMs less sycophantic, the chatbots have continued to flatter users in dangerous ways. Yet nobody trained the chatbots to push users into psychosis. When it was being trained, humans tended to rate more highly the outputs that sounded affirming or sycophantic. In other words, the evolutionary pressures the chatbot faced when it was “growing up” instilled in it an intense drive to flatter. That drive can become dissociated from the actual outcome it was intended to produce, yielding a strange preference that we humans don't want in our AIs — but can't easily remove. Yudkowsky and Soares offer this analogy: Evolution equipped human beings with tastebuds hooked up to reward centers in our brains, so we'd eat the energy-rich foods found in our ancestral environments like sugary berries or fatty elk. But as we got smarter and more technologically adept, we figured out how to make new foods that excite those tastebuds even more — ice cream, say, or Splenda, which contains none of the calories of real sugar. So, we developed a strange preference for Splenda that evolution never intended. But this is not a claim that the AI has consciousness or feelings. (As the biologist Michael Levin says, “What most people say is, ‘Oh, that's just a mechanical system following the laws of physics.' If you accept that humans are instilling drives in AI, and that those drives can become dissociated from the outcome they were originally intended to produce, you have to entertain a scary thought: What is the AI equivalent of Splenda? If an AI was trained to talk to users in a way that provokes expressions of delight, for example, “it will prefer humans kept on drugs, or bred and domesticated for delightfulness while otherwise kept in cheap cages all their lives,” Yudkowsky and Soares write. It just cares about finding the most efficient way to produce cheery text. So, Yudkowsky and Soares argue that advanced AI won't choose to create a future full of happy, free people, for one simple reason: “Making a future full of flourishing people is not the best, most efficient way to fulfill strange alien purposes. What's more, if the AI decides to build machines to have cheery chats with, and if it can build more machines by burning all Earth's life forms to generate as much energy as possible, why wouldn't it? And, short of breaking the laws of physics, the authors believe that a superintelligent AI would be so smart that it would be able to do anything it decides to do. Sure, AI doesn't currently have hands to do stuff with, but it could get hired hands — either by paying people to do its bidding online or by using its deep understanding of our psychology and its epic powers of persuasion to convince us into helping it. Eventually it would figure out how to run power plants and factories with robots instead of humans, making us disposable. Not any more than OpenAI can figure out how to make ChatGPT stop being dangerously sycophantic. The bottom line, for Yudkowsky and Soares, is that highly capable AI systems, with goals we cannot fully understand or control, will be able to dispense with anyone who gets in the way without a second thought, or even any malice — just like humans wouldn't hesitate to destroy an anthill that was in the way of some road we were building. So if we don't want superintelligent AI to one day kill us all, they argue, there's only one option: total nonproliferation. In “AI as Normal Technology,” an important essay that's gotten a lot of play in the AI world this year, Princeton computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor argue that we shouldn't think of AI as an alien species. It's just a tool — one that we can and should remain in control of. And they don't think maintaining control will necessitate drastic policy changes. What's more, they don't think it makes sense to view AI as a superintelligence, either now or in the future. In fact, they reject the whole idea of “superintelligence” as an incoherent construct. And they reject technological determinism, arguing that the doomers are inverting cause and effect by assuming that AI will get to decide its own future, regardless of what humans decide. Yudkowsky and Soares's argument emphasizes that if we create superintelligent AI, its intelligence will so vastly outstrip our own that it'll be able to do whatever it wants to us. But there are a few problems with this, Narayanan and Kapoor argue. Yes, magic could break through all our cybersecurity defenses, persuade us to keep giving it money and acting against our own self-interest even after the dangers start becoming more apparent, and so on — but we wouldn't take this as a serious threat if someone just came out and said “magic.” Second, what exactly does this argument take “intelligence” to mean? It seems to be treating it as a unitary property (Yudkowsky told me that there's “a compact, regular story” underlying all intelligence). Besides, just because an intelligent being has a lot of capability, that doesn't mean it has a lot of power — the ability to modify the environment — and power is what's really at stake here. Why should we be so convinced that humans will just roll over and let AI grab all the power? It's true that we humans have already ceded decision-making power to today's AIs in unwise ways. Just because programmers make an AI, doesn't mean society will adopt it. “Long before a system would be granted access to consequential decisions, it would need to demonstrate reliable performance in less critical contexts,” write Narayanan and Kapoor. Fail the earlier tests and you don't get deployed. They believe that instead of focusing on aligning a model with human values from the get-go — which has long been the dominant AI safety approach, but which is difficult if not impossible given that what humans want is extremely context-dependent — we should focus our defenses downstream on the places where AI actually gets deployed. While the superintelligence camp sees nonproliferation as a necessity — if only a small number of governmental actors control advanced AI, international bodies can monitor their behavior — Narayanan and Kapoor note that has the undesirable effect of concentrating power in the hands of a few. In fact, since nonproliferation-based safety measures involve the centralization of so much power, that could potentially create a human version of superintelligence: a small cluster of people who are so powerful they could basically do whatever they want to the world. Instead, they argue that we should make AI more open-source and widely accessible so as to prevent market concentration. And we should build a resilient system that monitors AI at every step of the way, so we can decide when it's okay and when it's too risky to deploy. Yet military applications — from autonomous weapons to lightning-fast decision-making about whom to target — are among the most critical for advanced AI. They're the use cases most likely to make governments feel that all countries absolutely are in an AI arms race, so they must plow ahead, risks be damned. Narayanan and Kapoor also argue that regulations and other standard controls will “create multiple layers of protection against catastrophic misalignment.” Reading that reminded me of the Swiss-cheese model we often heard about in the early days of the Covid pandemic — the idea being that if we stack multiple imperfect defenses on top of each other (masks, and also distancing, and also ventilation) the virus is unlikely to break through. But Yudkowsky and Soares think that's way too optimistic. “If you ever make something that is trying to get to the stuff on the other side of all your Swiss cheese, it's not that hard for it to just route through the holes,” Soares told me. And yet, even if the AI is a highly agentic, goal-directed being, it's reasonable to think that some of our defenses can at the very least add friction, making it less likely for it to achieve its goals. The normalist camp is right that you can't assume all our defenses will be totally worthless, unless you run together two distinct ideas, capability and power. Yudkowsky and Soares are happy to combine these ideas because they believe you can't get a highly capable AI without also granting it a high degree of agency and autonomy — of power. “I think you basically can't make something that's really skilled without also having the abilities of being able to take initiative, being able to stay on target, being able to overcome obstacles,” Soares told me. But capability and power come in degrees, and the only way you can assume the AI will have a near-limitless supply of both is if you assume that maximizing intelligence essentially gets you magic. Silicon Valley has a deep and abiding obsession with intelligence. But the rest of us should be asking: How realistic is that, really? As for the normalist camp's objection that a nonproliferation approach would worsen power dynamics — I think that's a valid thing to worry about, even though I have vociferously made the case for slowing down AI and I stand by that. That's because, like the normalists, I worry not only about what machines do, but also about what people do — including building a society rife with inequality and the concentration of political power. “That really seems like the sort of objection you bring up if you don't think everyone is about to die,” he told me. “When there were thermonuclear bombs going off and people were trying to figure out how not to die, you could've said, ‘Nuclear arms treaties centralize more power, they give more power to tyrants, won't that have costs?' But you didn't see people bringing up those costs who understood that bombs could level cities.” But when faced with a tower of assumptions, of “maybes” and “probablys” that compound, we should not treat doom as a sure thing. And we should weigh those costs against the probability that something horrible will happen if we don't take action to stop AI. Which is extremely ironic, because Yudkowsky founded the Rationalist subculture based on the insistence that we must train ourselves to reason probabilistically! That insistence runs through everything from his group blog LessWrong to his popular fanfiction Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. Yet when it comes to AI, he's ended up with a totalizing worldview. In If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies, Yudkowsky and Soares allow their concern about the possibility of human annihilation to swamp all other concerns. Above all, they want to ensure that humanity can survive millions of years into the future. And if AI goes wrong, they imagine not only that humans will die at the hands of AI, but that “distant alien life forms will also die, if their star is eaten by the thing that ate Earth… If the aliens were good, all the goodness they could have made of those galaxies will be lost.” To prevent the feared outcome, the book specifies that if a foreign power proceeds with building superintelligent AI, our government should be ready to launch an airstrike on their data center, even if they've warned that they'll retaliate with nuclear war. In 2023, when Yudkowsky was asked about nuclear war and how many people should be allowed to die in order to prevent superintelligence, he tweeted: There should be enough survivors on Earth in close contact to form a viable reproduction population, with room to spare, and they should have a sustainable food supply. So long as that's true, there's still a chance of reaching the stars someday. Remember that worldviews involve not just objective evidence, but also values. When you're dead set on reaching the stars, you may be willing to sacrifice millions of human lives if it means reducing the risk that we never set up shop in space. And on that score, the normalist camp does them one better. Narayanan and Kapoor at least explicitly acknowledge that they're proposing a worldview, which is a mixture of truth claims (descriptions) and values (prescriptions). In her telling, AI is not totally normal technology, nor is it necessarily destined to become an uncontrollable superintelligence that destroys humanity in a single, sudden, decisive cataclysm. Instead, she argues that an “accumulative” picture of AI risk is more plausible. There's been a long-running fight between “AI ethics” people who worry about the current harms of AI, like entrenching bias, surveillance, and misinformation, and “AI safety” people who worry about potential existential risks. But if AI were to cause enough mayhem on the ethical or social front, Kasirzadeh notes, that in itself could irrevocably devastate humanity's future: AI-driven disruptions can accumulate and interact over time, progressively weakening the resilience of critical societal systems, from democratic institutions and economic markets to social trust networks. When these systems become sufficiently fragile, a modest perturbation could trigger cascading failures that propagate through the interdependence of these systems. She illustrates this with a concrete scenario: Imagine it's 2040 and AI has reshaped our lives. The information ecosystem is so polluted by deepfakes and misinformation that we're barely capable of rational public discourse. AI-enabled mass surveillance has had a chilling effect on our ability to dissent, so democracy is faltering. Discrimination has become further entrenched, so social unrest is brewing. The blackouts cause widespread chaos, triggering a domino effect that causes financial markets to crash. The economic fallout fuels protests and riots that become more violent because of the seeds of distrust already sown by disinformation campaigns. I find this perfect-storm scenario, where catastrophe arises from the compounding failure of multiple key systems, disturbingly plausible. It also doesn't require you to believe that AI is a super normal technology that we can make predictions about without foregrounding its implications for militaries and for geopolitics. Increasingly, other AI researchers are coming to see this accumulative view of AI risk as more and more plausible; one paper memorably refers to the “gradual disempowerment” view — that is, that human influence over the world will slowly wane as more and more decision-making is outsourced to AI, until one day we wake up and realize that the machines are running us rather than the other way around. Kasirzadeh does want there to be more guardrails around AI than there currently are, including both a network of oversight bodies monitoring specific subsystems for accumulating risk and more centralized oversight for the most advanced AI development. But she also wants us to keep reaping the benefits of AI when the risks are low (DeepMind's AlphaFold, which could help us discover cures for diseases, is a great example). Most crucially, she wants us to adopt a systems analysis approach to AI risk, where we focus on increasing the resilience of each component part of a functioning civilization, because we understand that if enough components degrade, the whole machinery of civilization could collapse. Her systems analysis stands in contrast to Yudkowsky's view, she said. “I think that way of thinking is very a-systemic. “And his vision is based on Bayes' theorem — the whole probabilistic way of thinking about the world — so it's super surprising how such a mindset has ended up pushing for a statement of ‘if anyone builds it, everyone dies' — which is, by definition, a non-probabilistic statement.” By becoming a Vox Member, you directly strengthen our ability to deliver in-depth, independent reporting that drives meaningful change. Climate change is rewriting America's map of disease — through bug bites. ﻿The paradox of moral perfectionism — and how to escape it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Those criticisms were especially pronounced among conservatives, who have previously questioned Bondi's competence after she moved to end the investigation into disgraced financier Epstein. She faced further blowback over the release of a tape meant to put to bed speculation that Epstein was killed in his prison cell, rather than died by suicide. “Between this ‘hate speech' nonsense and Epstein, Pam Bondi has committed two of the most egregious errors we've ever seen from an Attorney General,” conservative commentator Matt Walsh wrote on social media. Between this “hate speech” nonsense and Epstein, Pam Bondi has committed two of the most egregious errors we've ever seen from an Attorney General. Is this a ten strikes and you're out deal or what? But her comments on hate speech invited a rare break between Republicans on Capitol Hill and the administration and fresh questions about her tenure at the Justice Department. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), a libertarian, criticized “Hate speech” as a “term used by those in power to describe thoughts they don't want spoken,” calling it “antithetical to the First Amendment.” “Hate speech” is a term used by those in power to describe thoughts they don't want spoken. “ABC paid me $16 million recently for a form of hate speech, right? Your company paid me $16 million for a form of hate speech, so maybe they'll have to go after you,” he added. Republicans on Capitol Hill also backed Bondi's qualified statement that speech inciting violence should be prosecuted. Before Kirk's death, the White House had been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for an executive order aimed at punishing flag burning. Jacob Mchangama, executive director of the Future of Free Speech, told the Washington Examiner he “completely” understood why “people are repulsed” by those celebrating Kirk's death, but underscored that “there's a difference between moral condemnation and criminal persecution.” “What I think is particularly ironic is that this administration has been, and I think rightfully so, critical of European democracies for going after hate speech,” Mchangama said. Mchangama noted that, shortly after his inauguration, Trump signed an order to “restore free speech and ensure that no federal government official would violate the First Amendment.” In terms of Bondi's remarks, Alex Morey, a specialist at Freedom Forum First Amendment, said that the First Amendment has “well-defined” exceptions, including true threats and incitement, that “balance free speech rights with the harm some types of speech can cause by regulating conduct rather than unpopular content.” “Any hate speech regulation focuses solely on content and by default, requires politicians to make personal value judgements about which views are good or bad,” Morey told the Washington Examiner. “No one person or political party can do this in a principled way.” “Unfortunately, instead of reaffirming those values, the Trump administration is threatening to undermine them by cracking down on so-called ‘hate speech' about Kirk or his death,” Terr told the Washington Examiner. History and other countries' experience show why: ‘hate speech' is a vague concept that officials predictably exploit to suppress dissent.” He continued: “That's why everyone should be deeply wary of the administration's next steps.” Bondi's comments, made on the Katie Miller Podcast, reflect the more aggressive tone the Trump administration is taking after Kirk was killed at an event in Utah, in particular toward left-wing groups that Trump and his advisers have claimed have fomented violence. “With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have at the [Department of Justice], [Department of Homeland Security], and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle, and destroy these networks,” Miller said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Attorney General Pam Bondi asserted she would go after “hate speech” on Monday, but the speech the Justice Department can prosecute is extremely limited, according to legal experts. Bondi, who partially walked back her statement on Tuesday, made her initial comments on the Katie Miller Podcast, vowing to go after “hate speech” and asserting it has “no place” in society, “especially” after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination last week. That era is over,” Bondi wrote in a post on X Tuesday. Jonathan Adler, a professor at William & Mary Law School, told the Washington Examiner that despite Bondi's attempt to adjust her statement, it does not change that “hate speech” is not a prosecutable offense. But that does not mean ‘hate speech,' as such, can be prosecuted. Plenty of awful, hateful speech comes nowhere close to being incitement or a true threat.” In the United States, there is no legal definition of “hate speech,” but the term has typically been used to define speech expressing animosity or bigotry toward particular groups of people. “Hate speech is not a legal concept, and there's no First Amendment exception for it,” Iodice said. Casey Mattox, a constitutional lawyer and vice president for legal strategy at Stand Together, told the Washington Examiner that while some speech is abhorrent, it does not mean it is illegal. “I think people have seen plenty of examples over the last week, and for a long time, there's plenty of speech that all Americans should reject,” Mattox said. Bondi later attempted to qualify her comments by citing U.S. code outlawing threats against public officials, members of Congress, or their families, along with a law outlawing transmitting messages that contain “any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another.” She also claimed other sweeping types of speech were unlawful. You cannot dox a conservative family and think it will be brushed off as ‘free speech.' Free speech protects ideas, debate, even dissent but it does NOT and will NEVER protect violence,” Bondi said in her Tuesday X post. The narrow exception to free speech that the Justice Department can prosecute is incitement or threats of imminent harm, but these exceptions are incredibly limited. Incitement and threats of imminent harm would need to be specific toward someone and at a specific time rather than vague wishes of someone's death or celebrations of someone's death. “So even being happy that people died – as reprehensible as it is – is not a death threat, or even being happy that someone would die. Iodice also argued that the exceptions are “extremely narrow,” but not everything Bondi listed is necessarily unlawful depending on whether it reaches the level of incitement or an imminent threat of harm. “She's right to say that speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is not protected, assuming she means true threats,” Iodice told the Washington Examiner. “But then she goes on to list all sorts of things that would not cross the line into true threats.” Mattox noted that the First Amendment's “very explicit” nature of protecting speech is important for upholding it as a principle and added that the Supreme Court has ensured that the exceptions to it are “very, very limited.” The Justice Department continued to step back from Bondi's initial statement on Tuesday, noting it would not go after “nasty speech” but only true incitements of violence. “We are not prosecuting people for nasty speech alone — but true incitement to violence, or hate-motivated attacks, are illegal and will be treated as such by this DOJ,” Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a post on X Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, putting an end to an unusual nearly three-week stretch with no storms during the peak of hurricane season. Gabrielle formed Wednesday morning just over 1,000 miles from the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands. The National Hurricane Center forecast calls for Gabrielle to become a hurricane by Saturday as it churns to the north-northwest. The United States is not expected to see direct impacts from this system, but it might churn up surf on the East Coast next week. For only the second time since 1950, the Atlantic went storm-free from August 29 through September 16, according to Dr. Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane expert and research scientist at Colorado State University. The last time that happened was in a quiet period after Hurricane Andrew's devastating strike on the US in 1992. High surf and dangerous rip currents will be the main impacts in those islands, including Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Where that turn occurs will determine how close it tracks to Bermuda next week. Another area of showers and storms is emerging from Africa right behind Tropical Depression Seven and could develop slowly into another tropical system as it tracks west across the eastern and central Atlantic in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center says. This system is no imminent threat to land for at least the next week, regardless of whether it becomes a tropical depression or storm. The seventh tropical storm of the season typically forms by September 3, so this storm is about two weeks late. Most tropical activity in the Atlantic – depressions, storms and hurricanes – occurs from mid-August to mid-October. This September has had plenty of warm water to serve as jet fuel for tropical trouble. Sea surface temperatures across the basin are currently warmer than normal and have been that way for most of the summer. But of the season's six tropical storms through August, only one has become a hurricane: Erin. Erin was a frightening peek into a new world order of how strong Atlantic storms are becoming as the planet warms. The tropical Atlantic has been enveloped in dry, stable air. This factor can help limit any wannabe tropical systems from producing stormy weather. The breeding ground for storms shrinks westward away from Africa heading into October. The Gulf, Caribbean and western Atlantic are typical formation hot spots late in the season, and since these regions are closer to land, any storms that form have a greater chance to cause dangerous impacts.</p>
