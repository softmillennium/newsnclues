Casino operator Star Entertainment has been under financial pressure for some time. Just as it was set to run out of cash on Friday March 7, Star announced a last-minute rescue package. This centred on selling its 50% stake in the Queens Wharf casino to Hong-Kong-based joint venture partners for $53 million. All of this remains subject to details being finalised, and regulatory approvals. But Star is far from out of the woods yet. Whatever happens to it and its casino assets, there are bigger questions about whether the age of unfettered gambling revenue for casinos may have already ended. Both Star and Australia’s other major casino operator, Crown, have emerged from a range of high-profile scandals in recent years. Media reporting, inquiries, and royal commissions into Crown, and then Star, give some insight into how the casino business used to be run in Australia. Star’s (and Crown’s) business model appears to have previously relied on two major revenue streams: benefiting from the proceeds of crime (by operating as a cash laundry for organised criminal gangs), and exploiting every vulnerable person who walked onto their premises. Both casinos facilitated money laundering, particularly via junket operators, organisers of casino visits by high rollers. Former Star executives and board members are now facing Federal Court proceedings brought by ASIC, with two already having been fined. Read more: 'Multiple red flags': ASIC's court case against Star executives shows the risks of complacency Both Star and Crown were also found to have encouraged significant expenditure by addicted gamblers. Ordinary people were also encouraged to use poker machines for hours without any attempt at encouraging a break, as mandated by “responsible gambling” codes. The Victorian Royal Commissioner, investigating Crown, regarded its “responsible gambling” failures as particularly heinous. In NSW and Victoria, the casinos have been required to introduce “cashless gaming” systems. This takes cash out of the system, deterring money launderers. Gamblers must also set a limit on their gambling spend, and adhere to it. Certainly, overcapitalisation of new developments has played a part in casinos’ struggles. Crown Melbourne was effectively sold to Kerry Packer in 1998 on the back of its own financial issues. Overcapitalisation of the business was seen as an issue then. Competition from online wagering and pokie venues may also be playing a part. Precommitment systems for online wagering would be relatively easy to introduce. After all, these measures would reduce the amount that people lose. From a public health perspective, however, they provide an effective system to prevent harm in the first place, rather than simply picking up the pieces.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This means, if the polls are correct, neither party will likely win enough seats to command a parliamentary working majority. Many still see that as an unhappy era, with internal division within Labor’s party room in Canberra, and yet another leadership coup, as the lasting, bitter memory. So, it is time to reassess whether – or how well – Australia might be governed in similar circumstances. Second, the popular vote share that goes to the two major parties has been in long-term decline, from about 90% 40 years ago, to about 70% of late. But this overlooks the fact that some voters’ sympathies lie in single-issue campaigns. Third, and most importantly, our model of minority government is conspicuously one-dimensional. These are important, of course, but they provide artificial stability by limiting disagreement in parliament that might bring down a government. One eye-catching proposition for stable minority government involves Labor and the Coalition coming together to agree not to topple the other for an arbitrary period of half a parliamentary term. The UK’s Conservatives and Liberal Democrats ran a joint government from 2010–15, with some distinction. This resulted in the full implementation of their respectively most prized policies. It also requires a readiness to prioritise policy issues within parties. Meanwhile, there is evidence of pressure to keep both the Teals and Greens at a distance from any such agreement, with reports that lobby groups for the hospitality and coal sectors respectively will fund major party candidates to help defeat hostile crossbenchers. From Labor’s perspective, the nucleus is around a disparate set of economic and social modernisation policies. This is accompanied by wariness of immigration and identity politics. Survey research points to its broad appeal certainly but less is known about the depth of this support. Finding a middle path on these issues that would satisfy enough crossbenchers to help one of the major parties form government will be the challenge. It is not necessarily a bad outcome for the nation. But it means all MPs will have to take into account the greatly enhanced premium on stable government before any serious horse-trading happens.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But are our strategies working?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 19:26:05 <p>
Half a century later, we’re in the middle of an ongoing “national crisis” – and our federal government has committed itself to ending family and domestic violence “in one generation”. This year, eight women have already been killed by violence according to Destroy the Joint, which has kept a Counting Dead Women tally since 2012. And while there has been major social and economic progress for women over the last 50 years, a recent report reveals a stark “employment gap” between women who have experienced domestic violence and those who have not. Review: Quarterly Essay 97: Losing It: Can We Stop Violence Against Women and Children? From today’s standpoint, the aim of eradicating domestic violence may look rather utopian, even naïve. As a historian who is currently collaborating on a history of domestic violence in Australia, the 1970s and 1980s stand out as decades of possibility and fast change. The problem had finally come out from “behind closed doors”. Now, ending domestic violence is once again a stated goal – of the government, no less. Journalist and anti-violence campaigner Jess Hill investigates this question in her important new Quarterly Essay. “No other country in the world has eradicated gendered violence,” writes Hill. “Australia is the only one that’s even promised to do that.” With this ambitious goal in mind, her essay is offered as a contribution and an intervention. Since her award-winning, agenda-setting book See What You Made Do: Power, Control and Domestic Abuse (2019), she has been heavily involved in efforts to stop the gendered violence she has long reported on. She is deeply committed to the many victim–survivors who have shared their experiences with her. She has been a champion for its criminalisation, including by making a submission to the New South Wales Joint Select Committee on coercive control in 2021. From July 1 2024, NSW became the first state to make coercive control a criminal offence. Support for the measure is by no means uniform – and has been heavily criticised by First Nations women in particular, because it would likely result in further incarceration of Indigenous women rather than offer protection. In addition to her groundbreaking 2019 book, she has written a 2021 Quarterly Essay on #MeToo and hosted a three-part SBS series on consent and sexual violence in Australia, Asking For It (2023). But in 2019, Commonwealth, state and territory leaders “flew the white flag” and conceded there would be no substantial reduction in violence against women by 2022. Hill questions whether promoting “gender equality” as the overarching, or primary, solution to eradicating gendered violence is the most effective use of government funds or sector expertise. If the government genuinely wishes to eradicate gendered violence within a generation, she suggests, the current prevention strategy is no longer fit for purpose – if it ever was. Hill highlights grim statistics and trends, well aware they have lost some of their capacity to shock. Police are called out to a family violence incident every minute, almost double the reported cases in 2016. Both victims and perpetrators of sexual abuse are getting younger, as revealed by the Australian Child Maltreatment Study. In evaluating this failure, Hill notes contributing factors such as a revolving door of ministers during the last Coalition government, which was handed the National Plan “like a hot potato”. Her main target, though, is Our Watch, the national agency responsible for gender-based violence campaigns, and their Change the Story primary prevention strategy. These evidence-based frameworks, Hill continues, stress “multiple intersecting risk factors” for gendered violence, “such as childhood mistreatment, substance abuse, a weak criminal system and a culture of parental dominance over children (to name a few) alongside gendered risk factors, like harmful attitudes and gender inequality”. On this point, Hill usefully pans out to survey the wider terrain, as Judith Butler did in her recent book Who’s Afraid of Gender? She sketches out a global gender “backlash” network, with world leaders like Trump and Putin up top, anti-rights groups in the middle, and influencers like Andrew Tate “on the factory floor”. While many agreed gender equality is important, “there was a lot of confusion” over what the term means. In questioning the Our Watch framework, Hill builds on a position paper she co-authored in 2024 with UNSW professor Michael Salter: Rethinking Primary Prevention. (It was criticised – rightly, Hill agrees – for not appointing an Aboriginal woman.) As she shows in Losing It, she and Salter are hardly alone in advocating for more targeted approaches to prevention and more accountability for existing prevention work. Victoria is the only state to make Respectful Relationships Education mandatory, Hill writes. Yet, as they all agree, much more work remains to be done on multiple fronts. As the Australian Child Maltreatment Study revealed, for example, while sexual abuse of children by adults has dramatically declined, young Australians are still experiencing high rates of sexual abuse. Rates of Indigenous child removal are so high, “it’s been labelled a second Stolen Generation”, Hill writes. Hill points to the work of organisations such as Djirra, a wraparound support service for Aboriginal women headed by Antoinette Braybrook, and Yiliyapinya, a not-for-profit that works with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and their carers “to improve their brain health and to help them heal” as vanguard initiatives. As she acknowledges, “moving the dial on intractable social problems is outrageously difficult”. It doesn’t help that governments presently appear highly captive to alcohol and gambling lobbies. This makes it extra hard to respond to research that establishes links between substance abuse and all forms of gendered violence – or significant rises in family violence in areas with a high concentration of poker machines. Throughout Losing It, Hill reminds readers that violence against women and children is not a problem to be treated in isolation, with a one-size-fits-all approach: it demands an all-systems response. With over 50 years of awareness and at least 40 years of government responses behind us, Hill is right to demand more, now our leaders have committed themselves to their boldest target yet. More solutions are available to us than ever before – but at the same time, as Hill shows, violence against women and children is also taking new forms and exhibiting new patterns. But most of all, it’s a galvanising one, inviting Australia to solve the “wicked problem” of violence against women and children within one generation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

New evidence says its much more about your choices than your genes</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 19:25:03 <p>
One of the most enduring questions humans have is how long we’re going to live. A study recently published in the prestigious journal Nature Medicine has attempted for the first time to quantify the relative contributions of our environment and lifestyle versus our genetics in how we age and how long we live. This study used data from the UK Biobank, a large database in the United Kingdom that contains in-depth health and lifestyle data from roughly 500,000 people. By using this method researchers were able to estimate how quickly an individual’s body was actually ageing. Environmental exposures included lifestyle choices (for example, smoking, physical activity), social factors (for example, living conditions, household income, employment status) and early life factors, such as body weight in childhood. When it came to disease-related mortality, as we would expect, age and sex explained a significant amount (about half) of the variation in how long people lived. It suggests environmental factors influence health and longevity to a far greater extent than genetics. The environmental factors that had the most influence on earlier death and biological ageing included smoking, socioeconomic status, physical activity levels and living conditions. Interestingly, being taller at age ten was found to be associated with a shorter lifespan. Although this may seem surprising, and the reasons are not entirely clear, this aligns with previous research finding taller people are more likely to die earlier. Carrying more weight at age ten and maternal smoking (if your mother smoked in late pregnancy or when you were a newborn) were also found to shorten lifespan. Probably the most surprising finding in this study was a lack of association between diet and markers of biological ageing, as determined by the proteomic profiling. But there are a number of plausible explanations for this. Second, the dietary data in this study, which was self-reported and only measured at one time point, is likely to have been of relatively poor quality, limiting the researchers’ ability to see associations. And third, as the relationship between diet and longevity is likely to be complex, disentangling dietary effects from other lifestyle factors may be difficult. So despite this finding, it’s still safe to say the food we eat is one of the most important pillars of health and longevity. Key exposures (such as diet) in this study were only measured at a single point in time, and not tracked over time, introducing potential errors into the results. Also, as this was an observational study, we can’t assume associations found represent causal relationships. Finally, it’s possible this study may have underestimated the role of genetics in longevity. It’s important to recognise genetics and environment don’t operate in isolation. Rather, health outcomes are shaped by their interplay, and this study may not have fully captured the complexity of these interactions. It’s worth noting there were a number of factors such as household income, home ownership and employment status associated with diseases of ageing in this study that are not necessarily within a person’s control. This is great news, unless you have good genes and were hoping they would do the heavy lifting.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

More than three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, a 30-day ceasefire between the two warring countries may be imminent. But much more needs to happen before a just and lasting peace is achieved. Since the night of February 24 2022, millions of Ukrainian citizens, military personnel, journalists, officials and civil society activists have shared first-hand eyewitness accounts, updates, commentaries and opinions on the war. Around the world, many online communities have also sprung into action to counter Russian propaganda and raise awareness of what is happening inside Ukraine. We have been studying these communities for the past three years, conducting hours of interviews with members and observing their activity on social media. To conduct much of this research and connect with members, we had to join some of these communities – a common requirement for researchers working in online settings. Our work reveals a range of skills and strategies activists use in the online fight against Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was accompanied by online disinformation and propaganda campaigns. The aims of these campaigns are to sow discord, distrust and dismay among both Ukrainian and international audiences by, for example, depicting Ukraine as a failed state ruled by Nazis. Ukraine responded by launching its own information operations to counter Russian propaganda, appeal for help from the world and maintain the security of its defensive operations. In some cases, social media platforms have aided the Russian cause. At the same time, they have suppressed evidence of war crimes. For example, in the first year of the Russian invasion, independent investigative journalism organisations such as Disclose documented thousands of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers against Ukrainian civilians. Much of this content included graphic imagery, violence and offensive language. For example, a 2023 investigation by the BBC revealed thousands of fake TikTok accounts created as part of a Russian propaganda campaign spreading lies about Ukrainian officials. This isn’t new or unique to the war in Ukraine. For example, in 2019, US TikToker Feroza Aziz shared a makeup tutorial in which she subtly raised awareness of China’s treatment of the Uyghurs – a topic that is often suppressed on the Chinese-owned platform. Members – or “fellas”, as they are known – from many regions around the world were brought together by its rituals using internet and popular culture memes. In most cases, this involves raising funds for urgent military or humanitarian efforts to benefit Ukraine. Some users share amusing or ridiculous anecdotes from their lives before closing with a donation request. Members of the North Atlantic Fella Organisation also try to combat Russian propaganda and disinformation. They highlight their ridiculousness by responding with memes and jokes. People spreading Russian disinformation often find themselves annoyed by the swarms of “meme dogs” in their replies. In turn, this has allowed North Atlantic Fella Organisation members to report them for violation of X’s terms of service and have their accounts suspended, as our forthcoming research documents. However, from late 2022 onward, North Atlantic Fella Organisation members we interviewed as a part of our research reported decreased effectiveness of X’s response to problematic user conduct. This was soon after tech billionaire Elon Musk bought the social media platform.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Pronouns are just small words we use in place of names all the time. Getting pronouns right is a simple thing everyone can do to show respect. Linguistic shifts towards gender inclusivity are occurring worldwide, and the use of gender-neutral or inclusive pronouns is not a new nor exclusively Western phenomenon. Chinese, one of the world’s oldest languages and spoken by more than one billion people, illustrates how languages adapt to reflect shifting understanding of gender. Its pronoun system may be on the cusp of significant change. In my newly published research, I’ve explored what is happening with Chinese third-person pronouns. The modern Chinese pronoun system is fascinating for two reasons. You can have a whole conversation about someone without revealing their gender. The lack of gender-distinct pronouns in spoken Mandarin has prompted calls for written Chinese to follow suit. Queer Chinese speakers have proposed several gender-inclusive pronouns that would be pronounced tā, just like 他 (he) and 她 (she). Other people hope to see the now-masculine 他 regain its original function as an ungendered pronoun. I asked survey respondents, a third of whom were nonbinary or otherwise gender-diverse, about their pronoun preferences and perceptions. I also analysed how pronouns are used in a large database of contemporary Chinese texts. Notably, 他 (he) was not used by any women or gender-diverse people, except one who considered it gender-neutral. In contrast, fewer than 8% had encountered the new character-based pronouns 「⿰无也」 or「⿰㐅也」 and no one reported using them. Survey participants were overwhelmingly positive about TA, with 63% expressing favourable views. The look and feel is good, it suits people’s everyday pronunciation habits, and doesn’t create issues with having to specify someone’s gender. It works in two ways: as a gender-neutral pronoun when gender is unknown (like saying “someone left their umbrella”), and as a gender-inclusive pronoun specifically including gender-diverse people. Many survey respondents called TA “respectful” and “inclusive” but also simply “convenient”. However, some respondents were concerned TA is “untraditional” and “pollutes the Chinese language”. Before a new character can be typed on computers or phones, it needs to be officially encoded in Unicode, the global standard for digital text. My research shows this requirement is strongly influencing which emerging Chinese pronouns can gain traction. While some survey respondents hoped to see a gender-inclusive Chinese character adopted, they weren’t optimistic about 「⿰无也」or 「⿰㐅也」 becoming mainstream. TA is currently the most popular emerging Chinese gender-inclusive pronoun, crucially because it mimics how people use tā in spoken Mandarin. It is already part of people’s vocabulary, and already used (at least as a gender-neutral pronoun) by mainstream Chinese media and on online platforms. This makes TA a strong contender for widespread adoption into contemporary Chinese.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When two junior employees bump into each other in the corridor and start chatting about their manager’s overbearing manner, it’s typically considered gossip. Both scenarios meet traditional definitions of gossip – the information being shared is about other people, the people it’s about are absent, the information is shared in a way that casts judgement on those people, and it’s informal. What counts as gossip is much more slippery than we might think. I reviewed 184 academic articles to understand what really constitutes workplace gossip. The key, I found, is not any set of objective criteria, but rather people’s shared agreement that a situation counts as gossip. My work also provides insights into how businesses can manage gossip before it becomes a scandal. If the victim of sexual harassment complains directly to their manager, an investigation is automatically justified. If the manager does something about what they’ve heard and the source turns out to be unreliable, they could face negative consequences for acting on what was essentially “just gossip.” But if they don’t act, and the information turns out to be credible, they could face repercussions for ignoring the “inside word.” There is evidence that such paradoxical situations play out quite frequently in real-world workplaces. For example, inside information about negligence towards patient safety in healthcare settings has, in the past, been dismissed as “just gossip” until it provoked a public scandal. In this case, the inquiry also found official complaints had been ignored. One case study from the United States found managers tended to keep an ear out for information passing through the grapevine and selectively use it to further their own interests. Gossip gains its credibility as the inside word because it takes place outside official communication channels. Therefore, if managers try to co-opt gossip into formal management processes, it’s likely to have the unintended consequence of discrediting the shared information. Instead, “managing gossip” requires a better understanding of its functions and motivations. However, it could be managed simply by being transparent about staff salaries, filling the information gap before gossip does. Another key function of gossip is to warn against antisocial behaviours like bullying. But if employees feel comfortable speaking up about such behaviour — even when it’s perpetrated by those with official power – managers will not face the dilemma of whether to act on information that could turn out to be “just gossip.” But what can be managed are the workplace behaviours and hierarchical relationships that gossip loves to sink its teeth into.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Scientists have used a type of artificial intelligence, called a large language model, to uncover new insights into how the human brain understands and produces language. Using artificial intelligence (AI), scientists have unraveled the intricate brain activity that unfolds during everyday conversations. Based on how an AI model transcribes audio into text, the researchers behind the study could map brain activity that takes place during conversation more accurately than traditional models that encode specific features of language structure — such as phonemes (the simple sounds that make up words) and parts of speech (such as nouns, verbs and adjectives). It then uses the statistics of that mapping to "learn" to predict text from new audio files that it hasn't previously heard. As such, Whisper works purely through these statistics without any features of language structure encoded in its original settings. Identifying similarities between how the model develops language processing abilities and how people develop these skills may be useful for engineering devices that help people communicate. The study's results suggest that "we should think about cognition through the lens of this [statistical] type of model," Goldstein told Live Science. The study, published March 7 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour , featured four participants with epilepsy who were already undergoing surgery to have brain-monitoring electrodes implanted for clinical reasons. Most studies that use recordings of conversations take place in a lab under very controlled circumstances over about an hour, Goldstein said. Although this controlled environment can be useful for teasing out the roles of different variables, Goldstein and his collaborators wanted to "to explore the brain activity and human behavior in real life." Goldstein explained that there is ongoing debate as to whether distinct parts of the brain kick into gear during these tasks or if the whole organ responds more collectively. The researchers found that certain brain regions did tend to correlate with some tasks. For example, areas known to be involved in processing sound, such as the superior temporal gyrus, showed more activity when handling auditory information, and areas involved in higher-level thinking, such as the inferior frontal gyrus, were more active for understanding the meaning of language. They could also see that the areas became active sequentially. However, the researchers also clearly saw areas activate during activities they were not known to be specialized for. "I think it's the most comprehensive and thorough, real-life evidence for this distributed approach," Goldstein said. After this analysis, they could use the model to predict what brain activity would go with conversations that had not been included in the training data. The research is a "groundbreaking study because it demonstrates a link between the workings of a computational acoustic-to-speech-to language model and brain function," Leonhard Schilbach , a research group leader at the Munich Centre for Neurosciences in Germany who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email. However, he added that, "Much more research is needed to investigate whether this relationship really implies similarities in the mechanisms by which language models and the brain process language." “If we understand the inner workings of artificial and biological neurons and their similarities, we might be able to conduct experiments and simulations that would be impossible to conduct in our biological brain," he told Live Science by email.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

COVVI-19 gave rise to a multiplication of conspiracy theses in France and all over the world. The world pandemic nevertheless seemed to mark as, before it, the attacks of September 11, 2001 an acceleration of its diffusion.

The strength of conspiracy is due in its logic. However, when the Times revealed, on August 18, 1921, that this document was a montage, Jacques Bainville, one of the leaders of the French Action, despite everything its existence and affirms: This rejection of an inexpensive remedy was actually aimed at leaving the field free to the marketing of a new vaccine synonymous with huge financial gains for a pharmaceutical industry acting in the service of supposed Jewish financial interests. Any element asking questions or awakening the surprise is raised to the rank of irrefutable evidence and is perceived as necessarily intentional.

But conspiracy has also evolved at the time of the covid with an enlargement of its audience and trivialization and an ever stronger political instrumentalization. Conseilism is distinguished from previous periods due to its links with the Internet at a time when social networks have become one of the main sources of information. For researcher Alessandro Leiduan, social networks have reduced "the time necessary for social incubation" of conspiratorial theses and have expanded "the territorial space subject to their influence". States researchers have studied the impact of links between the pandemic and social networks on populations and have concluded that a generalized disruption of cognitive and social structures. This moment made them more open to the rejection of official stories and the speech of experts. They were both afraid for their health and their use while having the feeling of not being able to control anything. As Alessandro Leiduan shows, in an interview "conspiracy theory at the time of the covid pandemic", these doubts were the source of general distrust against scientists and authorities, which continues today. In doing so, the sensitivity to conspiracy theses now exceeds the circles of psychologically unstable individuals, or in a situation of vulnerability, and political groups and concerns a broader fringe of the population. Beyond its trivialization, conspiracy has also become "a new tool for disqualifying opposing speech", as researcher Camille Némeau points out. Since the COVID, the accusation of conspiracy has now been taken up by all political forces of all stripes to discredit opponents and contradictors. But also of his growing political instrumentalization and the difficulties that will be overcome to see him back down.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The current universal digitization upsets our relationship with historical documents, memory and knowledge. An essential question arises: how to create a digital heritage that is both lasting, ethical, accessible, authentic and respectful of data protection? A project to digitize this documentary legacy is underway, piloted by the University of Burgundy Europe. But it also exposes these documents at several risks: commodification of data, dependence on digital giants, fragmentation of collective memory, and above all, an increasing ecological footprint. In a world where digital infrastructures consume massive and growing quantities of energy and are based on limited natural resources, can we still consider a "sustainable" digitization of intellectual heritage? Today, while its heritage is going through this digital mutation, it seems necessary to question our practices. Ecological and political tensions that shape digital technology cannot be ignored. Preserving the memory of an intellectual in an era where knowledge becomes a monetisable resource, even more with the arrival of generative artificial intelligence, is not just a technical operation, it is also a cultural and political choice. In the digital age, an imperative seems to impose itself, everything must be preserved: historical archives, personal memories, cultural documents. This accumulation perhaps aims to build a virtual collective memory, but poses a paradox: by wanting to hold everything, do we not risk losing ourselves in an overload of information? In the heritage field, this mass of data creates confusion rather than a clarification. Instead of facilitating access to knowledge, digital can sometimes blur their understanding. It would structure thought and focus on the essentials. Another issue is that of power over this communication space. Large technological companies (Amazon, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Tiktok) hold digital infrastructure and monetize data. When it started, the web bore an ideal of freedom, without commercial or political control. Today, the web is fragmented between national and commercial blocks, each power imposing its own rules. China controls access to content via "the Grand Firewall", while in Russia, citizens' data must be stored on national servers. In addition, the Internet is dominated by digital giants, especially those of Silicon Valley, who control infrastructure and capture most of the profits and jobs related to new technologies, including artificial intelligence. Europe, on the other hand, is struggling to establish itself as a major technological player. Artificial intelligence uses enormous amounts of data, including protected works, often without the author's authorization, thus raising legal and ethical issues. Any information can be used to generate content, making data a key resource for the digital economy. In this context, preserving the cultural and symbolic wealth of knowledge becomes a crucial challenge. How to resist this merchant dynamic and protect the intellectual heritage against instrumentalization? Europe is trying to supervise large technological companies with initiatives such as Digital Markets Act (DMA) or the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). But faced with the transnational strategies of digital giants, which have considerable means to bypass or influence regulations, their effectiveness remains uncertain. We can no longer consider our societies regardless of terrestrial constraints and ecological interdependencies. Consequently, the question of digital heritage cannot be limited to a technical issue: it initiates political choices on access to knowledge, infrastructure governance and sustainability of supports.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Researchers are developing new methods in order to ensure safe storage, which is not too energy delicious, and which allows effective exploitation of data. For this, they offer in particular to carry out the calculations directly on encrypted data. Due to the enormous quantity of sensitive data kept online, cloud systems have become an essential tool for modern commercial operations, but also a significant target of cyber attacks. Currently, more than 90 % of organizations are based on Clouds services for essential operations, and there are more than 3.6 billion users active worldwide - which means that 47 % of the world's population uses cloud services. 14 % of them had experienced data violation in the past twelve months. While organizations transfer more and more sensitive data on a cloud (almost half of the stored information is considered sensitive), the vulnerable surface to attacks is increasing for cybercriminals. Consequently, incidents are more frequent and at higher risk, since the loss of sensitive information can have significant effects, both financially and in terms of reputation. The average world cost of data violation in 2024 was estimated at $ 4.88 million. Today, what is called "client -sided encryption" makes it possible to effectively preserve data security and their confidentiality. However, so that encrypted data is useful, you must be able to use it safely - exploit them by making calculations, for example. From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. User authentication and access control are among the essential mechanisms to avoid data violations. Access control - which consists in regulating that can visualize, use or interact with cloud resources, whether data, applications or services - is the second line of defense. Customer -side encryption allows you to store data in a safe way In order to deal with this problem, Mega, another client -side encryption service, uses public key cryptography, which avoids the stage of the online key distribution server. However, this strategy requires management of sophisticated electronic certificates, as the number of asymmetrical cryptography figures is proportional to the potential number of users to share a document, it is difficult to apply on a large scale. Read More: Hunt for waste in the Cloud and Data Centers This encryption system can be placed on the scale, because its access policy does not require lists all individuals with authorization to access data, only the characteristics of potential users. This access control is implemented thanks to the encryption and deciphering algorithms themselves, which are demonstrated safe in theory. This type of decryption, already in use, requires large calculation resources. For aircraft with limited resources, this is a major drawback in terms of efficiency. However, timeing requires regular updates, which can require significant calculation resources for the biggest systems. Ideally, servers should be able to perform important operations on encrypted data without even having to decrypt it, which would preserve confidentiality at each stage. It is a advanced encryption technique that allows mathematical operations - in particular addition and multiplication - are carried out on encrypted data directly by a server, without going through deciphering. However, current cutting -edge systems cannot yet be used for large -scale operations due to "noise": random data is involuntarily introduced by encryption operations. This noise threatens the integrity of the results of calculations and makes frequent operations to delete inaccuracies - again, an expensive process in calculation resources, in particular on bulky data systems. We propose for this problem a new direct processing approach of encrypted data. It makes it possible to carry out an unlimited number of arithmetic operations without resorting to "bootstrapping" (the mathematical operation to reduce noise) and achieves higher performance for various secure calculation operations, for example the respectful reidentification of privacy.

In Georgia, in manifestations against power, references to repression and purges led by the Soviet regime are numerous. For more than 100 days, demonstrators have gone through the streets of Georgia. It is with these words that a young woman explains her arrival at the microphone of journalist Zarina Zabrisky. Another lady mentions her grandfather, a teacher victim of "Russian repression". A participant commemorates an ancestor killed in 1924 and believes that the current situation is "quite comparable to that of a hundred years ago". Because the purges also intended to bring out "a new man", a "Soviet", having largely broken with his culture and national traditions, to become aware of the political violence suffered in the 20th century, of their brutality and their inadmissible character seemed to be, in the USSR of Perestroika, an essential condition for reaffirming and consolidating national identities. From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. It is the need for Georgian director Tenguiz Abouladzé in repentance. When it was released in January 1987, the film was an event and seemed to mark a turning point: to bury the past, it was necessary to tell the truth about the crimes committed-or at least that was most often interpreted. The Stalinist Georgia of Tenguiz Abouladze - Invitation to travel (April 21, 2023) The difference between Russian and Ukrainian memory approaches quickly appeared. We, Russia, will not apologize before anyone. Wouldn't it been an additional reason to cry all the victims of Soviet famines and violence together? Russia by Vladimir Putin did not wish it. Because she denied the sufferings of neighboring peoples-and her own ...-gradually rehabilitated Stalin and was increasingly aggressive, she dug memorial and political chasms with other ex-Soviet republics now independent. Read More: Memory of communism: a European controversy More generally, the Russian authorities refuse any questioning of the Stalinist past, especially external, and less and less conceal this refusal. As early as 2007, textbooks commanded by the presidential administration and not yet imposed on everyone justified the Soviet purges: they would have been essential to improve the economy, to fight against external and interior opponents and, in the end, to prevail over Nazi Germany. Since then, the situation has continued to deteriorate. In his book Radio Vladimir (2025), Filipp Dzyadko, Russian writer and journalist in exile since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, notes that Putin "engaged a war on memory": Filipp Dzyadko thus underlines that the Memorial association - forcibly closed in December 2021 - "did not stop [alert them to the serious sequelae left in society by the trauma of a poorly overcome past", starting with "a deep atomization" and "a visceral fear which was transmitted from generation to generation". The memory approaches taken in Georgia or Ukraine fight, among other things, these ailments, but they are now associated with a de-security as well as with de-RUSSATION. This is what the remarks made during Georgian demonstrations or in a Ukraine again brutalized by Russia reflect. "The next day, she exclaimed:" Exactly what was going on in 1921. Make a choice, do not become Sergo Ordjonikidé! By the evocation of this revolutionary, she recalled the involvement of certain Georgians in submission to Bolshevik Russia, but also to Putinian Russia. On the same social network, another Georgian written in December 2024: "Do you know what time it is?" Admittedly, the oligarch Bidzina Ivanichvili, a true master of the country, seems very distant, by his luxurious lifestyle, from Stalin's practices.

Mice will attempt to revive unconscious companions by licking and biting their faces, scientists discover. Mice appear to administer first-aid if they find a fellow mouse unconscious, scientists have discovered. They attempt to revive companions by licking at their faces, or even by pulling at their mouths or tongues, according to a study published Feb. 21 in the journal Science . "The most striking discovery in this study is the existence of instinctive emergency responses in animals to revive unconscious — and even freshly deceased — partners. This study provides the first documented evidence of resuscitation-like behavior in naïve, untrained mice," study lead author Wenjian Sun , a researcher at the University of Southern California, told Live Science in an email. Helping other animals that are injured or sick has been observed in a number of species, including dolphins, elephants, and non-human primates, Sun explained. Related: Ants perform life saving operations — the only animal other than humans known to do so "These behaviors often include touching, grooming, nudging, and, in some cases, more intense physical actions such as striking. These states included the other mouse being stressed and unconscious. Grooming increased in vigor over the test period from sniffing and licking to biting at the other mouse's mouth and tongue, with more aggressive actions being seen in pairs of mice that were more familiar with one another. While these findings indicate that mice have an instinct to help others like humans do, the researchers can't be certain why they act in this way. "We do not exclude the possibility that the animal is simply driven by instinctive impulses to perform these actions — an instinct that may have evolved over time during evolution — rather than acting with a conscious intent to revive its partner," Sun said. In another paper, also published on Feb. 21 in Science , other researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles describe the neuronal mechanisms behind this behavior. This aligns with the oxytocin's well-known role as the 'love hormone' which is associated with trust and affection in humans and promotes social bonding," Sun explained.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/donald-trump-thinks-some-accents-are-beautiful-but-what-makes-them-so-251458'>Donald Trump thinks some accents are ‘beautiful,’ but what makes them so?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 12:37:12 <p>
There is much evidence showing that opinions on language are not based in any objective standards of beauty or aesthetics, but rather on our attitudes about the people speaking them. However, there is no scientific relationship between accent and intelligence; these stereotypes are learned behaviour. Research shows young children of about five or six, for example, do not discriminate between U.S. northern and southern accents. Many negative stereotypes about accents and the people who have them are often based in racism or classism. “French, which had taken centuries to develop into a most subtle intricate form — the height of sophistication — was far too complex for these simple savages to learn. Today, language attitudes may be more subtle in their racism or classism, but they persist, using our biases about a group of people to affect how we feel about their way of speaking. Studies show that speakers tend to rate their own dialects as very pleasant. Research also shows that when people are unfamiliar with accents, they tend to not discriminate between them. In other words, when unfamiliar listeners have no knowledge about an accent or its place of origin, they rate accents equally. When speakers are familiar with an accent or dialect, however, they use their social knowledge to make judgments about the esthetics, determining which is more pleasing than another. Understanding different accents is a skill that develops over time, and greater exposure to speakers with a particular accent helps us understand that accent more easily. The attitude we have about foreign accents is affected by our social knowledge of a person, their accent and where they come from. Our ability to understand reflects the cognitive load that our brain is put through in order to categorize the different sounds that we are hearing. Putting these two together, it is easy to see how the historical prestige associated with European accents, as well as the political power of leaders like Emmanuel Macron of France, Starmer from the United Kingdom or Modi of India would be reflected in Trump’s positive attitude towards them. Similarly, he might consider a foreign journalist’s position on the world stage to be far less worth doing the cognitive work necessary to understand them. Fundamentally, there is no objective criteria for determining the “beauty” of someone’s accent.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theconversation.com/trumps-english-language-order-upends-americas-long-multilingual-history-252163'>Trump’s English language order upends America’s long multilingual history</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theconversation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 12:36:39 <p>
Across its nearly 250-year history, the United States has never had an official language. On March 1, U.S. President Donald Trump changed that when he signed an executive order designating English as the country’s sole official language. This new order also revokes a language-access provision contained in an earlier executive order from 2000 that aimed to improve access to services for people with limited English. Despite some reactions in the New York Times, Washington Post and elsewhere, it remains unclear whether Trump’s executive order will face legal or political challenges. Amid continual attacks from the Trump administration on established norms, this decree may pass with relatively little resistance, despite a deeper meaning that extends far beyond language. According to data from the Census Bureau, one-fifth of all Americans can speak two or more languages. English has long functioned as a pragmatic lingua franca for the U.S. Yet an American tendency towards ideological monolingualism is gathering momentum. During the last few decades, more than 30 American states have enshrined English as an official language. The March 1 executive order is a crowning achievement for the “English-only movement.” Trump has tapped directly into this sentiment and its xenophobic preoccupations, rooted in white fragility and white supremacy. In 2015, during his first bid for the Oval Office, Trump reprimanded Jeb Bush, the bilingual former governor of Florida, during a televised debate, stating: “This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish.” Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February 2024, Trump gave voice to his own linguistic insecurity: It is in fact a sign of strength that Americans have not needed such a mandate until now, effectively navigating their complex multilingual reality without top-down legislation. While Australia’s constitution specifies no official language, the government promotes English as the “national language,” and then offers to translate some web pages into other languages. Recognizing that English is unthreatened and secure, even without legal backing, New Zealand legislators have focused their attention elsewhere. Welsh and Irish have both received some official recognition, while in Scotland, the Bòrd na Gàidhlig continues to advocate for official recognition of Gaelic. Trump’s recent executive order is both practical and symbolic. Language access can be a matter of life or death. Interpretation in courts, hospitals and schools is a fundamental human right. The consequences of government agencies abandoning their already limited efforts at translation and interpretation could have huge ramifications. Symbolically, Trump’s order is red meat for his MAGA followers. Americans will not stop speaking, writing and signing in languages other than English because of an executive order.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

When Canadian ice hockey centre Connor McDavid scored in overtime to lead Canada to victory over the United States in the National Hockey League’s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament in February, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau posted on social media, “You can’t take our country — and you can’t take our game.” Meanwhile, the tournament itself, which pitted the top Canadian and American players against one another for the first time in more than a decade, became a representation of these deepening political divisions and showed that hockey isn’t as politically neutral as is often suggested. Hockey” as he was widely known), whose strategic use of elbows on the ice has become a political rallying cry for Canadians. In particular, Howe’s practice of keeping his “elbows up” in the corners to ward off belligerents on the opposing team has become a focal point for Canadians’ actions against Trump’s aggression. Howe’s guidance has been echoed by Canadian comedian Mike Myers on Saturday Night Live and by Trudeau at the Liberal leadership convention that marked the transition to Prime Minister Mark Carney. In his first speech as Liberal leader, Carney made another hockey reference when he said: “We didn’t ask for this fight, but Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. While it may be surprising to see such enthusiasm for an “elbows up” approach and for “dropping the gloves” as one would in a hockey fight, this kind of strategic employment of violence fits perfectly with Howe’s longstanding brand of hockey manhood. Howe’s brand of violence was careful and calculated, rather than reckless or emotional. Even when he used his fists to batter an opponent — such as in his famous 1959 fight with New York Rangers enforcer Lou Fontinato — Howe presented himself as a reluctant and reasonable fighter who conformed to the idealized, manly “code” of hockey. A little later, the guy will have four stitches in his head.” Although critics of fighting and violence have become more outspoken in recent years, these values remain integral to hockey culture at the highest level and an influential point of reference for what it means to be a “true” hockey fan and a patriotic Canadian. With their “elbows up,” Canadians are counting on a Gordie Howe-style response — rational, expert and effective — in a trade war with the United States that may just be getting started.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

But when the team gave Google's "co-scientist" — an AI tool designed to collaborate with researchers — this question in a short prompt, the AI's response produced the same answer as their then-unpublished findings in just two days.

Cyclone Alfred will cost the March 25 budget at least A$1.2 billion, hit growth and put pressure on inflation, Treasurer Jim Chalmers says. In a Tuesday speech previewing the budget, Chalmers will also say that on preliminary estimates, the cyclone’s immediate hit to GDP is expected to be up to $1.2 billion, which could wipe a quarter of a percentage point off quarterly growth. From building costs to damaged crops raising prices for staples like fruit and vegetables,” Chalmers says in the speech, an extract of which has been released ahead of delivery. Early modelling indicated losses covered by the Cyclone Reinsurance Pool were about $1.7 billion. “The budget will reflect some of those immediate costs and we’ll make sensible provisions for more to come,” he says. “I expect that these costs and these new provisions will be in the order of at least $1.2 billion […] and that means a big new pressure on the budget.” This is in addition to the already budgeted for disaster relief. “At MYEFO, we’d already booked $11.6 billion for disaster support nationally over the forward estimates. "With all of this extra funding we expect that to rise to at least $13.5 billion when accounting for our provisioning, social security costs and other disaster related support.” Australia is bracing for the possibility our beef export trade could be caught in a new tariff round to be unveiled early next month. In seeking the exemption, Australia was unsuccessful in trying to leverage its abundance of critical minerals, which are much sought after by the US. What we need to do is find out what it is that the Americans want in terms of this relationship between Australia and the United States and then make President Trump an offer he can’t refuse. funds for enhanced childcare and to provide some student debt relief Read more: Labor and the Coalition have pledged to raise GP bulk billing. Deloitte’s Stephen Smith said that although a $26.1 billion deficit was slightly smaller than forecast in the December budget update, the longer-term structural deterioration should be “a reality check for politicians wanting to announce election sweeteners in the weeks ahead”. Albanese said that any Australian contribution to a Ukraine peacekeeping force would be “small”. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has opposed sending Australians to a peacekeeping force.

What it is: The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) star-forming region Where it is: 1,400 light-years away, in the constellation Orion A deep dive into the star-forming Flame Nebula by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed free-floating, Jupiter-size objects that could help answer that key question in astronomy. Brown dwarfs are often called " failed stars " because they don't get dense and hot enough to become stars and, instead, eventually cool to become dim, hard-to-see objects. However, exactly how small a brown dwarf can be is a mystery, largely because these objects are impossible to study using standard telescopes. But JWST is sensitive to infrared light, which it sees as heat. The telescope went looking for relatively warm and bright young brown dwarfs in the Flame Nebula, whose dense dust and gas proved no match for its infrared detectors. Now, JWST has picked up the baton and completed what scientists called "a quantum leap" in understanding brown dwarfs. "It's really difficult to do this work, looking at brown dwarfs down to even ten Jupiter masses, from the ground, especially in regions like this," Matthew De Furio , an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of a study published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said in a statement . "Having existing Hubble data over the last 30 years or so allowed us to know that this is a really useful star-forming region to target.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the COVVI-19 epidemic had now become a pandemic (five days later, on March 16, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the implementation of national confinement, effective on March 17, editor's note). It all started a few months earlier, in December 2019, with the report in Wuhan, China, a "home of serious cases due to unknown origin". The manager, quickly identified, turned out to be, an emerging coronavirus, called Sars-Cov-2. Three months later, the newcomer had spread in 114 countries according to the WHO, and more than 118,000 cases were reported, while 4,291 deaths were identified. During this period, and throughout the pandemic, public health agencies such as WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States played a leading role, coordinating with local health services to test, trace and isolate cases of virus infection. Five years later, the Trump administration has already eliminated more than 5,000 employees in combined NIH and CDC, and works for the United States to disengage from WHO. And this, even though the United States is faced with several epidemics of tuberculosis, a resurgence of measles (due to a decline in vaccination levels in certain populations), and the worst flu season for the last 15 years ... What can be the consequences of these decisions? Expanding and slow Epidemiah circulation of information Through my research, as a health communication specialist, I notably analyzed the essential role played by non -profit organizations and public agencies in the protection of public health. From Monday to Friday + Sunday, receive the analyzes and decrypts from our experts for free for another look at the news. Without such information sharing systems, it was much more difficult to list the outbreaks and follow the evolution of infections from one region to another. The 1918 influenza pandemic is a notable example of these shortcomings. Appeared for the first time in a Kansas military base in the spring, this disease, combining flu and pneumonia, then spread abroad. The lack of media coverage of the spring epidemic, associated with an absence of follow -up, had led to this confusion: most people believed that the deadly strain came from Europe. Unfortunately, it was already too late to stem the epidemic wave. The polio epidemic benefited from a more coordinated response This effort was particularly visible during the 1952 polio epidemic. During this summer, in fact, infections by the polio virus exploded in the United States: 57,628 cases were identified, and more than third of patients kept sequelae resulting in paralysis of various degrees. She informed the population about the propagation epidemic, created emergency hospital wings dedicated to polio, recruited nurses and health professionals, and shared her resources with affected areas. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis has then changed its name and mission, becoming the March of Dimes, a charity association aimed at improving the health of newborns by fighting against premature births, birth problems and infant mortality. The crucial role of public health agencies This global organization has brought together nations of all continents Improving disease surveillance, prevention, treatments and research. During the 1950s and 1960s, these agencies extended their field of action to many areas related to public health, adopting various approaches and strategies drawn up by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis: Monitoring and registration of data, public education, surveillance and investigations concerning potential or proven threats, assistance in times of crisis and support for scientific research. For decades, these agencies have rarely drawn attention to them, which his agents track in the field of infections by salmonella or by dangerous hemorrhagic fever viruses. A survey conducted in 2024 revealed that almost 60 % of adults interviewed believe that the United States has drawn profits from its membership in WHO. With reason, because without solid efforts coordinated between public health agencies, minor health crises can be transformed into epidemics, or even pandemics. That these structures are weakened, and it may be that tomorrow, the whole world is much less well prepared to face it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.livescience.com/health/sex/do-sperm-really-race-to-the-egg'>Do sperm really race to the egg?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> livescience&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 09:00:00 <p>
Egg fertilization is often described as an epic swim meet: Millions of sperm swim as fast as they can toward the egg until one — the fastest, strongest, healthiest sperm of them all — wins the race and wriggles into the egg, with the prize of passing its genes to future offspring. But is this really how it happens? Do sperm really race to the egg? Yes and no, David J. Miller , a professor in the animal sciences department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told Live Science. Sperm do swim during this process, but "the major movement is actually provided by contractions of the female tract," Miller explained. A 1996 study illustrated just how efficient these contractions are, Miller noted. It makes sense that sperm would need some extra help, because while the sperm swim in one direction, the egg needs to travel in the opposite direction to meet them, Sabine Koelle , a full professor of anatomy and developmental biology at the University College Dublin School of Medicine and Medical Sciences, told Live Science.

In fact, an individual sperm's movement is less of an effort to move forward and more of an effort to move inward, toward the middle of the tract, Koelle said. However, just because a sperm is the first to arrive doesn't mean it gets to do the fertilizing. "Sperm require some final maturation that occurs in the female tract, and it's time dependent," Miller said. "They might be replaced by some of the other more slowly transported sperm that have had time to complete that maturation." "A lot of them are flushed back out from the tract. Up to 70% of sperm don't even make it past the cervix, Koelle noted. "The sperm are stuck there and can't free themselves," she said. This is another place where the female reproductive organs are choosing winners: Scientists have noticed that normal-looking sperm are more likely to bind to the wall, Miller said, and binding to the wall provides some metabolic benefits that increase their lifespan. This isn't a perfect system, of course. " Obviously, we have genetic diseases that come through sperm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
