Tenney

GENEVA — A group that calls itself Concerned Citizens of NY24 is hosting a forum Tuesday night on the impacts federal actions are having on healthcare.

And, they're hoping the region's congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will attend during a legislature recess scheduled for next week.

The forum will be held from 7-8:30 p.m. at the Smith Opera House, 82 Seneca St. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.

Other forums are planned, the group said.

“Hearing that public concerns of the constituents of New York's 24th Congressional District were not being heard, a group of citizens has come together to hold a series of public forums in order to give people a place to voice their concerns and ask questions with the hope that the congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will hear and represent the consensus,” said Scott Comegys, chair of the Wayne County Democratic Committee.

The Geneva forum will include Dr. Laurel Dallmeyer, a retired physician who worked in Geneva for many years, along with other retired and current healthcare industry professionals, including Anne Ruflin, Jennifer Scott, and Dr. Robert Scott.

Comegys said Tenney “has been invited to attend and participate, although at the time of this release (Friday morning) the representative has not responded to the invitation that was hand-delivered to their Canandaigua office.”

Tenney's office did not reply to a request for comment as of Friday morning's print deadline.

HBO's third season of “The White Lotus” is underway. A mostly new cast of guests flock to Thailand's Koh Samui to stay at the show's namesake luxury spa and wellness sanctuary. Here, spirituality and a possible whodunnit are served up to loyal fans of the beloved comedy-drama series. 

This season begins similarly to others, with plenty of intrigue, leaving behind a string of mysteries about who died and how. The show opened with gunshots and a dead body, this time floating face down in a lotus pond. 

As storylines are introduced, a surprising theme running throughout this season is the frequent mention of lorazepam, a prescription medication used to treat anxiety and certain types of insomnia.

Victoria Ratliff, played by Parker Posey, whose Southern drawl brings a distinctive ring to the word “lorazepam,” can't seem to get through the day without popping these anti-anxiety pills like candy, sometimes downing them with white wine at dinner.

Her overuse of the pills leaves her slurring her words, zoning out, and dozing off at the dinner table. At one point in episode 4 (which was released on March 9), Victoria's daughter Piper exclaims, “You don't have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”

In this episode, Victoria's husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. While attending a yacht party with their three children, he steals Victoria's prescription bottle from her bag, drinks a few glasses of what looks like whiskey and becomes incoherent.

If you're wondering about this drug and whether it's safe for anxiety, read on. We'll break down how the drug is meant to be used, the main risks, and other ways to manage your anxiety.

Lorazepam is the generic name for the prescription medication Ativan. It belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which also include: 

“Lorazepam is a commonly prescribed medication for anxiety. It's also used to treat panic attacks and can be used for insomnia,” said David Merrill, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

The drug works by slowing the activity in the brain, which promotes relaxation in the body and a reduction in anxious thoughts.

However, “the first-line treatment [for anxiety] is typically antidepressants like SSRIs [antidepressants], plus psychotherapy,” Merrill told Healthline.

“Something like cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction — where you get a better understanding of what's driving your anxieties and how to manage the anxiety when it comes up, versus just popping a pill like is done on a TV show.”

Victoria L. Leigh, DO, FACOI, an internal medicine specialist with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, CA, said in certain cases, benzodiazepines may be used first, such as with anxiety experienced by cancer patients and hospice or palliative care patients.

Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine.

One 2024 meta-analysis of previous studies found that benzodiazepines were more effective than SSRIs at reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety. Both drugs were similarly effective at reducing the psychological symptoms. 

However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder.

Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. These are a normal part of the body's stress response, said Merrill, not something that is dangerous or harmful.

“If you learn how to counteract those sensations when they come up, whether by taking a deep breath or taking a break from what you are doing, you can keep them from becoming a full-blown panic attack,” Merrill said.

Some people can manage their anxiety without medication, using therapy alone. However, “with more severe cases of anxiety, we see the best outcomes with a combination of meds and therapy, at least over the short-term,” Merrill noted. “Then sometimes people can taper off the medications when their anxiety is under better control.”

When used as prescribed, lorazepam can cause the following side effects:

More serious problems, such as life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma, can occur if lorazepam is used alongside opioid medications such as codeine, oxycodone, and tramadol. 

Drinking alcohol or using certain illegal drugs alongside lorazepam can also increase these risks.

“Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”

People who are using illegal drugs or other substances should not use lorazepam. People with a history of alcohol dependence or abuse should not use lorazepam unless recommended by their doctor.

“Because lorazepam is short-acting, its onset is faster, making addiction more likely,” Leigh told Healthline. In addition, “withdrawals from this medication are more abrupt than the longer-acting medications in this family.”

Once dependence occurs, “if lorazepam is stopped suddenly, withdrawal symptoms can lead to seizures, altered [thoughts], and can be fatal,” she said.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines can cause physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, even when taken as directed. 

The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend upon the dose you are taking, how long you've been taking the drug, other sedating drugs you are taking, and other factors.

Symptoms of withdrawal include:

Merrill said other signs of lorazepam dependence include:

If you are experiencing physical dependence or if you had withdrawal symptoms when you tried to stop taking lorazepam, ask your doctor about tapering your dose. Tapering means taking smaller doses over the course of a few or several weeks until you can safely stop the drug.

To find a psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in substance misuse issues, search the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) database or call SAMHSA's national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

Many non-medication options have been shown to help relieve anxiety symptoms. Some of these may include:

“Focusing on exercise can also help to balance the ‘fight or flight' nervous system response that drives anxiety-related feelings,” said Leigh. “Reduction in alcohol consumption and focusing on a balanced diet can also impact the ‘gut-brain axis' and can improve mental health as well.”

For Amanda Armstrong, founder of Rise As We and author of “Healing Through the Vagus Nerve,” the missing link to healing from anxiety is often the autonomic nervous system.

This part of the nervous system controls unconscious processes such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. It's also in charge of keeping us safe through the body's fight, flight, fawn and freeze responses.

“Understanding the role of the nervous system really shifts the paradigm from ‘I'm broken,' to seeing that your symptoms make sense when put into the context of basic biological needs, your past trauma history, and how that gets stored in your body,” said Armstrong, who is based near Washington, D.C.

When viewed through the lens of the nervous system, anxiety symptoms are a survival response, one that makes sense in the context of the human body and a person's current and past experiences.

Other factors can also contribute to anxiety, such as sleep deprivation, being overstressed or over-caffeinated, suffering from micronutrient deficiencies, or lacking connection to other people and community.

In her practice, Armstrong teaches clients two types of tools for managing their anxiety.

First are tools that people can use in the moment if they are feeling anxious or having a panic attack. This includes visual orienting (slowly looking around your space), biting into a lemon, and certain kinds of breathing.

These help people move up what Armstrong refers to as the autonomic nervous system ladder — away from the sympathetic activation response (also known as fight or flight mode) toward a state of calm and connection.

The other group of tools helps reduce people's anxiety symptoms long-term. Part of this proactive approach is helping people understand what might be contributing to their anxiety symptoms, including: 

Once clients have mapped out these factors, Armstrong asks: “What feels meaningful, and what feels accessible for you to take on right now?”

While Armstrong said there's a time and a place for the use of anti-anxiety medications, she empowers clients by educating them about how their bodies work and giving them tools to manage their anxiety.

This approach can also pave the way for deeper work with a therapist, whether it's talk therapy, shadow work, or somatic parts (aka inner child) work. If the nervous system is well regulated, therapy is often more productive.

Overall, “the approach I use gives you an entire new framework for understanding yourself, and navigating your world and your symptoms in a way that is not associated with brokenness,” Armstrong told Healthline. “There's also more space for compassion and curiosity.”

In Season 3 of the HBO series “The White Lotus,” some characters appear to pop lorazepam like candy. This prescription drug is used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia due to anxiety or situational stress.

Studies show that benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective for treating both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. However, antidepressant SSRIs are more commonly used first because they have a lower risk of severe side effects.

Lorazepam carries a risk of dependence and potential for misuse. This drug can also cause life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma when used alongside opioid pain relievers, alcohol, or certain illegal drugs.

For many, the Shriners are a bit of a mystery, known for their distinctive fezzes, parade appearances, and charitable work, but not always for the details of their organization. While some might joke about them being a "secret society," the reality is much simpler: the Shriners are a fraternal organization dedicated to fun, fellowship, and philanthropy, particularly through their support of children's healthcare.

The Shriners organization was founded in 1872 in New York City by a group of Freemasons who wanted to create a fraternity with a focus on both camaraderie and charitable work. Over the years, the group has attracted notable members, including Presidents Gerald Ford and Harry Truman, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, General Douglas MacArthur, and even cultural icons like John Wayne and J. Edgar Hoover.

The Shriners' commitment to philanthropy led to the establishment of Shriners Hospitals for Children, a network of 22 hospitals across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These hospitals specialize in treating children with orthopedic conditions, burns, cleft lip and palate, and other disabilities. Until 2012, all care was provided entirely free of charge. Today, while insurance is billed when available, any costs not covered are absorbed by the hospital—ensuring that families never have to pay out of pocket for necessary medical care.

Bulloch County has its own Shriners group, the Statesboro Shrine Club, which was rechartered in May 2016. Though still a relatively young club, its members are working to grow their presence in the community and increase awareness of their mission. The club specifically supports the Shriners Children's Hospital in Greenville, South Carolina, which provides life-changing treatment for children in need.

To raise funds, the club engages in a variety of community events. A key initiative is their paper sale, where members stand on street corners handing out papers in exchange for donations, with 100% of proceeds going directly to the children's hospital. While the exact date for this year's sale is still being determined, they are aiming for April or May to avoid extreme summer heat.

The club also participates in local parades, where their brightly decorated vehicles and enthusiastic members bring smiles to children and adults alike. Beyond just entertainment, these appearances help build awareness of the Shriners' mission. One of their biggest annual events in Bulloch County is their boiled peanut sale at the fair, which has grown significantly in the past two years. The club also takes part in community activities like Trunk-or-Treat events, strengthening their ties to local families.

Despite their rich history and ongoing charitable work, the Shriners are still working to establish a stronger presence in Statesboro and Bulloch County. While cities like Vidalia have long-standing and well-known Shriners groups, the Statesboro Shrine Club is still growing its local reputation.

One unique approach they take is holding their meetings at different local restaurants each month. This not only helps the club engage with the community but also supports small businesses in Bulloch County. Eventually, the club hopes to raise enough money to purchase its own meeting space, but for now, it remains focused on outreach and engagement.

One key requirement for joining the Shriners is that members must first be Freemasons. While Masonic membership may seem mysterious to outsiders, the process is relatively simple: you have to ask to join. Those interested in becoming a Mason, and, by extension, a Shriner, can reach out to a local Mason or Shriner for more information on the process.

Beyond membership, community members can support the Shriners' mission by attending their events, donating to their fundraisers, or simply spreading the word about their work.

The Statesboro Shrine Club is actively looking for ways to expand its reach, increase participation, and deepen its impact on the community. For those interested in supporting their efforts, keeping up with local events, and learning more, Grice Connect's events calendar is a great resource for staying informed about upcoming fundraisers and activities.

Additionally, the club is seeking photos from past events to help showcase their work. If you've attended a parade or fair and have pictures of the Shriners in action, they would love to see them!

Franciscan is building a new cancer center at the campus of its new Crown Point hospital at I-65 and 231.

The new Franciscan Health Crown Point opened in 2024.

Franciscan Alliance is set to recognize our 150th anniversary at the end of this year.

Many things have changed in healthcare during that century and a half and we have adapted to meet the changing needs of our communities with state-of-the-art innovations throughout. What hasn't changed is our Catholic nonprofit healthcare ministry's fidelity to our mission of continuing Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition.

Last year, Franciscan Alliance set into motion multiple projects that support our regional approach to healthcare, optimizing facilities and resources with state-of-the-art services to improve the level of care for all of Northwest Indiana.

The year began with the opening of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point at the corner of U.S. 231 and Interstate 65, which replaced the 50-year-old Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital on Main Street.

This facility was constructed to support the highest acuity of patients in a convenient location and designed to keep patient care and safety at the center while enveloping employees, patients and families in our Catholic traditions.

The hospital includes 207 inpatient beds with room to expand to 300, as well as an attached medical office building and expandable diagnostic and treatment centers. It includes a hybrid operating room with the latest technology to care for cardiac patients, enhanced patient safety and convenience and private rooms in the neonatal intensive care unit, which is staffed by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago neonatologists.

In July, Franciscan Health Crown Point and Lurie announced their expanded partnership with the addition of a Lurie Children's pediatric hospitalist to serve young patients admitted to the pediatric unit. The partnership allows for board-certified/board-eligible Lurie pediatricians to provide daily management of pediatric inpatients, in-house care 24/7 in the pediatric inpatient unit, coordination of care with the child's pediatrician, management of care for newborns and pediatric consultations in the emergency department.

In the past, when children would require hospitalization, they would often be transferred by ambulance to hospitals hours from home, creating added stress for families during an already challenging time. This collaboration helps to ensure children and adolescents from across Northwest Indiana receive exceptional, comprehensive care close to home.

Franciscan Health Crown Point saw the groundbreaking in September of The Dean and Barbara White Cancer Center, which is slated to open in early 2027. This project was made possible in part by a $30 million donation from The Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation in November 2023, the largest gift ever received by the Franciscan Health Foundation, the fundraising support arm of our nonprofit healthcare ministry.

The 71,000-square-foot, three-story cancer center is being constructed by Tonn and Blank Construction on the campus of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital. This state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment center will consolidate existing Franciscan Health Crown Point cancer care services into one convenient location.





Providing kind, considerate and well-connected care throughout a family's journey through oncology treatment and recovery is our mission, and we are pleased to have such an aligned partner in the White family.

Franciscan Health Michigan City saw a groundbreaking in October for a new medical office building in Valparaiso. The two-story, 82,881-square-foot building is being built by Tonn and Blank Construction at the southeast corner of State Roads 2 and 49. It will house an ExpressCare, primary care and specialty physician offices, diagnostic imaging, CT, MRI, ultrasound and laboratory services.

We are excited to be significantly expanding our presence in Valparaiso with this project. The new building is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

In early November, Franciscan Health also broke ground on a new medical office building in St. John. The building mirrors the Valparaiso building in design and services and is also being built by Tonn and Blank Construction, at 10323 Wicker Ave. This building is also scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

Also in November, we announced that Franciscan Health Dyer will transition in late 2027 to a campus dedicated to treating behavioral health patients, a move designed to meet the growing need for behavioral health treatment while supporting Franciscan Alliance's regional approach to healthcare.

The transformation into a behavioral health campus will allow for the expansion of the current 92-bed inpatient behavioral health unit and the addition of behavioral health services. The existing Dyer emergency room will be transformed as well, with the space being used to house a new high acuity Franciscan ExpressCare for patients seeking medical care and the addition of an emergency intake department specifically dedicated to behavioral health. Patients seeking emergency room care may seek treatment at Franciscan Health Munster, just 2 miles away.

Inpatient, emergency and surgical services will move from Dyer to the expanded Munster campus in late 2027. Inpatient rehabilitation will also move from Dyer to a new rehabilitation facility on the Munster campus around the same time.

The expansion of the Munster campus is already underway and includes a three-story addition to an existing three-story medical structure and the construction of a new five-story medical structure.

Franciscan also offers a multitude of Community Health Improvement programs designed with input from community health surveys. From a variety of food insecurity programs to diaper pantries, the Prenatal Assistance Program, free health-related classes and much more, our Community Health Improvement programs further support our values of compassionate concern and Christian stewardship.

Backing these and many other initiatives is the Franciscan Health Foundation, which exists to support our mission. From cancer and cardiac care to community education, family health programs, women and children's services, educational scholarships and more, the Foundation supports Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition by caring for our neighbors with compassion and the love they need during their most trying times.

As we prepare to look back on 150 years of service, we are proud to look toward the future with hope for a more resilient, healthier Region, with the needs of our neighbors being met at locations closer to their homes than ever before.
