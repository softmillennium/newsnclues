1. Why am I using BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8?

BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 contains the active ingredients ibuprofen and codeine phosphate hemihydrate. Ibuprofen belongs to a family of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This group of medicines work by relieving pain, inflammation (e.g. swelling, redness, soreness) and fever. Codeine is an opioid analgesic that works in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain. BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 is used to provide temporary relief of acute to moderate pain and inflammation in patients over the age of 12 years. Once taken, your body processes the codeine into its active form, morphine, in the liver. In about 8% of people, they may experience less pain relief compared to others as their body doesn't convert codeine to morphine very well.
