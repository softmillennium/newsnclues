                <p>The arrival of artificial intelligence has revolutionized several sectors, and programming is one of the most impacted. AI models, such as chatgPT, Copilot and Claude, have become indispensable assistants for developers, allowing the creation of codes faster and more efficiently. However, this dependence raises an alert: are programmers fail to learn the true foundation of programming?

This phenomenon resembles the revolution of calculators, which have forever changed the way we perform mathematical operations. Now, the programming lives a similar dilemma: Can AI replace the programmer or just turn it into something new?

The impact of AI on programming

The popularization of AI tools in programming has generated a drastic change in the way codes are written. According to studies, six months after the launch of ChatgPT, 90% of programmers already used Ia in their work. These tools facilitate repetitive tasks, correct errors and suggest instant solutions, making programming more accessible to everyone.

The problem, according to developer Namanyay Goel, is that the new generation of programmers is being excessively dependent on AI. In his blog, he states that many junior developers do not understand the functioning of the code they produce. They simply ask for answers to AI, without understanding the foundations behind what they are copying and gluing.

Previously, sites like Stack Overflow encouraged learning by requiring programmers to research and analyze several answers before finding an ideal solution. Now AI provides ready answers, which can result in superficial knowledge.

Is the programming losing its essence?

For some experts, the real learning of programming is threatened. “AI offers quick but no context answers,” says Goel. He warns that by depending exclusively on these tools, programmers may lose their ability to solve problems without external aid.

However, others argue that this concern is exaggerated. A developer at the Slashdot Forum points out that the quality of programming education was already a problem before AI. For him, technology only accelerated a process that was already happening: the superficiality in programming learning.

Still, there are ways to circumvent this problem. Experts recommend that programmers use AI as a complementary tool, questioning proposed solutions and exploring alternatives before simply accepting them. The debate in forums and the exchange of knowledge between professionals are also essential to enhance the understanding of the code.

Can AI eliminate the need for programmers?

The rise of AI raises an inevitable question: will the programming be fully automated in the future? For Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the answer is yes. In a recent statement, he stated that "no one will need to learn to program, because I will do it for us."

Other executives, such as Mark Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, agree. It is believed that the AI ​​will soon assume much of the coding tasks, leaving programmers a more strategic role, focused on architecture and software engineering.

This transformation resembles the impact of calculators on mathematics teaching. Today, no one needs to know how to solve complex equations manually, as calculators do it instantly. However, mathematicians still exist - and focus on solving problems that machines still can't.

The same can happen with programming: programmers can specialize in more complex areas, delegating simpler tasks to AI. This would increase productivity and efficiency, allowing professionals to focus on innovations and new technological challenges.

The future of programmers in the world of AI

The advance of artificial intelligence in programming is inevitable, and programmers will need to adapt. In the future, the value of a developer may no longer be in his ability to write code, but in his ability to manage, revise and improve AI -generated solutions.

The question is not whether AI will replace programmers, but how area professionals can evolve along with this technology. Perhaps, in a few decades, programming without the help of AI becomes as rare as resolving complex calculations without a calculator. And those who master this new reality will have a competitive differential in the market.

As in Isaac Asimov's tale, the feeling of power, where humanity forgot how to make calculations without computers, may be that in the future, programmers without becoming a rarity. But is this really a problem? Or just the natural evolution of technology?

                <p>Johnson & Johnson's security team issued an internal alert after detecting a large wild feline, possibly a jaguar near the company's preserved forest area. The animal was caught by security cameras, which led to the immediate adoption of preventive measures to ensure the safety of employees and the activation of environmental agencies for monitoring and eventual capture of the animal.

New safety rules for employees

From this Saturday (15), new guidelines were implemented within the company's campus. Among the main measures adopted are:

Mandatory use of internal transport: Internal buses will be available 24 hours and should be used for any travel within the company area, especially after 18h;

Internal buses will be available 24 hours and should be used for any travel within the company area, especially after 18h; Restricted foot displacement: If necessary, employees should walk only in groups of at least three people;

If necessary, employees should only walk in groups of at least three people; Home Office Recommendation: For those who have the hybrid work option, the orientation is to prioritize the home office temporarily;

For those who have the hybrid work option, the orientation is to prioritize the home office temporarily; Continuous Monitoring: Safety teams have intensified surveillance in the area and will keep up until the situation is solved by the environmental authorities.

History of appearances in the region

This is not the first time a large wild animal has been spotted in the area. In July 2019, a similar warning was issued after reports of the presence of a feline in the region. The place where the animal was seen borders the Ressaca stream, which crosses neighborhoods such as Jardim Pra do Sol, Jardim das Industries and Limoeiro. The preserved forest around the company's campus is a natural habitat for several species, which may explain the recurrence of these appearances.

Johnson & Johnson reaffirms its commitment to the security of its employees and will continue to monitor the situation in cooperation with the responsible authorities.

                <p>A recent study by the University of Bristol in the UK suggests that the fusion of current continents will result in a supercontinent with extreme temperatures. The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that these changes can make vast areas of the planet uninhabited, creating unfavorable conditions for many life forms. Projections point out that mammals, including humans, will have difficulty adapting to the future environment.

What is “Pangea Ultima” and how will it affect the planet?

“Pangea Ultima” is the name given to the supercontinent that, according to scientists, will form in about 250 million years. With the fusion of the terrestrial masses, the planet will face a severe continentality effect, resulting in temperatures that may vary between 40 ° C and 70 ° C. In addition, high carbon dioxide levels will contribute to extreme warming, creating a challenging environment for life.

Another worrying factor is increased volcanic activity. According to the researchers, the release of large amounts of CO₂ can further intensify global warming, aggravating the already hostile scenario and making the earth an increasingly difficult place for species survival.

Will mammals be able to survive?

Historically, mammals have demonstrated a large capacity to adapt to different climates. However, the planned changes will be much more drastic than any event faced so far. With the formation of supercontinent in an already hot and wet tropical region, conditions can become even more adverse, requiring accelerated evolution of species.

Increased solar radiation and the scarcity of water resources may represent insurmountable challenges for many organisms. If scientists' predictions are confirmed, the earth may face a new mass extinction, shaping the future of global biodiversity.

                <p>Meta, a company previously known as Facebook, continues to invest in the advancement of artificial intelligence to improve communication between different languages. Recently, the company has presented new AI models that promise to offer more accurate translations and transcripts in real time, significantly improving global interaction. These improvements are a fundamental step for a more interconnected world, facilitating the exchange of information and making communication more accessible to millions of people.

How do new AI models work?

The new AI models of the goal use advanced machine learning to improve the accuracy of translations and transcripts. They are trained with vast linguistic databases, allowing artificial intelligence to better understand the nuances of different languages. This reduces common errors in automatic translations and increases the fluidity of generated texts.

In addition, the goal has incorporated Natural Language Processing Techniques (PLN), which help AI interpret the context of words, ensuring more coherent translations. This is essential for languages ​​that have idioms or regional variations, where literal translation can distort the meaning of the message.

Another innovative factor is the ability to adapt to AI to style and tone of conversation, making interactions more natural and bringing automatic translation of the level of a native speaker.

Impact on global communication

Goal advances bring significant benefits to global communication. Among the main impacts, stand out:

Interactions without linguistic barriers: People from different parts of the world will be able to communicate more efficiently, enabling a more integrated collaboration in business, academic and social environments;

People from different parts of the world will be able to communicate more efficiently, enabling a more integrated collaboration in business, academic and social environments; Better accessibility: Improved transcription technology benefits mainly people with hearing impairment, allowing easy access to content spoken through real -time subtitles;

Improved transcript technology mainly benefits people with hearing impairment, allowing easy access to content spoken through real -time subtitles; Improving the digital experience: Instant translation tools applied to social networks, video calls and emails can improve the user experience around the world, making the internet a more inclusive and affordable space.

In addition to these benefits, improving the accuracy of translations can directly impact sectors such as education, tourism and international trade, simplifying transactions and allowing companies and consumers to interact without linguistic obstacles.

Challenges to be overcome

Despite the advances, the implementation of these AI models still faces important challenges. One of the main obstacles is to ensure that technology can deal with worldwide linguistic diversity, including dialects and cultural variations within the same language. Some languages ​​have complex grammatical structures and less data available for training, making AI accuracy a greater challenge.

Another relevant factor is the privacy of the data. Audio transcripts and translated texts may contain sensitive information, requiring robust security measures to protect users. The goal is already working on the development of data protection protocols to avoid leaks and ensure that their tools are used ethically and safely.

The future of AI in communication

Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly, and the goal seeks to position itself at the forefront of this development. The tendency is for AI models to become increasingly sophisticated, approaching human fluency in the translation and interpretation of different languages.

In the future, these technologies can be integrated with virtual assistants, smart devices and even real -time applications for face -to -face conversations, allowing fluid communication without the need for intermediaries. This would pave the way for a world where linguistic barriers are practically nonexistent.

With these advances, the goal reinforces its commitment to making technology more accessible and effective, contributing to a more interconnected global environment, where language does not limit communication, but expands it, creating new opportunities and bringing people closer to different cultures.

                <br/>
                <p>A surprising archaeological discovery in White Sands National Park in the United States can change understanding of the first means of transport. Traw marks and human footprints, dating from about 22,000 years ago, suggest that the inhabitants of the time used a rudimentary structure to load cargo - possibly a traval, a type of primitive sled.

If confirmed, this evidence can represent the oldest record ever found of a human transport system, preceding the invention of the wheel by approximately 17,000 years.

O Travois: the possible first means of human transportation

Travois is a simple structure, consisting of two long wooden rods tied in triangular format or “x”, one end dragged by the ground while the other is held by one person or an animal. This method was widely used by indigenous cultures of the great plains of North America, where it was traditionally pulled by dogs or horses.

However, the traces found in White Sands suggest that thousands of years ago the first humans manually carried their heavy loads. The researchers identified three distinct patterns of soil drag brands:

Type I: Deep and narrow groove, occasionally fork;

deep and narrow groove, occasionally forking; Type II: wide and shallow channels, with a more linear trajectory;

wide and shallow channels, with a more linear trajectory; Type III: Two parallel lines, possibly left by a “x” tract.

In addition to the marks on the ground, human footprints of different sizes along the trails were found, indicating that children accompanied adults, possibly helping to transport the loads.

Investigation of the old trails

Before concluding that these marks were caused by a traval, scientists considered other possibilities. Hypotheses were analyzed such as:

Marks left by extinct animals, such as mammoths or giant laziness, dragging their tails or trumples;

Natural wreckage, such as branches and trunks, transported by wind or water;

Trails formed by primitive boats or makeshift sled.

However, the evidence analyzed discarded these explanations. The trails had repetitive and organized patterns, always accompanied by human footprints, reinforcing the theory that the first inhabitants of the Americas already used a rudimentary method to facilitate the transport of heavy objects.

The impact of discovery on the history of transportation

So far, the traditional history of human mobility indicated that the first means of transportation have emerged only with the invention of the wheel, around 5,000 BC.

According to archaeologist Matthew Bennett of the University of Bournemouth, there is evidence that similar traces may exist in other parts of the world, but have not yet been recognized as evidence of primitive transport. If more such records are found, this discovery may profoundly change the understanding of the evolution of human technology.

In addition, this finding reinforces the hypothesis that the first inhabitants of the Americas arrived at the continent long before believed. Recent studies suggest that these peoples may have migrated to the region for over 33,000 years, challenging the conventional theory that occupation would only have occurred after the melting of glaciers, about 15,000 years ago.

Rethinking mobility in prehistory

The discovery of drag brands in New Mexico opens new perspectives on the ingenuity of the early humans. If Travois was really used at that time, it indicates that, long before the invention of the wheel, our ancestors were already innovating to facilitate their daily activities.

In addition to modifying what we know about the evolution of the means of transport, this finding makes us reflect on how many other technological innovations of the past may have been forgotten over time.

Whether due to the need for survival or convenience, the human being has always sought more efficient ways to get around and transport objects - and this search can be much older than we imagine.

                <p>Have you ever imagined what would happen if an object traveling at the speed of light hit the earth? This question was sent by a follower of the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) and answered by Fabrício Kalaki, Master's student in Astronomy by the Postgraduate Program in Physics of the institution. Although, according to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible for an object with mass to reach this speed, the theoretical exercise reveals impressive scenarios. Even traveling to a fraction of this speed, a simple needle could have an unimaginable impact.

The destructive power of a high -speed needle

According to Kalaki, if a 5 gram needle traveled to 99.99% of the speed of light and reached the earth, the energy released would be devastating. The calculation shows that this impact would equivalent to approximately 654 kilotons of TNT, a power about 44,000 times higher than the Hiroshima bomb and 32,000 times more powerful than Nagasaki's.

If the object collided with the ground, the destruction would be immense. The impact would form a deep crater and release a wave of shock with destructive power superior to any detonated atomic bomb. The energy of the collision could cause catastrophic damage in a large region, depending on the place of impact.

Objects that really fall from space

Although the possibility of an object reaches the earth at this speed is only theoretical, celestial bodies come into the atmosphere frequently. However, most of these fragments disintegrate before reaching the ground due to friction with the atmosphere. This phenomenon gives rise to what we know as fantry or meteor stars.

Some of these objects, depending on their inlet angle, may even ricochet in the atmosphere and return to space without causing damage to the earth's surface. Others, larger, may survive reentry and reach the ground, such as meteorites. The impact of these bodies, even at speeds far lower than light, is already able to cause considerable damage.

Hypervelozes impacts and the science behind them

Object collisions at very high speeds are studied by scientists in various areas. An example is ultra-high energy cosmic rays, extremely fast particles that reach Earth from deep space. These rays are investigated to understand their origin and their relationship with cosmic structures such as black holes and quasars.

Another field of study involves the plasma generated by impacts of meteoroids and spatial debris, a little understood phenomenon. To analyze it, scientists perform simulations that help predict emissions caused by these events.

At the University of Kent, the UK, researchers use a high -speed cannon to simulate cosmic collisions in the laboratory. The equipment fires projectiles at extreme speeds to study damage caused and better understand what happens when space bodies collide with planets or satellites.

Want to simulate an impact?

If you are curious about what a real impact on Earth would be, there is a tool called Impact Earth!, Available online. This simulator allows you to test different scenarios of asteroid collisions with our planet, showing the possible consequences in terms of shock waves, craters and global damage.

Although a needle hitting Earth at the speed of light is an impossible scenario according to the laws of physics, studying these impacts helps to better understand the effects of space collisions, and prepare strategies to deal with real threats from the cosmos.

                <p>Spider-Man stories are typically colorful, splashy affairs, especially when translated to live-action or animation. The upcoming Spider-Noir show will continue that trend, it just may also do it without the vibrant palette we’ve become accustomed to.

In a recent interview with ComingSoon, actor Lukas Haas mentioned the series could get two releases, one in color and the other in black-and-white. During shooting, he said, the monitors were in monochrome, which made it “very, very, very authentic. I would actually go and look at the monitor and think I was looking at some older footage, but it was actually just what was on the camera at the time. They did a beautiful job with the filters and all that stuff, making it look like genuine old 1930s, black and white film.”

Spider-Man Noir’s previous onscreen appearances have made him and his universe black-and-white, keeping with the noir vibe that defines the hero. It’d be cool to have that continue in Spider-Noir; the last time Marvel used that stylized look was Werewolf by Night. Outside of that, there’s been Godzilla Minus Color and Hundreds of Beavers in recent years, and that’s just a small handful of examples. Visual flair is still something Marvel shows can struggle with, and this would be as good a time as any to experiment and do something different, especially since this is in its own universe and has a little more freedom.

Whether in color or black-and-white, Spider-Noir will air on MGM+.</p></b>

                <p>In 2019, a group of scientists detected an impressive cosmic phenomenon: an explosion of radio waves so intense that it released an amount of energy equivalent to hundreds of millions of suns. These explosions, called rapid gusts (FRB), last only milliseconds, but carry immense energy. What intrigued the researchers most was that, when they tried to identify the origin of this explosion, they found nothing. Now, years later, the answer was finally revealed.

An explosion of unknown origin

Quick radio gusts are one of the greatest mysteries of modern astronomy. In many cases, they occur in isolation, becoming difficult events to predict and study. Some, however, repeat themselves, allowing scientists to monitor and trace their origin.

The FRB detected in February 2019 was one of those rare events. At first, no galaxy was identified as its source. However, after years of analysis and observations with radiotelescopes, astronomers finally located the point where the gust originated: an extremely distant dwarf galaxy, located at more than half of the observable universe.

The discovery, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters and led by astronomer Danté Hewitt of the University of Amsterdam, revealed that this dwarf galaxy is one of the least massive ever observed by emitting a FRB. This challenges previous theories, which suggested that these explosions were mainly associated with massive and active galaxies in the formation of stars.

The search for the source of the radio gust

Identifying the origin of a FRB is no easy task. Because these gusts are extremely fast, their tracking depends on accurate measurements and long hours of observation with specialized telescopes. In the case of FRB 20190208a, the researchers devoted 65.6 hours of observation between February 2021 and August 2023 to find their source.

At first, scientists were perplexed as they could not identify any host galaxy. However, when analyzing images of the Canarias Gran Telescope, they detected a very distant dwarf galaxy and extremely weak luminosity. This helped explain why his identification was so difficult.

To calculate its distance, scientists analyzed how FRB radio waves dispersed by crossing the space. The data indicated that the explosion had traveled approximately 7 billion years before reaching Earth, making it one of the most distant FRBs ever recorded.

An unusual source and its implications

Scientists have found that the Galaxy of origin of the 20190208a FRB is significantly smaller and less massive than galaxies normally associated with these phenomena. According to Hewitt, this galaxy can be between 10 and 100 times weaker than most galaxies already observed by emitting FRBs, being comparable to the clouds of Magalhães.

Dwarf galaxies usually do not have as many stars as larger galaxies. However, when their most massive stars come to the end of their lives, they do not disappear silently: explode as supernovae, forming highly magnetized neutron stars, known as magnetres. These magnetares are one of the main known sources of FRBs.

The discovery suggests that dwarf galaxies can play a more important role in the formation of these radio gusts than previously thought. This can help scientists better understand how and where these events occur, as well as bringing new information about the composition and evolution of these small galaxies.

Mysteries not yet resolved

Despite the new discoveries, many questions still remain unanswered. Scientists know that magnetres can generate FRBs, but this is not the only possible explanation. There are theories that suggest that black holes or still unknown cosmic phenomena may be involved.

Also, as dwarf galaxies are difficult to detect at large distances, there may be many other similar sources of FRBs that have not yet been identified. This means that the number of explosions of this type in the universe can be much larger than the estimated today.

For more answers, Hewitt and his team say it will be essential to perform new measurements with more advanced radiotlescopes and expand optical observations in search of dwarf galaxies that may be hidden in little exploited regions of the cosmos. However, this is still a great technical and scientific challenge.

A fascinating phenomenon full of secrets

The detection of the 20190208a FRB and the identification of its origin represent a significant advance in the research of rapid gusts. This discovery not only expands our understanding of these cosmic events, but also raises new questions about the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies.

The universe continues to surprise scientists with phenomena that challenge our current explanations. Each new discovery brings us a little closer to understanding the mysteries of the cosmos, but also reminds us that there is still much to be explored and understood.

                <p>Fish is one of the most nutritious and beneficial foods for health. Rich in high quality proteins, essential fatty acids and vitamins, it plays a key role in balanced diet. However, among so many species, there is a highly nutritious fish that is little consumed in Brazil, but widely appreciated in other countries. Find out why it can be an excellent choice for your diet!

BREAK: One of the healthiest fish in the world

Very popular in Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, France, Spain and Greece, the bass is found mainly in the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins. Despite its relevance in international cuisine, this species is not yet widely consumed in Brazil. However, its nutritional properties make it one of the healthiest fish to include in food.

The sea bass is an excellent source of complete protein, containing all the essential amino acids needed for the proper functioning of the body. In addition, it has a lysine, a key component for the maintenance of the musculoskeletal system and for the production of hormones and bodies essential to the body.

Another major differential of sea bass is its high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, known for their benefits to the heart and the immune system. These compounds help regulate blood pressure, reduce inflammation and prevent triglyceride accumulation in the arteries. In addition, omega-3 plays an important role in nervous system health and may help prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson.

Essential nutrients present in the bass

In addition to omega-3 and high biological value proteins, the bass contains other fundamental health nutrients:

Arginine: contributes to the detoxification of the body and assists in the functioning of the immune system;

                <p>1. Delays in getting broadband to the people. Some states are on the 1 yard line. A bunch are on the 5 yard line. More will be getting there every week. These more-sweeping changes will only cause delays. The administration could fix the problems with the program via waiver and avoid slowdowns. Shovels could already be in the ground in three states, and they could be in the ground in half the country by the summer without the proposed changes to project selection.

2. More people will get Starlink/Kuiper, and fewer people will get fiber connection. This could be dramatic, or it could be measured, depending on where the admin sets the threshold limit, and whether states are permitted to award projects above the new threshold on the basis of value per dollar, or if they’re forced to take the cheapest proposal, even if it provides poorer service.

3. The 3 states with approved Final Proposals remain in limbo. They are currently held in NIST review regarding their proposed FPFRs (the budgets accompanying their approved final proposals).

This makes no sense - these states are ready to go, and they got the job done on time, on budget, and have plans that achieve universal coverage. If the administration cares about getting shovels in the ground, states with approved Final Proposals should move forward, ASAP.

4. West Virginia (and soon additional states) who have completed their work, but don’t have approved Final Proposals also remain in limbo. They have a final proposal ready to go that gets exceptional service to all West Virginia homes and businesses. Like the three states with approved Final Proposals, only the current administration stands between them and getting shovels in the ground. If the administration cares about getting things done, they should allow any state that comes forward with a Final Proposal under the old rules in the next couple of months move forward with that plan.

5. No decision has been made about how much of the existing progress the 30 states who are already performing subgrantee selection should be allowed to keep. The administration simply cannot say whether the time, taxpayer funds, and private capital that were spent on those processes will be wasted and how much states will have to re-do.

6. The wireless industry will be, effectively, shut out of the BEAD program. There will be few, if any, locations that are above any new cost limit that will be able to be more cheaply served by fixed wireless than low earth satellites.</p></b>

                <p>A set of iPhone 17 dummies has surfaced, giving us a preview of how ridiculously thin Apple's worst-kept secret, the iPhone 17 Air, looks alongside the iPhone 17 lineup.

Noted tipster Sonny Dickson shared purported images of metal molds for the iPhone 17 series on X over the weekend. These kinds of molds are often provided to third-party casemakers to prepare them for the next year's crop of handsets.

While the iPhone 17 dummy models don't necessarily reveal any new information that hasn't already been leaked, the shots do an excellent job of demonstrating the size difference between the rumored iPhone 17 Air and the rest of Apple's upcoming handsets.

Exactly how thin the iPhone 17 Air will be remains up in the air, though it's rumored to fall somewhere between 4.5mm and 6mm thick at the thinnest point. One thing the dummies appear to back up is the iPhone 17 Air's screen size. Previous rumors suggested the thin frame will support a 6.6-inch OLED display, putting it between the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Here’s your first look at the iPhone 17 dummies, Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/WnOjD71IbaMarch 16, 2025

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman confirmed as much in Sunday's Power On newsletter. Apple thought about bumping the iPhone 17 Air up to 6.9 inches, he said, but “pulled the plug on that over fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending.”

The iPhone 17 Air is set to borrow several design cues from the iPhone 16 Pro phones, he continued, including slimmer bezels, a Dynamic Island cutout, and a Camera Control button. Dickson's dummy photos seem to back up these claims, showing off a cutout for the Camera Control button and a slightly tweaked Dynamic Island, with the front-facing camera on the left side of the pill.

Interestingly, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retain the camera's usual position on the right side, as it's been since the iPhone 14 Pro. Only the iPhone 17 Air is the odd duck out.

                <p>Can reality be more flexible than we imagine?

The universe is composed of energy, vibrations and particles in constant motion. Science has proven that emotions affect the human body, but some researchers believe that this influence goes beyond: our emotions could interact with an invisible field that permeates the entire universe.

Quantum Field theory proposes that reality is not fixed but moldable. According to this idea, everything in the universe is interconnected and human consciousness can play a role in the way matter behaves.

The connection between mind and matter: What do studies say?

In the subatomic world, the laws of classical physics do not seem to apply. Particles may exist in multiple states at the same time, communicate instantly at a distance and even react to simple observation. This quantum unpredictability has led researchers such as Joe Dispenza to explore if the human mind can indeed influence reality.

DISPENZA base your hypothesis on three fundamental scientific concepts:

Neuroplasticity: The brain is moldable and can restructure according to the thoughts and emotions we often experience. This suggests that we can train our mind to react more positively to adverse situations.

Epigenetics: Emotional and environmental factors can activate or disable genes, influencing our health without altering DNA.

Electromagnetic fields: The heart and brain generate electric waves that interact with the environment. Dyspenza argues that these fields can resonate with Quantum Field, modifying not only our biology but also aspects of external reality.

Can our emotions change the physical world?

Although it seems a speculative idea, some experiments suggest that thoughts and emotions may affect the behavior of subatomic particles.

The power of intention: If particles respond to observation, can consciousness influence matter? Some research indicates that mental intent and focus may change quantum patterns, although there is no scientific consensus on this yet.

Visualization and Meditation: Studies show that imagining an active action areas of the brain similar to when this action is actually performed. This suggests that the body reacts to thought as if it were real.

Emotional Resonance: Despenza suggests that emotions such as gratitude and love have a "frequency" capable of attracting favorable circumstances. Still without concrete proof, this theory has been explored in practices such as the Law of Attraction.

Science or speculation? What experts say

Despite the enthusiasm surrounding these ideas, the scientific community requires more evidence to claim that consciousness can modify external reality. While neuroscience proves that emotions influence health and well-being, the hypothesis that thoughts can manipulate the physical world is still controversial.

However, there is a consensus that our emotional states directly affect our biology. Psychoneuroimuneology has already shown that stress weakens the immune system, while meditation and positive thinking can reduce inflammation and improve cardiovascular health.

Are we facing a revolution in understanding reality?

We still cannot say for sure that the mind alters the external world, but science continues to exploit this complex relationship between consciousness and matter. Perhaps the true change is not in modifying the universe around us, but how we perceive and react to it.

The greatest mystery may not be in the cosmos, but within each of us.</p></b>

                <p>This iPhone design could have been a thing of the past.

Apple reportedly introducing a new iPhone variant coming with its upcoming iPhone 17 line. The phone, unofficially called the "iPhone 17 Air," could be the thinnest iPhone Apple created although it might not be as thin as some may had anticipated.

A new report on the iPhone 17 Air claims Apple's attempt to make this phone extra thin led to a radical design idea.

Apple initially wanted to make the iPhone 17 Air completely port-free, according to a report from Bloomberg. The iPhone maker reportedly considered removing the USB-C from the phone, requiring users to charge their phone wireless and sync their data via the cloud.

That plan was scrapped in part due to the concerns of customers being upset with this new design change, which comes as no surprise considering how past changes, such as switching cable connections and removing the headphone port, were met with discontent. Another reason Apple reportedly didn't go with the idea was due to the recent ruling in the EU requiring new iPhones to incorporate a USB-C connection, which is what led to the recent inclusion of the connection with the iPhone 15.

However, if this new thin iPhone becomes a success, Apple will reportedly make another attempt at a port-free phone in the future.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the idea of a port-free design.

How thin will the iPhone 17 Air be?

It's still unknown exactly how thin the iPhone 17 Air will be.

Apple reportedly reduced the thickness of the phone by 2mm. That doesn't seem like a significant amount, but considered the iPhone 16 was 7.8mm, a reduction of that much is a huge design effort.

One social media user known for leaking Apple designs posted dummy models for the upcoming iPhone 17 lineup. Among the models is a thinner iPhone that could be the iPhone 17 Air.

Even with its thin design, Apple is reportedly making the iPhone 17 Air larger in regards to its screen size. The phone would have a screen measuring 6.6 inches, which would be about the same size as the Pro version. The report says there was an initial plan to make the thin iPhone have an even bigger screen at 6.9 inches, closer to the Pro Max sizing, but that idea was ultimately scrapped due to concerns a phone that thin and large possibly bending, which was an issue referred to as "Bendgate" back with the iPhone 6.

While Apple is reportedly making some sacrifices with the iPhone 17 Air—such as including only one rear camera and eliminating the SIM card slot—the phone will still offer battery life comparable to other models. The iPhone Air could be priced at $900, placing it at the same price range as the iPhone Plus, according to the report.

Apple will reportedly implement the technologies developed for the iPhone 17 Air in future devices, most notably the rumored folding iPhone. Apple’s folding phone has been the subject of speculation for years, while other manufacturers like Samsung and Google have already released their own foldable devices in recent years. Apple is expected to unveil its folding iPhone next year, but details on this phone remain scarce.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>You may have seen a video earlier this week of Aloy, protagonist of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise, recreated with generative AI in a leaked Sony test demo. The video spurred a whirlwind of emotions from players and developers, in part because the Aloy bot has a robotic voice found in text-to-speech programs, rather than that of her longtime human voice actor, Ashly Burch.

Despite not having her facial or voice data used for the bot, and Guerrilla telling her ahead of time that this wasn’t for anything actively in development, Burch admitted to feeling “worried about game performance as an art form.” In the video below, she touches on voice actors’ current fight for AI-related rights to voice acting, such as getting to consent to developers using replicas of their performances, and to know what those replicas are being used for.

Sony’s leaked video featured the genAI Aloy answering questions from Sony Interactive’s software engineering director Sharwan Raghiebardajal. Upon booting up Horizon Forbidden West, the replica describes the in-game beasts nearest the player and their ideal weak point. It’s all basic stuff that the player can do just playing Forbidden West, as you can scan beasts to see what they are and their most vital areas, and if you forget, the in-game glossary has you covered.

But the footage comes amid a larger push for generative AI by major publishers, who see the technology as a boon in the development process, from design and art to voice acting. The SAG-AFTRA voice actor strike is close to going on for a full year, and the union recently said major companies like WB Games and Take-Two refuse to budge on using the technology to create voice replicas.

This AI Aloy represents part of those actors’ fears: Sony and Guerrilla own Horizon, so they have the power to do as they wish with Aloy without informing Burch of the specifics, and that could possibly extend to her voice performance. Her greater concern is for actors in less secure positions than hers that could be greatly impacted by this, which she admits “hurts my heart. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors, and I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue doing this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.”

At time of writing, Sony’s yet to comment on the Aloy demo video, or discuss plans to incorporate anything like this tech into its PlayStation products. But the silence itself may speak volumes.</p></b>

                <p>The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP's) national internet censor just announced that all AI-generated content will be required to have labels that are explicitly seen or heard by its audience and embedded in metadata. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) just released the transcript for the media questions and answers (akin to an FAQ) on its Measures for the Identification of Artificial Intelligence Generated and Synthetic Content [machine translated]. We saw the first signs of this policy move last September when the CAC's draft plans emerged.

This regulation takes effect on September 1, 2025, and will compel all service providers (i.e., AI LLMs) to “add explicit labels to generated and synthesized content.” The directive includes all types of data: text, images, videos, audio, and even virtual scenes. Aside from that, it also orders app stores to verify whether the apps they host follow the regulations.

Users will still be able to ask for unlabeled AI-generated content for “social concerns and industrial needs.” However, the generating app must reiterate this requirement to the user and also log the information to make it easier to trace. The responsibility of adding the AI-generated label and metadata falls on the shoulders of this end-user person or entity.

The CAC also outlaws the malicious removal, tampering, forgery, or concealment of these AI labels, including the provision of tools that will help carry out these acts. Although this obviously means that you’re prohibited from deleting the AI label and metadata on AI-generated content, it also prohibits the addition of this identifier for human-created data.

The CCP, through the CAC, aims to control the spread of disinformation and prevent internet users from being confused by AI-generated content via the application of this law. At the moment, we haven’t seen any prescribed punishments for violators, but there is always the threat of legal action from the Chinese government.

This isn’t the first law that attempts to control the development and use of AI technologies, and the EU enacted its Artificial Intelligence Act in 2024. Many may react negatively to this move by the CAC, especially as it’s known for administering the Great Firewall of China to limit and control the internet within China’s borders. Nevertheless, this move will help reduce misinformation from anyone and everyone, especially as AI LLMs become more advanced. By ensuring that artificially generated content is marked clearly, people could more easily determine if they’re looking at or listening to a real event or something conjured by a machine on some server farm.</p></b>

                <p>Today at Amazon, you can pick up the Asus TUF Gaming VG247Q1A gaming monitor for its lowest price to date — at least according to data from price tracker CamelCamelCamel. This well-specified gaming monitor has a recommended price of $159 but it's currently discounted to just $99. So far, an expiration for the deal has not been given, so we're not sure how long it will be available at this rate. This could indicate a new floor for the screen or be part of a temporary offer. Either way, it's an exciting deal that's definitely worth a closer look, especially if you're shopping on a budget.

For a monitor in this price range, you really get quite a few attractions, spec-wise. It's AMD FreeSync Premium certified display, which guarantees things like a high refresh rate, low frame rate compensation (LFC) support, and more. If you want to see how well this monitor stacks up against others on the market today, check out our list of best gaming monitors to see what our favorites are.

Asus TUF Gaming FHD 24-Inch Monitor: now $99 at Amazon (was $159)

This gaming monitor from Asus features a 24-inch VA panel with an FHD resolution. It's AMD FreeSync Premium-certified and has a dense, FHD resolution. You get both DisplayPort and HDMI inputs to take advantage of and have a few options for audio support, as well, thanks to its integrated speakers and 3.5mm audio jack.

The Asus TUF Gaming VG247Q1A monitor sports a 24-inch VA panel. This screen has an FHD resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, paired with a high refresh rate that can reach as high as 165 Hz and a swift response time of just 1ms. In general, these are pretty impressive specs given the $99 price tag — especially with the AMD FreeSync Premium certification in mind.

You can reach a maximum possible brightness of 350 Nits on the TUF Gaming VG247Q1A monitor which, again, isn't too bad for a $99 product. It has two 2W speakers integrated for convenient integrated audio output alongside a 3.5mm audio jack for connecting external audio peripherals. A DisplayPort 1.2 input is provided for video input as well as two HDMI 1.4 ports.

This monitor can be tilt-adjusted, but sadly the stand doesn't offer any way to set the height. It does, however, come with 100 x 100mm VESA wall mounting support so you can attach it to an arm or stand of your preference.</p></b>

                <p>Every year, Marvel tends to have a couple of event miniseries that shake things up for every comics character, or just certain characters within their own corner of the universe. While the heroes are currently dealing with Doctor Doom’s takeover of Earth, some stuff’s about to go down up in the stars, too—and House of X and Ultimate Spider-Man writer Jonathan Hickman is at the helm of this endeavor.

In June, Hickman teams with Federico Vizenti and Iban Coello on Imperial, which centers on the assassination of several galactic leaders, setting off a chain reaction of coups, wars, and changing empires across the universe. Key players of this “sweeping cosmic epic” include Black Panther, several Hulks (including Skaar!), the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Nova, with “groundbreaking developments” (and spiffy new designs) promised for all of them and the cosmic side of the Marvel universe. And in true Hickman fashion, it’ll also pave the way for an “entire new landscape” of Marvel comics set in space, which have sort of fell by the wayside in favor of more earthbound stories.

Talking to Marvel, Hickman said he’s treating Imperial as the cosmic equivalent to what he did with Ultimate Invasion, just more as an actual story rather than a “world building exercise.” As a self-professed fan of Marvel’s galactic cast, he’s “very excited” to establish a new status quo for future creatives to play around with. “The art team is killing it, and we’re all just very excited for what’s happening in this special corner of the Marvel Universe.”

Imperial’s four-part saga begins on June 4.</p></b>

                <p>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

A set of iPhone 17 dummies appeared last night in a new leak from Sonny Dickson, who has a long history of reliably leaking the nonfunctional versions of iPhones that case and accessory makers use to prepare for the next year’s crop of handsets. The images look very much like the renders we’ve seen in recent weeks, down to the phone-spanning camera bump that Apple is expected to add to all but the standard iPhone 17.

Dickson includes shots of the dummies from all sides. The edge-on shots here really do a good job showing how big of a difference there will be between the rumored iPhone 17 Air and the others. The rest of the iPhone line, which I have never thought of as especially thick, looks absolutely beefy by comparison. Take a look:

The dummies appear to back up rumors that the iPhone 17 Air will be a 6.6-inch phone, positioning it in between the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch 16 Pro Max of this year. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reiterates that it’s going to have a 6.6-inch screen in today’s Power On newsletter. Apple had considered making it 6.9 inches, he writes, but “pulled the plug on that over fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending.” He adds that the phone will get slim bezels like 16 Pro phones, a Dynamic Island cutout, and Camera Control button — which Dickson’s dummy photos seem to support.

The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be as thin as 5.5mm, with a single camera on the back like the iPhone 16E. Gurman writes that the phone will get a mix of high-end features, like a 120Hz ProMotion display, and low-end ones, like an Apple A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro. Despite its thinness, he says it will have battery life on par with other iPhones. Finally, he expects the phone will cost “roughly $900,” or about what the iPhone 16 Plus starts at now.</p></b>

                <p>is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

A set of iPhone 17 dummies appeared last night in a new leak from Sonny Dickson, who has a long history of reliably leaking the nonfunctional versions of iPhones that case and accessory makers use to prepare for the next year’s crop of handsets. The images look very much like the renders we’ve seen in recent weeks, down to the phone-spanning camera bump that Apple is expected to add to all but the standard iPhone 17.

Dickson includes shots of the dummies from all sides. The edge-on shots here really do a good job showing how big of a difference there will be between the rumored iPhone 17 Air and the others. The rest of the iPhone line, which I have never thought of as especially thick, looks absolutely beefy by comparison. Take a look:

The dummies appear to back up rumors that the iPhone 17 Air will be a 6.6-inch phone, positioning it in between the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9-inch 16 Pro Max of this year. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reiterates that it’s going to have a 6.6-inch screen in today’s Power On newsletter. Apple had considered making it 6.9 inches, he writes, but “pulled the plug on that over fears that a thin device with a giant screen would be susceptible to bending.” He adds that the phone will get slim bezels like 16 Pro phones, a Dynamic Island cutout, and Camera Control button — which Dickson’s dummy photos seem to support.

The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be as thin as 5.5mm, with a single camera on the back like the iPhone 16E. Gurman writes that the phone will get a mix of high-end features, like a 120Hz ProMotion display, and low-end ones, like an Apple A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro. Despite its thinness, he says it will have battery life on par with other iPhones. Finally, he expects the phone will cost “roughly $900,” or about what the iPhone 16 Plus starts at now.</p></b>

                <p>OpenAI and Elon Musk have agreed to accelerate their legal dispute regarding OpenAI's transition to a for-profit model, according to Reuters. The trial is set for December. A recent court decision denied Musk's attempt to halt this transition but allowed the case to proceed. Meanwhile, the parties have postponed deciding whether the case will be settled by a judge or a jury.

According to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, both parties have chosen to postpone the decision on whether the expedited case will be resolved by a judge or a jury. However, they agreed that the proposed trial is set for December. Earlier this month, the judge rejected Musk's motion to pause OpenAI's structural shift.

Elon Musk initiated legal proceedings to block OpenAI's shift to a for-profit structure last fall accusing the organization of departing from its original mission. OpenAI countered, claiming Musk is trying to hinder its progress to benefit his rival company, xAI. Furthermore, OpenAI argued that Musk had previously supported a for-profit transition for personal financial gain.

Musk cofounded OpenAI in 2015 together with Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and Ilya Sutskever, with the goal of advancing AI for the public good. He left the organization in 2018, citing concerns that a multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft violated OpenAI's nonprofit values by prioritizing profit over public interest. Following OpenAI's 2022 release of ChatGPT and its move toward commercial partnerships, Musk filed a lawsuit in March 2023 to stop the organization's planned restructuring. He later expanded the lawsuit to include Microsoft, accusing it of influencing OpenAI's shift toward profit-driven operations.

OpenAI disputes Musk's claims, arguing that his actions are intended to disrupt its progress for the advantage of xAI, another venture of Musk. In fact, OpenAI presented evidence that in 2017, Jared Birchall, who manages Musk's family office, registered a company intended to be a for-profit version of OpenAI. Documents and text messages show Musk sought a 50-60% equity stake in the entity, claiming it was necessary to help finance an $80 billion Mars colonization project.</p></b>

                <p>Chinese technology giant Baidu released two new artificial intelligence (AI) models that it touted as stronger than those of DeepSeek and OpenAI based on certain benchmarks, as the large language model (LLM) competition continues to heat up.

Baidu made its latest multimodal foundational model Ernie 4.5 and its first multimodal reasoning model Ernie X1 freely available on its website on Sunday.

Ernie 4.5’s multimodal capabilities, which cover images, audio and video, outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4o on several benchmark platforms including CCBench and OCRBench, Baidu said in a statement posted on WeChat. The Ernie 4.5 foundational model’s text capabilities also surpassed that of DeepSeek V3 based on several benchmarks, and roughly matched US firm OpenAI’s GPT-4.5, the company said.

Baidu was the first Chinese Big Tech firm to launch an LLM in China in March 2023 following the frenzy created by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But its early-mover advantage was challenged by China’s other AI players in the last two years. The search giant’s latest move to increase its relevance in China’s AI market came as DeepSeek has fanned an open-source wave, with Alibaba, Tencent and Bytedance galloping ahead in grabbing business and consumer users for their models.

Baidu did not provide benchmark results for its new reasoning model Ernie X1, but said that it “delivers performance on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price”.

Pricing for business access to Ernie X1’s application programming interface (API) is set at 2 yuan (US$0.28) per million token inputs and 8 yuan per million token outputs, the company said.</p></b>

                <p>There are probably a lot of simple tasks you do repeatedly on your phone, like muting it in a meeting, reducing the screen brightness late at night, or turning on the battery saver when you leave for work. If you have a Samsung Galaxy phone, then you have access to a Routines tool that can automate a lot of these for you.

Each Routine comes with a trigger and an action to carry out in response. Triggers cover times, locations, and phone states (like Do Not Disturb and low battery), while the actions cover most of the phone settings (including notifications, display settings, and Bluetooth) and can also launch apps or specific functions (like making your phone vibrate or turning on the flashlight).

There are lots of possibilities here. You can disable notifications while you’re using Samsung Health to exercise, mute your phone when you have a meeting, or bring up the weather forecast when you dismiss your morning alarm. You can also combine multiple triggers and actions, making the feature even more versatile. Routines can be launched manually, as well.

If you want inspiration, Samsung has provided some Routines you can use to get yourself started. From Settings, select Modes and Routines, then open the Discover tab.

If you’ve decided that you’d like to try creating your own, here’s how.

Create new Routines

Left: Each routine has at least one trigger and at least one action. Right: You have a long list of triggers to choose from. Screenshots: Samsung

To create a new Routine, head to Settings on your Galaxy phone and tap on Modes and Routines, then switch to the Routines tab at the bottom.

Tap the + (plus) button in the top right corner.

Tap Add what will trigger this routine to choose your trigger. You can scroll through the options or use the search box at the top to look for something specific.

Set the conditions for the trigger by choosing Add condition . Place , for example, lets you choose the location that acts as the trigger. You can also use this to get more control over the trigger — if you only want it to run when you have wired headphones connected, for instance, or when Wi-Fi is enabled. You can add more than one condition.

Tap Add what this routine will do to pick the action that happens as a result of the trigger. Again, you can search for something specific or scroll through the options.

You can also set the conditions for the action, if required. For example, if your action concerns the Display and you want the action to involve Brightness , you can specify the level of brightness that will be set.

Tap Add action if you want to add more than one action. To change the order that actions are carried out in, tap and hold them to drag them into position.

Tap Save to confirm the Routine.

Give your new routine a name, an icon, and a color to identify it, then tap Done to store it.

When the criteria for a Routine are met, the actions are taken. If the conditions are already met when you save the Routine, then it will immediately start to run.

Managing your routines

Left: You can give your Routine names and icons. Right: Routines can be easily disabled and enabled as needed. Screenshots: Samsung

You can head back to the Modes and Routines screen at any time to view and modify your Routines. They’ll be grouped by ones that are active and ones that aren’t.

If the routine is running, you can cancel or stop it. Tap on Details to see all the settings for that routine. If it’s not running, then just tap on the routine to go to the Details screen.

At the bottom of the screen, you’ll find the Edit and Delete options.

If you tap on the three dots (bottom right), you can duplicate or disable a Routine (which stops it from running but doesn’t delete it). You can also block notifications for a specific Routine so it’ll run quietly in the background.</p></b>

                <p>Atari parts and accessories store Best Electronics stands bravely defiant against the march of time and technology, continuing to serve this increasingly niche retro hardware market 41 years after it was set up. As well as supplying parts, it continues to source and make new parts, provide support, hints, and tips, and claims to have spent $100,000+ in engineering development. In contrast, the iconic and innovative Atari Corp. behind all the firm's home computers, and advanced consoles like the Lynx and Jaguar, went bankrupt in 1996, which is almost 30 years ago.

Many readers, and several writers here on Tom's Hardware, will have grown up with Atari computers and consoles. Thus, it is admirable to see exclusive new and upgraded parts like rubber domes for your ST / STE / Falcon computer keyboard and all Gold PCB boards for your CX series joysticks, plus lots of other parts, continue to be manufactured and supplied to Atari fans. The retailer also stocks "a lifetime supply," of new-old products in some categories. Interestingly, it reveals many of these were warehoused from the "thousands and thousands of pallets of Atari goods," it bought when Atari Sunnyvale was liquidated.

As a previous owner of Atari ST, Falcon, Lynx and Jaguar hardware, looking through these products is like hunting through a treasure trove. Best Electronics says it lists 5,000+ Atari items on its site. However, these are just the most popular items, so if you are after something that appears to be absent from the extensive parts and components lists it is advised to send an email.

Alternatively, you can really go back in retail time by ordering the Best Rev. 10 All Atari catalog. This is a paper catalog of over 220 pages, making it about half an inch thick and 1.4 pounds in weight. Helpfully, the catalog includes 330 pictures of Atari bits, as well as extras like prototype information, repair tips and tricks, a complete list of Atari custom chips and replacement ICs, and more. Check out the two-page sample and more information on the Best Electronics site.

We've covered retro hardware holdouts before, with reports on the surprisingly recent demise of the floppy disk in Japan, German railway systems that still rely on MS-DOS and Windows 3.11, and even the Indiana bakery which still runs Commodore 64-powered cash registers. Nevertheless, Best Electronics dogged and extensive support for Atari fans still impresses.

The last original hardware from Atari Corp. was the Jaguar console, introduced in 1993 and discontinued in 1996. That end date coincides with the filing for bankruptcy by the iconic firm. Sadly, the Atari branded products which arrived after this time were just rehashed and recycled wares designed to milk the firm's classic video games IP with minimal innovation.</p></b>

                <p>Apple’s rumored iPhone 17 Air will be more than just a slim new iPhone. A report says “it’s really a new beginning for the iPhone.”

The super-slender device reportedly will pack cutting-edge technologies not used in other iPhones.

iPhone 17 Air marks a ‘new beginning for the iPhone’

Multiple rumors point to Apple launching an iPhone 17 Air later this year. It will replace the Plus model in the iPhone’s lineup, which has not sold in large numbers. But if you assumed Apple would simply slim down one of its existing iPhones for the iPhone 17 Air, think again.

Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, details Apple’s “herculean effort” behind the upcoming iPhone, codenamed D23.

From the outside, the iPhone 17 Air won’t look much different from the other iPhone 17 models. It seemingly will sport a 6.6-inch 120Hz ProMotion display with narrow bezels, a Dynamic Island and a Camera Control button. Gurman says even the battery life will be “on par with current iPhones.”

Like the non-Pro iPhone 17, the Air supposedly will use an A19 chip. The slim design could come with a compromise: a single 48MP rear camera. Rumors suggest Apple will prioritize slimness over features with the iPhone 17 Air. No wonder the phone could be as slim as the M4 iPad Pro, measuring less than 6 mm thick.

Future iPhones will benefit from the iPhone 17 Air

On the inside, Apple reportedly will make radical changes to create the iPhone 17 Air. This will include redesigning the display and silicon components, using its power-efficient C1 modem, giving up on the SIM card slot entirely outside the United States and other big changes.

At one point, Apple even considered ditching the USB-C port entirely, going all-in on wireless charging, and making a portless iPhone. However, the company decided otherwise, with the European Union’s scrutiny being one of the key reasons.

Many technological breakthroughs that Apple will use in the iPhone 17 Air eventually should make their way to future iPhones. Some of them could show up in the high-end foldable iPhone rumored to launch in 2026.

A telling size comparison

To compare the design of the Air against Apple’s other models coming this autumn, take a look at a set of “dummy” images posted Sunday on X by leaker Sonny Dickson. Note how very slim the Air looks next to any of the other iPhone 17 models.

Here’s your first look at the iPhone 17 dummies, Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/WnOjD71Iba — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) March 16, 2025

It’s quite possible these are accurate, considering Dickson posted images of iPhone 16 series dummies last April that turned out completely on the nose.</p></b>

                <p>A Chinese state report assessing CPU reliability and security has revealed the HiSilicon Kirin X90, a never-before-seen SoC (via Jukanlosreve on X). For context, HiSilicon serves as Huawei's wholly-owned chip subsidiary. The juxtaposition of this SoC with other server processors positions it as the successor of the aging Kunpeng 920 design that launched back in 2019. To clarify, the report does not disclose important details such as the process technology, specifications, or intended use case. However, Huawei has long used the same underlying architectures for both servers and PCs, and the company reportedly has a new line of laptops coming in April that will leverage its own homegrown HarmonyOS.

Kirin SoCs are primarily used in Huawei's mobile devices and have become increasingly vital to China's goal towards semiconductor autarky after the imposition of sanctions. The Kirin 9000S, Kirin 9000S1, and Kirin 9010 are the company's first homegrown offerings built using SMIC's 7nm technology with custom Arm-based Taishan cores. The latest Kirin 9020 that powers Huawei's Mate 70 series is based on Taishan V120, which can match AMD's Zen 3 cores in Geekbench single-core performance.

Conversely, Huawei's server and PC divisions have been relatively quiet, as evidenced by the lack of new Kunpeng SoC designs since 2019. The new Kirin X90, despite its name, could be a possible successor, considering that Huawei is reportedly launching a new "AI PC" with HarmonyOS next month. It's likely to be fabricated using SMIC's 7nm process featuring Taishan V120 cores based on either the Armv8 or Armv9 architectures, which are not subject to the US trade ban.

Hmm? Huawei’s ARM PC chip is called the Kirin X90. It seems different from what you mentioned. @tphuang pic.twitter.com/pDAupx38GqMarch 15, 2025

In contrast to Loongson's MIPS or LoongArch-based chips, Kunpeng cores employ a custom Arm architecture, which should offer relatively broader compatibility. Despite such advantages, inadequate operating system and software support have consistently been the Achilles' heel of these processors. On the mobile side, Huawei's homegrown HarmonyOS platform works relatively well with its Kirin SoCs. With upcoming laptops expected to be based on HarmonyOS, much of these software-related headwinds should be cleared up for the Kirin X90.

Notebooks carry a different software ecosystem than mobile phones, including specialized applications that developers must port. Furthermore, even general mobile applications on HarmonyOS will need a UI (User Interface) rework for optimal laptop integration.

Similar to previous iterations, it's likely that Huawei will carry over the same design to its desktop and server counterparts. On the consumer side, if our speculation holds, Huawei's integration of custom hardware and software is comparable to Apple silicon Macbooks. The performance and reliability, however, remain uncertain. We can expect Huawei to provide details shortly, provided the April launch rumors are valid.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>CoolIT, a company specializing in liquid cooling solutions for data centers, has debuted a new liquid cooling cold plate, advertised to dissipate 4kW of heat, which is four times what Nvidia’s B200 accelerator is rated at. The company claims a doubling of heat dissipation over current industry standards regarding single-phase Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) solutions. This announcement falls right before GTC, where Nvidia is expected to introduce its GB300 Blackwell Ultra offerings and discuss plans for the next-generation Rubin architecture. The timing may be more than a coincidence.

As the name suggests, Direct Liquid Cooling brings the liquid coolant in direct contact with the heat-generating components, such as a CPU or GPU. The single-phase part refers to the state of the coolant; in single-phase, the coolant remains a liquid while in two-phase it changes state by boiling / condensing. In general, this is quite similar to the AIOs (All-In-Ones) and custom liquid cooling loops your PC might have. Both rely on the same principles and fall under the umbrella of the direct-to-chip (D2C) cooling approach.

A cold plate absorbs heat from the processor and transfers it to the coolant in the tubes, which CoolIT mentions is either water or a mixture of water-glycol. In standard testing, at a flow rate of six Liters Per Minute (LPM), CoolIT’s new cold plates reportedly achieved 97% heat removal from a 4,000W Thermal Test Vehicle (TTV) which indicates excellent heat transfer efficiency. The company also claimed a thermal resistance of under 0.009 Celsius/Watt while incurring a full flow loop pressure drop to 8 PSI (Pounds per Square Inch). For a quick understanding of these numbers, a lower thermal resistance value for a given material means it conducts heat more effectively. Similarly, in a closed-loop, a lower pressure drop means the pump doesn’t have to work as hard to circulate the coolant.

Server-grade CPUs such as AMD’s EPYC and Intel’s Xeon can chug up-to 500W of power. While liquid-cooling is deployed with certain high-performance setups, this is a number well within reach of air-cooling solutions. AI accelerators on the contrary, like AMD’s Instinct MI325X and Nvidia’s Blackwell family, are designed with TDPs over 1,000W. Training and running AI is both computationally taxing and power-intensive.

With the manifestation of a practical arms-race between tech-giants across the globe, chipmakers have been pushing the boundaries of technology for higher performance. Sadly, one of those aspects is increased power consumption, and that gets progressively worse as more of these racks are deployed. Consequently, we are witnessing a growing trend towards liquid cooling. Immersion cooling seems like a viable solution, but it limits vertical rack stacking and not every data center is designed with such infrastructure in mind, so for the time being, we’re likely to see D2C solutions increase in adoption.</p></b>

                <p>The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is comfortable, but it's still leaning more toward being flexible for multiple grips rather than perfect for one.

Logitech's G Pro line of lightweight, performance-focused, ambidextrous gaming mice has been popular with professional gamers since it debuted. Naturally, the company decided it was better not to mess with a good thing, and, as a result, the line has stayed pretty consistent — even the most recent Pro X Superlight 2 was practically identical to its predecessor. But now it seems like Logitech is looking to branch out (slightly) by introducing a Pro X Superlight 2 alternative: the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex.

The Logitech Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is everything the Pro X Superlight 2 is, it just... looks different. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex has the same specs as its ambidextrous counterpart: Logitech's Hero 2 optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 44,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 888 IPS and can handle up to 88 G's of acceleration; Lightforce hybrid optical/mechanical switches; and up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. It also weighs the same (60g), has the same rated battery life (95 hours), and comes in the same colorways.

The only real difference is its shape — an asymmetrical, right-handed ergonomic shape with a hump for support and lightly contoured sides for grip. While not the most revolutionary shape for a gaming mouse, it's a huge deviation from the low-profile, uniformly ambidextrous shape that has practically defined the line up until now. It's not surprising, though — the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex looks like it's coming for the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro, which is still one of the best gaming mice on the market thanks to its incredible design.



The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is available now for $159.99.

Design and Comfort of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is a wireless ultra-lightweight gaming mouse with an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape. It's made of solid, lightweight plastic and features a uniformly smooth, matte surface that comes in black, white, or pink. I will say that I am a big fan of Logitech's bright fuchsia take on pink over other gaming companies' fixation on pastel pink, mostly because bright fuchsia is my favorite shade of pink. As far as design goes, the mouse has Logitech G's "G" logo in silver on the palm rest, and the word "SUPERLIGHT" printed in silver on the right side.

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is on the larger side, measuring 4.95 inches (125.8mm) long by 2.67 inches (67.7mm) wide. It has an ergonomic shape, with contouring along the sides and a hump that's shifted toward the center left. The hump is on the higher side, measuring 1.73 inches (43.9mm) at its highest point. It's worth pointing out that these measurements are almost identical to those of the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro (which is clearly what the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is gunning for).

The mouse is easy to hold thanks to its contoured sides — the contouring is more pronounced on the left (thumb) side, but there's still enough of a groove on the right side that the mouse is easy enough to pick up and move quickly. It helps, of course, that the mouse is ultra-light, weighing just 2.12 ounces (60g). It's not the lightest mouse on the market, though it is just a touch lighter than the DeathAdder V3 Pro (2.22oz / 63g).

It's a very comfortable mouse, though the hump's placement did feel particularly pronounced. Its highest point is at the center left, and the slope toward the right side of the mouse is steeper than expected. This wasn't too much of an issue for me — though I never really got used to it — but I can see this being bothersome for someone with smaller hands. The primary mouse buttons have some very subtle contouring to help keep your fingers in place, though they are a bit slippery. Logitech includes grip tape in the box, but I don't usually need grip tape to keep a good grasp on mice — the smooth finish is just a little too far on the slippery side.

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is a fairly straight forward five-button mouse, with right and left primary buttons, two thumb buttons on the left side, and a notched, clickable scroll wheel. All of the buttons are nicely tactile and clicky, and the scroll wheel has a soft, easy notching that's still delineated enough for precise scrolling but not so stiff that it's taxing to scroll through long webpages.

The bottom of the mouse features a power switch and large PTFE mouse skates — a large piece covering the upper third (or so) of the mouse, a piece surrounding the magnetic door that opens to reveal dongle storage, and a small piece surrounding the mouse's sensor. Logitech includes an alternate PTFE-covered door for those who feel like they're not getting enough glide from the strip around the bottom. The magnetic door can also be replaced with the PowerPlay module from Logitech's PowerPlay or PowerPlay 2 for infinite wireless charging.

In the box, the mouse comes with a 6-foot (1.8m) rubber USB-C to USB-A charging cable, a 2.4GHz wireless USB-A dongle and USB extender, custom cut grip tape for the sides and the buttons, and an alternate magnetic door covered in PTFE.

Performance of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex features Logitech's Hero 2 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 44,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 888 IPS, and can handle up to 88 G's of acceleration. It gets a standard 1,000 Hz (1ms) polling rate when connected via cable, and up to an 8,000 Hz (0.25ms) polling rate over 2.4GHz wireless. These are the same specs that this mouse's counterpart, the Pro X Superlight 2, has, thanks to a firmware update — the Pro X Superlight 2 and the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex have the same sensor.

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex will work for all grip types, though you'll need larger hands if you want to use this mouse comfortably with a fingertip grip. This mouse is more ergonomically-designed than the regular Pro X Superlight 2, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's for you — it's a comfortable mouse, but it does have a lot of flare at the tip and the hump didn't sit back far enough for my liking. I didn't hate it, but I didn't take to it anywhere near as naturally as I did to the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro .

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is an excellent gaming mouse for those who don't need extra buttons (you can program the mouse two layers deep with Logitech's "G-Shift" feature, but if you're looking for extra buttons this is not the mouse for you. It's lightweight and easy to grip and pick up, and it glides over just about any surface smoothly thanks to the large PTFE foot on the bottom. It has an extremely low 0.125 ms response time, and even if this doesn't make a significant difference to most gamers, at least this mouse's 2.4GHz wireless connection felt stable and speedy over 1,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, and 8,000 Hz polling rates.

The mouse feature's Logitech's new Lightforce hybrid optical/mechanical switches — the same as you'll find in the Pro X Superlight 2. These switches can operate both optically and mechanically — optical actuation is faster (literally, the speed of light) but drains battery faster, while mechanical actuation (actually, as configured by Logitech — "hybrid") is still fast enough for most gamers and also saves power. The switches are definitely on the loud, clicky side, and have a tactile, if somewhat inconsistent, feel.

Only the primary buttons are loud and clicky, however — the side buttons and scroll wheel click are practically the opposite. The mouse's side buttons are well-placed, though they may be a little out of the way for those with smaller hands, and are slightly mushy. The scroll wheel is notched, with soft, quiet notches. Despite this, scrolling is somewhat loud, as there's a little bit of a rattle when you scroll quickly. This is not my favorite scroll wheel — I didn't encounter any issues with scroll wheel jump in my testing, but the scroll wheel is just loose enough that I'm concerned this could be an issue in the future. The scroll wheel click is also on the stiffer side (though it is, at least, also pretty quiet).

Features and Software of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex can be configured in Logitech's universal peripheral software, G Hub. You can use G Hub to set the mouse's DPI steps and wireless and wired polling rates, and to remap buttons (all five of them). There's also an advanced menu that lets you set DPI separately for x- and y-axis movement, as well as adjust the lift-off distance (low, medium, high).

Image 1 of 2 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Logitech also includes a sensor calibrator that lets you calibrate the mouse to mimic the feel of a different mouse — say, the mouse you had before this one, so you don't need to worry about a significant adjustment period. G Hub also comes with a handful of generic game-ready presets, such as "First Person," "First Person XY Split," "MMORPG," and "Productivity."

Wireless Experience & Battery Life of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex

The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is designed to connect primarily over a low-latency 2.4GHz "Lightspeed" wireless connection — it can also connect via cable (USB-C), but the included cable is clearly designed for charging, not wired use. Like other premium ultra-lightweight wireless gaming mice, the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex doesn't bother with frivolities such as Bluetooth connectivity or RGB lighting (though there is a small indicator LED in the center of the mouse that pulses to indicate things like battery life, charging status, etc).

Logitech rates the battery life of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex at 95 hours over 2.4GHz wireless with a standard 1,000 Hz polling rate; this number drops to around 19 hours, as you might expect, when you bump the polling rate up to 8,000 Hz and turn on the "optical only" switch option. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is compatible with Logitech's PowerPlay system, so if you own the PowerPlay or the PowerPlay 2 , the mouse will have essentially unlimited battery life. The PowerPlay module does add about 3g of weight to the mouse, though.

Bottom Line

The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is an excellent alternative to the regular Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 — it's both lightweight and grippable while adding an ergonomic shape that many users will find more comfortable than the original's ambidextrous shape. Many users, but not all — while it works better than the original does for all grip types, that doesn't make it ideal for every grip type. I generally use a palm grip, and the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex's steeper, more centered hump felt off to me — I couldn't get used to it even after a couple of weeks of testing.</p></b>

                <p>DDR4 vs DDR5

There are currently two standards on the market, and there probably will continue to be for a while as DDR4 phases out. Chances are, if you’re upgrading an older system, you’ll need DDR4 RAM, and if you’re building a new system, you’ll be looking for DDR5. Check your motherboard model to make sure, because they aren’t compatible with each other. You can also check out an in-depth explainer on the differences between DDR4 and DDR5 if you’re curious.

Capacity

Once you know whether you need DDR4 or DDR5, the next major decision is how much memory you want. Unless you really plan on just browsing the web and watching the occasional video, I recommend starting at 32GB. Most memory is sold in kits, so if you want 32GB you’ll typically buy a pair of 16GB sticks, often shown in listings as 2x16GB, and install them according to your motherboard’s instructions for dual channel memory. Some gamers may benefit from 64GB of memory, but anything more would be for special use cases.

Speed

The other number you’re likely to see prominently displayed on memory is clock speed, measured in MHz. DDR5 starts at 3,200MHz, but it seems like most DIY memory falls in the 6,000-6,400MHz range. Some enthusiast RAM goes all the way up to 8,000MHz, but I don’t think the average user will benefit from that much speed.

Notably, if you want to fully utilize your RAM’s stated speed, you’ll need to make sure XMP, or AMD’s EXPO, are enabled in your BIOS. Check your motherboard manual for more information on enabling the feature and setting your MHz properly.

Latency

Performance has another measurable function in the form of CL, or CAS Latency. While the clock speed measures how fast the RAM can move data, the CL denotes how quickly it can access that data, with a lower number meaning faster access. While clock speeds got a huge bump with DDR5, the CL numbers might look high to folks who have experience with DDR4. Just know that the higher clock speeds make up for this difference, so now we’re looking at 28-30 for the first number instead of the 12-16 we had before.

Fit and Compatibility

There are a few considerations you also may want to keep in mind when purchasing memory for your system. Most modules are roughly the same size, but if you have a large CPU cooler you may want to make sure any shrouds on the memory aren’t too tall. Most DIY motherboards don’t have capacity limits for memory that should concern your average PC user, or even gamer, but if you’re upgrading an older system, you’ll want to check the manual and motherboard model to confirm how much storage it can handle.

Know that there are typically two sizes of memory module. You’ll usually find DIMMs in desktop computers, and SO-DIMMs in laptops, but some very small desktop computers may opt for laptop memory.</p></b>

                <p>Wegovy, eat your heart out. In a new research paper, scientists say they’ve discovered a naturally occurring hormone that might help people lose weight while avoiding the side effects commonly associated with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar drugs.

A team of researchers at Stanford Medicine conducted the study, published last week in the journal Nature. With the help of artificial intelligence, the team identified a previously unknown peptide that appeared to safely reduce the appetite and weight of mice and miniature pigs without causing nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. More studies will be needed to verify the molecule’s safety and effectiveness in people, but the findings provide a tantalizing preview into what could be the future of obesity treatment.

The emergence of semaglutide and similar drugs in recent years has been truly revolutionary for the field of obesity medicine. These medications, also used for type 2 diabetes, have proven to be far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone, with results ranging from 15% to 20% lost weight in clinical trials. Semaglutide works by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate our appetite and metabolism, among other functions (some drugs like tirzepatide mimic both GLP-1 and other related hormones).

As groundbreaking as these drugs are, they are known to commonly cause annoying GI symptoms, and may rarely cause more severe complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Scientists have also been working to find and develop newer generation drugs that could provide even greater weight loss or offer other conveniences, such as being available as a pill. In that vein, the Stanford Medicine researchers devised a novel strategy to find their drug candidate.

Many hormones in the body are activated only when their precursors are cleaved by specific enzymes. These precursors are called prohormones, and the family of enzymes that chop them up are called prohormone convertases. The researchers looked at one of these enzymes, prohormone convertase 1/3, which is known to help produce GLP-1. They decided to see if they could find other useful hunger-related hormones naturally produced by the enzyme. To greatly speed up this discovery process, they developed a computer algorithm (nicknamed Peptide Predictor) to narrow the list of potential molecules that fit their criteria.

This screening found an initial batch of 373 prohormones that could yield some 2,700 different peptides (peptides are often the building blocks of larger proteins, but they can have their own distinctive functions in the body). From there, the researchers tested 100 peptides they knew or suspected could affect the brain’s hunger drive (including GLP-1 for comparison). And ultimately, they identified one molecule that appeared to be particularly promising, a 12 amino acid-long peptide called BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP.

The scientists then tested BRP on lab mice and miniature pigs (minipigs are thought to closely resemble people metabolically). They found that a single dose of BRP greatly reduced the appetite of both animals in the short term, sometimes by as much as 50%. And obese mice given BRP significantly lost weight over a two-week span, with most of this weight being stored fat.

Further experiments showed that BRP’s hunger-reducing effects on the brain don’t involve the GLP-1 receptor at all, and it simply didn’t cause the animals to experience the GI symptoms commonly associated with Ozempic-like drugs. The dosed animals also didn’t experience changes to their movement, level of anxious behavior, or water intake, suggesting that BRP can be safely tolerated when taken as a drug.

“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues. That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels.” said study senior researcher Katrin Svensson, an assistant professor of pathology at Stanford, in a statement from the university. “In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”

The team’s findings are, of course, preliminary at this point. It will take plenty more time and research, including early successful clinical trials in humans, before BRP should be seen as the next big thing in obesity treatment. But the team’s discovery is the latest to suggest that semaglutide has truly sparked a sea change in obesity treatment. There are now dozens of experimental drugs in the pipeline that are threatening to rival or even surpass Ozempic/Wegovy, including different formulations of semaglutide. For their part, Svensson and her colleagues have already filed patents on BRP, and she has co-founded a company that she hopes will develop the molecule for clinical use.

No drug comes without side effects, but the future of obesity treatment could someday involve a lot less nausea.</p></b>

Angry Miao is known for ridiculous, over-the-top mechanical keyboard designs, but now it’s made a gaming mouse that’s, you guessed it: ridiculous and over-the-top. It’s also cool as all hell, starts at $125 on a Kickstarter preorder special ending March 17th, and may be my new favorite mouse.

The AM Infinity Mouse has a skeletonized magnesium-alloy shell that weighs just 49 grams, making it one of the lightest full-size mice on the market. Within its hollowed-out, super lightweight black chassis is a magnetic battery that can be popped out and swapped in seconds. A spare is kept charged and at the ready on the mouse’s 2.4GHz receiver. This functionality gives the mouse its name, as Angry Miao claims hot-swapping equals “infinite” battery. Just like how my fridge has infinite ice cubes, obviously.

It’s like an Ariel Atom, but a mouse.

The Infinity Mouse’s more conventional features include an 8,000Hz polling rate for minimal input latency, even with high-refresh monitors. Its PixArt PAW3950 optical sensor is capable of 30,000 DPI so you can make the mouse as ridiculously sensitive as you want. And its new TTC Orange Dot Optical V2 micro switches have a nice tactile click, sensitive enough to confidently register when pressing anywhere on the left and right mouse buttons (even up near the mouse’s center). Its forward and back buttons on the left side are see-through blue in this pre-production model, but Angry Miao says they’ll be black on final units expected to ship in June.

In addition to the 2.4GHz connectivity enabled through its RGB-illuminated dongle / battery charger, the mouse also supports Bluetooth and wired USB-C. (In wired mode without a battery, it’s just 39 grams). Angry Miao claims that when using 8,000Hz polling over 2.4GHz wireless you can get up to 17 hours of continuous use before having to swap its 340mAh battery. That’s ample time for it to recharge on the receiver. And if you bump the mouse down to 1,000Hz the estimated battery life extends to 43 hours.

The wireless receiver puck has RGB lighting that shows charging status once you swap batteries.

I expect the most polarizing aspects of the AM Infinity Mouse to be the aesthetics and the ergonomics of its open design. The open look may not be to everyone’s liking, especially if you don’t want to deal with dust buildup on your mouse’s circuitry. While plenty of other mice have had cutouts for the sake of weight savings, they’re usually much more conservative honeycomb patterns. The Infinity Mouse leaves just the bare-minimum of metal. Angry Miao claims it pursued this design upon inspiration from the Lotus Evanora concept and late-1970s Lotus Type 79 F1 car, and it does look like a small sampling of automotive art on your desk.

But like a race car, the Infinity Mouse and its massive cutouts may not comfortably accommodate everyone. My average hands feel perfectly fine gripping the Infinity Mouse, but none of my fingers or palm touch points fall directly on an edge. If you have small hands and rest your palm harder on the base of your mouse, you may feel differently about this one’s comfort.

I love this thing. Like Angry Miao’s keyboards, it’s a striking design piece to have on your desk. But unlike its boutique mechs, the Infinity Mouse is priced much more logically. I’m no esports competitor, but I’ve used my share of quality gaming mice from the likes of Logitech, Razer, and SteelSeries — and I regularly use an older Logitech G Pro Wireless.

The Infinity Mouse has great tactile click sounds, it feels snappy and solid, and its movements on a desk mat are nice and smooth. It makes my 80g Logitech feel a little hefty by comparison, and its swappable batteries are a treat. I never have to worry about pulling a cable out to clutter up my desk while the mouse charges.

Previous Next































1 / 17 Here are a whole bunch of macro detail shots of the Infinity Mouse, if you’re like me and like staring at every square inch of this thing.

I know you can free yourself of mouse charging woes with something like a Logitech G Powerplay (of which my mouse is actually compatible). But that Qi-based charging pad alone costs over $100 and still requires a cable stretching across your desk. The Infinity Mouse’s receiver can just discreetly hang out at the perimeter of your desk (even more so if you turn off its RGB lights) and have your fresh charge ready for you in a snap. A mouse that uses AA or AAA batteries is arguably just as hot-swappable as the Infinity Mouse and costs as little as $30. But any old mouse like that is not going to look this cool or feel this smooth. And dealing with disposable batteries is a wasteful nuisance that I personally, strongly dislike.

There’s a lot of marketing hype around high-performance mice being tuned for esports-level performance and giving you a competitive edge. The reality is, most people are not able to take full advantage of a mouse or other peripheral to make much of a difference in their KDR or how often they land the dub. But let’s be honest, it’s fun to pretend our tools enable us to perform our best, even when we know it’s overkill. The Infinity Mouse has those fancy specs like a lot of other mice out there, but it’s also got a truly unique design and some handy functionality benefits.</p></b>

                <p>The dreaded Akira ransomware attack has had another hole blown through its hull. Blogger Tinyhack has discovered a new exploit to brute-force the virus's encryption and has reportedly already used it to restore the data of an attacked company. Akira, a well-known ransomware cyberattack, may now be escapable by affected companies thanks to a GPU-based brute-force counterattack. With an RTX 4090, the Tinyhack found they could crack the encrypted ransomware'd files in seven days, and with 16 GPUs, the process would take just over ten hours.

Akira is a ransomware attack aimed at high-profile targets, first discovered in 2023 and known for ludicrously high ransom requests (sometimes reaching tens of millions of dollars). In 2023, Avast's Threat Research Team found the method Akira used to encrypt victim files, and published a free encryption breaker tool to free computers from the dreaded attack. Akira then patched this high-profile crack, adding some bespoke details to its originally publicly-available encryption methods.

At least one Akira variant uses an encryption method that can be decrypted via the new GPU-based brute-force method over a period of days or weeks. The Akira attack uses the chacha8 and Kcipher2 encryption methods to generate per-file encryption keys, using four distinct timestamps, in nanoseconds, as seeds. These timestamps can be deduced to a tight range of on average 5 million nanoseconds (0.005 seconds), and then precisely found with brute-force, a process which requires the use of top-end GPUs such as Nvidia's RTX 3090 or 4090.

Several things must go right for those hoping to execute the decryption method. Encrypted files must be untouched following the encryption so the timestamp that the file was last accessed can be found and used for the brute-force. Using a NFS (as opposed to files just living on the network's local disks) can also complicate decryption, as server lag will make it more difficult to determine the true timestamps used by the encryption.

Using an RTX 4090, decrypting a single file by running through every possible nanosecond in the average range of 4.5 million nanoseconds, finding the correct four timestamps, and generating the appropriate decryption keys takes around 7 days. Affected organizations are recommended to rent servers through services like runpod or vast.ai, using multiple GPU servers to bring the time down. Tinyhack's client took around 3 weeks to successfully decrypt a full set of VM files.

Ransomware attacks are most often impossible to decrypt without paying ransom, so finding a method to circumvent the attack is a big win for cybersecurity research. While those behind Akira will likely quickly patch this method for future attacks as they did after the Avast decryption release, those already hit by Akira may be able to free infected systems with this method.

Tinyhack's blog post runs through the entire process of discovering the vulnerability and full instructions to decrypt with it, so please head there to get an exhaustive look at brute-forcing a way into Akira. Ransomware has come a long way since its beginnings on a floppy disk sent by mail, and today marks another victory against it.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Quantum computers are no longer just a futuristic concept and today are the subject of intense studies and investments by some of the largest technology companies in the world. Although they are still in early stages, these machines are expected to revolutionize the way data is processed, reaching speeds and unattainable abilities by conventional computers. In addition, they can solve complex mathematical problems and make it accessible a quantum reality that, for now, remains mostly theoretical.

Unlike traditional computers, which operate with bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use cubits, which may exist simultaneously in both states, thanks to the overlap phenomenon. However, this technology faces a major obstacle: cubits are extremely sensitive to the environment and lose data stored in second fractions.

The revolutionary advance of quantum memory

A new study conducted by scientists or Katz and Roy Shaham of the Dr. Ofer Firtenberg group at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences, in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., proposed an innovative solution to significantly prolong data retention in cubits.

Quantum systems have been studied for more than two decades as potential data storage due to a unique feature of electrons and other fundamental particles: their spins. The spin represents the rotation movement of an electron around its axis and can be stable under certain conditions, allowing a direction of rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise. When two atoms collide, their spins can remain unchanged or change direction, thus functioning as a binary information storage system.

To convert atomic memory into quantum memory, scientists used a laser beam containing a single overpowered photon, directed to a sealed glass cell with billions of gaseous atoms. This process changes an electron spin without detected. Subsequently, atoms can be excited so that the inverted spin electron ends a new photon in the same trajectory as the original beam but displaced from its source. This system creates a quantum memory unit with considerably larger durability, albeit limited to some fractions of the second.

A new approach to prolong the lifetime of cubits

Scientists at the Weizmann Institute suggested that the use of an innovative gas combination could dramatically increase the longevity of quantum memory. The system uses two types of gases: an alkaline gas, such as rubidium or potassium, and a rare noble gas, such as helium-3. Alkaline gas receives the information stored in the photons and, through collisions, transfers this data to noble gas.

Although the electrons of rare noble gases do not have spin, their atomic nuclei have and can keep it for much longer periods-potentially months. To recover stored information, alkaline gas is again excited, transferring noble gas data back to photons, which can be read by quantum systems.

In an article published in 2021, researchers from the Firtenberg group demonstrated the bidirectional relationship between photons and atomic nuclei spin. This paved the way for a quantum memory system of greater stability and efficiency.

The challenge of stability and the future of quantum computing

Scientists assess that while the transfer of classical information between alkaline gas electrons and noble gas nuclei is relatively slow, quantum data transmission can be significantly faster. For this, it is necessary to establish an efficient communication channel between a photon, an alkaline gas electron and a core of noble gas, without depending on the specific identity of each atom involved in the process.

In a recent study, the researchers demonstrated an optimized model for this transfer, opening doors for the development of a highly stable quantum memory system. However, the path to the full realization of this technology is still long. Theoretical and experimental studies continue to boost innovation in this field, with the objective of improving communication between quantum computers through photons.

Several research groups follow this line of research, facing the great challenge of keeping cubits stable for longer periods. Despite obstacles, recent advances indicate that quantum computing may be getting closer to a technological revolution that will transform the way we store and process information.

Dr. OFER FIRStenberg's research has the support of the laboratory in memory of Leon and Blacky Broder.

                <p>I’m not here to sell you the idea of laptop stands—see that story here—but if you’re going to drop a small fortune on an iOS device, it deserves a pedestal that complements its sculptural craftsmanship. Apple has surpassed 2.2 billion active devices as of February 2024, so odds are you own at least one. And if Apple made laptop stands, they would look like Rain Design’s.

Apple devices are known for their elegant simplicity, and Rain Design just gets it. All of its stands disappear behind the device that they’re meant to support and don’t drown your workplace in visual clutter. Most of its products hover between $25 and $65 (excluding the $319 iGo monitor stand) and have iOS-esque finishes—silver, gold, space gray, black, midnight blue, and starlight (that champagne hue)—and most are designed with a cable outlet.

Apple carries Twelve South stands, but I prefer Rain Design’s. They slightly less expensive, with a wider variety of styles and colors. And they’re sturdy, so they'll still be holding strong even after you’ve replaced your MacBook with its shinier successor.

Stability You Can Rely On

The mStand is my favorite of the bunch. It’s rock-solid, forged from a solid aluminum plate, and designed with a wide base (7.5 x 10 inches) that makes it one of the most stable stands I’ve tested. I very much appreciate the slot underneath to tuck my external keyboard and mouse when not in use. If you collaborate in-person often, the mStand360 model adds a swivel base. Rain Design makes mStand variations for iPhones and iPads, too.

If you prefer a little more flexibility, the iLevel2 ($65) lets you dial the height from 5.4 to 7.9 inches with a simple front slider. The mTower ($50) is a vertical stand that enables you to stow your Macbook upright, freeing up valuable desk space—ideal if you use an external monitor. And if you’re someone who intended to work at your desk but somehow ended up on the couch after lunch, the iLap ($45)—with its detachable front cushion—is one of the few lap desks that are just as stable for desk work. (The iRest does the same for tablets; all three cushions are removable to fold down and pack.)

Ready for Action

The mBar Pro+ is the best portable stand. The 5.5-inch elevation feels just right for comfortable viewing and typing. When I'm not toting this to a coffee shop, it stays stationed on my already cluttered desk, ready for when I need a second screen.

If you have a tablet, mBar Pro+, which works with most MacBooks, is also compatible with the 9.7-inch iPad, 10.5-inch, and 12.5-inch iPad Pro in horizontal mode. It folds down to just 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs less than a pound; it's compact enough to throw into any tote bag, including my Lululemon Boxy Mini Tote. Plus, it comes with a svelte pouch, like all of the company's portable products. If you prefer lower laptop stands, the foldable mBar pro ($55) and the mBar fixed stand ($25) both raise your MacBook by three inches.

Rain Design isn’t out here trying to reinvent the wheel with flashy features. The company has taken the fundamentals and made them better, offering an assortment of stands that—at the very least—don't buckle under pressure. Essentially, Rain Design delivers what we all desire: unwavering stability, genuine thoughtfulness, and durability that'll outlive your Apple device.</p></b>

Matter Co-Reader . I’ve mentioned Matter here a few times — it’s a really lovely read-later app for Apple devices. This new feature is a very clever use of AI: you select some text, the app will offer up questions you might have about it, and you just tap to learn more. Way more powerful than a dictionary or Wikipedia lookup. I’ve mentioned Matter here a few times — it’s a really lovely read-later app for Apple devices.

Screen share

Tina Nguyen joined The Verge’s politics team a couple of weeks ago, in an extremely chill and normal time to be covering the intersection of technology and politics. She understands the Trump administration, the ways that everything from social media to podcasts have changed the way we interact with our government, and where this is all headed better than just about anybody. She also wrote maybe the funniest piece of restaurant reporting I’ve ever read, about her experience at the Trump Grill.

I asked Tina to share her homescreen with us, and she agreed — she also sent me a picture of her bookshelf, which includes a truly enormous Dunkin’ mug and a WrestleMania chair. It’s all very good. Anyway, here’s Tina’s homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:

The device: I got the iPhone 16 Pro recently, though I’ll admit it was for self-serving reasons... 1) I went on vacation to Big Sky last year with a friend and her photos of us at Yellowstone were WAY better than mine, and 2) I wanted to get the latest phone before tariffs hit. (This trade war is chaotic and I’m not taking risks.)

The wallpaper: Sunrise in the Austrian Alps. I went on a weeklong ski trip to Arlberg in February 2020, and the memory of that vacation sustained me mentally for the next three years, The Giver-style.

The apps: Messages, Signal, Weather, Apple Notes, Reminders, Settings, Photos, Clock, Camera, Lyft, YouTube Music, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Nike Run Club, Google Keep, Apple Fitness, Lime, Uber, Apple Watch, Slack, Elgato Control Center, Calm, Phone, Google Maps, Safari, Gmail.

Lime scooters are endemic in DC, which makes it easy to jet around the two-mile radius of places I visit on a regular basis, but if I have to go somewhere like Union Station (or locations where I have to wear heels), I’ll race Uber and Lyft against each other.

The Control Center app is for me to adjust my Elgato Key Lights at my desk. I initially got them for doing media hits, but it turns out that they make excellent sun lamps, too. (My home office has NO WINDOWS, and I swear to god, they’ve improved my productivity.)

Of course I have the Calm app. Have you seen what I cover for a living?

I also asked Tina to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:

Crowdsourced

Here’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.

“You mention Fantasy Hike sometimes, so you’ve got to try Prado Traveler. It’s an incremental step counter RPG where your daily steps fuel your character to delve dungeons, level up, and get loot. Like an incremental game, you can check in on it here and there without it consuming too much time, but all your progress is tied to your activity. Now I just need to get my friends playing so I can try out the co-op features.” – Emmett

“Playing Arco. Great game — good combat system, good story, deserves a wider audience!” – Ben

“I discovered Organic Maps, a well-made app for OpenStreetMap. It seems to have great data where I live in Central Europe, and it even has public transport routing and opening hours. I try to look into open-source alternatives for US big tech apps, as you can’t predict the future right now.” – Alex

“The Australian TV series Mr Inbetween is having a bit of a renaissance in Australia at the moment. You might like it.” – Bennett

“I’m wondering if I’m in the majority or minority of people that do this: using email notifications for everything I possibly can. All of these different services have their own app and push you to download it so you ‘can stay up to date with notifications’ or ‘pay bills from the app!’ I feel like it’s so much easier for me to manage these types of services by sending all of my notifications to one central location: my email address. Then I’ll just move them to the appropriate folder (label in Gmail) or even use the snooze feature on the email receipt to come one day after the estimated delivery time on my shipments.” – Tony

“The Flipper Zero is a really intriguing multitool that may be useful in the coming end times.” – Scott

“Before seeing Mickey 17, I can recommend the book Mickey7 to anyone that liked anything by Andy Weir (The Martian, Project Hail Mary), Dennis E. Taylor (Bobiverse series), or Martha Wells (Murderbot series). Fun and smart sci-fi that is a joy to read!” – David

“Logseq has replaced all my workflow tools with one succinct journal-based document engine that builds the knowledge graph as I bullet journal. It even has Emacs’ Org mode-style to-do lists and an extensive plugin ecosystem. Also open source!” – James

“Before the holidays, I read this review of Zwo’s Seestar S50 ‘smart telescope.’ That rekindled my longtime (but never acted on) interest in astronomy. I learned that Zwo was coming out with a new, smaller entry-level model, the Seestar S30, so I preordered one in early December. It arrived a couple weeks ago, and I’m just blown away.” – David

Signing off

For the last few weeks, I’ve been running a bunch of experiments on myself to see if I can find relatively easy ways to start using my phone less. (Lots more on this to come.) Everyone has lots of ideas, all the way from “gadgets that force you off your phone” to “just be disciplined, you buffoon.” I don’t love either of those approaches.

So far, the best and most achievable thing I’ve tried is to charge my phone in another room. I set up a little charging station down in my living room, and that’s now where my phone goes before I start getting ready for bed every night. But here’s the thing that really made it stick: I took the charger out of my bedroom. Now, even on nights when I absentmindedly walk upstairs with my phone, I have to go back down and plug it in. That one change has helped me read more before bed, and I’m no longer looking at a screen when I first wake up. I don’t know if any of it has made me a better person or whatever, but it does make my mornings feel a little quieter. And after only a couple of nights, it just felt like routine. Highly recommended.

See you next week!</p></b>

                <p>Imagine hopping onto a large floatie in a lake or pool, and then trying to move. We’ve all been there—without paddling limbs, wind-catching sails, or a propelling engine, you’re stuck. But what if we could make the water itself move you?

An international team of researchers has developed a technique to manipulate water and move floating objects with a level of precision that seems right out of a sci-fi movie. Beyond its inherent cool factor, this research could have practical applications, ranging from molecular experiments to the maneuvering of boats across large bodies of water.

The water manipulation technique is driven by waves. After studying computer simulations, the team used 3D-printed plastic structures to generate different kinds of waves in a water tank. One of the structures was a ring with 24 tubes connected to speakers, which produced low-pitched humming sounds that created ripples in the water within the ring.

By playing with the magnitude and frequency of the waves produced by the structures, the researchers generated intricate patterns across the water’s surface—such as loops and vortices—allowing them to control the movement of floating objects like foam balls, ping pong balls, and grains of rice.

As detailed in a study published in early February in the journal Nature, the researchers used waves to accomplish tricks such as holding the floating objects in place or inducing them to follow circular or spiral paths. They even noted that small external waves did not greatly disturb the pattern and object movement. Overall, the floating objects only ever deviated from their path by less than a fifth of an inch (about 5 millimeters). Despite appearances, the researchers aren’t waterbenders—it’s all grounded in physics.

“Our findings are the first step in exploring how water waves can be shaped to move objects, with many potential applications in the future,” study co-lead Shen Yijie, from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said in a university statement.

Yijie is an optical engineer, and the recent study was inspired by his research on light patterns. He and his colleagues had previously shown that light waves could move tiny particles within light patterns, which led him to wonder if water could behave similarly.

“We’ve shown that water waves can be used to precisely move floating objects as small as rice grains. Future research could study even smaller waves such as those on the scale of cells that are hundreds of times smaller, as well as much larger sea waves that are a thousand times bigger,” Yijie added.

On a molecular scale, this technique could bring particles together without direct manipulation. On a larger scale, we could control the movement of boats across bodies of water, though the researchers admit that the impact of strong natural waves would have to be accounted for. Could this technique also move liquids within water? Similar water manipulation techniques might help clean up floating chemical pollutants. It’s also worth noting, however, that scientists would likely have to use very large wave-generating structures in large bodies of water.

Given the similarities among water waves, light waves, and electron movement, the researchers suggest that water could provide a more accessible way to study some quantum phenomena. If you think that’s wildly futuristic, just wait—future research could even investigate the possibility of using water patterns to store data, according to the statement.

For now, however, the team aims to investigate whether waves can create similar patterns beneath the surface of the water.</p></b>

                <p>If you've invested in a new Samsung Galaxy S25 phone, then you get access to the latest software features from Samsung, courtesy of One UI 7. This is Samsung's take on Android 15, which will slowly be making its way to older Galaxy handsets over the coming months, though there's no exact time frame.

One UI 7 brings with it a new lick of digital paint and a range of small improvements. But two new features stand out: Now Bar and Now Brief. Built with a sprinkling of artificial intelligence (of course), these are the new features you'll want to check out first if you want to make the most of your Galaxy S25.

Customizing the Now Bar

The Now Bar is Samsung's answer to Live Activities on the iPhone: Those panels that pop up and expand onscreen when there's real-time information you need to know about. Think sports scores, or a rapidly approaching Uber, or a timer for a recording you're making—anything where a persistent notification is useful.

Android has long supported persistent notifications that stick at the top of the screen, but the Now Bar makes them more prominent, specifically on the lock screen. Even if your Galaxy S25 is locked, you can keep up with important updates from critical apps: Maybe navigation instructions in Google Maps, for example.

Developers need to build Now Bar support into their apps, so you won't see every app appear right away. Samsung has made sure all of its own apps are Now Bar–ready, including Samsung Health; you can see constantly updated activity stats on the Now Bar widget while you work out, all without having to unlock your phone.

In addition, the Now Bar is the new place for the lock screen audio player widget, which was previously higher up on the screen. If you're listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks then you'll see quick controls here. Any modes or routines you've set on your phone for muting notifications or carrying out automations will appear here too.</p></b>

                <p>Everyone who buys a complicated modern countertop oven is quickly beset with a dilemma: how to clean a toaster oven with nonstick coatings and breakable parts, and lord knows what else. The modern multifeature accessory oven is beset by odd crannies and frangible heating elements. If you convect or air fry a chicken, the grease will fly off in all directions in a fine and oily mist and land, ickily, on the oven walls.

Let all this go unchecked, and your oven will either look bad, smell bad, or both. I test toaster ovens and air fryers for a living, so I've had to clean many variations of oven. And I've made at least one costly mistake along the way, by absent-mindedly thinking it was a good idea to clean grease droppings off a quartz heating element with my thumbnail. (Don't do this. You'll break it, and despair.)

But don't worry. And don't resort to harsh chemicals that'll damage your oven or make your food weird. Here's some step-by-step, practical advice about how to keep your toaster oven clean— and advice on how to clean it when all seems lost.

Clean Often, and Soon

The simplest advice is the one that will save you from ever needing more advice in the future: Clean your oven after every meal that contains fat, oil, butter, and/or dairy. Even if it's just a little damp-cloth wipe-down and even if the oven doesn't look dirty. If you don't bake yesterday's grease into the sides of the oven and glass door, you've already won the war of the future. It's like Ender's Game.

Anyway, here's a quick step-by-step for daily cleaning, following the good advice of toaster oven makers Breville, Cuisinart, and Panasonic.

Wait for your oven to cool: Eat your dinner first. Was it good? That's exciting. Don't try to clean a hot pan and oven; it'll hurt, and there's no reason for it. After dinner, go survey the damage.</p></b>

                <p>Ever since we first heard murmurs of Apple prepping an ultra-slim iPhone, speculations were rife about a fittingly high asking price. But it seems buyers won’t get hit with an absurd “innovation tax” for the iPhone 17 Air model later this year.

According to Bloomberg, the upcoming phone might be priced at “roughly $900.” To put that into perspective, that’s the same asking price as the iPhone 16 Plus. To recall, the iPhone 17 Air is expected to replace the “Plus” model in Apple’s line-up later this year.

A few pleasant surprises

The package, however, is going to be a mixed bag of surprises. For example, the slim phone is expected to offer a 6.6-inch display, but it will borrow the ProMotion display tech from the pricier Pro models. So far, the high refresh rate perk has been exclusive to Apple’s flagship iPhones and iPads.

Moreover, despite its slim chassis, the iPhone 17 Air will retain the Camera Control button. The biggest surprise, however, is going to be the battery life. As per Bloomberg’s report, despite packing a slimmer battery pack, it will offer a per-charge mileage that is “on par with current iPhones.”

Of course, a few sacrifices had to be made in order to achieve the slim profile. The most prominent one is the watered-down camera hardware. Despite its high asking price, the iPhone 17 Air is said to offer only a single 48-megapixel rear camera. For comparison, that’s the imaging hardware we get on the $599 iPhone 16e, as well.

In the processing department, it will come equipped with the new A19 silicon, while the iPhone 17 Pro models will go with the faster A19 Pro variant. Apple is also skipping the physical SIM tray on this one, going all-in with an eSIM approach.

Finally, the svelte phone will also come fitted with the in-house C1 modem, which made its first appearance inside the iPhone 16e earlier this year. So far, the modem hasn’t raised any performance red flags, but it misses out on a crucial connectivity upgrade.

Unlike the Qualcomm modems, the C1 modem lacks support for the faster mmWave 5G architecture. Apple won’t be the only brand playing the ultra-slim phone game this year.

Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to arrive in the coming months. Tecno’s impressive Spark Slim is also said to be on a 2025 launch trajectory. A handful of Chinese brands are eyeing their own ultra-slim phones this year, as well.</p></b>

                <p>These days, artificial intelligence can generate photorealistic images, write novels, do your homework, and even predict protein structures. New research, however, reveals that it often fails at a very basic task: telling time.

Researchers at Edinburgh University have tested the ability of seven well-known multimodal large language models—the kind of AI that can interpret and generate various kinds of media—to answer time-related questions based on different images of clocks or calendars. Their study, forthcoming in April and currently hosted on the preprint server arXiv, demonstrates that the LLMs has difficulty with these basic tasks.

“The ability to interpret and reason about time from visual inputs is critical for many real-world applications—ranging from event scheduling to autonomous systems,” the researchers wrote in the study. “Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), most work has focused on object detection, image captioning, or scene understanding, leaving temporal inference underexplored.”

The team tested OpenAI’s GPT-4o and GPT-o1; Google DeepMind’s Gemini 2.0; Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet; Meta’s Llama 3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct; Alibaba’s Qwen2-VL7B-Instruct; and ModelBest’s MiniCPM-V-2.6. They fed the models different images of analog clocks—timekeepers with Roman numerals, different dial colors, and even some missing the seconds hand—as well as 10 years of calendar images.

For the clock images, the researchers asked the LLMs, what time is shown on the clock in the given image? For the calendar images, the researchers asked simple questions such as, what day of the week is New Year’s Day? and harder queries including what is the 153rd day of the year?

“Analogue clock reading and calendar comprehension involve intricate cognitive steps: they demand fine-grained visual recognition (e.g., clock-hand position, day-cell layout) and non-trivial numerical reasoning (e.g., calculating day offsets),” the researchers explained.

Overall, the AI systems did not perform well. They read the time on analog clocks correctly less than 25% of the time. They struggled with clocks bearing Roman numerals and stylized hands as much as they did with clocks lacking a seconds hand altogether, indicating that the issue may stem from detecting the hands and interpreting angles on the clock face, according to the researchers.

Google’s Gemini-2.0 scored highest on the team’s clock task, while GPT-o1 was accurate on the calendar task 80% of the time—a far better result than its competitors. But even then, the most successful MLLM on the calendar task still made mistakes about 20% of the time.

“Most people can tell the time and use calendars from an early age. Our findings highlight a significant gap in the ability of AI to carry out what are quite basic skills for people,” Rohit Saxena, a co-author of the study and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said in a university statement. “These shortfalls must be addressed if AI systems are to be successfully integrated into time-sensitive, real-world applications, such as scheduling, automation and assistive technologies.”

So while AI might be able to complete your homework, don’t count on it sticking to any deadlines.</p></b>

                <p>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Sometime in the fall of 2021, Andrew Krapivin, an undergraduate at Rutgers University, encountered a paper that would change his life. At the time, Krapivin didn’t give it much thought. But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (“just for fun,” as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science.

The paper’s title, “Tiny Pointers,” referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer’s memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. However, to achieve that, he needed a better way of organizing the data that the pointers would point to.

He turned to a common approach for storing data known as a hash table. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected—taking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements.

Martín Farach-Colton, a coauthor of the “Tiny Pointers” paper and Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin’s new design. Hash tables are among the most thoroughly studied data structures in all of computer science; the advance sounded too good to be true. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a “Tiny Pointers” coauthor), William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student’s invention. Kuszmaul had a different reaction. “You didn’t just come up with a cool hash table,” he remembers telling Krapivin. “You’ve actually completely wiped out a 40-year-old conjecture!”

Together, Krapivin (now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge), Farach-Colton (now at New York University), and Kuszmaul demonstrated in a January 2025 paper that this new hash table can indeed find elements faster than was considered possible. ln so doing, they had disproved a conjecture long held to be true.</p></b>

We’re a little over 160-days-away from the official iPhone 17 Air announcement, which means lots more leaks and spy shots will be surfacing in the coming months, including this dummy unit comparison. This handset is rumored to measure just 5.5mm to 6mm at its thinnest point, though the camera bump adds significant bulk, bringing the total thickness to around 9.5mm at its thickest.





In this dummy unit comparison, we can see that the front may not look drastically different from other iPhone 17 models, retaining features like Face ID and a Dynamic Island, but there’s speculation it could have a smaller Dynamic Island than its Pro counterparts. The rear camera layout is where it differentiates itself, boasting a single rear camera housed in a wide, rectangular “camera bar” or a Google Pixel-like “visor” design, with the flash positioned separately. It’s expected to feature a 6.6-inch LTPO OLED display, positioning it between the sizes of the standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, while it should be powered by an A19 chip, built on TSMC’s 3-nanometer N3P technology.

                <p>Earth’s hadal zone includes marine regions 19,700 to 36,000 feet (6,000 to 11,000 meters) below sea level. The reference to the Greek god of the underworld, Hades, is not coincidental—these are the deepest regions of our oceans, and one of the least explored areas on Earth. New research sheds light on this dramatic environment and the creatures that call it home despite the extreme conditions.

Researchers used a cutting-edge Chinese submersible called Fendouzhe to plunge over 35,700 feet (10,900 m) below sea level and collect hundreds of biological samples from the hadal zone in the Yap Trench, the Philippine Basin, and the Mariana Trench—the deepest ocean trench on Earth. Of the more than 7,000 microbial species researchers documented in the samples, over 89% were previously unknown. Their study, published March 6 in the journal Cell, highlights surprising diversity in one of our planet’s most extreme environments.

“Extraordinarily high novelty, diversity, and heterogeneity were observed in the hadal microbiome, especially among prokaryotes and viruses, which are impacted by both the broader context of extreme environmental conditions as well as the delicate topography in the hadal zone,” the researchers wrote in the study. Their work is part of the Mariana Trench Environment and Ecology Research (MEER) project, which they claim provides the “first systematic view of the ecosystem in the hadal zone.”

The hadal zone features extreme pressure, near-freezing temperatures, low nutrient levels, and almost complete darkness. Simply put, “extraordinary environmental challenges to life,” according to the researchers. Nevertheless, the hadal samples revealed the presence of 7,564 microbial species, of which 89.4% were documented for the first time. The “remarkable diversity” of the samples was also reflected in the microbes’ genetics, which revealed a broad range of survival strategies.

The paper is one of a trio of MEER studies on hadal zone ecosystems published on the same day. One of the other studies details how amphipods (small shrimp-like creatures) may thrive in the extreme environments of the hadal zone thanks to a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. The other suggests that fish living deeper than 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) below sea level all have a genetic mutation that helps them mitigate the impact of the cold, pressure, and lack of sunlight.

This last study also estimates when certain marine creatures first descended to such depths. For example, the researchers propose that eels colonized the deep seas around 100 million years ago, which allowed them to survive the meteorite impact that almost wiped out the dinosaurs and decimated marine creatures inhabiting shallower waters.

Altogether, the three studies demonstrate the existence of similar adaptive mechanisms between microorganisms and larger creatures living in the hadal zone. “These findings suggest the existence of convergent adaptation strategies to hadal environments that transcend species boundaries and biological domains,” the researchers wrote in a commentary on the trio of studies. In other words, the hadal zone’s extreme environment likely drove unrelated species to develop similar traits.

In addition to the microbes, amphipods, and fish, however, the researchers also encountered human litter: plastic bags, soda cans, beer bottles, and even a laundry basket, according to Science.

“This was deeply shocking to us,” Weishu Zhao, an extremophile microbiologist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author of the microbial study, told Science. While she and her colleagues noted that deep-sea microbes seem capable of processing some human contaminants, that seems like a small consolation in the face of humanity’s footprint reaching the deepest regions of our oceans.

Ultimately, the study provides rare insight into the exceptional diversity of a region once believed to be lifeless—proving that life really does always find a way.</p></b>

The Chinese tech company says its Ernie X1 model delivers performance on par with Deepseek-R1 at 50 percent of the cost, though it hasn't yet published benchmarks or technical details to support these claims.

The company also unveiled Ernie 4.5, a new multimodal base model that processes videos, photos, and text more effectively than its predecessors. According to Baidu, the model shows marked improvements in reducing hallucinations, handling complex reasoning tasks, and writing code. Internal benchmarks suggest it performs better than OpenAI's standard GPT-4o and matches capabilities with the newer GPT-4.5.

Through its Qianfan cloud platform, Baidu has set Ernie 4.5's pricing at $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.20 for output - a fraction of GPT-4.5's rates of $75 per million input tokens and $150 per million output tokens. The company's Ernie X1 model comes in even lower at $0.28 per million input tokens and $1.10 for output - half the API cost of Deepseek-R1, though Deepseek's model is also available as open source.

Beyond enterprise services, Baidu now offers its AI chatbot Ernie Bot at no cost to individual users. The company plans to incorporate both new models into its existing products, including Baidu Search and the Wenxiaoyan app.

Baidu goes open source

Mid-February, Baidu CEO Robin Li announced a major change in direction: the company will make its Ernie 4.5 series open-source starting June 30. Li, who historically supported keeping models closed, said that open source would "spread the technology much faster."

While Baidu hasn't announced open-source plans for X1, such a move appears likely since Deepseek-R1, which Baidu currently uses in some of its products, is already open source.

This development adds to the pressure on Western AI companies that maintain higher pricing for comparable capabilities. The shift began with what's now called the "Deepseek moment" - when, in January 2025, Deepseek demonstrated that it could match the performance of Western AI labs with significantly fewer resources.

Western AI companies have taken notice. Both Anthropic and OpenAI have petitioned the US government to regulate Chinese AI development, citing national security and political concerns. But it's also true that open-source Chinese models could significantly impact these companies' commercial API offerings.

As China's dominant search provider, Baidu aimed to establish itself early in the AI race. The company launched Ernie Bot as China's first ChatGPT alternative in 2023, drawing 70 million users within three months. These new releases suggest Baidu is accelerating development as domestic rival Deepseek gains international recognition.

                <p>Almost all aspects of modern life depend on our internet connection. When my supplier undergoes a breakdown, everything stops: teleworking via VPN, listening to music on Spotify and even the use of connected domestic devices. It is a brutal reminder of our dependence on the invisible network that keeps us connected.

A total failure is completely unacceptable. But an unstable connection, with latencies and buffer memory, can be even more frustrating. If you are sure that your signal is strong, but you always encounter problems, the concern may come from the location of your router.

1-Emplaction is essential, but the scope counts

The location is always essential. But the efficiency of your router also depends on the size of your home and the scope of its signal.

A single wireless access point should be enough for most apartments and small houses (140 m² or less). The larger houses on several floors have a different challenge, which can be taken up by opting for a mesh network. The mesh networks consist of a main access point and additional nodes which can be distributed throughout the space to ensure homogeneous coverage.

Long-range routers and Wi-Fi repeaters are also options to optimize the efficiency of your router. However, whatever the number of transmitters you have, the location of your main access point is crucial for its overall performance.

2-a central location is ideal, ideally on a shelf

Common sense suggests placing your router in a central area of ​​your home to obtain a optimally distributed Wi-Fi cover. However, it's not always easy. The technician of your supplier probably installed the router near the place where the signal is sent to your building. If you have the possibility of connecting your modem to a more central part by an ethernet cable, your router could considerably improve the cover throughout your living space.

What we know less is that raising its router increases its scope. Placing it in height makes it possible to minimize signal interference, whether for furniture or people. If you do not have a high shelf (and a wall mounting or the installation of a shelf dedicated to your router is impractical), consider placing it above a chest of drawers or a high cabinet.

A central location guarantees constant speeds and strengthens network safety, as neighbors' routers are less likely to operate the signal.

3-other electronic devices can disrupt the signal

My Spectrum router was initially installed behind my 48 -inch TV. It was ideal for my television, but it posed problems for my office, which is just 5 meters away. By moving it from behind the screen to a small table next door, my computer and my Google Hub devices are now enjoying a stronger and more constant signal.

From all conventional household appliances, the microwave oven represents the greatest risk of electronic interference for your router. This is because the radiation emitted by a microwave emits a signal very close to the frequency band of the router (about 2.4 GHz). Even if I do not expect many people to install a router in their kitchen, the proximity of the microwave is sometimes inevitable in the apartments and houses of the big cities where the space is limited.

As far as possible, avoid the areas where your router could be affected by Wi-Fi devices, even if this implies moving it away from your desktop printer.

Precautions concerning the antennas, if you have them

All Wi-Fi routers are equipped with antennas, whether integrated into the device or external. Articulated antennas can even contribute to more uniform coverage.

Whether your router is equipped with two or eight antennas, you can adjust them to optimize the distribution. Antennas emit signals in all directions, spreading according to a donut-shaped wave perpendicular to the antenna itself. Thus, orient them towards the sky can be more advantageous for a smaller or single-storey house, because the signal is diffused outwards from its vertical position. The same goes for an antenna positioned horizontally, which could better reach the areas located in height or below.

The main thing is to experiment with the orientation of your antenna while keeping in mind these limits of physics.</p></b>

                <p>Good quality sleep is important for everyone. And the more people who struggle with sleep, the more likely they will think about the best bedroom environment. From supplements to establishing a routine before bed, there are many items and advice that will help you sleep. These products can certainly be useful. However, in reality, just changing the bed arrangement may improve your sleep quality.

So I got advice from sleep experts on how to create a bedroom that will give you the best possible sleep. The three people spoke to us: Shahna Robbins (US certified health and wellness coach), Leah Kaylor (sleep psychologist) and Chelsea Roashshuayve (sleep expert and neuroscientist with sleep testing and management platform Wesper).

Placement to promote good sleep

Experts agreed on the optimal bed arrangement for a good night's sleep. This means that the bed should be placed so that your head is facing a sturdy wall in a quiet place.

According to Roashshuaib, this means "a wall that does not share the boundary between other bedrooms and noisy areas of the home." If you live in a busy area or in an urban area, choose a wall that does not face the outside. If all walls are located in a noisy area, it is recommended that the bed be centered in the room.

Kaylor explains that this arrangement will "give you a sense of security and reduce external interference." Also, if the bed frame is too high, too low, noisy or unstable, it can have a negative effect on the quality of your sleep. Of course, it is also important that the mattress and pillows are comfortable. Roash Shuaib also suggests sleeping away from the vents, as sudden temperature changes occur during sleep will make your sleep fragmented and unsettled.

The impact of electronic devices

Experts say electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, tablet devices and laptops should be considered completely removed from the bedroom. "The brain is very skilled in linking the environment and behavior. In other words, how you spend your time in the bedroom affects whether you get a good night's sleep," explains Roashshuaib. Therefore, sleep experts recommend that you refrain from working in bed or relaxing there all day. Because beds should be a place for sleep, and the more you spend other things there, the more your brain can associate the bed as a place other than sleep.

In short, Robbins points out that "bedrooms should be just for two things: sex and sleep." Blue light emitted from screens such as smartphones suppresses melatonin production. Melatonin plays a role in regulating the sleep and wakefulness cycle. "Just being passively exposed to notifications, vibrations and standby lights from the device can increase your awakening level and prevent you from falling asleep or maintaining sleep," Roash Shuaib adds. Robbins says if you need to read before bed or go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you should consider using a red flashlight.</p></b>

                <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu launched two new AI models on Sunday: ERNIE 4.5, a native multimodal model, and ERNIE X1, a deep-thinking reasoning model. The company has also made its AI chatbot, ERNIE Bot, free for individual users earlier than planned.

“As a deep-thinking reasoning model with multimodal capabilities, ERNIE X1 delivers performance on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price. Meanwhile, ERNIE 4.5 is our latest foundation model and new-generation native multimodal model,” the company said in a post on X.

The company said that ERNIE 4.5 improves understanding, generation, reasoning, and memory while reducing hallucinations and enhancing logical reasoning and coding abilities. It is now available via APIs on Baidu AI Cloud’s MaaS platform, Qianfan. ERNIE X1 will also be accessible on the platform soon.

For enterprise users, ERNIE 4.5’s input and output pricing starts at $0.55 per 1 million tokens and $2.20 per 1 million tokens, respectively. ERNIE X1’s pricing starts at $0.28 per 1 million tokens for input and $1.10 per 1 million tokens for output.

Baidu plans to integrate ERNIE 4.5 and ERNIE X1 across its ecosystem, including Baidu Search and the Wenxiaoyan app.

Notably, Baidu was among the first in China to launch a ChatGPT-style chatbot in early 2023, with Ernie 4.0 claiming to rival OpenAI’s GPT-4. However, adoption has lagged due to strong competition, especially from DeepSeek’s R1 model, released last month.

Meanwhile, DeepSeek plans to release its next reasoning model, the DeepSeek R2, ‘as early as possible.’ The company initially planned to release it in early May but is now considering an earlier timeline. The model is said to produce ‘better coding’ and reason in languages beyond English.</p></b>

                <p>A balcony power plant with memory enables the proportion of self -consumption to increase significantly and to use solar power even if the sun no longer shines.

Why the balcony power plants are becoming increasingly popular

The rising electricity prices and the growing awareness of renewable energies have led to more and more households relying on solar energy. While large photovoltaic systems are mostly reserved for homeowners with sufficient roof surface, balcony power plants (also called plug solar systems) offer a compact alternative for tenants and homeowners with a limited space. These systems can be installed directly on the balcony parapet, on the house wall or on the terrace without an electrical engineer and make a direct contribution to reducing electricity costs.

But despite their efficiency, classic balcony power plants have a disadvantage: unused electricity is simply lost because there are no feed -in tariffs in these systems. This is exactly where the storage facility of a Balcon power plant comes in. By combining with a battery system, excess electricity can be stored and used later - for example in the evenings when the sun no longer shines. But the question arises: is a balcony power plant with storage?

A crucial factor for profitability is the self -consumption rate. The more of the electricity generated is used directly in the household, the higher the savings. Since more electricity is often produced during the day than can be used immediately, a memory represents a sensible addition.

"A balcony power plant with memory enables the proportion of self -consumption to increase significantly and to use solar power even if the sun no longer shines."

Important factors before buying a balcony power plant

Before you invest in such a system, you should take different aspects into account. In addition to size and performance, the legal situation also plays a crucial role. In Germany there are clear regulations that regulate the operation of such mini solar systems. If you are unsure whether registration with the network operator is necessary, you can find out this on the basis of a current overview of the legal requirements.

The individual electricity savings and economy can also be calculated in advance. Online tools make it possible to receive a realistic assessment of possible energy production using the location and solar radiation. If you want to know how much solar power can be generated with a specific system, you can check this with a simulated earnings calculator.

In addition, attention should be paid to the technical security of the system. Especially when connecting to the house network, certain standards must be met to ensure safe operation. For this purpose, specialist associations have published special recommendations for electrical installation.

Thanks to modern storage technologies, the use of solar power becomes more flexible. But in addition to the advantages, there are also some challenges that need to be considered before buying.

How does a balcony power plant with memory work?

A balcony power plant with memory works similarly to a conventional photovoltaic system, but on a smaller scale. The solar modules capture solar energy and convert using an inverter in a customary alternating current. The decisive difference to a classic balcony power plant is that the current produced not only consumes immediately, but can also be saved in a battery. This makes it possible to use solar power even if the sun does not shine - for example in the evenings or on cloudy days.

The selection of the right memory is crucial. Various factors play a role, including the capacity of the battery, the loading and discharge power as well as the lifespan of the memory. There are now smart systems that intelligently control self -consumption and ensure that the stored electricity is used as efficiently as possible. In order to find out which storage capacity makes sense for your own household, an individual calculation of needs can help.

What are the advantages of a balcony power plant with memory?

A balcony power plant with memory brings with it a number of advantages that make it an attractive solution for environmentally conscious households:

Higher self -consumption quota: The memory can use more electricity generated instead of flowing into the network unused.

Saving in electricity costs: Less network power cover means lower monthly electricity invoices.

Independence from the energy supplier: The intermediate storage of electricity can be better intercepted by fluctuations in electricity prices.

Environmental friendliness: The consumption of your own solar power reduces CO₂ emissions and protects fossil resources.

Flexibility: Even in households with fluctuating power consumption, the stored energy can be used individually.

A great advantage is also the possibility to optimize your own consumption. Depending on the memory size and consumption behavior, households can significantly increase their electricity aid. In the meantime, there are already many systems that can use a network cover sensor to be able to measure electricity consumption in the household and dinner dynamically. This means that zero feed -up can be realized.

In order to get a better overview of the potential benefit, it is worth simulating the possible savings.

Are there any disadvantages or challenges?

Despite the many advantages, there are also some challenges that should be taken into account before purchasing. One of the biggest hurdles are the acquisition costs. While a simple balcony power plant is already available for a few hundred euros, the costs with an additional memory increase significantly. So the question is whether the investment will pay for itself over the years.

Another point is technical compatibility. Not every memory is compatible with every balcony power plant, and there are differences in efficiency. Before buying, it should therefore be checked whether inverter, solar modules and memory are optimally coordinated. There are also certain electrical safety requirements that must be observed.

In addition, the legal situation for balcony power plants with memory is not always clearly regulated. While normal balcony power plants are relatively uncomplicated up to a certain performance, other regulations apply to storage systems. It is therefore advisable to find out more about the current legal framework before purchasing is made.

Is a balcony power plant with storage financially worthwhile?

The central question for many interested parties remains: Does the investment in a balcony power plant with a memory pay for itself in the long term? The answer depends on several factors, including the acquisition costs, the annual electricity savings and possible funding opportunities.

While a simple balcony power plant without memory is already available for around 600 to 1,000 euros, the costs for a model with memory are usually between 1,500 and 3,000 euros, depending on the capacity and quality of the components used. The investment in a memory is particularly worthwhile if the self -consumption is maximized. Because the more self -generated electricity is used, the less must be obtained from the network - which reduces the electricity costs in the long term.

One decisive factor is the amortization time, i.e. the time required to compensate for the investment costs through the saved electricity costs. A detailed cost-benefit analysis can help to receive a realistic assessment of the savings.

Cost factor balcony power plant without memory balcony power plant with memory acquisition costs approx. 600 - € 1,000 approx. € 1,500 - € 3,000 estimated annual savings 100 - 150 - 250 € Amortization time 2 to 5 years 8 - 12 years of independence from the network slightly higher

Funding programs can also significantly improve the economy of a balcony power plant with memory. In Germany and other European countries, there are government grants and tax breaks for photovoltaic systems and storage solutions. Interested parties should check which funding opportunities exist.

In the current Balcon power plant Storage Test from the EnergieMagazin.com, 10 current systems were checked and compared. The most famous manufacturers currently include anchors, Zendure, Ecoflow, Growatt and Marstek.

When is a balcony power plant with a memory worth?

A balcony power plant with memory can be a sensible investment - but not for every household alike. The decision depends heavily on individual factors such as electricity consumption, acquisition costs and funding opportunities.

Advantages at a glance:

✔ Higher self -consumption rate

✔ Lower electricity costs over the years

✔ More independence from the electricity provider

✔ Environmentally friendly use of renewable energies

Possible disadvantages:

✘ higher acquisition costs

✘ Longer amortization time than with models without storage

✘ technical and legal framework must be observed

If you are unsure whether a memory is the right choice, you can calculate the individual benefit with an online computer. A comparison of different storage systems can also help to make the right decision.

One thing is certain: the future belongs to renewable energies. Whether with or without a memory - balcony power plants offer an efficient way to reduce your own electricity bill and make a contribution to climate protection.</p></b>

                <p>A brand new mint supercomputer for ESA. Space HPC. From today also the European Space Agency, such as its US and Japanese counterparties, can count on a formidable calculation power that will significantly expand its skills in terms of efficiency, speed and sustainability of research, both in the space and monitoring of the environment and extreme events. The ASA supercomputer is called Space HPC, an acronym for High Performance Computing, and a few days ago in Esrin, the Italian headquarters of the Agency, in Frascati, was inaugurated in the presence of the general manager Josef Aschbacher, of the director of the observation program of the Earth Simonetta Cheli, of the president of the Italian Space Agency Teodoro Valente and many of the scientists who have collaborated in the project and conducted Space HPC's first "real" tests.

What is Space HPC, the new ESA supercomputer

We called it confidentially supercomputer, but more technically HPC is a "enhanced calculation system", or "high -performance calculation environment" designed to meet the growing computational needs of the European Space Industry. The scientific programs of ESA and its partners, in fact, provide a huge amount of data, which Space HPC will be able to collect, manage, interpret and put together with a speed and efficiency much higher than it was possible in the past.

One thing that was obviously there was a great need: "A few years ago - said Aschbacher - I visited the NASA Supercomputer in Silicon Valley, and then those of Japan, and I wondered why the ESA and Europe were not equipped with a similar tool, to be put at the service of the community. For some time we had decided to remedy this problem, and today we finally see the result of our efforts concretized. " The HPC, in particular, combines cutting -edge technologies with a sustainable and efficient approach from an energy point of view: it is equipped with about 34 thousand CPUs CPUs and 108 graphic cards, for a total power of 5 petoflops, can count on over 6 storage memory petibobete and 156 ram terabyte and is lithium cooled. It will serve to do many things, as Cheri explains: "The ASA supercomputer will be the central reference point of the Agency for any high -performance calculation need linked to research and development, both for the Directions of ESA and for our industrial partners. The earth's observation program, the largest in the agency, is of course a key actor ".</p></b>

                <p>The price of cocoa has increased dramatically due to climate change. Due to the increases, the next Easter children could receive a smaller egg than usual. Certainly, more salty, at least from an economic point of view. We see.

The food of the gods

The production of cocoa, already considered from ancient times the "food of the gods" is strongly threatened by global warming. And, for the very old market law, if the demand falls and the demand increases, prices are also the prices. In this case in a dizzying way. To reveal the less sweet face of the medal are two relationships, one published by the Central Climate Research Organization and the other by the British NGO Christian Aid. The first explains the consequences of six weeks of high temperatures above the optimal conditions of cocoa growth in four countries, which are however among the major producers of West Africa (and which alone cover about 70% of global production). The second highlights how prices have increased by 400% in recent years, connecting this aspect to drought and strong rainfall in the main producing countries.

Plantations that rot

According to the analysis of the British NGO, the failed crops in Ghana and the Ivory Coast weighed a lot on the sector, where at the moment it is still cultivated over 50% of the cocoa worldwide. It is not the first time that it happens: it is a trend of recent years that, however, does not seem close to reversing.

Already in 2023 an important collapse of the production caused by extreme climatic conditions such as drought, floods and diseases of the plants had occurred, making the cocoa price splash up to 400% more, and reaching $ 12,218 per tonne. On 18 December 2024 a new record was recorded: 12,605 dollars per tonne, with prices that are still very high today, albeit around 9 thousand dollars. To get an idea, until 2023 the price of cocoa stood permanently under 3 thousand dollars the tonne.

The causes, it was said, seem to be in climate change: if we look at the data of the last thirty years, the surgery is recorded in 2023, the year in which the rainfall has been double compared to the norm in the season in western Africa: "The wet conditions have made plants rot due to the disease of the black packet. This was followed by a severe drought in 2024 - read in the Report - the United Nations have declared 2024 in Ghana has hit more than a million people, causing serious losses of crops and record food prices.</p></b>

                <p>The entrepreneur has long been interested in the idea of ​​reaching telepathy with a neural interface. In a long presentation of 2017 in which he outlined the idea behind the newborn Neuralink, he underlined the need to be able to communicate with the thought. In August 2024 Musk then reiterated the ambitions of Neuralink on this front in an episode of the popular Podcast of Lex Fridman. "They could be unlocked new ways of interacting with the computer," Fridman said during the podcast, referring to potential improvements in the speed and precision of the Neuralink device. "And with other human beings - Musk replied - as long as they also have, or want, a neuralink".

The billionaire has also hypothesized that in the future healthy people will also be implanted BCI, which will allow to reach a "symbiosis" with artificial intelligence.

Telecinese and other neuralink plans

Also on March 3, Neuralink has filed a question to record also Telekinesis and Blindsight brands. Since Telecinese is the (theoretical) psychic ability to move objects without physical interactions, the company's request could be interpreted as a reference to a future product capable of controlling robotic arts and other devices. In November 2024, Neuralink announced that he wants to check if paralyzed people are able to use his system to move a robotic arm. In a February post on the corporate blog, the company has declared that a participant in his study, Alex, is now using a BCI to check various devices, including a robotic arm.

Blindsight is instead the name given by Neuralink to another brain system in the development phase, aimed at people who have lost their sight. In September, the company wrote on X that the United States Food and Drug Administration had inserted the device in a category (Breakthrough Device) which allows you to accelerate the evaluation process by the body. The question filed on March 3 speaks of a device "for the restoration of visual perception".</p></b>

                <p>If you have never heard of it, maybe it's time to get to know Lineageos. Smartphone manufacturers offer updates to the operating system only for a limited period of time. In the Android world, for example, they range from a minimum of two years to a maximum of seven. It may therefore happen that suddenly your phone - still fully functional - can no longer go to the latest version of Android or install the latest security patches. It is an annoying experience for those who prefer to continue using their device and instead find themselves forced to replace it.

And it is precisely here that Lineageos comes into play. It is a ROM based on the Open Source version of Android, compatible with most of the devices with OS of the green robot. The installation is not very simple: it is necessary to be familiar with the lines of command and follow the specific indications for your device. But at the end of this procedure you will have a modern operating system capable of shooting on your elderly phone.

Give value to the old smartphones

The fact that we consider smartphones as a disposable assets is a bit bizarre. Try to think of all the efforts that people make to take care of vintage cars and keep them in operation: there is a great passion behind, of course, but also the will to dedicate time to tinker. Normally we give the value of old things, and I would like the old phones to be treated in the same way. The models in circulation for more than ten years maintain a certain power and can still prove to be useful, as long as they are willing to dedicate them the time necessary to guarantee their proper functioning. Installing a personalized operating system is the first step in this direct and Lineageos is an excellent solution.

But the advantages don't end there. By default, Lineageos has no Google software, an aspect that makes it perfect for users attentive to privacy or for those who want to cut all bridges with the US giant. If it is not your case, don't worry: you can add the Play Store during the configuration and install all the Big G apps you want.</p></b>

                <p>is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Virgin Atlantic announced a partnership with California-based Joby Aviation to launch an air taxi service in the UK, becoming the latest airline to bet on a new class of electric aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.

Joby’s all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. The vehicle can take off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shift into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200mph, travel 150 miles on a single battery charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft.

Under the partnership, customers will be able to book a seat in one of Joby’s multi-rotor aircraft through the Virgin Atlantic website and app. The vehicles will be co-branded with Joby and Virgin Atlantic logos. But the UK service will need to wait until Joby has acquired type certification, which means the aircraft meets all the FAA’s design and safety standards, and then launched its US-based service.

Under the partnership, customers will be able to book a seat in one of Joby’s multi-rotor aircraft through the Virgin Atlantic website and app.

Air taxi operators face a number of hurdles before they become a reality, including safety regulations and airport designs. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority has started looking into how airports would need to be reevaluated for air taxi flights, including charging and air space.

Joby and Virgin Atlantic envision 15-minute flights from Manchester Airport to Leeds, or 8-minute journeys from Heathrow Airport to Canary Wharf. Joby is planning a network of landing locations around the UK, and expects to offer prices that are comparable with “existing premium ground ridesharing options at launch.”

Virgin Atlantic isn’t the first airline to team up with Joby. The startup scored a $200 million investment from Delta Air Lines in 2022. (Delta owns a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic.) And last year, Toyota said it would dump $500 million into Joby. However, Virgin Atlantic is not investing in Joby as part of the partnership, the companies said.

Air taxis, sometimes misidentified by the mainstream media as “flying cars,” are essentially helicopters without the noisy, polluting gas motors (though they certainly have their own unique noise profile). In addition to Joby, companies like Archer Aviation, Volocopter, and Beta Technologies have claimed they are on the cusp of launching services that will eventually scale up nationwide. But others have floundered; German company Lilium recently said that two of its subsidiaries were insolvent and could cease operations.

Joby said recently it has made record progress in completing four of the five stages required for commercial passenger service in the US, and expects to carry its first passengers late this year or early next. The company has also recently delivered a second aircraft to the US Air Force as part of a testing partnership.

Joby got a boost recently, when the Federal Aviation Administration published highly anticipated final regulations for eVTOL vehicles that it says will chart the path for the “air travel of the future.” But its unclear whether those rules will go into effect, after the FAA ordered a pause to allow the Trump administration to review them. A long review could stretch Joby’s timeline out beyond the 2025 target date it set for a taxi service launch.</p></b>

                <p>Last week, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple was planning “one of the most dramatic software overhauls” in its history. The company is currently planning a redesign for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 – all in the name of consistency. Gurman even said that this would be the “biggest revamp since iOS 7” for iPhone and iPad, and the “most significant upgrade to the Mac since macOS Big Sur.

Now, Bloomberg reports that Apple executives are “confident” that users will love this visionOS-inspired design.

According to Gurman, the overhauls for iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 go “well beyond a fresh coat of paint,” and will “alter the way people interact with their devices for many years to come.”

The redesigns, which will span across Apple’s biggest platforms, will take inspiration from Apple’s latest platform, visionOS:

The new interfaces will adopt the design principles introduced in visionOS, the software for Apple’s Vision Pro headset. That includes greater transparency and new types of windows and buttons — and that should make all Apple devices feel more consistent and familiar.

Despite being one of the biggest software overhauls in many years, Apple executives reportedly believe that users won’t take issue with it, per Gurman:

Despite the risks involved in major interface changes, top Apple executives say they are confident that users will love the new look and feel. The trick is creating something that appeals both to the hundreds of millions of current users and the new customers that Apple hopes to add in the coming years.

Executives believe these interfaces will be “simpler to user, faster to navigate, and easier to learn.” These new software designs will potentially set the stage for more radical hardware. That includes foldable devices and touchscreen Macs, according to Gurman.

Apple also aims to create consistency between all of its platforms with these new iOS, iPadOS, and macOS designs. It also aims to “adapt to an era adopted by artificial intelligence assistants, rather than people continually dipping in and out of applications.”

What do you think of Apple’s upcoming software updates receiving a full overhaul? Let us know in the comments.

                <p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, iPhone 17 Air will feature a number of features from the iPhone 16 Pro, including Camera Control and ProMotion. Rumors have long suggested that the entire iPhone 17 lineup would feature ProMotion, but it wasn’t quite clear whether or not iPhone 17 Air would feature Camera Control. Despite the thinness though, it now seems likely the phone will feature Camera Control.

Apple had also considered making the iPhone 17 Air its first “port-free” iPhone, and going all in on wireless charging. The company ultimately decided against this.

As previously rumored, Apple is working on a much thinner iPhone for the iPhone 17 lineup. It’s expected to come in at 5.5mm, with a roughly $900 price tag, similar to the iPhone 16 Plus it replaces. It’ll also have a few compromises. It won’t have a second speaker, and it’ll only have a single rear camera, unlike the iPhone 16 Plus it replaces. Nonetheless, it’ll pack a 6.6-inch display.

One area that it won’t compromise in is battery life. Apple didn’t want to compromise in this department, according to Gurman:

Skinnier phones require thinner batteries, and that often mean fewer hours of battery life. Apple didn’t want to compromise here, so it sent engineers back to the drawing board to redesign display and silicon components, as well as software, to make the device more efficient.

Additionally, the iPhone 17 Air will offer the C1 chip, Apple’s first 5G modem. This chip initially debuted in the new iPhone 16e, and will also make its appearance in the iPhone 17 Air. This does mean that the iPhone 17 Air won’t support mmWave, though Apple still totes the iPhone 16e as offering “Superfast 5G cellular.”

This is the second time we’ve heard an analyst suggest a $900 starting price for the iPhone 17 Air. Back in December, The Wall Street Journal also reported such. If this price point holds up, the phone will probably perform particularly well. It’ll certainly be the first iPhone to look truly new in quite some time.

Apple had also considered making the iPhone 17 Air its first iPhone to have no charging port, though the company ultimately decided against this. Apple likely wouldn’t have been able to make this change anyways, due to European regulation.

                <p>According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is potentially working on a third generation Studio Display, codenamed J527. This would be a version ahead of the already rumored second generation Studio Display, which is codenamed J427 – but feature advantages of the third generation display are unknown. It’s also plausible that this isn’t a third-generation monitor at all. Let’s discuss.

Last month, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported that Apple begun development on a new external display, codenamed J427, for release in 2026. This would be a Studio Display successor, rather than a new Pro Display.

However, Apple is also working on an additional monitor, codenamed J527, per Bloomberg:

Now, here’s one twist. I’m told Apple is working on a second new monitor code-named J527. At this point, it seems unlikely that the device would be a subsequent generation, given the amount of time between updates and that we’re still a bit away from the J427.

Gurman suggests that J427 and J527 might end up not being distinct products, and instead Apple is just prototyping with multiple options for a second generation Studio Display. This would make a fair bit of sense, given the fact that it’s been over 3 years since the first generation Studio Display debuted, and there’s still over a year before the rumored second generation model will launch.

Additionally, Gurman speculates that J527 could end up being a “second model with a different screen size or set of specifications,” and mentions the fact that Apple’s Pro Display XDR is nearing 6 years old.

All in all, it isn’t necessarily clear what this J527 rumor means. Could it be a third generation Studio Display? Studio Display Pro? Pro Display XDR 2? Who knows. The “27” number in the codename would heavily suggest that this will have a 27″ display size, at least.

                <p>Apple is rumored to be planning a second-generation Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting for release later this year, or early next year. That monitor is codenamed J427 within Apple, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman.



In his Power On newsletter today, Gurman said that Apple seemingly has even bigger plans in regards to external displays.

Specifically, he said that Apple is working on an additional monitor, codenamed J527.

However, he is not sure what this additional monitor will end up being, so it is a mystery for now. He speculated that Apple could be developing two different second-generation Studio Display models, and will eventually choose which one to launch. Alternatively, he guessed that the J527 model could be a second-generation Pro Display XDR.

The current Pro Display XDR launched in 2019, and the Studio Display followed in 2022.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today shared some new details about the rumored iPhone 17 Air.



In his Power On newsletter, Gurman said he was told that the device may start at roughly $899 in the U.S., which means that it would occupy the same price point as the iPhone 16 Plus. This would make sense, as it has been widely rumored that the Air model will take over the Plus model's spot in the iPhone lineup going forward.

Despite its rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will provide battery life that is "on par with current iPhones," although he did not mention any specific models. Presumably, this means that the device's battery life will be equal to the lowest-end iPhone 16 model, at a minimum. That would be surprisingly good.

Gurman said Apple has made hardware and software optimizations to make the iPhone 17 Air more power efficient. There are three rumored features for the iPhone 17 Air that should contribute to the device offering longer battery life than one might have imagined, including a higher-density battery, Apple's power-efficient C1 modem, and the lack of an Ultra Wide camera providing more internal space for a larger battery.

Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with the Camera Control button that debuted on all iPhone 16 models last year. This is the first time that this feature has been rumored for the device. The button provides quick access to the camera and related settings, but some people find it to be a nuisance and disable it.

He also revealed that the iPhone 17 Air's bezels around the screen will apparently be around as thin as the ones on the iPhone 16 Pro models.

A few other iPhone 17 Air specifications that he mentioned had already been rumored previously, including a 6.6-inch display with 120Hz ProMotion support, a Dynamic Island, a standard A19 chip instead of an A19 Pro chip, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, the C1 modem, and the lack of a physical SIM card slot seemingly worldwide.

Unsurprisingly, look for the iPhone 17 Air to launch in September this year.</p></b>

                <p>A new leak has revealed iPhone 17 dummies, giving us a glimpse of Apple’s next lineup. The images, shared by reliable leaker Sonny Dickson, show non-functional models used by case and accessory makers. These dummies match recent renders, confirming major design changes.

New iPhone 17 Leak Shows Major Design Changes

One of the biggest changes is the new camera bump. It stretches across the back of most models, except the standard iPhone 17. The dummies also highlight size differences. The iPhone 17 Air appears much thinner than other models, making them look bulkier in comparison.

The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be just 5.5mm thin. It will have a single rear camera, similar to the iPhone 16E. Apple is mixing premium features with cost-cutting decisions. While it will have a 120Hz ProMotion display, it may use an A19 chip instead of the A19 Pro.

Display Size and Features

According to analyst Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 6.6-inch display. This places it between the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro and the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max. Apple initially considered a 6.9-inch screen but decided against it. The company worried that a large screen on a thin device might bend too easily.

The iPhone 17 Air will also have ultra-thin bezels, similar to the iPhone 16 Pro models. It will include a Dynamic Island cutout and a new Camera Control button. These features aim to improve usability while keeping a sleek look.

Battery and Pricing

Despite its thin design, battery life is expected to match other iPhones. Apple’s advancements in battery efficiency will likely make this possible. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to cost around $900, similar to the iPhone 16 Plus.

Future Innovations: Portless and Foldable iPhones?

If the iPhone 17 Air is successful, Apple may take bigger risks. Gurman suggests Apple is working on a portless iPhone. This idea has been rumored for years. The company is also preparing for a foldable iPhone, possibly launching by 2026. This device would be similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold but with a more refined hinge and a less visible crease.

Conclusion

The iPhone 17 series, especially the iPhone 17 Air, marks a shift in Apple’s design. The focus is on thinness, camera refinements, and future innovations. As more leaks emerge, excitement builds for Apple’s next big release.

With speculation mounting about Apple’s plans for an ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air launching alongside this year’s iPhone 17 lineup, a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims Apple at one point considered removing the charging port entirely—making it the company’s first-ever portless iPhone.

Writing in his weekly Power On newsletter, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will feature the C1 chip, Apple’s first in-house 5G modem. This chip debuted in the iPhone 16e and is also set to power the iPhone 17 Air. However, like the 16e, this means the 17 Air won’t support mmWave 5G, though Apple still markets the 16e as offering “Superfast 5G cellular.”

“Skinnier phones require thinner batteries, and that often means fewer hours of battery life,” Gurman wrote. “Apple didn’t want to compromise here, so it sent engineers back to the drawing board to redesign display and silicon components, as well as software, to make the device more efficient.”

He also suggested that the iPhone 17 Air will foreshadow a shift to slimmer, portless iPhones in the future.

“The iPhone 17 Air represents the beginning of a sea change for Apple,” Gurman wrote. “If this model proves successful, Apple intends to revisit the idea of port-free iPhones and move more models toward this slimmer design.”

iPhone 17 Air: What We Know So Far

Here’s a roundup of the biggest iPhone 17 Air rumors so far:

Ultra-thin design, potentially the thinnest iPhone yet

C1 Apple modem, replacing Qualcomm chips (but no mmWave support)

Redesigned display, silicon, and battery for improved efficiency

Potential removal of the charging port (though not confirmed)

6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion

Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup later this year.</p></b>

                <p>In Brief

Chinese search engine Baidu has launched two new AI models — Ernie 4.5, the latest version of the company’s foundational model first released two years ago, as well as a new reasoning model, Ernie X1.

According to Reuters, Baidu claims that Ernie X1’s performance is “on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price,”, and it touts Ernie 4.5’s “high EQ,” allowing the model to understand memes and satire. Both models have multimodal capabilities, allowing them to process video, images, and audio, as well as text.

While Baidu was one of the first Chinese companies to launch a competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it has reportedly struggled to find widespread adoption. Meanwhile, the aforementioned DeepSeek recently unsettled American AI companies and investors by releasing models that were seemingly just as powerful at a much lower cost.

CNBC previously reported that Baidu plans to release its next generation model, Ernie 5, later this year, with further multimodal improvements.</p></b>

                <p>Baidu Inc. released a new artificial intelligence model that articulates its reasoning, in an apparent bid to regain momentum against up-and-coming rivals like DeepSeek.

The Ernie X1 model by China’s internet search leader works similarly to DeepSeek R1 — which shocked Silicon Valley by offering comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at a fraction of their development cost. Baidu’s reasoning model excels in areas like daily dialogs, complex calculations and logical deduction, it said in a statement Sunday.</p></b>

                <p>No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared.

During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups.

The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.)

In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds.

Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.”

Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round.



The billion-dollar-round club

OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion.

xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later.

Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.

Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion.

The many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club

Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia.

Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion.

Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June.

Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs.

Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.

Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data.

Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.

CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis.

Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued TogetherAi at $3.3 billion, and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.

Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion.

Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.

Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.

Deals of over a $100 million

Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.

Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.

Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation.

Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.

Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce.

Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup.

Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round.

Editor’s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.</p></b>

                <br/>
                <p>In a world filled with “vibe coding,” Zach Yadegari, teen founder of Cal AI, stands in ironic, old-fashioned contrast.

Ironic because Yadegari and his co-founder, Henry Langmack, are both just 18 years old and recently graduated from high school. Yet their story, so far, is a classic.

Launched in May, Cal AI has generated over 5 million downloads in eight months, Yadegari says. Better still, he tells TechCrunch that the customer retention rate is over 30% and that the app generated over $2 million in revenue last month.

Although TechCrunch couldn’t validate his download and revenue claims, Cal AI does have a 4.8-star rating on the Apple App Store, with 66,000 reviews, and over 1 million downloads on Google Play with a 4.8-star rating on nearly 75,000 reviews.

The concept is simple: Take a picture of the food you are about to consume, and let the app log calories and macros for you.

It’s not a unique idea. For instance, the big dog in calorie counting, MyFitnessPal, has its Meal Scan feature. Then there are apps like SnapCalorie, which was released in 2023 and created by the founder of Google Lens.

Cal AI’s advantage, perhaps, is that it was built wholly in the age of large image models. It uses models from Anthropic and OpenAI and RAG to improve accuracy and is trained on open source food calorie and image databases from sites like GitHub.

“We have found that different models are better with different foods,” Yadegari tells TechCrunch.

Along the way, the founders coded through technical problems like recognizing ingredients from food packages or in jumbled bowls.

The result is an app that the creators say is 90% accurate, which appears to be good enough for many dieters.

Teen coders and a hacker house

Yadegari is also earning some fame for his early success. But, unlike teen coders growing up with AI copilots, he was mastering Python and C# in middle school, he said.

Yadegari built his first business in the ninth grade and sold it for $100,000 to another game company, FreezeNova, when he was 16, he tells TechCrunch. “After quarantine, schools gave out Chromebooks to all of their students, and unsurprisingly, kids tried to abuse this by playing games in school,” he said.

The school responded by blocking web access to those game sites. So he “saw an opportunity” to build a website that gave access to all unblocked games.

The best part? He called the website “Totally Science” so the school wouldn’t block it, too.

With that sale, he and Langmack watched Y Combinator videos and socialized with the coder crowd on X looking for a new idea. He met Blake Anderson on X, who also became a Cal AI co-founder. Anderson, now 24, had earned notice as a young consumer app coder, too, for creating ChatGPT dating advice apps like RizzGPT and Umax.

Yadegari and Langmack had their idea after Yadegari began hitting the gym to gain weight and “impress girls,” he said, smiling.

Then they made another cliché choice: They moved to San Francisco to live in a hacker house while building their prototype.

But while there, Yadegari, the son of two lawyers, learned a contrarian lesson. He discovered he wanted to go to college and not become a classic Silicon Valley dropout type.

“Twenty-four-seven grinding, sleeping on the floor, actually, one of the nights, and it was a very fun time, and it taught me a lot,” he said of the experience.

But he looked around. “We were surrounded by people that were in their late 20s or 30s all day. And I realized that if I didn’t go to college, this is what life would be like.”

While he hasn’t yet determined which university he’ll attend, he and Langmack are still having fun running their company. It now includes another co-founder, Jake Castillo, 28 who is COO and running influencer marketing, as well as eight full-time employees between developers, a designer, and social media managers.</p></b>

                <p>Smartphone shooter games and nuclear power plants, local government offices in China. What do these have in common? This is an example of how DeepSeek's AI model, the R1, has been incorporated into its business over the past two months and is trying to ride the wave of progress made by its own tech companies.

Since causing a global whirlwind, DeepSeek has continued to dominate China's domestic news. However, most of this is not news about the company itself. Instead, companies in almost every industry are competing to announce that they have set a path to adopt DeepSeek's open source model into their company's business strategy. Some companies have found the true use of domestically produced, affordable, cutting-edge AI models, while others simply do so to aim for advertising or show off their country's pride.

Local reports have shown in recent weeks that over 20 Chinese automakers (and at least one bus manufacturer) have announced that DeepSeek chatbots will be installed in their cars. Additionally, more than 30 medical and pharmaceutical companies across China use DeepSeek for clinical diagnosis and research. It also revealed that dozens of domestic banks, insurance companies and securities companies are using DeepSeek to handle tasks such as training for customer service personnel and designing investment strategies.

This enthusiasm is similar to when ChatGPT appeared in the second half of 2022, when US and European companies all appealed to customers and investors that they were working on cutting-edge AI innovation. Over the next two years, major Chinese AI companies like Baidu and Alibaba have also released a number of impressive AI models, but have not attracted the attention of DeepSeek. DeepSeek has wowed the whole world. This is because the startup has released the AI ​​model, claiming that it built the AI ​​model with far fewer computing resources than the comparable models released by major companies.

The reality of the introduction of DeepSeek

As of March 11, nearly 5,000 questions about DeepSeek were recorded on the platform of China's online stock exchanges, where individual investors can ask publicly listed companies. Most of the questions asked if a particular company is considering using DeepSeek for its products or is currently using it. In response, hundreds of companies responded that they were hiring the company, and in some cases this led to a temporary rise in stock prices. However, once investors realized that some companies were simply saying they were experimenting with DeepSeek's apps within the company, their value had fallen sharply once more.

Some of the DeepSeek-related announcements make perfect sense. Cloud computing companies have announced that they will be offering DeepSeek's R1 to their customers, and domestic AI chip manufacturers have optimised their products to run DeepSeek's models.

However, many companies are trying to take advantage of the popularity. It is unclear what benefits these companies will actually benefit from DeepSeek's AI. For example, German computer accessories manufacturer Cherry has launched the AI ​​mouse in China. This means that you can have instant voice conversations with DeepSeek's chatbots by simply bringing them close to your mouth and pressing a button.</p></b>
