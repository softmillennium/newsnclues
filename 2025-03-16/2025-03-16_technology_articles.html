PHOENIX — The Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine (SWSIE), a multi-institutional tech group spearheaded by Arizona State University, announced Wednesday it has invested $1.5 million into eight startup companies in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.

SWSIE was launched in 2024 as one of the first 10 tech groups under the umbrella of National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Engines. It specifically received its own startup funding of $15 million to research and execute solutions for water scarcity and equitable energy access in extreme desert conditions.

The eight startup companies being doled out funding are being supported in the commercialization process of their “proven model or prototype,” according to a press release. Models or prototypes awarded funding deal with finding industry solutions for semiconductor manufacturing, solar power, mining, atmospheric water harvesting and other environmental issues.

SWSIE processed more than 220 grant applications from 16 states before ultimately narrowing down their selections.

“These startups emerged from a competitive selection process due to the promise of their technologies, which stand to advance new industries and future-proof existing ones,” SWSIE CEO Brian Sherman said in the release.

Sherman added SWSIE's funding is just beginning, as this will be the first of “many funding cycles” while the innovation group continues to grow itself.

A few solutions SWSIE is actively working on in the Valley are saving water needed for semiconductor manufacturing (it is estimated to use eight million gallons daily by 2030), expanding the capacity of silicon-based solar cells and recuperating carbon emissions into fuel and “other sustainable carbon products.”

In addition to receiving funding for prototypes, the eight startups will have the opportunity to introduce their businesses to investors at SWSIE's Innovation Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 21-22.

“The overwhelming response to this funding opportunity underscores the dire need for investment in technologies at this stage, as well as the broad interest in new solutions for critical resource management,” SWSIE chief innovation officer Katie Pettinger said in the release.

In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it can be a daunting task to keep up with all the important news. To make it easier for readers, we've put together the Weekly Tech Recap, where we take a look at the top news stories making waves in the tech world. This week, Google confirmed that its Google Assistant will soon be retiring, Samsung began rolling out the One UI 7 beta update, and more.



Google has officially confirmed that its classic Google Assistant will be retiring later this year, and Gemini will take up the mantle of default assistant app on Android. In a blog post about the big change, Google said that the classic Google Assisstant will no longer be available on most Android devices or for new downloads.

The company also confirmed that tablets, cars and other devices that connect to the phone, such as headphones and watches, will also be upgraded to Gemini. The tech giant also confirmed that it will be bringing Gemini to other home devices such as speakers, displays and TVs.

Samsung has begun rolling out the Android 15-based One UI 7.0 beta update for its Galaxy S23 series in select regions, including India, the United States, and South Korea. The update, which was previously restricted to the Galaxy S24 series, is now available for users of the Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23+, and Galaxy S23 Ultra who wish to test Samsung's latest custom interface ahead of its official release.

As per user reports on Samsung's community forums, the beta update is currently available only for unlocked models. In India, the Galaxy S23 is receiving the update with firmware version S918BXXU8ZYC3, while the Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 Ultra are receiving firmware versions S918BOXM8ZYC3 and S918BXXU8DYC3, respectively. The update also includes the March 2025 security patch, ensuring the latest security enhancements.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has introduced Copilot for Gaming, an AI assistant aimed at improving the gaming experience. Announcing the feature on social media platform X, Nadella said, “With Copilot for Gaming, you can jump back into games faster, get real-time coaching, and stay connected... all on your own terms.”

A promotional video posted by Nadella demonstrated the AI assisting a user in downloading Age of Empires IV using voice commands on a smartphone. The AI also provided guidance in Minecraft, suggesting the next move in a survival scenario and aiding in-game strategy.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has officially confirmed the company's plans to replace the iconic Alert Slider, a feature that has been synonymous with OnePlus smartphones for years. The decision, long speculated upon, has now been made public through a community post from Lau, who framed the change as an “evolution” rather than a removal. However, for many devoted OnePlus users, the news marks the end of an era.

For years, the Alert Slider has been a hallmark of OnePlus devices, allowing users to toggle between sound profiles – a feature particularly useful in meetings or quiet settings. Its removal is set to disappoint loyal OnePlus fans who appreciated the convenience it offered.

OpenAI is reportedly geared toward introducing several artificial agents soon. Various reports hint that the tech giant is working to roll out these AI agents on specialised domains.

A recent report from The Information hinted that OpenAI is working to launch three different AI chatbots. These AI chatbots are believed to offer specialised knowledge-based information on various domains. Citing sources, the publication suggested that these AI agents will be launched with monthly charges of up to $20,000 (approx  ₹17,40,800).

New Delhi: Nine miniature satellites designed and developed by Israeli high school students were launched into space, according to the Israel Space Agency (ISA).

Calling it "the largest Israeli satellite constellation built by students in nine municipalities," the ISA said on social media platform X that the satellites were launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base.  

According to SpaceX, the satellites were launched at 8.43 a.m. local time, Xinhua news agency reported.  

The satellites, including the first-ever Druze satellite developed by students from the Druze community, were deployed into an orbit about 500 km above Earth, where they will remain for about three years with the mission of measuring cosmic radiation and its effects on electronic components, the ISA said in a separate statement on its website.  

The development of the satellites was part of the Tevel 2 national project led by the ISA and Tel Aviv University, at a cost of 10.5 million shekels (about 2.88 million dollars), the statement said.  

The project aims to connect different Israeli communities and promote equal opportunities in science and technology education, the statement mentioned.  

The Innovation, Science, and Technology Ministry, in partnership with Tel Aviv University and nine local authorities, has launched the Tevel 2 project with a budget of NIS 10.5 million.  

This initiative involves setting up satellite communication stations, allowing students to track mission data and manage operations.  

"We are witnessing a winning combination of scientific excellence, technological education, and societal integration," Uri Oron, director of ISA said.  

He added that the Tevel 2 project is a testament to the power of Israeli innovation.  

"These satellites will not only provide crucial scientific data but also serve as an inspiration for the next generation of Israeli space scientists," Oron stated.  

Designed to operate for about three years, the project aims to inspire Israel's next generation of space engineers and scientists.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — After being gang-raped by armed men while collecting firewood, the 28-year-old tried in vain to get help. Some clinics were closed, others told her to return later and she had no money to access a hospital.

Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. “I felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,” she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.
