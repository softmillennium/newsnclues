AI models, such as chatgPT, Copilot and Claude, have become indispensable assistants for developers, allowing the creation of codes faster and more efficiently. However, this dependence raises an alert: are programmers fail to learn the true foundation of programming? These tools facilitate repetitive tasks, correct errors and suggest instant solutions, making programming more accessible to everyone. The problem, according to developer Namanyay Goel, is that the new generation of programmers is being excessively dependent on AI. Previously, sites like Stack Overflow encouraged learning by requiring programmers to research and analyze several answers before finding an ideal solution. Now AI provides ready answers, which can result in superficial knowledge. For some experts, the real learning of programming is threatened. “AI offers quick but no context answers,” says Goel. He warns that by depending exclusively on these tools, programmers may lose their ability to solve problems without external aid. A developer at the Slashdot Forum points out that the quality of programming education was already a problem before AI. For him, technology only accelerated a process that was already happening: the superficiality in programming learning. Experts recommend that programmers use AI as a complementary tool, questioning proposed solutions and exploring alternatives before simply accepting them. For Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the answer is yes. In a recent statement, he stated that "no one will need to learn to program, because I will do it for us." Other executives, such as Mark Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, agree. It is believed that the AI ​​will soon assume much of the coding tasks, leaving programmers a more strategic role, focused on architecture and software engineering. This transformation resembles the impact of calculators on mathematics teaching. The advance of artificial intelligence in programming is inevitable, and programmers will need to adapt. The question is not whether AI will replace programmers, but how area professionals can evolve along with this technology. Perhaps, in a few decades, programming without the help of AI becomes as rare as resolving complex calculations without a calculator. And those who master this new reality will have a competitive differential in the market. As in Isaac Asimov's tale, the feeling of power, where humanity forgot how to make calculations without computers, may be that in the future, programmers without becoming a rarity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Johnson & Johnson's security team issued an internal alert after detecting a large wild feline, possibly a jaguar near the company's preserved forest area. The animal was caught by security cameras, which led to the immediate adoption of preventive measures to ensure the safety of employees and the activation of environmental agencies for monitoring and eventual capture of the animal.

New safety rules for employees

From this Saturday (15), new guidelines were implemented within the company's campus. Among the main measures adopted are:

Mandatory use of internal transport: Internal buses will be available 24 hours and should be used for any travel within the company area, especially after 18h;

Internal buses will be available 24 hours and should be used for any travel within the company area, especially after 18h; Restricted foot displacement: If necessary, employees should walk only in groups of at least three people;

For those who have the hybrid work option, the orientation is to prioritize the home office temporarily; Continuous Monitoring: Safety teams have intensified surveillance in the area and will keep up until the situation is solved by the environmental authorities.

History of appearances in the region

This is not the first time a large wild animal has been spotted in the area. In July 2019, a similar warning was issued after reports of the presence of a feline in the region. The place where the animal was seen borders the Ressaca stream, which crosses neighborhoods such as Jardim Pra do Sol, Jardim das Industries and Limoeiro. The preserved forest around the company's campus is a natural habitat for several species, which may explain the recurrence of these appearances.

Johnson & Johnson reaffirms its commitment to the security of its employees and will continue to monitor the situation in cooperation with the responsible authorities.

The research, published in Nature Geoscience, indicates that these changes can make vast areas of the planet uninhabited, creating unfavorable conditions for many life forms. Projections point out that mammals, including humans, will have difficulty adapting to the future environment. What is “Pangea Ultima” and how will it affect the planet? “Pangea Ultima” is the name given to the supercontinent that, according to scientists, will form in about 250 million years. With the fusion of the terrestrial masses, the planet will face a severe continentality effect, resulting in temperatures that may vary between 40 ° C and 70 ° C. In addition, high carbon dioxide levels will contribute to extreme warming, creating a challenging environment for life. Another worrying factor is increased volcanic activity. However, the planned changes will be much more drastic than any event faced so far. With the formation of supercontinent in an already hot and wet tropical region, conditions can become even more adverse, requiring accelerated evolution of species. Increased solar radiation and the scarcity of water resources may represent insurmountable challenges for many organisms. If scientists' predictions are confirmed, the earth may face a new mass extinction, shaping the future of global biodiversity.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Recently, the company has presented new AI models that promise to offer more accurate translations and transcripts in real time, significantly improving global interaction. These improvements are a fundamental step for a more interconnected world, facilitating the exchange of information and making communication more accessible to millions of people. They are trained with vast linguistic databases, allowing artificial intelligence to better understand the nuances of different languages. This reduces common errors in automatic translations and increases the fluidity of generated texts. Interactions without linguistic barriers: People from different parts of the world will be able to communicate more efficiently, enabling a more integrated collaboration in business, academic and social environments; People from different parts of the world will be able to communicate more efficiently, enabling a more integrated collaboration in business, academic and social environments; Better accessibility: Improved transcription technology benefits mainly people with hearing impairment, allowing easy access to content spoken through real -time subtitles; Some languages ​​have complex grammatical structures and less data available for training, making AI accuracy a greater challenge. Audio transcripts and translated texts may contain sensitive information, requiring robust security measures to protect users. The goal is already working on the development of data protection protocols to avoid leaks and ensure that their tools are used ethically and safely. In the future, these technologies can be integrated with virtual assistants, smart devices and even real -time applications for face -to -face conversations, allowing fluid communication without the need for intermediaries. This would pave the way for a world where linguistic barriers are practically nonexistent. With these advances, the goal reinforces its commitment to making technology more accessible and effective, contributing to a more interconnected global environment, where language does not limit communication, but expands it, creating new opportunities and bringing people closer to different cultures.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A surprising archaeological discovery in White Sands National Park in the United States can change understanding of the first means of transport. O Travois: the possible first means of human transportation Travois is a simple structure, consisting of two long wooden rods tied in triangular format or “x”, one end dragged by the ground while the other is held by one person or an animal. This method was widely used by indigenous cultures of the great plains of North America, where it was traditionally pulled by dogs or horses. However, the traces found in White Sands suggest that thousands of years ago the first humans manually carried their heavy loads. The researchers identified three distinct patterns of soil drag brands: Before concluding that these marks were caused by a traval, scientists considered other possibilities. Natural wreckage, such as branches and trunks, transported by wind or water; If Travois was really used at that time, it indicates that, long before the invention of the wheel, our ancestors were already innovating to facilitate their daily activities. In addition to modifying what we know about the evolution of the means of transport, this finding makes us reflect on how many other technological innovations of the past may have been forgotten over time. Whether due to the need for survival or convenience, the human being has always sought more efficient ways to get around and transport objects - and this search can be much older than we imagine.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This question was sent by a follower of the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) and answered by Fabrício Kalaki, Master's student in Astronomy by the Postgraduate Program in Physics of the institution. Although, according to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, it is impossible for an object with mass to reach this speed, the theoretical exercise reveals impressive scenarios. The calculation shows that this impact would equivalent to approximately 654 kilotons of TNT, a power about 44,000 times higher than the Hiroshima bomb and 32,000 times more powerful than Nagasaki's. The impact would form a deep crater and release a wave of shock with destructive power superior to any detonated atomic bomb. This phenomenon gives rise to what we know as fantry or meteor stars. Some of these objects, depending on their inlet angle, may even ricochet in the atmosphere and return to space without causing damage to the earth's surface. Others, larger, may survive reentry and reach the ground, such as meteorites. The impact of these bodies, even at speeds far lower than light, is already able to cause considerable damage. Object collisions at very high speeds are studied by scientists in various areas. An example is ultra-high energy cosmic rays, extremely fast particles that reach Earth from deep space. To analyze it, scientists perform simulations that help predict emissions caused by these events. The equipment fires projectiles at extreme speeds to study damage caused and better understand what happens when space bodies collide with planets or satellites. If you are curious about what a real impact on Earth would be, there is a tool called Impact Earth!, Available online. This simulator allows you to test different scenarios of asteroid collisions with our planet, showing the possible consequences in terms of shock waves, craters and global damage.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Spider-Man stories are typically colorful, splashy affairs, especially when translated to live-action or animation. The upcoming Spider-Noir show will continue that trend, it just may also do it without the vibrant palette we’ve become accustomed to.

In a recent interview with ComingSoon, actor Lukas Haas mentioned the series could get two releases, one in color and the other in black-and-white. During shooting, he said, the monitors were in monochrome, which made it “very, very, very authentic. I would actually go and look at the monitor and think I was looking at some older footage, but it was actually just what was on the camera at the time. They did a beautiful job with the filters and all that stuff, making it look like genuine old 1930s, black and white film.”

Spider-Man Noir’s previous onscreen appearances have made him and his universe black-and-white, keeping with the noir vibe that defines the hero. It’d be cool to have that continue in Spider-Noir; the last time Marvel used that stylized look was Werewolf by Night. Outside of that, there’s been Godzilla Minus Color and Hundreds of Beavers in recent years, and that’s just a small handful of examples. Visual flair is still something Marvel shows can struggle with, and this would be as good a time as any to experiment and do something different, especially since this is in its own universe and has a little more freedom.

Whether in color or black-and-white, Spider-Noir will air on MGM+.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.gizmodo.com.br/explosao-cosmica-revela-segredos-inesperados-sobre-o-universo-9007'>Cosmic explosion reveals unexpected secrets about the universe</a></h2><b>Source:</b> gizmodo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 18:49:58 <p>
These explosions, called rapid gusts (FRB), last only milliseconds, but carry immense energy. Some, however, repeat themselves, allowing scientists to monitor and trace their origin. The FRB detected in February 2019 was one of those rare events. This challenges previous theories, which suggested that these explosions were mainly associated with massive and active galaxies in the formation of stars. Identifying the origin of a FRB is no easy task. Because these gusts are extremely fast, their tracking depends on accurate measurements and long hours of observation with specialized telescopes. At first, scientists were perplexed as they could not identify any host galaxy. However, when analyzing images of the Canarias Gran Telescope, they detected a very distant dwarf galaxy and extremely weak luminosity. To calculate its distance, scientists analyzed how FRB radio waves dispersed by crossing the space. Scientists have found that the Galaxy of origin of the 20190208a FRB is significantly smaller and less massive than galaxies normally associated with these phenomena. According to Hewitt, this galaxy can be between 10 and 100 times weaker than most galaxies already observed by emitting FRBs, being comparable to the clouds of Magalhães. However, when their most massive stars come to the end of their lives, they do not disappear silently: explode as supernovae, forming highly magnetized neutron stars, known as magnetres. This can help scientists better understand how and where these events occur, as well as bringing new information about the composition and evolution of these small galaxies. Scientists know that magnetres can generate FRBs, but this is not the only possible explanation. Also, as dwarf galaxies are difficult to detect at large distances, there may be many other similar sources of FRBs that have not yet been identified. For more answers, Hewitt and his team say it will be essential to perform new measurements with more advanced radiotlescopes and expand optical observations in search of dwarf galaxies that may be hidden in little exploited regions of the cosmos. However, this is still a great technical and scientific challenge. This discovery not only expands our understanding of these cosmic events, but also raises new questions about the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies. The universe continues to surprise scientists with phenomena that challenge our current explanations. Each new discovery brings us a little closer to understanding the mysteries of the cosmos, but also reminds us that there is still much to be explored and understood.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Fish is one of the most nutritious and beneficial foods for health. However, among so many species, there is a highly nutritious fish that is little consumed in Brazil, but widely appreciated in other countries. Find out why it can be an excellent choice for your diet! Very popular in Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, France, Spain and Greece, the bass is found mainly in the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins. However, its nutritional properties make it one of the healthiest fish to include in food. Another major differential of sea bass is its high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, known for their benefits to the heart and the immune system. These compounds help regulate blood pressure, reduce inflammation and prevent triglyceride accumulation in the arteries. In addition to omega-3 and high biological value proteins, the bass contains other fundamental health nutrients: Antioxidant that protects cells against the damage caused by free radicals; Vitamin D: essential for bone health and for strengthening the immune system; The bass can also be fried or breaded, but these options add saturated fats and reduce their health benefits. For those who want to maintain a balanced diet, occasional consumption of fried fish is not harmful, but it is important to opt for healthier methods most of the time.

The universe is composed of energy, vibrations and particles in constant motion. Quantum Field theory proposes that reality is not fixed but moldable. According to this idea, everything in the universe is interconnected and human consciousness can play a role in the way matter behaves. The connection between mind and matter: What do studies say? This quantum unpredictability has led researchers such as Joe Dispenza to explore if the human mind can indeed influence reality. DISPENZA base your hypothesis on three fundamental scientific concepts: Epigenetics: Emotional and environmental factors can activate or disable genes, influencing our health without altering DNA. Dyspenza argues that these fields can resonate with Quantum Field, modifying not only our biology but also aspects of external reality. Although it seems a speculative idea, some experiments suggest that thoughts and emotions may affect the behavior of subatomic particles. The power of intention: If particles respond to observation, can consciousness influence matter? Some research indicates that mental intent and focus may change quantum patterns, although there is no scientific consensus on this yet. Visualization and Meditation: Studies show that imagining an active action areas of the brain similar to when this action is actually performed. This suggests that the body reacts to thought as if it were real. Emotional Resonance: Despenza suggests that emotions such as gratitude and love have a "frequency" capable of attracting favorable circumstances. Still without concrete proof, this theory has been explored in practices such as the Law of Attraction. We still cannot say for sure that the mind alters the external world, but science continues to exploit this complex relationship between consciousness and matter.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

You may have seen a video earlier this week of Aloy, protagonist of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise, recreated with generative AI in a leaked Sony test demo. The video spurred a whirlwind of emotions from players and developers, in part because the Aloy bot has a robotic voice found in text-to-speech programs, rather than that of her longtime human voice actor, Ashly Burch. Despite not having her facial or voice data used for the bot, and Guerrilla telling her ahead of time that this wasn’t for anything actively in development, Burch admitted to feeling “worried about game performance as an art form.” In the video below, she touches on voice actors’ current fight for AI-related rights to voice acting, such as getting to consent to developers using replicas of their performances, and to know what those replicas are being used for. It’s all basic stuff that the player can do just playing Forbidden West, as you can scan beasts to see what they are and their most vital areas, and if you forget, the in-game glossary has you covered. The SAG-AFTRA voice actor strike is close to going on for a full year, and the union recently said major companies like WB Games and Take-Two refuse to budge on using the technology to create voice replicas. This AI Aloy represents part of those actors’ fears: Sony and Guerrilla own Horizon, so they have the power to do as they wish with Aloy without informing Burch of the specifics, and that could possibly extend to her voice performance. Her greater concern is for actors in less secure positions than hers that could be greatly impacted by this, which she admits “hurts my heart. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors, and I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue doing this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.” At time of writing, Sony’s yet to comment on the Aloy demo video, or discuss plans to incorporate anything like this tech into its PlayStation products.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP's) national internet censor just announced that all AI-generated content will be required to have labels that are explicitly seen or heard by its audience and embedded in metadata. We saw the first signs of this policy move last September when the CAC's draft plans emerged. This regulation takes effect on September 1, 2025, and will compel all service providers (i.e., AI LLMs) to “add explicit labels to generated and synthesized content.” The directive includes all types of data: text, images, videos, audio, and even virtual scenes. Aside from that, it also orders app stores to verify whether the apps they host follow the regulations. Users will still be able to ask for unlabeled AI-generated content for “social concerns and industrial needs.” However, the generating app must reiterate this requirement to the user and also log the information to make it easier to trace. The CAC also outlaws the malicious removal, tampering, forgery, or concealment of these AI labels, including the provision of tools that will help carry out these acts. Although this obviously means that you’re prohibited from deleting the AI label and metadata on AI-generated content, it also prohibits the addition of this identifier for human-created data. Many may react negatively to this move by the CAC, especially as it’s known for administering the Great Firewall of China to limit and control the internet within China’s borders. Nevertheless, this move will help reduce misinformation from anyone and everyone, especially as AI LLMs become more advanced. By ensuring that artificially generated content is marked clearly, people could more easily determine if they’re looking at or listening to a real event or something conjured by a machine on some server farm.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Every year, Marvel tends to have a couple of event miniseries that shake things up for every comics character, or just certain characters within their own corner of the universe. While the heroes are currently dealing with Doctor Doom’s takeover of Earth, some stuff’s about to go down up in the stars, too—and House of X and Ultimate Spider-Man writer Jonathan Hickman is at the helm of this endeavor.

In June, Hickman teams with Federico Vizenti and Iban Coello on Imperial, which centers on the assassination of several galactic leaders, setting off a chain reaction of coups, wars, and changing empires across the universe. Key players of this “sweeping cosmic epic” include Black Panther, several Hulks (including Skaar!), the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Nova, with “groundbreaking developments” (and spiffy new designs) promised for all of them and the cosmic side of the Marvel universe. And in true Hickman fashion, it’ll also pave the way for an “entire new landscape” of Marvel comics set in space, which have sort of fell by the wayside in favor of more earthbound stories.

Talking to Marvel, Hickman said he’s treating Imperial as the cosmic equivalent to what he did with Ultimate Invasion, just more as an actual story rather than a “world building exercise.” As a self-professed fan of Marvel’s galactic cast, he’s “very excited” to establish a new status quo for future creatives to play around with. “The art team is killing it, and we’re all just very excited for what’s happening in this special corner of the Marvel Universe.”

Imperial’s four-part saga begins on June 4.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

However, they agreed that the proposed trial is set for December. Earlier this month, the judge rejected Musk's motion to pause OpenAI's structural shift. Elon Musk initiated legal proceedings to block OpenAI's shift to a for-profit structure last fall accusing the organization of departing from its original mission. Furthermore, OpenAI argued that Musk had previously supported a for-profit transition for personal financial gain. He left the organization in 2018, citing concerns that a multibillion-dollar partnership with Microsoft violated OpenAI's nonprofit values by prioritizing profit over public interest. Following OpenAI's 2022 release of ChatGPT and its move toward commercial partnerships, Musk filed a lawsuit in March 2023 to stop the organization's planned restructuring. He later expanded the lawsuit to include Microsoft, accusing it of influencing OpenAI's shift toward profit-driven operations. OpenAI disputes Musk's claims, arguing that his actions are intended to disrupt its progress for the advantage of xAI, another venture of Musk. In fact, OpenAI presented evidence that in 2017, Jared Birchall, who manages Musk's family office, registered a company intended to be a for-profit version of OpenAI. Documents and text messages show Musk sought a 50-60% equity stake in the entity, claiming it was necessary to help finance an $80 billion Mars colonization project.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Chinese technology giant Baidu released two new artificial intelligence (AI) models that it touted as stronger than those of DeepSeek and OpenAI based on certain benchmarks, as the large language model (LLM) competition continues to heat up.

Baidu made its latest multimodal foundational model Ernie 4.5 and its first multimodal reasoning model Ernie X1 freely available on its website on Sunday.

Ernie 4.5’s multimodal capabilities, which cover images, audio and video, outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-4o on several benchmark platforms including CCBench and OCRBench, Baidu said in a statement posted on WeChat. The Ernie 4.5 foundational model’s text capabilities also surpassed that of DeepSeek V3 based on several benchmarks, and roughly matched US firm OpenAI’s GPT-4.5, the company said.

Baidu was the first Chinese Big Tech firm to launch an LLM in China in March 2023 following the frenzy created by the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. But its early-mover advantage was challenged by China’s other AI players in the last two years. The search giant’s latest move to increase its relevance in China’s AI market came as DeepSeek has fanned an open-source wave, with Alibaba, Tencent and Bytedance galloping ahead in grabbing business and consumer users for their models.

Baidu did not provide benchmark results for its new reasoning model Ernie X1, but said that it “delivers performance on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price”.

Pricing for business access to Ernie X1’s application programming interface (API) is set at 2 yuan (US$0.28) per million token inputs and 8 yuan per million token outputs, the company said.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

There are probably a lot of simple tasks you do repeatedly on your phone, like muting it in a meeting, reducing the screen brightness late at night, or turning on the battery saver when you leave for work. Each Routine comes with a trigger and an action to carry out in response. Triggers cover times, locations, and phone states (like Do Not Disturb and low battery), while the actions cover most of the phone settings (including notifications, display settings, and Bluetooth) and can also launch apps or specific functions (like making your phone vibrate or turning on the flashlight). You can also combine multiple triggers and actions, making the feature even more versatile. From Settings, select Modes and Routines, then open the Discover tab. Right: You have a long list of triggers to choose from. You can also use this to get more control over the trigger — if you only want it to run when you have wired headphones connected, for instance, or when Wi-Fi is enabled. Tap Add what this routine will do to pick the action that happens as a result of the trigger. Again, you can search for something specific or scroll through the options. To change the order that actions are carried out in, tap and hold them to drag them into position. Give your new routine a name, an icon, and a color to identify it, then tap Done to store it. If the conditions are already met when you save the Routine, then it will immediately start to run. Left: You can give your Routine names and icons. Right: Routines can be easily disabled and enabled as needed. You can head back to the Modes and Routines screen at any time to view and modify your Routines. If the routine is running, you can cancel or stop it. Tap on Details to see all the settings for that routine. If it’s not running, then just tap on the routine to go to the Details screen. If you tap on the three dots (bottom right), you can duplicate or disable a Routine (which stops it from running but doesn’t delete it). You can also block notifications for a specific Routine so it’ll run quietly in the background.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Atari parts and accessories store Best Electronics stands bravely defiant against the march of time and technology, continuing to serve this increasingly niche retro hardware market 41 years after it was set up. Thus, it is admirable to see exclusive new and upgraded parts like rubber domes for your ST / STE / Falcon computer keyboard and all Gold PCB boards for your CX series joysticks, plus lots of other parts, continue to be manufactured and supplied to Atari fans. The retailer also stocks "a lifetime supply," of new-old products in some categories. Best Electronics says it lists 5,000+ Atari items on its site. However, these are just the most popular items, so if you are after something that appears to be absent from the extensive parts and components lists it is advised to send an email. Alternatively, you can really go back in retail time by ordering the Best Rev. This is a paper catalog of over 220 pages, making it about half an inch thick and 1.4 pounds in weight. We've covered retro hardware holdouts before, with reports on the surprisingly recent demise of the floppy disk in Japan, German railway systems that still rely on MS-DOS and Windows 3.11, and even the Indiana bakery which still runs Commodore 64-powered cash registers. Nevertheless, Best Electronics dogged and extensive support for Atari fans still impresses. Sadly, the Atari branded products which arrived after this time were just rehashed and recycled wares designed to milk the firm's classic video games IP with minimal innovation.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The super-slender device reportedly will pack cutting-edge technologies not used in other iPhones. Multiple rumors point to Apple launching an iPhone 17 Air later this year. But if you assumed Apple would simply slim down one of its existing iPhones for the iPhone 17 Air, think again. Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman, in the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, details Apple’s “herculean effort” behind the upcoming iPhone, codenamed D23. Gurman says even the battery life will be “on par with current iPhones.” Rumors suggest Apple will prioritize slimness over features with the iPhone 17 Air. At one point, Apple even considered ditching the USB-C port entirely, going all-in on wireless charging, and making a portless iPhone. Many technological breakthroughs that Apple will use in the iPhone 17 Air eventually should make their way to future iPhones. To compare the design of the Air against Apple’s other models coming this autumn, take a look at a set of “dummy” images posted Sunday on X by leaker Sonny Dickson. Here’s your first look at the iPhone 17 dummies, Thoughts?

However, Huawei has long used the same underlying architectures for both servers and PCs, and the company reportedly has a new line of laptops coming in April that will leverage its own homegrown HarmonyOS. Kirin SoCs are primarily used in Huawei's mobile devices and have become increasingly vital to China's goal towards semiconductor autarky after the imposition of sanctions. The latest Kirin 9020 that powers Huawei's Mate 70 series is based on Taishan V120, which can match AMD's Zen 3 cores in Geekbench single-core performance. Conversely, Huawei's server and PC divisions have been relatively quiet, as evidenced by the lack of new Kunpeng SoC designs since 2019. It's likely to be fabricated using SMIC's 7nm process featuring Taishan V120 cores based on either the Armv8 or Armv9 architectures, which are not subject to the US trade ban. In contrast to Loongson's MIPS or LoongArch-based chips, Kunpeng cores employ a custom Arm architecture, which should offer relatively broader compatibility. Despite such advantages, inadequate operating system and software support have consistently been the Achilles' heel of these processors. On the mobile side, Huawei's homegrown HarmonyOS platform works relatively well with its Kirin SoCs. Notebooks carry a different software ecosystem than mobile phones, including specialized applications that developers must port. Furthermore, even general mobile applications on HarmonyOS will need a UI (User Interface) rework for optimal laptop integration. On the consumer side, if our speculation holds, Huawei's integration of custom hardware and software is comparable to Apple silicon Macbooks. We can expect Huawei to provide details shortly, provided the April launch rumors are valid.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

CoolIT, a company specializing in liquid cooling solutions for data centers, has debuted a new liquid cooling cold plate, advertised to dissipate 4kW of heat, which is four times what Nvidia’s B200 accelerator is rated at. The company claims a doubling of heat dissipation over current industry standards regarding single-phase Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) solutions. This announcement falls right before GTC, where Nvidia is expected to introduce its GB300 Blackwell Ultra offerings and discuss plans for the next-generation Rubin architecture. In general, this is quite similar to the AIOs (All-In-Ones) and custom liquid cooling loops your PC might have. In standard testing, at a flow rate of six Liters Per Minute (LPM), CoolIT’s new cold plates reportedly achieved 97% heat removal from a 4,000W Thermal Test Vehicle (TTV) which indicates excellent heat transfer efficiency. The company also claimed a thermal resistance of under 0.009 Celsius/Watt while incurring a full flow loop pressure drop to 8 PSI (Pounds per Square Inch). Similarly, in a closed-loop, a lower pressure drop means the pump doesn’t have to work as hard to circulate the coolant. Sadly, one of those aspects is increased power consumption, and that gets progressively worse as more of these racks are deployed. Consequently, we are witnessing a growing trend towards liquid cooling. Immersion cooling seems like a viable solution, but it limits vertical rack stacking and not every data center is designed with such infrastructure in mind, so for the time being, we’re likely to see D2C solutions increase in adoption.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-mice/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-dex-review'>Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex Review: A very close second</a></h2><b>Source:</b> tomshardware&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 13:16:22 <p>
The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is comfortable, but it's still leaning more toward being flexible for multiple grips rather than perfect for one. Logitech's G Pro line of lightweight, performance-focused, ambidextrous gaming mice has been popular with professional gamers since it debuted. Naturally, the company decided it was better not to mess with a good thing, and, as a result, the line has stayed pretty consistent — even the most recent Pro X Superlight 2 was practically identical to its predecessor. But now it seems like Logitech is looking to branch out (slightly) by introducing a Pro X Superlight 2 alternative: the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex has the same specs as its ambidextrous counterpart: Logitech's Hero 2 optical sensor, which has a maximum resolution of 44,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 888 IPS and can handle up to 88 G's of acceleration; Lightforce hybrid optical/mechanical switches; and up to an 8,000 Hz wireless polling rate. The only real difference is its shape — an asymmetrical, right-handed ergonomic shape with a hump for support and lightly contoured sides for grip. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is a wireless ultra-lightweight gaming mouse with an ergonomic, contoured right-handed shape. It's made of solid, lightweight plastic and features a uniformly smooth, matte surface that comes in black, white, or pink. It's worth pointing out that these measurements are almost identical to those of the Razer DeathAdder V3 Pro (which is clearly what the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is gunning for). It helps, of course, that the mouse is ultra-light, weighing just 2.12 ounces (60g). It's a very comfortable mouse, though the hump's placement did feel particularly pronounced. This wasn't too much of an issue for me — though I never really got used to it — but I can see this being bothersome for someone with smaller hands. The primary mouse buttons have some very subtle contouring to help keep your fingers in place, though they are a bit slippery. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is a fairly straight forward five-button mouse, with right and left primary buttons, two thumb buttons on the left side, and a notched, clickable scroll wheel. All of the buttons are nicely tactile and clicky, and the scroll wheel has a soft, easy notching that's still delineated enough for precise scrolling but not so stiff that it's taxing to scroll through long webpages. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex will work for all grip types, though you'll need larger hands if you want to use this mouse comfortably with a fingertip grip. This mouse is more ergonomically-designed than the regular Pro X Superlight 2, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's for you — it's a comfortable mouse, but it does have a lot of flare at the tip and the hump didn't sit back far enough for my liking. The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is an excellent gaming mouse for those who don't need extra buttons (you can program the mouse two layers deep with Logitech's "G-Shift" feature, but if you're looking for extra buttons this is not the mouse for you. It has an extremely low 0.125 ms response time, and even if this doesn't make a significant difference to most gamers, at least this mouse's 2.4GHz wireless connection felt stable and speedy over 1,000 Hz, 4,000 Hz, and 8,000 Hz polling rates. These switches can operate both optically and mechanically — optical actuation is faster (literally, the speed of light) but drains battery faster, while mechanical actuation (actually, as configured by Logitech — "hybrid") is still fast enough for most gamers and also saves power. The mouse's side buttons are well-placed, though they may be a little out of the way for those with smaller hands, and are slightly mushy. This is not my favorite scroll wheel — I didn't encounter any issues with scroll wheel jump in my testing, but the scroll wheel is just loose enough that I'm concerned this could be an issue in the future. Features and Software of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex can be configured in Logitech's universal peripheral software, G Hub. There's also an advanced menu that lets you set DPI separately for x- and y-axis movement, as well as adjust the lift-off distance (low, medium, high). Logitech also includes a sensor calibrator that lets you calibrate the mouse to mimic the feel of a different mouse — say, the mouse you had before this one, so you don't need to worry about a significant adjustment period. G Hub also comes with a handful of generic game-ready presets, such as "First Person," "First Person XY Split," "MMORPG," and "Productivity." Wireless Experience & Battery Life of the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex The Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is designed to connect primarily over a low-latency 2.4GHz "Lightspeed" wireless connection — it can also connect via cable (USB-C), but the included cable is clearly designed for charging, not wired use. Like other premium ultra-lightweight wireless gaming mice, the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex doesn't bother with frivolities such as Bluetooth connectivity or RGB lighting (though there is a small indicator LED in the center of the mouse that pulses to indicate things like battery life, charging status, etc). The Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 Dex is an excellent alternative to the regular Logitech G Pro X Superlight 2 — it's both lightweight and grippable while adding an ergonomic shape that many users will find more comfortable than the original's ambidextrous shape. Many users, but not all — while it works better than the original does for all grip types, that doesn't make it ideal for every grip type. I generally use a palm grip, and the Pro X Superlight 2 Dex's steeper, more centered hump felt off to me — I couldn't get used to it even after a couple of weeks of testing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Check your motherboard model to make sure, because they aren’t compatible with each other. Most memory is sold in kits, so if you want 32GB you’ll typically buy a pair of 16GB sticks, often shown in listings as 2x16GB, and install them according to your motherboard’s instructions for dual channel memory. Some gamers may benefit from 64GB of memory, but anything more would be for special use cases. The other number you’re likely to see prominently displayed on memory is clock speed, measured in MHz. DDR5 starts at 3,200MHz, but it seems like most DIY memory falls in the 6,000-6,400MHz range. Notably, if you want to fully utilize your RAM’s stated speed, you’ll need to make sure XMP, or AMD’s EXPO, are enabled in your BIOS. Performance has another measurable function in the form of CL, or CAS Latency. There are a few considerations you also may want to keep in mind when purchasing memory for your system. Most modules are roughly the same size, but if you have a large CPU cooler you may want to make sure any shrouds on the memory aren’t too tall. Most DIY motherboards don’t have capacity limits for memory that should concern your average PC user, or even gamer, but if you’re upgrading an older system, you’ll want to check the manual and motherboard model to confirm how much storage it can handle. Know that there are typically two sizes of memory module.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In a new research paper, scientists say they’ve discovered a naturally occurring hormone that might help people lose weight while avoiding the side effects commonly associated with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and similar drugs. These medications, also used for type 2 diabetes, have proven to be far more effective at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone, with results ranging from 15% to 20% lost weight in clinical trials. Semaglutide works by mimicking GLP-1, a hormone that helps regulate our appetite and metabolism, among other functions (some drugs like tirzepatide mimic both GLP-1 and other related hormones). As groundbreaking as these drugs are, they are known to commonly cause annoying GI symptoms, and may rarely cause more severe complications like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis). Scientists have also been working to find and develop newer generation drugs that could provide even greater weight loss or offer other conveniences, such as being available as a pill. In that vein, the Stanford Medicine researchers devised a novel strategy to find their drug candidate. The researchers looked at one of these enzymes, prohormone convertase 1/3, which is known to help produce GLP-1. To greatly speed up this discovery process, they developed a computer algorithm (nicknamed Peptide Predictor) to narrow the list of potential molecules that fit their criteria. This screening found an initial batch of 373 prohormones that could yield some 2,700 different peptides (peptides are often the building blocks of larger proteins, but they can have their own distinctive functions in the body). The scientists then tested BRP on lab mice and miniature pigs (minipigs are thought to closely resemble people metabolically). They found that a single dose of BRP greatly reduced the appetite of both animals in the short term, sometimes by as much as 50%. The dosed animals also didn’t experience changes to their movement, level of anxious behavior, or water intake, suggesting that BRP can be safely tolerated when taken as a drug. The team’s findings are, of course, preliminary at this point. It will take plenty more time and research, including early successful clinical trials in humans, before BRP should be seen as the next big thing in obesity treatment. For their part, Svensson and her colleagues have already filed patents on BRP, and she has co-founded a company that she hopes will develop the molecule for clinical use. No drug comes without side effects, but the future of obesity treatment could someday involve a lot less nausea.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://theverge.com/hands-on/630856/angry-miao-am-infinity-mouse-gaming-price-specs-impressions'>This gaming mouse has a striking skeletonized design and hot-swap batteries</a></h2><b>Source:</b> theverge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 13:00:00 <p>
Angry Miao is known for ridiculous, over-the-top mechanical keyboard designs, but now it’s made a gaming mouse that’s, you guessed it: ridiculous and over-the-top. It’s also cool as all hell, starts at $125 on a Kickstarter preorder special ending March 17th, and may be my new favorite mouse. Within its hollowed-out, super lightweight black chassis is a magnetic battery that can be popped out and swapped in seconds. This functionality gives the mouse its name, as Angry Miao claims hot-swapping equals “infinite” battery. Just like how my fridge has infinite ice cubes, obviously. The Infinity Mouse’s more conventional features include an 8,000Hz polling rate for minimal input latency, even with high-refresh monitors. And its new TTC Orange Dot Optical V2 micro switches have a nice tactile click, sensitive enough to confidently register when pressing anywhere on the left and right mouse buttons (even up near the mouse’s center). Its forward and back buttons on the left side are see-through blue in this pre-production model, but Angry Miao says they’ll be black on final units expected to ship in June. In addition to the 2.4GHz connectivity enabled through its RGB-illuminated dongle / battery charger, the mouse also supports Bluetooth and wired USB-C. (In wired mode without a battery, it’s just 39 grams). That’s ample time for it to recharge on the receiver. The wireless receiver puck has RGB lighting that shows charging status once you swap batteries. The open look may not be to everyone’s liking, especially if you don’t want to deal with dust buildup on your mouse’s circuitry. Angry Miao claims it pursued this design upon inspiration from the Lotus Evanora concept and late-1970s Lotus Type 79 F1 car, and it does look like a small sampling of automotive art on your desk. But like a race car, the Infinity Mouse and its massive cutouts may not comfortably accommodate everyone. If you have small hands and rest your palm harder on the base of your mouse, you may feel differently about this one’s comfort. But unlike its boutique mechs, the Infinity Mouse is priced much more logically. I know you can free yourself of mouse charging woes with something like a Logitech G Powerplay (of which my mouse is actually compatible). But that Qi-based charging pad alone costs over $100 and still requires a cable stretching across your desk. The Infinity Mouse’s receiver can just discreetly hang out at the perimeter of your desk (even more so if you turn off its RGB lights) and have your fresh charge ready for you in a snap. And dealing with disposable batteries is a wasteful nuisance that I personally, strongly dislike. The reality is, most people are not able to take full advantage of a mouse or other peripheral to make much of a difference in their KDR or how often they land the dub. The Infinity Mouse has those fancy specs like a lot of other mice out there, but it’s also got a truly unique design and some handy functionality benefits.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The dreaded Akira ransomware attack has had another hole blown through its hull. Blogger Tinyhack has discovered a new exploit to brute-force the virus's encryption and has reportedly already used it to restore the data of an attacked company. In 2023, Avast's Threat Research Team found the method Akira used to encrypt victim files, and published a free encryption breaker tool to free computers from the dreaded attack. Akira then patched this high-profile crack, adding some bespoke details to its originally publicly-available encryption methods. These timestamps can be deduced to a tight range of on average 5 million nanoseconds (0.005 seconds), and then precisely found with brute-force, a process which requires the use of top-end GPUs such as Nvidia's RTX 3090 or 4090. Several things must go right for those hoping to execute the decryption method. Tinyhack's client took around 3 weeks to successfully decrypt a full set of VM files. Ransomware attacks are most often impossible to decrypt without paying ransom, so finding a method to circumvent the attack is a big win for cybersecurity research. While those behind Akira will likely quickly patch this method for future attacks as they did after the Avast decryption release, those already hit by Akira may be able to free infected systems with this method. Tinyhack's blog post runs through the entire process of discovering the vulnerability and full instructions to decrypt with it, so please head there to get an exhaustive look at brute-forcing a way into Akira.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Although they are still in early stages, these machines are expected to revolutionize the way data is processed, reaching speeds and unattainable abilities by conventional computers. In addition, they can solve complex mathematical problems and make it accessible a quantum reality that, for now, remains mostly theoretical. However, this technology faces a major obstacle: cubits are extremely sensitive to the environment and lose data stored in second fractions. A new study conducted by scientists or Katz and Roy Shaham of the Dr. Ofer Firtenberg group at the Weizmann Institute of Sciences, in partnership with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd., proposed an innovative solution to significantly prolong data retention in cubits. Quantum systems have been studied for more than two decades as potential data storage due to a unique feature of electrons and other fundamental particles: their spins. The spin represents the rotation movement of an electron around its axis and can be stable under certain conditions, allowing a direction of rotation, clockwise or counterclockwise. When two atoms collide, their spins can remain unchanged or change direction, thus functioning as a binary information storage system. This system creates a quantum memory unit with considerably larger durability, albeit limited to some fractions of the second. This paved the way for a quantum memory system of greater stability and efficiency. Scientists assess that while the transfer of classical information between alkaline gas electrons and noble gas nuclei is relatively slow, quantum data transmission can be significantly faster. For this, it is necessary to establish an efficient communication channel between a photon, an alkaline gas electron and a core of noble gas, without depending on the specific identity of each atom involved in the process. In a recent study, the researchers demonstrated an optimized model for this transfer, opening doors for the development of a highly stable quantum memory system. Theoretical and experimental studies continue to boost innovation in this field, with the objective of improving communication between quantum computers through photons. Despite obstacles, recent advances indicate that quantum computing may be getting closer to a technological revolution that will transform the way we store and process information.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

I’m not here to sell you the idea of laptop stands—see that story here—but if you’re going to drop a small fortune on an iOS device, it deserves a pedestal that complements its sculptural craftsmanship. Apple has surpassed 2.2 billion active devices as of February 2024, so odds are you own at least one. And if Apple made laptop stands, they would look like Rain Design’s. Apple devices are known for their elegant simplicity, and Rain Design just gets it. All of its stands disappear behind the device that they’re meant to support and don’t drown your workplace in visual clutter. Apple carries Twelve South stands, but I prefer Rain Design’s. They slightly less expensive, with a wider variety of styles and colors. It’s rock-solid, forged from a solid aluminum plate, and designed with a wide base (7.5 x 10 inches) that makes it one of the most stable stands I’ve tested. I very much appreciate the slot underneath to tuck my external keyboard and mouse when not in use. If you collaborate in-person often, the mStand360 model adds a swivel base. It folds down to just 9.5 x 6 inches and weighs less than a pound; it's compact enough to throw into any tote bag, including my Lululemon Boxy Mini Tote. Plus, it comes with a svelte pouch, like all of the company's portable products. Rain Design isn’t out here trying to reinvent the wheel with flashy features. Essentially, Rain Design delivers what we all desire: unwavering stability, genuine thoughtfulness, and durability that'll outlive your Apple device.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We’ve all been there—without paddling limbs, wind-catching sails, or a propelling engine, you’re stuck. But what if we could make the water itself move you? Beyond its inherent cool factor, this research could have practical applications, ranging from molecular experiments to the maneuvering of boats across large bodies of water. After studying computer simulations, the team used 3D-printed plastic structures to generate different kinds of waves in a water tank. They even noted that small external waves did not greatly disturb the pattern and object movement. Overall, the floating objects only ever deviated from their path by less than a fifth of an inch (about 5 millimeters). Despite appearances, the researchers aren’t waterbenders—it’s all grounded in physics. Yijie is an optical engineer, and the recent study was inspired by his research on light patterns. He and his colleagues had previously shown that light waves could move tiny particles within light patterns, which led him to wonder if water could behave similarly. On a molecular scale, this technique could bring particles together without direct manipulation. Similar water manipulation techniques might help clean up floating chemical pollutants. Given the similarities among water waves, light waves, and electron movement, the researchers suggest that water could provide a more accessible way to study some quantum phenomena. If you think that’s wildly futuristic, just wait—future research could even investigate the possibility of using water patterns to store data, according to the statement.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Everyone who buys a complicated modern countertop oven is quickly beset with a dilemma: how to clean a toaster oven with nonstick coatings and breakable parts, and lord knows what else. The modern multifeature accessory oven is beset by odd crannies and frangible heating elements. If you convect or air fry a chicken, the grease will fly off in all directions in a fine and oily mist and land, ickily, on the oven walls. I test toaster ovens and air fryers for a living, so I've had to clean many variations of oven. And I've made at least one costly mistake along the way, by absent-mindedly thinking it was a good idea to clean grease droppings off a quartz heating element with my thumbnail. Here's some step-by-step, practical advice about how to keep your toaster oven clean— and advice on how to clean it when all seems lost. The simplest advice is the one that will save you from ever needing more advice in the future: Clean your oven after every meal that contains fat, oil, butter, and/or dairy. Even if it's just a little damp-cloth wipe-down and even if the oven doesn't look dirty.

Ever since we first heard murmurs of Apple prepping an ultra-slim iPhone, speculations were rife about a fittingly high asking price. But it seems buyers won’t get hit with an absurd “innovation tax” for the iPhone 17 Air model later this year. The package, however, is going to be a mixed bag of surprises. So far, the high refresh rate perk has been exclusive to Apple’s flagship iPhones and iPads. As per Bloomberg’s report, despite packing a slimmer battery pack, it will offer a per-charge mileage that is “on par with current iPhones.” Despite its high asking price, the iPhone 17 Air is said to offer only a single 48-megapixel rear camera. Apple is also skipping the physical SIM tray on this one, going all-in with an eSIM approach. So far, the modem hasn’t raised any performance red flags, but it misses out on a crucial connectivity upgrade. Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to arrive in the coming months.

These days, artificial intelligence can generate photorealistic images, write novels, do your homework, and even predict protein structures. New research, however, reveals that it often fails at a very basic task: telling time. Their study, forthcoming in April and currently hosted on the preprint server arXiv, demonstrates that the LLMs has difficulty with these basic tasks. “Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), most work has focused on object detection, image captioning, or scene understanding, leaving temporal inference underexplored.” They fed the models different images of analog clocks—timekeepers with Roman numerals, different dial colors, and even some missing the seconds hand—as well as 10 years of calendar images. “Analogue clock reading and calendar comprehension involve intricate cognitive steps: they demand fine-grained visual recognition (e.g., clock-hand position, day-cell layout) and non-trivial numerical reasoning (e.g., calculating day offsets),” the researchers explained. Overall, the AI systems did not perform well. “Most people can tell the time and use calendars from an early age. Our findings highlight a significant gap in the ability of AI to carry out what are quite basic skills for people,” Rohit Saxena, a co-author of the study and PhD student at the University of Edinburgh’s School of Informatics, said in a university statement. “These shortfalls must be addressed if AI systems are to be successfully integrated into time-sensitive, real-world applications, such as scheduling, automation and assistive technologies.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Sometime in the fall of 2021, Andrew Krapivin, an undergraduate at Rutgers University, encountered a paper that would change his life. But two years later, when he finally set aside time to go through the paper (“just for fun,” as he put it), his efforts would lead to a rethinking of a widely used tool in computer science. The paper’s title, “Tiny Pointers,” referred to arrowlike entities that can direct you to a piece of information, or element, in a computer’s memory. Krapivin soon came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory. But in the midst of his tinkering, Krapivin realized that he had invented a new kind of hash table, one that worked faster than expected—taking less time and fewer steps to find specific elements. Martín Farach-Colton, a coauthor of the “Tiny Pointers” paper and Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers, was initially skeptical of Krapivin’s new design. But just to be sure, he asked a frequent collaborator (and a “Tiny Pointers” coauthor), William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, to check out his student’s invention. “You didn’t just come up with a cool hash table,” he remembers telling Krapivin. Together, Krapivin (now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge), Farach-Colton (now at New York University), and Kuszmaul demonstrated in a January 2025 paper that this new hash table can indeed find elements faster than was considered possible. ln so doing, they had disproved a conjecture long held to be true.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

We’re a little over 160-days-away from the official iPhone 17 Air announcement, which means lots more leaks and spy shots will be surfacing in the coming months, including this dummy unit comparison. This handset is rumored to measure just 5.5mm to 6mm at its thinnest point, though the camera bump adds significant bulk, bringing the total thickness to around 9.5mm at its thickest.





In this dummy unit comparison, we can see that the front may not look drastically different from other iPhone 17 models, retaining features like Face ID and a Dynamic Island, but there’s speculation it could have a smaller Dynamic Island than its Pro counterparts. The rear camera layout is where it differentiates itself, boasting a single rear camera housed in a wide, rectangular “camera bar” or a Google Pixel-like “visor” design, with the flash positioned separately. It’s expected to feature a 6.6-inch LTPO OLED display, positioning it between the sizes of the standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, while it should be powered by an A19 chip, built on TSMC’s 3-nanometer N3P technology.

New research sheds light on this dramatic environment and the creatures that call it home despite the extreme conditions. Their study, published March 6 in the journal Cell, highlights surprising diversity in one of our planet’s most extreme environments. The hadal zone features extreme pressure, near-freezing temperatures, low nutrient levels, and almost complete darkness. The paper is one of a trio of MEER studies on hadal zone ecosystems published on the same day. The other suggests that fish living deeper than 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) below sea level all have a genetic mutation that helps them mitigate the impact of the cold, pressure, and lack of sunlight. This last study also estimates when certain marine creatures first descended to such depths. “These findings suggest the existence of convergent adaptation strategies to hadal environments that transcend species boundaries and biological domains,” the researchers wrote in a commentary on the trio of studies. In other words, the hadal zone’s extreme environment likely drove unrelated species to develop similar traits. In addition to the microbes, amphipods, and fish, however, the researchers also encountered human litter: plastic bags, soda cans, beer bottles, and even a laundry basket, according to Science. “This was deeply shocking to us,” Weishu Zhao, an extremophile microbiologist at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and a co-author of the microbial study, told Science. While she and her colleagues noted that deep-sea microbes seem capable of processing some human contaminants, that seems like a small consolation in the face of humanity’s footprint reaching the deepest regions of our oceans. Ultimately, the study provides rare insight into the exceptional diversity of a region once believed to be lifeless—proving that life really does always find a way.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Baidu has introduced two new AI models that take aim at Western competitors with aggressive pricing and plans for open-source release. The company also unveiled Ernie 4.5, a new multimodal base model that processes videos, photos, and text more effectively than its predecessors. According to Baidu, the model shows marked improvements in reducing hallucinations, handling complex reasoning tasks, and writing code. Internal benchmarks suggest it performs better than OpenAI's standard GPT-4o and matches capabilities with the newer GPT-4.5. Beyond enterprise services, Baidu now offers its AI chatbot Ernie Bot at no cost to individual users. Mid-February, Baidu CEO Robin Li announced a major change in direction: the company will make its Ernie 4.5 series open-source starting June 30. Li, who historically supported keeping models closed, said that open source would "spread the technology much faster." This development adds to the pressure on Western AI companies that maintain higher pricing for comparable capabilities. But it's also true that open-source Chinese models could significantly impact these companies' commercial API offerings. As China's dominant search provider, Baidu aimed to establish itself early in the AI race. The company launched Ernie Bot as China's first ChatGPT alternative in 2023, drawing 70 million users within three months. These new releases suggest Baidu is accelerating development as domestic rival Deepseek gains international recognition.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Almost all aspects of modern life depend on our internet connection. When my supplier undergoes a breakdown, everything stops: teleworking via VPN, listening to music on Spotify and even the use of connected domestic devices. It is a brutal reminder of our dependence on the invisible network that keeps us connected. Receive a selection of strategic advice and concrete tips every week in your mailbox with our newsletter practical guides. But an unstable connection, with latencies and buffer memory, can be even more frustrating. If you are sure that your signal is strong, but you always encounter problems, the concern may come from the location of your router. A single wireless access point should be enough for most apartments and small houses (140 m² or less). The larger houses on several floors have a different challenge, which can be taken up by opting for a mesh network. The mesh networks consist of a main access point and additional nodes which can be distributed throughout the space to ensure homogeneous coverage. Long-range routers and Wi-Fi repeaters are also options to optimize the efficiency of your router. However, whatever the number of transmitters you have, the location of your main access point is crucial for its overall performance. A central location guarantees constant speeds and strengthens network safety, as neighbors' routers are less likely to operate the signal. By moving it from behind the screen to a small table next door, my computer and my Google Hub devices are now enjoying a stronger and more constant signal. As far as possible, avoid the areas where your router could be affected by Wi-Fi devices, even if this implies moving it away from your desktop printer. All Wi-Fi routers are equipped with antennas, whether integrated into the device or external. Articulated antennas can even contribute to more uniform coverage. Whether your router is equipped with two or eight antennas, you can adjust them to optimize the distribution. Thus, orient them towards the sky can be more advantageous for a smaller or single-storey house, because the signal is diffused outwards from its vertical position.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

From supplements to establishing a routine before bed, there are many items and advice that will help you sleep. However, in reality, just changing the bed arrangement may improve your sleep quality. Experts agreed on the optimal bed arrangement for a good night's sleep. If you live in a busy area or in an urban area, choose a wall that does not face the outside. Kaylor explains that this arrangement will "give you a sense of security and reduce external interference." Also, if the bed frame is too high, too low, noisy or unstable, it can have a negative effect on the quality of your sleep. Of course, it is also important that the mattress and pillows are comfortable. Roash Shuaib also suggests sleeping away from the vents, as sudden temperature changes occur during sleep will make your sleep fragmented and unsettled. Therefore, sleep experts recommend that you refrain from working in bed or relaxing there all day. In short, Robbins points out that "bedrooms should be just for two things: sex and sleep." Blue light emitted from screens such as smartphones suppresses melatonin production. Melatonin plays a role in regulating the sleep and wakefulness cycle. "Just being passively exposed to notifications, vibrations and standby lights from the device can increase your awakening level and prevent you from falling asleep or maintaining sleep," Roash Shuaib adds.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The company has also made its AI chatbot, ERNIE Bot, free for individual users earlier than planned. Meanwhile, ERNIE 4.5 is our latest foundation model and new-generation native multimodal model,” the company said in a post on X.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.zdnet.de/88420958/balkonkraftwerk-mit-speicher-lohnt-sich-die-investition-wirklich/'>Balcony power plant with memory: Is the investment really worth it?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> zdnet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 06:00:37 <p>
A balcony power plant with memory enables the proportion of self -consumption to increase significantly and to use solar power even if the sun no longer shines. Why the balcony power plants are becoming increasingly popular The rising electricity prices and the growing awareness of renewable energies have led to more and more households relying on solar energy. While large photovoltaic systems are mostly reserved for homeowners with sufficient roof surface, balcony power plants (also called plug solar systems) offer a compact alternative for tenants and homeowners with a limited space. But despite their efficiency, classic balcony power plants have a disadvantage: unused electricity is simply lost because there are no feed -in tariffs in these systems. This is exactly where the storage facility of a Balcon power plant comes in. By combining with a battery system, excess electricity can be stored and used later - for example in the evenings when the sun no longer shines. But the question arises: is a balcony power plant with storage? A crucial factor for profitability is the self -consumption rate. "A balcony power plant with memory enables the proportion of self -consumption to increase significantly and to use solar power even if the sun no longer shines." In addition to size and performance, the legal situation also plays a crucial role. In Germany there are clear regulations that regulate the operation of such mini solar systems. The individual electricity savings and economy can also be calculated in advance. If you want to know how much solar power can be generated with a specific system, you can check this with a simulated earnings calculator. Thanks to modern storage technologies, the use of solar power becomes more flexible. How does a balcony power plant with memory work? The decisive difference to a classic balcony power plant is that the current produced not only consumes immediately, but can also be saved in a battery. This makes it possible to use solar power even if the sun does not shine - for example in the evenings or on cloudy days. There are now smart systems that intelligently control self -consumption and ensure that the stored electricity is used as efficiently as possible. In order to find out which storage capacity makes sense for your own household, an individual calculation of needs can help. What are the advantages of a balcony power plant with memory? A balcony power plant with memory brings with it a number of advantages that make it an attractive solution for environmentally conscious households: Environmental friendliness: The consumption of your own solar power reduces CO₂ emissions and protects fossil resources. Flexibility: Even in households with fluctuating power consumption, the stored energy can be used individually. A great advantage is also the possibility to optimize your own consumption. Depending on the memory size and consumption behavior, households can significantly increase their electricity aid. In the meantime, there are already many systems that can use a network cover sensor to be able to measure electricity consumption in the household and dinner dynamically. Despite the many advantages, there are also some challenges that should be taken into account before purchasing. While a simple balcony power plant is already available for a few hundred euros, the costs with an additional memory increase significantly. Before buying, it should therefore be checked whether inverter, solar modules and memory are optimally coordinated. There are also certain electrical safety requirements that must be observed. In addition, the legal situation for balcony power plants with memory is not always clearly regulated. Is a balcony power plant with storage financially worthwhile? While a simple balcony power plant without memory is already available for around 600 to 1,000 euros, the costs for a model with memory are usually between 1,500 and 3,000 euros, depending on the capacity and quality of the components used. Funding programs can also significantly improve the economy of a balcony power plant with memory. The most famous manufacturers currently include anchors, Zendure, Ecoflow, Growatt and Marstek. The decision depends heavily on individual factors such as electricity consumption, acquisition costs and funding opportunities. A comparison of different storage systems can also help to make the right decision. One thing is certain: the future belongs to renewable energies. Whether with or without a memory - balcony power plants offer an efficient way to reduce your own electricity bill and make a contribution to climate protection.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A brand new mint supercomputer for ESA. From today also the European Space Agency, such as its US and Japanese counterparties, can count on a formidable calculation power that will significantly expand its skills in terms of efficiency, speed and sustainability of research, both in the space and monitoring of the environment and extreme events. The ASA supercomputer is called Space HPC, an acronym for High Performance Computing, and a few days ago in Esrin, the Italian headquarters of the Agency, in Frascati, was inaugurated in the presence of the general manager Josef Aschbacher, of the director of the observation program of the Earth Simonetta Cheli, of the president of the Italian Space Agency Teodoro Valente and many of the scientists who have collaborated in the project and conducted Space HPC's first "real" tests. What is Space HPC, the new ESA supercomputer We called it confidentially supercomputer, but more technically HPC is a "enhanced calculation system", or "high -performance calculation environment" designed to meet the growing computational needs of the European Space Industry. The scientific programs of ESA and its partners, in fact, provide a huge amount of data, which Space HPC will be able to collect, manage, interpret and put together with a speed and efficiency much higher than it was possible in the past. One thing that was obviously there was a great need: "A few years ago - said Aschbacher - I visited the NASA Supercomputer in Silicon Valley, and then those of Japan, and I wondered why the ESA and Europe were not equipped with a similar tool, to be put at the service of the community. For some time we had decided to remedy this problem, and today we finally see the result of our efforts concretized. " The HPC, in particular, combines cutting -edge technologies with a sustainable and efficient approach from an energy point of view: it is equipped with about 34 thousand CPUs CPUs and 108 graphic cards, for a total power of 5 petoflops, can count on over 6 storage memory petibobete and 156 ram terabyte and is lithium cooled. It will serve to do many things, as Cheri explains: "The ASA supercomputer will be the central reference point of the Agency for any high -performance calculation need linked to research and development, both for the Directions of ESA and for our industrial partners.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The first explains the consequences of six weeks of high temperatures above the optimal conditions of cocoa growth in four countries, which are however among the major producers of West Africa (and which alone cover about 70% of global production). The second highlights how prices have increased by 400% in recent years, connecting this aspect to drought and strong rainfall in the main producing countries. It is not the first time that it happens: it is a trend of recent years that, however, does not seem close to reversing. Already in 2023 an important collapse of the production caused by extreme climatic conditions such as drought, floods and diseases of the plants had occurred, making the cocoa price splash up to 400% more, and reaching $ 12,218 per tonne. On 18 December 2024 a new record was recorded: 12,605 dollars per tonne, with prices that are still very high today, albeit around 9 thousand dollars. To get an idea, until 2023 the price of cocoa stood permanently under 3 thousand dollars the tonne.

"And with other human beings - Musk replied - as long as they also have, or want, a neuralink". The billionaire has also hypothesized that in the future healthy people will also be implanted BCI, which will allow to reach a "symbiosis" with artificial intelligence. Also on March 3, Neuralink has filed a question to record also Telekinesis and Blindsight brands. Since Telecinese is the (theoretical) psychic ability to move objects without physical interactions, the company's request could be interpreted as a reference to a future product capable of controlling robotic arts and other devices. In November 2024, Neuralink announced that he wants to check if paralyzed people are able to use his system to move a robotic arm. In a February post on the corporate blog, the company has declared that a participant in his study, Alex, is now using a BCI to check various devices, including a robotic arm.

Rumors have long suggested that the entire iPhone 17 lineup would feature ProMotion, but it wasn’t quite clear whether or not iPhone 17 Air would feature Camera Control. It’s expected to come in at 5.5mm, with a roughly $900 price tag, similar to the iPhone 16 Plus it replaces. One area that it won’t compromise in is battery life. Skinnier phones require thinner batteries, and that often mean fewer hours of battery life. This chip initially debuted in the new iPhone 16e, and will also make its appearance in the iPhone 17 Air. This does mean that the iPhone 17 Air won’t support mmWave, though Apple still totes the iPhone 16e as offering “Superfast 5G cellular.” Back in December, The Wall Street Journal also reported such. If this price point holds up, the phone will probably perform particularly well. It’ll certainly be the first iPhone to look truly new in quite some time.

However, Apple is also working on an additional monitor, codenamed J527, per Bloomberg: I’m told Apple is working on a second new monitor code-named J527. Gurman suggests that J427 and J527 might end up not being distinct products, and instead Apple is just prototyping with multiple options for a second generation Studio Display. This would make a fair bit of sense, given the fact that it’s been over 3 years since the first generation Studio Display debuted, and there’s still over a year before the rumored second generation model will launch.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman today shared some new details about the rumored iPhone 17 Air. In his Power On newsletter, Gurman said he was told that the device may start at roughly $899 in the U.S., which means that it would occupy the same price point as the iPhone 16 Plus. This would make sense, as it has been widely rumored that the Air model will take over the Plus model's spot in the iPhone lineup going forward. Despite its rumored ultra-thin and lightweight design, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will provide battery life that is "on par with current iPhones," although he did not mention any specific models. Presumably, this means that the device's battery life will be equal to the lowest-end iPhone 16 model, at a minimum. Gurman said Apple has made hardware and software optimizations to make the iPhone 17 Air more power efficient. There are three rumored features for the iPhone 17 Air that should contribute to the device offering longer battery life than one might have imagined, including a higher-density battery, Apple's power-efficient C1 modem, and the lack of an Ultra Wide camera providing more internal space for a larger battery. Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with the Camera Control button that debuted on all iPhone 16 models last year. The button provides quick access to the camera and related settings, but some people find it to be a nuisance and disable it. Unsurprisingly, look for the iPhone 17 Air to launch in September this year.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

These dummies match recent renders, confirming major design changes. The iPhone 17 Air appears much thinner than other models, making them look bulkier in comparison. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be just 5.5mm thin. It will have a single rear camera, similar to the iPhone 16E. According to analyst Mark Gurman, the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 6.6-inch display. Apple initially considered a 6.9-inch screen but decided against it. These features aim to improve usability while keeping a sleek look. Despite its thin design, battery life is expected to match other iPhones. Apple’s advancements in battery efficiency will likely make this possible. If the iPhone 17 Air is successful, Apple may take bigger risks. Gurman suggests Apple is working on a portless iPhone. The company is also preparing for a foldable iPhone, possibly launching by 2026. The focus is on thinness, camera refinements, and future innovations. As more leaks emerge, excitement builds for Apple’s next big release.

With speculation mounting about Apple’s plans for an ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air launching alongside this year’s iPhone 17 lineup, a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman claims Apple at one point considered removing the charging port entirely—making it the company’s first-ever portless iPhone.

Writing in his weekly Power On newsletter, Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will feature the C1 chip, Apple’s first in-house 5G modem. This chip debuted in the iPhone 16e and is also set to power the iPhone 17 Air. However, like the 16e, this means the 17 Air won’t support mmWave 5G, though Apple still markets the 16e as offering “Superfast 5G cellular.”

“Skinnier phones require thinner batteries, and that often means fewer hours of battery life,” Gurman wrote. “Apple didn’t want to compromise here, so it sent engineers back to the drawing board to redesign display and silicon components, as well as software, to make the device more efficient.”

He also suggested that the iPhone 17 Air will foreshadow a shift to slimmer, portless iPhones in the future.

“The iPhone 17 Air represents the beginning of a sea change for Apple,” Gurman wrote. “If this model proves successful, Apple intends to revisit the idea of port-free iPhones and move more models toward this slimmer design.”

iPhone 17 Air: What We Know So Far

Here’s a roundup of the biggest iPhone 17 Air rumors so far:

Ultra-thin design, potentially the thinnest iPhone yet

C1 Apple modem, replacing Qualcomm chips (but no mmWave support)

Redesigned display, silicon, and battery for improved efficiency

Potential removal of the charging port (though not confirmed)

6.6-inch OLED display with ProMotion

Apple is expected to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup later this year.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

In Brief

Chinese search engine Baidu has launched two new AI models — Ernie 4.5, the latest version of the company’s foundational model first released two years ago, as well as a new reasoning model, Ernie X1.

According to Reuters, Baidu claims that Ernie X1’s performance is “on par with DeepSeek R1 at only half the price,”, and it touts Ernie 4.5’s “high EQ,” allowing the model to understand memes and satire. Both models have multimodal capabilities, allowing them to process video, images, and audio, as well as text.

While Baidu was one of the first Chinese companies to launch a competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it has reportedly struggled to find widespread adoption. Meanwhile, the aforementioned DeepSeek recently unsettled American AI companies and investors by releasing models that were seemingly just as powerful at a much lower cost.

CNBC previously reported that Baidu plans to release its next generation model, Ernie 5, later this year, with further multimodal improvements.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Baidu Inc. released a new artificial intelligence model that articulates its reasoning, in an apparent bid to regain momentum against up-and-coming rivals like DeepSeek.

The Ernie X1 model by China’s internet search leader works similarly to DeepSeek R1 — which shocked Silicon Valley by offering comparable performance to the world’s best chatbots at a fraction of their development cost. Baidu’s reasoning model excels in areas like daily dialogs, complex calculations and logical deduction, it said in a statement Sunday.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/nvidias-ai-empire-a-look-at-its-top-startup-investments/'>Nvidia’s AI empire: A look at its top startup investments</a></h2><b>Source:</b> techcrunch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 00:00:00 <p>
No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Editor’s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Better still, he tells TechCrunch that the customer retention rate is over 30% and that the app generated over $2 million in revenue last month. Although TechCrunch couldn’t validate his download and revenue claims, Cal AI does have a 4.8-star rating on the Apple App Store, with 66,000 reviews, and over 1 million downloads on Google Play with a 4.8-star rating on nearly 75,000 reviews. For instance, the big dog in calorie counting, MyFitnessPal, has its Meal Scan feature. Then there are apps like SnapCalorie, which was released in 2023 and created by the founder of Google Lens. Cal AI’s advantage, perhaps, is that it was built wholly in the age of large image models. The result is an app that the creators say is 90% accurate, which appears to be good enough for many dieters. Cal AI founding team: Jake Castillo (bottom right); Blake Anderson (top right); Henry Langmack (top left); Zach Yadegari (bottom left) Image Credits:Cal AI Yadegari is also earning some fame for his early success. Yadegari built his first business in the ninth grade and sold it for $100,000 to another game company, FreezeNova, when he was 16, he tells TechCrunch. “After quarantine, schools gave out Chromebooks to all of their students, and unsurprisingly, kids tried to abuse this by playing games in school,” he said. The school responded by blocking web access to those game sites. With that sale, he and Langmack watched Y Combinator videos and socialized with the coder crowd on X looking for a new idea. He met Blake Anderson on X, who also became a Cal AI co-founder. Anderson, now 24, had earned notice as a young consumer app coder, too, for creating ChatGPT dating advice apps like RizzGPT and Umax. Yadegari and Langmack had their idea after Yadegari began hitting the gym to gain weight and “impress girls,” he said, smiling. Then they made another cliché choice: They moved to San Francisco to live in a hacker house while building their prototype. But while there, Yadegari, the son of two lawyers, learned a contrarian lesson. It now includes another co-founder, Jake Castillo, 28 who is COO and running influencer marketing, as well as eight full-time employees between developers, a designer, and social media managers.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Smartphone shooter games and nuclear power plants, local government offices in China. Since causing a global whirlwind, DeepSeek has continued to dominate China's domestic news. However, most of this is not news about the company itself. Some companies have found the true use of domestically produced, affordable, cutting-edge AI models, while others simply do so to aim for advertising or show off their country's pride. Local reports have shown in recent weeks that over 20 Chinese automakers (and at least one bus manufacturer) have announced that DeepSeek chatbots will be installed in their cars. It also revealed that dozens of domestic banks, insurance companies and securities companies are using DeepSeek to handle tasks such as training for customer service personnel and designing investment strategies. This enthusiasm is similar to when ChatGPT appeared in the second half of 2022, when US and European companies all appealed to customers and investors that they were working on cutting-edge AI innovation. Over the next two years, major Chinese AI companies like Baidu and Alibaba have also released a number of impressive AI models, but have not attracted the attention of DeepSeek. Cloud computing companies have announced that they will be offering DeepSeek's R1 to their customers, and domestic AI chip manufacturers have optimised their products to run DeepSeek's models. It is unclear what benefits these companies will actually benefit from DeepSeek's AI. For example, German computer accessories manufacturer Cherry has launched the AI ​​mouse in China. This means that you can have instant voice conversations with DeepSeek's chatbots by simply bringing them close to your mouth and pressing a button.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
