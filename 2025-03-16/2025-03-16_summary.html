KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — A massive fire tore through an overcrowded nightclub in North Macedonia on Sunday, killing 59 people and injuring 155 in a chaotic escape during a live concert. The tragedy focused national attention on corruption in the small Balkan country as authorities detained 15 people. 



The death toll may rise further, with 20 of the injured remain in critical condition, according to Health Minister Arben Taravari. The government has declared seven days of national mourning.



The pre-dawn blaze in the eastern town of Kocani left mostly young people dead and injured due to burns, smoke inhalation and a stampede in the desperate effort to reach the building's single exit, officials said. People as young as 16 were among the casualties, they said. 



Videos showed sparkling pyrotechnics on the stage hitting the ceiling followed by scenes of chaos inside the club, with young people running through the smoke as the musicians urged them to escape as quickly as possible.



“We even tried to get out through the toilet, to find bars (on the windows),” Marija Taseva, 19, told The Associated Press, describing the fire that erupted after watching a local pop group at Club Pulse. “I somehow managed to get out. I fell down the stairs and they ran over me, trampled me. ... I barely stayed alive and could hardly breathe.” She suffered an injury to her face.

The fire was the worst tragedy in recent memory to befall the landlocked nation, whose population is less than 2 million, and the latest in a slew of deadly nightclub fires around the world. 



Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said 15 people were detained for questioning after a preliminary inspection revealed the club was operating without a proper license. He said the number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250. 



“We have grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption in this case,” he told reporters without elaborating.

Condolences poured in from leaders around Europe as well as from the office of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized for a month for double pneumonia. 



European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also sent messages of support. “I wish those who were injured a speedy recovery. Ukraine mourns alongside our (North) Macedonian friends on this sad day,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. 



Health Ministry officials said the government had accepted offers of assistance from several neighboring countries, including Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey, where preparations were being made to receive patients with life-threatening injuries. 



In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, three people with severe burns aged 25, 25 and 19 were being treated at a civilian hospital, with one undergoing surgery, health authorities said. Their conditions are critical.



Throughout Sunday, relatives gathered in front of hospitals and city offices in Kocani, some 115 kilometers (72 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, begging authorities for more information. Resident Dragi Stojanov was informed that his 21-year-old son Tomce had died in the fire.



“He was my only child. I don't need my life anymore. ... 150 families have been devastated,” he said. “Children burnt beyond recognition. There are corpses, just corpses inside (the club). ... And the bosses (of organized crime), just putting money into their pockets.”

In Skopje, officials said the injured were sent to hospitals around the country, many being treated for severe burns and smoke inhalation. The effort was being assisted by multiple volunteer organizations.



President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova visited burn victims at a hospital in Skopje and spoke to parents waiting outside. 



“It's terrible ... hard to believe how this happened,” she said, her voice halting with emotion. “We must give these young people courage to continue.” 



The fire caused the roof of the single-story building to partially collapse, revealing the charred remains of wooden beams and debris. Police cordoned off the site and sent in evidence gathering teams in an operation also involving state prosecutors. 



North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country over the next three days.



Pyrotechnics have often been the cause of deadly fires in nightclubs, including the one at the Colectiv club in Bucharest, Romania, in 2015 in which 64 people died.

The aid freeze has upended anti-narcotics efforts in Latin America, with programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Ecuador affected.

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — As Latin America's drug trade surges, the Trump administration's aid freeze has brought crucial anti-narcotics programs to a screeching halt.

The administration paused virtually all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department, including its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. INL has supported governments and security forces worldwide to combat organized crime, human trafficking and drug trafficking.

Last year outside Bogotá, Colombian law enforcement officials captured “El Hombre” — the alleged ringleader of one of the largest drug trafficking networks in the Caribbean. The officers used skills taught to them months earlier by U.S. law enforcement under the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, according to an internal program report.

Colombia's army commander described the capture of Erick Mosquea, the alleged leader of the “Falcon Network,” as “an important blow to international drug smuggling.” U.S. authorities had been on the Dominican drug kingpin's tail since 2016.

In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Colombia's Defense Ministry confirmed that the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, known as ICITAP, has been suspended, and that other training programs have been affected across the security forces and government.

“Given the status of the United States as Colombia's main strategic ally in defense and security, most of the cooperation programs transcend to all levels, which is reflected in the operational development in the fight against drugs and transnational threats in general,” the statement said.

The State Department's aid freeze curtailed a fentanyl screening program in Mexico's largest port. In Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer and a U.S. ally in combating the drug trade, 18 Black Hawk helicopters were grounded after funding for fuel and maintenance was paused.

Washington has begun to issue waivers for these initiatives and some other frozen programs. According to the State Department, waivers for $7.8 million in INL funding have been granted for programs in Mexico to counter production and trafficking in fentanyl, and to dismantle terrorist criminal organizations. But other programs and investments remain paused.

In Ecuador, one of the biggest cocaine-trafficking hubs, the country's navy planned to begin construction this year on a $7 million dock for anti-narcotics operations along a coastline that has gone largely unprotected in recent years; the project is now on hold. In Mexico, about 60 INL contractors were terminated — roughly half of the contract force, one official said. Offices that train police and prosecutors, which relied on INL funds, have been hit by the freeze.

The Trump administration is “undertaking a whole-of-government review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,” a State Department official said in a statement.

Aid “implementing agencies” this month were sent a lengthy questionnaire asking, as part of the review, for a self-declaration that they have not “collaborated with” or been accused of working with terrorist entities, “cartels, narco/human traffickers,” as well as “groups that promote mass migration in the last ten years.”

It also asked whether they are compliant with U.S. policy blocking any funding for abortion counseling, work with any entity “that espouses anti-American beliefs,” have received funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran and whether funded projects “reinforce U.S. sovereignty by limiting reliance on international organizations or global governance structures.”

“The high irony is that just about every dime of U.S. counter-human smuggling training and capacity building comes out of INL,” said John Feeley, who served as an ambassador to Panama under the first Trump administration. “What is the Trump administration's top priority? Stopping illegal and undocumented migration. They shot the golden goose right in the leg.”

The freeze has revealed the region's deep dependence on U.S. counternarcotics programs — and upended it.

For decades, INL has funded programs helping governments around the world strengthen their criminal justice systems and combat international drug trafficking and organized crime.

In Colombia, INL programs have been crucial to boosting the capacity of its police since 1985. Alberto Lara, a former vice minister of defense in the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, said the partnership between Colombian security forces and INL has been essential to combating the growth of transnational criminal organizations.

“The police intelligence would not be what it is today without INL,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst in Colombia for the International Crisis Group.

Dickinson said she worries the freezes will pull Colombia — the  most important, stable and trusted U.S. partner in South America — further away from the United States.

“It's really the moment that Colombia starts asking, is this the right decision geopolitically?” Dickinson said. “If the U.S. is not a dependable partner, Colombia is going to have to look elsewhere.”

A former Petro government security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, estimated that the government depends on the United States and U.S. allies for 70 percent of its security resources.

Over the past month, the official said, it has forced the government to begin looking into new partnerships — on technology and security — with other countries, including India, Turkey and countries in the Middle East.

Much of the U.S. funding to address drug trafficking and other criminal activity goes to international organizations with which the United States closely coordinates. Among them, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime receives about a quarter of its annual budget of about $420 million from the United States — all of which was frozen last month.

While UNODC has been notified of some waivers, much of the money still has not been released and it remains unclear which programs will be permanently cut after Secretary of State Marco Rubio's review is completed.

Unlike some other U.N. and international agencies, most of UNODC spending is program-specific, with INL as well as the Justice and Homeland Security departments requesting and funding specific programs based on U.S. priorities.

In Central America, UNODC has set up cybercrime units and trained local law enforcement to intercept communications used by smugglers to recruit migrants and by sex traffickers. In Southeast Asia, a program counters online scammers, who often target Americans.

In addition, the UNODC publishes an annual World Drug Report, a key source of data on global narcotics flows that is used by U.S. agencies. It operates a lab to detect new synthetic drugs and runs a container screening program in at least 80 ports, including Mexico, training officials and supplying advanced equipment to combat smuggling.

Last week, following complaints from U.S. lawmakers, the UNODC received notification of a waiver for the port container control program in Mexico, although the long-term continuation of that program and others are still subject to the 90-day review to determine what should be permanently stopped. (The pause in aid to the container program was first reported by Reuters).

A number of international aid organization officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid attracting unwanted administration attention, said both the waiver and review processes have been rife with conflicting instructions from different U.S. funding agencies.

In Guatemala, INL has supported a task force that identifies and destroys chemical precursors — including those used for fentanyl. U.S. officials have hailed the program as a success, with five seizures of fentanyl precursors in three months. INL said in a statement to The Post on Friday that “the unit continues to receive INL funded support through DEA.” But while the program was granted a waiver, the full funding hasn't resumed, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment on the record.

Even as waivers emerge, officials said, damage has already been done — programs dismantled, bills unpaid and staff lost.

And it's not just about the halt of the programs, but the way they were publicized, said the former Colombian security official.  The news of the Black Hawk helicopter aid freeze gave armed groups information allowing them to find gaps in the armed forces' resources, the former official said, a dangerous development as the country faces some of its worst waves of violence in years.

ICITAP, the law enforcement training program, had recently launched a project to train about 600 Colombian police officials in investigating and tracking money laundering — crucial specialized skills to dismantle powerful criminal organizations, according to a former official involved in international security cooperation in Colombia.

The program, which had been in the works for years, is now suspended.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on various global issues and his relationships with other world leaders in a podcast interview with American scientist Lex Fridman.

One of the key topics he discussed was his bond with former US President Donald Trump, highlighting their mutual trust and shared commitment to prioritising their respective national interests.

He praised Mr Trump's dedication to America, describing him as "unwavering" and admiring his resilience in the face of adversity. "Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. This showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in nation first - India first," Mr Modi said.

He also commended Mr Trump's humility, citing his gesture of sitting in the audience during the 'Howdy Modi' event in 2019. "That's his humility," he added. He further expressed his admiration for Mr Trump's clear vision and roadmap for his second term as President.

The Prime Minister also reflected on his visit to the White House, where Mr Trump broke protocol by personally giving him a tour. "He personally took me on a tour of the White House," he said. Despite not having met in person for years, he emphasised that their communication and trust remained strong.

When asked about Mr Trump's comment that Mr Modi is a better negotiator, he attributed it to Mr Trump's graciousness and humility. "He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals," he said on Mr Trump's second term as President. He stressed that his approach to negotiation always prioritises India's interests.

In addition to discussing his relationship with Mr Trump, he also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He reiterated India's stance that the war can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation between Ukraine and Russia. He emphasised that he has a close relationship with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and that he would advise them to prioritise diplomacy.

"I can sit with President Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell President Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield," he said.

Furthermore, he discussed the importance of strengthening relations between India and China. He emphasised that competition between the two nations should not lead to conflict, and that dialogue is essential for building a stable and cooperative relationship. Mr Modi highlighted the deep cultural connections between India and China, noting that the two nations have learned from each other for centuries and have contributed significantly to global growth.

"If you look at historical records, for centuries, India and China have learned from each other. Together, they have always contributed to the global good in some way. Old records suggest that at one point, India and China alone accounted for more than 50 per cent of the world's GDP. That's how massive India's contribution was. And I believe our ties have been extremely strong, with deep cultural connections," he said.

Mr Modi acknowledged the border disputes between India and China but expressed optimism about the future of their relationship. He noted that his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping has led to a return to normalcy at the border, and that efforts are underway to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.

"After my recent meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm, and energy will return," he said.

Mr Modi's podcast interview with Lex Fridman provided valuable insights into his relationships with other world leaders, his approach to global issues, and his vision for India's role in the world. His emphasis on dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect highlights the importance of diplomacy in resolving conflicts and promoting global stability.

As he emphasised, "Our focus is to ensure that these differences don't turn into disputes. That's what we actively work toward. Instead of discord, we emphasise on dialogue. Because it is only through dialogue, that we can build a stable, cooperative relationship that serves the best interests of both the nations."

French president says France, UK and others could each deploy ‘a few thousand troops' to key locations to show Ukraine ‘long-term support'

Emmanuel Macron has said France, the UK, and other nations providing security guarantees for Ukraine after any eventual ceasefire would not be aiming to deploy a “mass” of soldiers, but instead could send contingents of several thousand troops to key locations in Ukraine without needing Russia's permission.

The French president told regional French newspapers, including Le Parisien and La Dépêche de Midi, that “several European countries, and indeed non-European ones” had “expressed their willingness” to join a possible deployment to Ukraine to secure a future peace agreement with Russia.

He said this could involve “a few thousand troops” from each state, deployed at “key points” in Ukraine, to conduct training programmes and “show our long-term support”.

Macron added in the interview on Saturday that the proposed contingents from countries that were members of the Nato alliance would serve as “a guarantee of security” for Ukraine and that “several European nations, and also non-European, have expressed their willingness to join such an effort when it is confirmed”.

He added: “Under no circumstances can the Ukrainians make territorial concessions without having any security guarantees.”

Moscow has firmly opposed such a deployment, but Macron said Russia's permission was not needed. He said Ukraine was sovereign. “If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them.”

Macron will meet the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, on Monday and then travel to Berlin on Tuesday to meet the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for talks on Ukraine before an EU summit.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, led a virtual meeting of 30 international leaders on Saturday including Macron and Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as well as leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Afterwards, Starmer challenged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to sign up to a ceasefire if he was serious about peace. He said allies would keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an “operational phase”.

Macron said after the meeting on Saturday that Europe and the US had to put pressure on Russia to accept a proposed ceasefire. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. On the contrary, the Russian president was “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”, he said.

“Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the US, to obtain this ceasefire,” Macron said.

Trump invoked 1798 law previously used to detain Japanese Americans in second world war to justify deportations

The US deported more than 250 mainly Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador despite a US judge's ruling to halt the flights on Saturday after Donald Trump controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime.

El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, said 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 had arrived and were in custody as part of a deal under which the US will pay the Central American country to hold them in its 40,000-person capacity “terrorism confinement centre”.

The confirmation came hours after a US federal judge expanded his ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority that allows the president broad leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations.

The US district judge James Boasberg had attempted to halt the deportations for all individuals deemed eligible for removal under Trump's proclamation, which was issued on Friday. Boasberg also ordered deportation flights already in the air to return to the US.

“Oopsie … Too late,” Bukele posted online, followed by a laughing emoji.

Soon after Bukele's statement, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, thanked El Salvador's leader.

“Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,” he wrote on the social media site X, following up on an earlier post in which he said the US had sent “2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador”.

Rubio added that “over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars”.

On Friday, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to order the deportations of suspected members of the Venezuelan gang he has accused of “unlawfully infiltrating” the US. The US formally designated Tren de Aragua a “foreign terrorist organization” last month.

He claimed the gang members were “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions” against the US.

The Alien Enemies Act has only ever been used three times before, most recently during the second world war, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.

It was originally passed by Congress in preparation for what the US believed would be an impending war with France. It was also used during the war of 1812 and during the first world war. 
 The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, slammed Judge Boasberg's stay on deportations. “This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” Bondi said in a statement on Saturday night.

But lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union contend that the Trump does not have the authority to use the law against a criminal gang, rather than a recognized state.

On Sunday, the Republican senator Mike Rounds questioned whether the deportation flights had ignored Judge Boasberg's order to turn around. “We'll find out whether or not that actually occurred or not,” Rounds told CNN. “I don't know about the timing on it. I do know that we will follow the law.”

after newsletter promotion

El Salvador's multimillion-dollar “terrorism confinement centre” – which is known by its Spanish acronym Cecot – is the centerpiece of Bukele's highly controversial anti-gang crackdown which has seen tens of thousands of people jailed since it was launched in March 2022.

The 40,000-capacity “mega-prison” was opened at the start of 2023 and has since become an essential destination for rightwing Latin American populists keen to burnish their crime-fighting credentials with voters. “This is the way. Tough on crime,” Argentina's hardline security minister, Patricia Bullrich, enthused last year after posing outside Cecot's packed cells.

A succession of social media influencers and foreign journalists have also been invited to tour the prison to document its harsh conditions and help Bukele promote his clampdown, which has helped dramatically reduce El Salvador's once sky-high murder rate.

“The conditions in there are like something you've never seen … Depending on which side of the argument you fall on, it's either the ultimate deterrent or it's an abuse of human rights,” the Australian TV journalist Liam Bartlett reported after visiting El Salvador's “hellhole” prison recently.

“There's no sheets [and] no mattresses. [Prisoners] sleep on cold steel frames and they eat the same meal every single day. Utensils are banned so they use their hands [to eat]. There's just two open toilets in each of these massive cells and the lights stay on 24/7,” Bartlett added. “Imagine how long you would last in these conditions.”

Human rights activists have decried how the mass imprisonments have taken place largely without legal process. More than 100 prisoners have died behind bars since Bukele's clampdown began.

Neither the US nor El Salvador offered any immediate evidence that the scores of Venezuelan prisoners sent to Cecot this weekend were in fact gang members or had been convicted of any offense.

Crew-10 ISS Space Docking Highlights: Four crew members of NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 mission have reached the space station. The Crew-10 mission carries NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov to ISS.

NASA and SpaceX launched a crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS) to bring home NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been stranded in space since last June.

The Dragon spacecraft took off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at 7.03 pm ET on Friday (4.33 am IST). The Dragon docked on to the ISS around 10 am.

Here are the highlights from the crew-10 ISS space docking:

Sunita Williams is classified under the GS-15 pay grade, which is the highest level for federal employees under the General Schedule (GS) system

A pair of astronauts stranded for more than nine months on the International Space Station were a step closer to returning home Sunday after a replacement crew docked with the orbital outpost.

The astronauts were shown on live TV embracing and hugging their counterparts in zero gravity on the space station shortly after their SpaceX Crew Dragon arrived at 0545 GMT.

All the hugs. 🫶The hatch of the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft opened March 16 at 1:35 a.m. ET and the members of Crew-10 entered the @Space_Station with the rest of their excited Expedition 72 crew. pic.twitter.com/mnUddqPqfr

NASA astronauts Sunita Willams and Butch Wilmore, and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov are scheduled to return to Earth on Wednesday onboard SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft.For MS Williams and Mr Wilmore, test pilots for Boeing's new Starliner capsule, the eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months as a series of helium leaks and thruster failures deemed their spacecraft unsafe and had to return empty in September.Astronauts who have travelled on space missions earlier have reported facing difficulty in walking, having bad eyesight, dizziness, and a condition called baby feet where space travellers lose the thick part of the skin on the soles that become soft like a baby's.

For their extended 9-month stay on the ISS, Ms Williams and Mr Wilmore will earn a prorated salary between $93,850 - $122,004 (approximately Rs 81 lakh - Rs 1.05 crore).





Including the $1,148 (around Rs 1 lakh) in incidental pay, their total earnings for the mission is expected to be $94,998 - $123,152 (approximately Rs 82 lakh - Rs 1.06 crore).

During their mission, the Crew-10 crew is scheduled to conduct material flammability tests to contribute to future spacecraft and facility designs. They will engage with students worldwide via ham radio and use its existing hardware to test a backup lunar navigation solution. According to NASA, astronauts themselves will also serve as test subjects, with one crew member conducting an integrated study to better understand physiological and psychological changes to the human body to provide valuable insights for future deep space missions. 



Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi  is "excited" to be officially part of the Expedition 72.Onishi has spent roughly 113 days in space as a flight engineer aboard the ISS as part of Expeditions 48 and 49. In 2016, he maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and became the first Japanese astronaut to capture the Cygnus spacecraft in space.

"Houston, thanks for tuning in early morning. Great to see our friends arrive," said Sunita Williams.


"I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out of the window and saw the space station for the first time...,"said 
Anne C McClain, NASA Astronaut and US Army Colonel."You can hardly put it into words. The ride up the Falcon 9, orbiting the earth for the last couple of days, it has been absolutely incredible. It is something none of us could do by ourselves. You cannot be great without the greatness of others. And the greatness of the ground control team has really shined through in getting us up here safely," she added.McClain was selected in June 2013 as one of eight members of the 21st NASA astronaut class. On her first spaceflight, McClain spent 204 days as a flight engineer during Expeditions 58 and 59 and completed two spacewalks, totaling 13 hours and 8 minutes.McClain is a commander of NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 mission, to conduct research, technology demonstrations, and maintenance activities aboard the microgravity laboratory.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore embarked on a 10-day mission aboard the Boeing Starliner on June 5, 2024, but the spacecraft experienced thruster malfunctions during its approach and docking maneuvers.This resulted in an extensive investigation by NASA and Boeing back on the ground, with the space agency finally declaring the Starliner too risky to carry astronauts back home. The Starliner instead returned empty, without experiencing further major issues.

The two astronauts are stranded in space for nearly 10 months now.

While walking on Earth, our feet face a lot of resistance in the form of gravity and friction, which makes the skin on the soles thicker. It protects us from feeling discomfort and pain while protecting us from general wear and tear.



However, after spending months in space, the harder skin comes off and the feet are left very soft and tender. Until the feet build up hard skin again, which can take from a few weeks to a couple of months, walking can be uncomfortable and even distressing.

 Says aim is to make military even more combat ready 

 By Olena Harmash 

 KYIV, - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday appointed Major-General Andriy Hnatov as Ukraine's chief of the general staff as Kyiv seeks to speed up army reform. 

 A decree published on the presidential website said General Hnatov, a deputy chief of staff, would replace Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Barhilevych. 

 "We are consistently changing the armed forces to make them even more combat ready. To achieve it, we are changing the management system and introducing clear standards," Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in a statement. 

 Hnatov has 27 years of military experience, having risen through the ranks from marines brigade commander to leading troops in the eastern Donetsk region. 

 Barhilevych would now oversee military standards and strengthen discipline in the army, the minister said. 

 With the war against Russia in its fourth year, Ukraine is seeking to restructure and strengthen its military as it fights the much bigger enemy. 

 Ukraine is on the back foot on the battlefield, with Kyiv's troops retreating from Russia's Kursk region and battling under growing pressure in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been advancing for months. 

 Military analysts estimate that about 880,000 people currently serve in the Ukrainian armed forces. 

 Despite the wartime challenges, the country has implemented changes to shed the Soviet legacy and make its military more efficient, appointing younger commanders with combat experience and supporting innovations. Last year Ukraine introduced a dedicated unmanned systems force. 

 At the start of this year, Ukrainian military officials said the country would move away from its brigades-based system towards a "corps" system of larger units, aiming to improve coordination among its forces spread along more than 1,000 kilometers of frontline and speed up decision-making. 

 One of Ukraine's top fighting units - the 3rd separate assault brigade - announced on Friday that it was reorganized into a corps. 

 "We plan to change the principles and methods of this war," Commander Andriy Biletskyi said in a video announcing the change. "This means changing the course of the war in favour of Ukraine."

Pair recently met to discuss Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other political matters, Sunday Times says

Nigel Farage has reportedly met Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's adviser turned nemesis, after the Vote Leave founder suggested voters should back Reform UK at the local elections.

Cummings, who was once a sworn enemy of Farage during the EU referendum as he battled to keep control of the leave campaign, is reported to have met the Reform leader to discuss Whitehall changes, which allies said was the strongest sign yet that Farage was taking seriously the idea of becoming prime minister.

Cummings and Farage were at odds for years in the run-up to the referendum and during Cummings's time at No 10, with Farage calling him a “horrible, nasty little man”. Cummings's Vote Leave won the official campaign designation during the referendum.

According to the Sunday Times, the pair met recently for a “friendly chat about the general scene” including subjects such as US politics, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, as well as “how No 10 and the Cabinet Office really work, about the catastrophe of the Tory party and about what Reform has to do to replace the Tories”. A Reform spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Cummings was said to be in advanced talks to launch his own new party – the Start-Up party – but in February he posted on X that he believed voters should now back Reform UK.

Asked by one X user on Sunday who he would vote for at the next general election, Cummings wrote: “Dunno yet but obviously everyone should vote Reform this spring … No downsides, just upsides.”

In a post on his Substack, Cummings claimed Britain needed a significant political realignment including a merger of the Conservatives with Reform. He wrote: “Shove out Kemi [Badenoch] ASAP, take over Tories, get Trump/Elon to facilitate a merger with Reform, tip in a third force of elite talent and mass energy so voters see an essentially new political force whose essence is a decisive break with 1992-2024 … break the coalition supporting [Keir] Starmer, take over No 10, do regime change.”

Farage's party is on course for a number of gains at the local elections in May, including potentially winning control of eight local councils, according to Electoral Calculus.

Nevertheless, Reform has been in turmoil for the past fortnight due to a significant rift between Farage and Rupert Lowe, one of his former MPs who has been thrown out of the party in a battle over bullying allegations and referred to the police. Lowe had criticised Farage in a Daily Mail interview and since claimed he had been censored by the party on immigration issues.

Researchers use innovative cameras to identify fish species hindering coral reef restoration

Marine scientists in Florida working to help reverse a calamitous decades-long decline in coral reefs caught fishy “porch pirates” in the act with an innovative underwater doorbell-style surveillance camera.

The footage showed that three corallivorous species – redband parrotfish, foureye butterflyfish and stoplight parrotfish – were responsible for eating more than 97% of coral laid as bait by the researchers at an offshore reef near Miami.

The findings, they say, can help inform coral reef repopulation efforts following a 90% decline in Florida's coral cover since the 1970s following unprecedented bleaching events caused by the climate emergency, particularly record ocean heat over the last two summers.

“Intense fish predation on newly outplanted corals has emerged as a major restoration bottleneck. The main goal was to address our lack of knowledge of the fish species that target corals after outplanting,” said Diego Lirman, a global leader in coral restoration research. He is a project leader and associate professor at the University of Miami's (UM) Rosenstiel school of marine, atmospheric and earth science.

“Identifying the fish species responsible for coral predation would allow practitioners to avoid reef sites or areas within sites with high abundances of those species and, similarly, select the right coral species for the right outplanting site,” Lirman said.

“The coral-baited underwater cameras provide insight into corallivore behavior and preferences and allow documentation of predation at various sites rapidly and without incurring the cost of outplanting.”

Lirman's team, funded by a grant from the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida, designed and built a number of recording devices using GoPro cameras in waterproof housing attached to a PVC frame, and with lead weights for stability. After shaky preliminary results, divers secured later models to the seabed at Paradise Reef, close to Key Biscayne in Miami-Dade county, using masonry nails and cable ties.

The so-called C-Bruvs (coral-baited remote underwater video system) were set to record time-lapse video, and footage was collected at 24- and 48-hour periods after deployment and weekly thereafter for the duration of the six-week project.

Lirman said the team overcame initial setbacks including overheating external batteries and leaks causing flooding in the camera housing, while the research was also not immune to petty porch pirate-style pilfery familiar to homeowners above ground who have recorded thefts on their doorstep.

“One of the C-Bruvs with a surface buoy attached was stolen from the reef,” he said.

Overall, however, the researchers considered their experiment a success. After analysis of the imagery, they determined redband parrotfish, which are prolific in the Caribbean and waters off Florida, were the most voracious predators, accounting for 56.3% of bites on the nine coral species put out in fragments as bait.

Next came foureye butterflyfish with 36.9%, and stoplight parrotfish with 4%. The three species, Lirman said: “showed clear preferences” for two or three particular types of coral, which received more than 65% of all bites recorded.

UM marine scientist and research master's graduate Erin Weisman presented the findings to the Reef Florida symposium of conservation leaders at Miami's Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in November.

“By identifying, for the first time, the main fish predators as well as their preferred diet, reef restoration practitioners can select sites and species that would minimize predation impacts and maximize restoration success before large-scale, costly outplanting is implemented,” Lirman said.

Future similar research, he added, could introduce elements of artificial intelligence.

“Analyses of the videos were extremely time-consuming, requiring a constant rewinding and stopping of the footage to record and annotate coral/fish interactions,” he said.

“It will be beneficial to explore AI software that can be trained to identify fish and their behaviors to automate the analysis process.”

Exclusive: Doctor Who writer says he feels ‘a wave of anger heading towards us' and hostility in UK as well as US

Russell T Davies has said gay society is in the “greatest danger I have ever seen”, since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November.

Speaking to the Guardian at the Gaydio Pride awards in Manchester on Friday, the Doctor Who screenwriter said the rise in hostility was not limited to the US but “is here [in the UK] now”.

“As a gay man, I feel like a wave of anger, and violence, and resentment is heading towards us on a vast scale,” he said.

“I've literally seen a difference in the way I'm spoken to as a gay man since that November election, and that's a few months of weaponising hate speech, and the hate speech creeps into the real world.”

“I'm not being alarmist,” he added. “I'm 61 years old. I know gay society very, very well, and I think we're in the greatest danger I have ever seen.”

Since his inauguration, Trump has ended policies giving LGBTQ+ Americans protection from discrimination. He has also restricted access to gender-affirming healthcare, said the US would only recognise two sexes, and barred transgender people from enlisting in the military.

Davies also used his keynote speech at the awards ceremony, which rewards the efforts made to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the UK, to criticise Trump, and the president's ally Elon Musk.

“I think times are darkening beyond all measure and beyond anything I have seen in my lifetime,” he told the audience, which included the singers Louise Redknapp and Katy B, and the Traitors contestants Leanne Quigley and Minah Shannon.

Davies said he had turned 18 and left home in 1981, adding: “And that is exactly the year that rumours and whispers of a strange new virus came along, which came to haunt our community and to test us in so many ways.”

“The joyous thing about this is that we fought back,” he said. The community “militarised, campaigned, marched and demanded the medicine”.

He added: “We demanded the science. We demanded the access.”

When he wrote the TV series Queer As Folk in the late 1990s, he said, it was part of a movement, with writers “fomenting ideas” and putting gay and lesbian characters on screen.

Had he been asked to imagine then what life for LGBTQ+ people would be like in 2025, “I want to say it's going to be all rainbows,” he said, “skipping down the street hand-in-hand, equality, equality, equality.”

But the peril the gay community now faced, he said, was even greater than that in the 1980s.

“The threat from America, it's like something at The Lord of the Rings. It's like an evil rising in the west, and it is evil,” Davies said.

“We've had bad prime ministers and we've had bad presidents before. What we've never had is a billionaire tech baron openly hating his trans daughter,” he added.

Musk, the de facto head of the “department of government efficiency”, bought the social networking site Twitter, which he renamed X. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found hate speech on the platform rose by 50% in the months after it was bought by the billionaire.

“We have never had this in the history of the world,” Davies said. “It is terrifying because he and the people like him are in control of the facts, they're in control of information, they're in control of what people think, and that is what we're now facing.”

But Davies said the gay community would do “what we always do in times of peril, we gather at night”, and would once again come together, and fight against this latest wave of hostility and oppression.

“What we will do in Elon Musk's world, that we're heading towards, is what artists have always done,” he told the Guardian, “which is to meet in cellars, and plot, and sing, and compose, and paint, and make speeches, and march.”

“If we have to be those rebels in basements yet again,” he added, “which is when art thrives, then that's what we'll become.”

A delegation of more than 150 Druze dignitaries from Syria visited holy sites in Israel over the weekend. It was the first time since 1974 that such a delegation crossed the border.Videos circulating showing a visit of a Druze delegation to holy sites in Israel for first time in 50 years. pic.twitter.com/RGQTRLjiIC— Ohad ✡️ اوهاد ✡️ אהד (@MOhadIsrael) March 16, 2025  They came from the Druze villages in the Hader region, which is adjacent to the Golan Heights.Their two-day visit was coordinated with the highest security and diplomatic bodies in Israel.

Many of those who crossed the border have immediate families on the Israeli side. They were welcomed warmly and lovingly. The encounter was very moving.”Up until 1974, Druze delegations made a pilgrimage to the Tomb of Jethro, Amar said. But the visits came to a halt after the demilitarization agreement following the Yom Kippur War, separating families from both sides of the border and impeding religious figures from the Druze community in Syria from visiting their holy sites.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “These were, first and foremost, religious, social, and communal visits,” Amar said. “They had nothing to do with politics or what is happening in the Middle East. We just renewed a measure that existed in the past, as the holiest place for the Druze is located near Tiberias.” AdvertisementThe latest visit was criticized sharply by many in the Arab world who saw it as a step toward normalization, which is still an obscene word for many, Amar said.“Many in the Arab world saw the visit in a negative way,” he said. “But 150,000 Palestinians work in Israel daily, and tens of thousands came from Gaza up until [the] October 7 [massacre]. We've never seen anyone make much noise about this, though. I really don't understand what the fuss was about.”An entirely different reality that is unfolding in Syria made the visit possible, Amar said. After years in which these visits were forbidden by the former regime, things were changing, he said.  Nevertheless, Amar was not optimistic about the current Syrian leadership.“No matter how much some in the West try to embellish it or ignore the genocide that was committed against the Alawite community, it is ISIS who seized power in Syria,” he said. “Whitewashing this is wrong and misleading. They are an extremist ISIS regime. I hope and believe that the Druze will know how to defend themselves from them. But, if necessary, Israel should lend a hand.”“Any clashes that start there will undoubtedly make it to our border,” he added. “We must not tolerate a similar event to October 7, nor allow ISIS to settle on our borders. This is an issue of national security for Israel, and it must not be allowed. We need to preserve ourselves as a state and as a community that is committed to each other. We should not and will not allow a similar massacre to take place.”More visits like this should be allowed, Amar said.“I think we will try to have more meetings,” he said. “It's been 51 years. It was like a holiday for us. We haven't seen our people on the other side of the border for so long, and some of us have never even met them at all.”The Druze delegates “were all excited and moved,” he added. “Videos show sheikhs in tears. It was such an emotional meeting. It's hard to explain. We, the Druze in Israel, were cut off from the Druze in Syria and Lebanon, and this is why this meeting was so touching.”“Just as Jews see themselves as being committed to all Jews around the globe, so are we Druze committed to our brethren,” Amar said. “We are a peace-loving people. We do not harm anyone, and we want to live in peace. I hope we remain in touch from now on.”

We should not and will not allow a similar massacre to take place.”More visits like this should be allowed, Amar said.“I think we will try to have more meetings,” he said. “It's been 51 years. It was like a holiday for us. We haven't seen our people on the other side of the border for so long, and some of us have never even met them at all.”The Druze delegates “were all excited and moved,” he added. “Videos show sheikhs in tears. It was such an emotional meeting. It's hard to explain. We, the Druze in Israel, were cut off from the Druze in Syria and Lebanon, and this is why this meeting was so touching.”“Just as Jews see themselves as being committed to all Jews around the globe, so are we Druze committed to our brethren,” Amar said. “We are a peace-loving people. We do not harm anyone, and we want to live in peace. I hope we remain in touch from now on.”
            



Their two-day visit was coordinated with the highest security and diplomatic bodies in Israel. It included a visit to holy sites, such as the Tomb of Jethro (Nabi Shu'ayb), near Karnei Hittin in the Galilee, and warm reception ceremonies with their Israeli brethren.

The dignitaries then took part in the annual “sheikhs' march,” which promotes Druze heritage in Israel.Druze MK Hamad Amar (Yisrael Beytenu), who received the delegation at a welcoming ceremony, spoke with The Jerusalem Post about the historic visit.

Many of those who crossed the border have immediate families on the Israeli side. They were welcomed warmly and lovingly. The encounter was very moving.”Up until 1974, Druze delegations made a pilgrimage to the Tomb of Jethro, Amar said. But the visits came to a halt after the demilitarization agreement following the Yom Kippur War, separating families from both sides of the border and impeding religious figures from the Druze community in Syria from visiting their holy sites.

We just renewed a measure that existed in the past, as the holiest place for the Druze is located near Tiberias.” AdvertisementThe latest visit was criticized sharply by many in the Arab world who saw it as a step toward normalization, which is still an obscene word for many, Amar said.“Many in the Arab world saw the visit in a negative way,” he said. “But 150,000 Palestinians work in Israel daily, and tens of thousands came from Gaza up until [the] October 7 [massacre]. We've never seen anyone make much noise about this, though. I really don't understand what the fuss was about.”An entirely different reality that is unfolding in Syria made the visit possible, Amar said. After years in which these visits were forbidden by the former regime, things were changing, he said.  Nevertheless, Amar was not optimistic about the current Syrian leadership.“No matter how much some in the West try to embellish it or ignore the genocide that was committed against the Alawite community, it is ISIS who seized power in Syria,” he said. “Whitewashing this is wrong and misleading. They are an extremist ISIS regime. I hope and believe that the Druze will know how to defend themselves from them. But, if necessary, Israel should lend a hand.”“Any clashes that start there will undoubtedly make it to our border,” he added. “We must not tolerate a similar event to October 7, nor allow ISIS to settle on our borders.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

A series of airstrikes hit the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Saturday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered the strikes (Sun. 16 March).

CAIRO (AP) — The United States and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the U.S. launched airstrikes to deter the rebels from attacking military and commercial vessels on one of the world's busiest shipping corridors.



“We're not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot. And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday. He said these are not the one-off retaliation strikes the Biden administration carried out after Houthi attacks.



President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions.



The Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels, in what they call acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally.



The attacks stopped when a Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office — but last week the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month.



There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the overnight U.S. strikes killed at least 31 people, including women and children, and wounded over 100 in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.



The airstrikes were one of the most extensive attacks against the Houthis since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.



Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. Rubio said some Houthi facilities had been destroyed.



The Houthis' political bureau has said the rebels will respond to the U.S. strikes and “meet escalation with escalation.” 



The rebels on Sunday claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group with missiles and a drone, but two U.S. officials told The Associated Press they were not tracking anything. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.



Rubio said that over the past 18 months the Houthis had attacked the U.S. Navy “directly” 174 times and targeted commercial shipping 145 times using “guided precision anti-ship weaponry.”



The attacks sparked the most serious combat the U.S. Navy had seen since World War II.



On Sunday, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it “plays no role in setting the national or operational policies” of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run TV.



Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on X, urged the U.S. to halt its airstrikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.



The U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the rebels. The U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said was bound for the Houthis.



The United States, Israel and Britain previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but the new operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.



The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.

Belarus's Lukashenko calls Putin his “elder brother,” but over 30 years in office, he's had to balance close ties to Moscow with keeping his country from being swallowed.

NOVAYA GUTA, Belarus — Three years after Russia used Belarus as a launching pad for its brutal invasion of Ukraine, the border here between Belarus and Ukraine is eerily quiet.

Gone are the days when the highway at this crossing was a bustling conduit between the port of St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea and the port of Odessa on the Black Sea. Now the crossing is used only for exchanges of prisoners of war and dead soldiers. Rows of dragon teeth puncture the surrounding fields and roads, and the way to Ukraine is barricaded and desolate.

Belarus lost a lot in severing its relationship with Ukraine — the West doubled down on sanctions after Minsk allowed Russian troops to use its territory as a staging ground. And Belarus is more than ever seen as a proxy for Moscow, with President Alexander Lukashenko even acquiescing to hosting Russian tactical nuclear weapons, including Moscow's latest, the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile.

While Lukashenko has expressed “no regrets” about Belarus's role in the conflict, his public statements belie a more complex picture of a country walking a delicate tightrope between its Soviet past — and an aggressive eastern neighbor — and its aspirations for renewed engagement with the European Union.

After Russia helped Lukashenko weather protests against his rule, he leaned even more into his country's pre-independence Soviet identity for everything from language to education. At the same time, however, he made overtures to the West to present himself as a mediator. As Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed for full integration of the two countries and a common currency, Lukashenko has managed to thread the needle, serving as a key ally to Moscow and a backer of the invasion — he appeared with Putin on Thursday as they pledged to deepen defense cooperation — while maintaining a degree of strategic sovereignty.

A rare trip to Belarus by a Washington Post reporting team has shown how Russia's shadow continues to lengthen over the country, and how it has been caught between two neighbors in a high-stakes conflict that could upend the global security order. With its strategic location between the NATO states and Russia, Belarus is key to any discussion about the future of European security. The question for Western governments is what role Belarus could play — will it just be a proxy for Russia or could Lukashenko become a go-between?

Unlike Lukashenko, residents in the border town of Novaya Guta deeply regret the war.

They recounted with grim faces their shock when columns of Russian armored vehicles rumbled through the town one night three years ago, as rockets and missiles roared overhead. Some even fear that a new “special military operation,” Putin's euphemism for the war, could absorb Belarus.

Sofia — who like many in this article is not identified by full name because of potential backlash from authorities for speaking to the international press — said people in the village are afraid that what was done to Ukraine could happen to Belarus, too.

“People who don't pay attention to this do not care. And those who do are afraid that Belarus may become a little Russia,” she said.

Sofia said her sister in Ukraine had cut contact since the war started — a story similar to those of several others in the village with relatives across the border. “We are guilty. This war was our fault, too,” Sofia said sadly.

On peak days, about 15,000 people and 7,000 vehicles used to flow along this highway. Border guards remember the “great” relations they used to have with their neighbors to the south, while residents recall a time when there was no border at all — one could just walk into Ukraine. Many here speak a blend of Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian.

“We haven't been lucky with our history here,” said one border guard, Andrei.

“So many people have died in this war,” he said. “The blood that's been spilled will only be forgotten after several generations.”

Still, Ukrainians should understand that resistance to Russia is futile, Andrei added — they should never have expected to win this war. In a time of such global instability, he said, small nations must choose bigger partners.

Anton Bykovsky, press secretary for Belarus's State Border Committee, had a similar message.

“When the middle brother fights with his older brother, as younger brothers, we naturally do everything possible to ensure that the family is in order and that there is no discord,” he said.

The hulking Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 30 years, frequently refers to the slighter Putin as his “older brother,” and the Belarusian's time in office has seen the development of a close, symbiotic relationship with Russia that began with their formation of a new union in 1995, four years after the fall of the Soviet Union  during a brief moment of liberalization for Belarus.

Putin has often suggested he would like to fully integrate the two countries. Lukashenko, who once called talks of unification “exceedingly stupid,” has so far managed to stave this off, but Putin has been taking advantage of Lukashenko's increasing vulnerability to push the countries even closer together.

“What we see now in Belarus is a creeping occupation, and this is done with consent of Lukashenko. Lukashenko does not serve the interests of Belarus, but the interests of Putin and Russia,” exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said in an interview. She added: “This could lead us to the situation where Belarus becomes completely swallowed by Russia.”

Tikhanovskaya is recognized in the West as the true victor in Belarus's 2020 presidential election, an event that ignited massive anti-government protests and, after a violent crackdown, deepened Belarus's international isolation.

In the nearly five years since those protests swept Belarus, Lukashenko has brutalized, jailed and exiled his critics. Today, a repost on social media is enough to get you jailed for criticism of the government.

The bond between Russia and Belarus has also deepened, culminating in Minsk's role in the invasion.

Western sanctions have made the economy of this country of just 9 million even more dependent on Russia, the focus of two-thirds of its trade.

“Within the Union State, we have many common, interconnected ties. … It's as if we are a single, joint space,” explained Sergey Avramenko, director of Minsk Tractor Works, using the formal term for the Russia-Belarus relationship. His sprawling operation, built on the order of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, exports 30 to 50 percent of its production to Russia.

But despite this reliance on Moscow, Lukashenko, a wily former collective-farm boss, is quick to demonstrate his readiness for renewed outreach with the West.

A fresh release of political prisoners was welcomed by the White House, and there has been speculation it could be a ploy to persuade the Trump administration to ease sanctions, as the United States recalibrates its relationship with Russia.

Lukashenko may be “looking to turn the page,” said Belarusian activist Dmitry Bolkunets. But the West should not be fooled, he warned. “He will exploit this tactic, continuing to imprison new individuals and trading their release.”

On an unusually bright January afternoon at the Brest Fortress, dozens of glum-looking schoolchildren were training in self-defense, first aid and rappelling at a building still riddled with World War II-era bullet holes.

The fortress, at the border with Poland, lies at the heart of one of modern Belarus's founding legends — it is where 1,000 Soviet soldiers died defending the city from invading Nazi forces at the start of a war that would go on to kill almost a third of the Belarusian population.

Viktor Ivanov, director of the Brest Regional Center for Youth Creativity, and his instructors are passionate that young Belarusians should be encouraged to connect with their history, which in the instructors' eyes reached its peak with Belarus's contribution to the Soviet victory over fascism.

But the message and historical narrative taught at the youth center is selective, critics argue, saying it ignores Belarus's medieval past, its history under Polish rule and its periods of independence. The program focuses largely on World War II — and is strikingly similar to government youth outreach in Russia.

Since the 2020 protests, Belarus has poured money into youth clubs like these and created new positions at schools to supervise military and patriotic upbringing. Last year, authorities announced a unified history textbook for Belarusian and Russian students.

“Lukashenko has mixed together the Second World War, obedience to his regime and support for the war in Ukraine into a single narrative, and he uses this narrative to confront Western liberal values, democracy and human rights,” said Franak Viacorka, Tikhanovskaya's chief adviser.

Meanwhile, people are warned away from places that tell a different story about Soviet times. At Kurapaty, a pine forest on the outskirts of the capital where Soviet-era secret police killed tens of thousands of people before World War II, surveillance cameras ring the woods and signs warn visitors they are being recorded.

There is no official memorial here. Authorities instead built a busy road that cuts through the forest, dismantling dozens of wood crosses that reminded Belarusians of the scale of the state's slaughter.

Language is another identity battleground in Belarus. As Valzhyna Mort, a Belarusian poet and professor at Cornell University, puts it: Once you open your mouth in today's Belarus, your political stance is determined.

After 2020, speaking Belarusian — closer to Ukrainian and Polish than Russian — became a sign of resistance to the regime, even though it is one of two official languages. Its teaching and use have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as the country has  experienced a new wave of Russification, drawing it closer to its neighbor.

Lukashenko has long regarded Belarusian as a “poor” dialect and, over his three decades in power, has weakened its use in preference of Russian. Belarusian still appears on street signs, government buildings, electoral ballots and public transportation — but it is very rare to hear it spoken.

“Belarusian has been reduced to a costume and a kitsch,” Mort said. “The government is not about to eliminate it completely, but our predominant culture is Russian, and Russian power is transmitted to us through the Russian language.”

There are islands of Belarusian still out there. At the Yakub Kolas museum in Minsk — dedicated to the life of the famous Belarusian writer of the early 20th century — guided tours are given almost exclusively in Belarusian.

Kolas's life was shaped by the state's repression of the Belarusian language. He was jailed for speaking Belarusian, and he smuggled early drafts of his first book out of prison by hiding scraps of paper in his long black beard.

“People still feel it is dangerous to speak Belarusian today and they are scared,” said one of the museum's guides. “It is linked to this Soviet period of repression.”

Belarusian publishers and writers have been jailed or pressured into exile. Teachers have been fired for conducting lessons in the language. Belarusian news sites have been shuttered. Conversely, the language has experienced something of an online renaissance, with a growing number of Belarusian-language content creators on TikTok, as young Belarusians seek to engage with their roots.

The Belarusian language is dying, said Sergei, 34, who works in digital sales in Minsk. “We are like a base for Russia and we can't do much about it,” he said, adding that Ukraine was right to fight for its national identity.

Not everyone is against Lukashenko's policies or a closer union with Russia.

Public sentiment has improved toward the authorities since 2020. Amid fears that Russia could try to draft Belarusians to fight alongside Russian troops, people credit Lukashenko with keeping the country out of direct involvement in the war.

Stronger economic ties with Russia, which have stabilized an isolated Belarusian economy and increased wages, have also tempered ripples of discontent.

Sergei Azhanilok, an economist, told The Post that it would be a “good thing” if Belarus and Russia were a single powerful state. “If we unite the territories, we wouldn't see much difference — we are one people, the Slavs,” he said.

Lukashenko is maintaining a “comfortable status quo” with Russia, according to Artyom Shraibman, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. But, in a recent analysis, he said that could be threatened by the momentous changes afoot with the war in Ukraine and talk of peace negotiations.

If the campaign against Ukraine were to be frustrated, he warned, Russia might “incorporate Belarus as a consolation prize.”

“Any shift in the current equilibrium spells danger for Minsk,” Shraibman said, adding that Lukashenko's “task ahead is monumental: keeping relations with his guarantor from going to either extreme.”

The Kennedy Center and BLM mural have been targeted, the newspaper is in freefall – and the Maga movement is gaining a foothold

It was an audience more accustomed to stifling a cough or resisting the temptation to unwrap a sweet. But when they spotted vice-president JD Vance taking his seat at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Thursday night, classical music-goers erupted in unrestrained boos, jeers and shouts of “You ruined this place!”

The noisy protest exemplified a culture clash taking place in the nation's capital. It came in the same week that work began to remove a giant “Black Lives Matter” mural near the White House, a top political columnist quit the Washington Post newspaper and a spending bill passed by the House of Representatives sought to impose drastic budget cuts of $1.1bn on the District of Columbia (DC).

Compounding it all, with Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) slashing the federal workforce, some residents fear that Washington could go the way of Detroit half a century ago: a city that loses its principal industry and goes into a downward spiral.

“Everybody feels the atmosphere is toxic here and you can't get away from it,” said Sally Quinn, an author, journalist and socialite. “People are so distraught and so down and in despair. The question is, what can we do? That's what people are asking in Washington. The biggest feeling of all is impotence: they can't stop it.”

Trump has always been an anachronistic presence in DC, where the Republican lost last year's presidential election to Democratic opponent Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points. During his first term, he only ventured out to one restaurant in the city – his own - and never attended the annual Kennedy Center Honors or White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

But as in other arenas, Trump's second term is more direct, determined and intentional, and includes the cultural equivalent of precision air strikes against the mostly liberal residents of Washington.

On Monday crews started work to remove a giant yellow “Black Lives Matter” slogan painted on a street one block from the White House. DC mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, had ordered the painting and renamed the intersection Black Lives Matter Plaza in June 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

Its erasure five years later amounts to a public acknowledgement of how vulnerable DC is now that Trump is back in the White House and Republicans control both houses of Congress. The work is expected to take about six weeks and the words will be replaced by an unspecified set of city-sponsored murals.

Among those who gathered to witness the work on Monday was Megan Bailiff, chief executive of Equus Striping, the pavement marking company that originally painted the letters. She told the Associated Press its presence was “more significant at this very moment than it ever has been in this country” and described its its removal as “historically obscene”.
  Trump has seized control of the Kennedy Center, the crown jewel of the city's performing arts scene, installing himself as chair and loyalist Ric Grenell as president. Numerous artists and producers have cancelled shows, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical Hamilton, while ticket sales reportedly dropped roughly 50% week-over-week after Trump announced his takeover.

The backlash against Vance at this week's National Symphony Orchestra concert was a palpable demonstration of the anger. Coming just weeks after the vice-president publicly berated Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, some could not help but note the irony that he was attending all-Russian programme that included Stravinsky's Petrushka, the story of three puppets brought to life by a charlatan.

The booing incident prompted a retort from Grenell, who wrote on the X social media platform: “It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views. Diversity is our strength.” Meanwhile this week Trump added Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center's board.

Quinn observed: “They're being very imaginative in their atrocities. They trashed the Kennedy Center and threw everybody out and put Laura Ingraham on the board. The Kennedy Center has been so much a part of the city for so long and suddenly it's gone. They've lost in the first couple of weeks 50% of their ticket sales. They're not getting the donations they used to get. All kinds of acts are cancelling and people I know say they won't ever set foot in that place.”

The Trump International hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue is no more but the Maga (Make America great again) movement is gaining a foothold in other parts of the city. Butterworth's, a bistro on Capitol Hill, has drawn Trump allies including Musk and Kash Patel and has been dubbed “Steve Bannon's restaurant”.

Bannon, who lives nearby but has no formal connection to Butterworth's, said in a text message it reminds him of one of his favourite areas in London. “It's Mayfair come to Capitol Hill,” he explained.

Co-owner Raheem Kassam, a former editor-in-chief of Breitbart News UK and ex-aide to British rightwing populist Nigel Farage, insisted in an online message: “We are a Capitol Hill restaurant that welcomes everyone and refuses to discriminate based on politics. Our investors come from a range of backgrounds, and includes left-liberals, apolitical-types, LGBT+ people, and minorities.

“But frankly, we're not really interested in ticking boxes. We're interested in great food and good vibes. If you fancy that, we're the place for you, no matter who you are. Just please, no hats for dinner service.”

Washington has often had a tenuous peace with the federal government when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House. It is now facing its most urgent threat since it was given the power of home rule during the Richard Nixon administration.

This week the House passed a continuing resolution to fund the federal government that includes a provision treating DC as a federal agency for budget purposes. This would force DC to revert to its fiscal year 2024 spending levels, resulting in an estimated $1.1bn cut to its current 2025 budget over the remaining six months.

The funds are locally raised taxpayer dollars, not federal subsidies. City officials warned of “calamitous reduction in services ranging from schools to public safety”. Washington could face potential hiring freezes, layoffs across various agencies, renegotiation or termination of leases and decreased security and janitorial services.

Paul Strauss, shadow US senator for DC, said: “I'm shocked that it's now House Republicans that are taking steps to defund the police, which was normally a position staked out by extreme members of the far left. To have the House vote to cut the police budget so substantially seems difficult to understand.”

After final passage of the continuing resolution, the Senate unanimously passed a bill by voice vote to restore the $1.1bn in spending cuts to the DC government. The DC bill, which Trump supports, must still be approved by the House when it returns on 24 March.

Democrats and DC officials view the proposed budget cuts as politically motivated, potentially aimed at undermining the self-governance of the predominantly Democratic city. Trump has previously suggested that DC would be better off under total federal control.

Such is the concern that Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, even floated the idea that Washington could be temporarily incorporated into Maryland. Raskin said on the City Cast DC podcast: “If you guys want to think about coming back to Maryland for this period, you would definitely be safer in the free state than you'd be under the brutal thumb of Maga colonialism.”

Simultaneously, Washington is facing economic headwinds due to deep federal job cuts orchestrated by Doge under the Trump administration. Unemployment claims recently rose 25% in one week and are four times as high as one year earlier. Glen Lee, the district's chief financial officer, has forecast that DC could lose 40,000 federal jobs – down by a fifth – and projected a loss of revenue of $1bn over the next three years.

Bill Galston, a chair in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank, noted that the federal government is a vast establishment with 2.3 million workers spread across the country, of whom 80% are not in Washington. “So I don't think that life in Washington DC has been upended yet,” he said.

“What there has been and of course is is a pell-mell replacement of a sense of security with a pretty near total sense of insecurity. The sense of what might happen to an individual is a larger effect than the actual firings. People are hunkering down.”

The shift in Trump's second term has been more dramatic than anyone expected, added Galston, a resident of 43 years. “There's an element of incredulity. People who tried to imagine in the starkest possible detail what could happen almost universally concede that, while they have let their imaginations run riot, they feel they didn't go far enough.

“There is something slightly surreal about all of this, but I wake up in the morning and I walk down the driveway in a very old fashioned way for my three newspapers and I open up the package and it's very real.”

As Doge downsizes the government, the Trump administration has considered offloading numerous federal properties, raising concerns about vacant buildings and a decline similar to that of Detroit after the car manufacturing industry was gutted. An essay in the New York Times newspaper this week was headlined: “DC Is Becoming Another Hollowed-Out Company Town.”

Quinn said: “It is a one industry town, and basically what they're doing is destroying the government, which is what Trump said he would do. Even Trump supporters are stunned. I know from some of my friends on the Hill that Republican senators and congressmen are freaking out, too, because they're hearing from their constituents.”

Quinn was married to the late Ben Bradlee, who was editor of the Washington Post when it reported on the Watergate scandal, which forced Nixon's resignation. Long a vital part of the fabric of the city, the storied newspaper has been in freefall, financially and editorially, over the past year.

Billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, who donated to and attended Trump's inauguration, recently ordered that the paper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Opinions editor David Shipley resigned because of the shift. This week Ruth Marcus, who had worked at the Post since 1984, also quit. Several star reporters have left in recent months.

David Maraniss, a former associate editor of the Post who recently resigned after 48 years at the paper, said: “What's happening at the Post is connected to Trump and that's very disturbing to me. I don't think Bezos genuflecting to an autocrat is something I want to have any part of. I consider the Post a public trust almost. That sounds sort of idealistic and naive but it's larger than an owner; it's an identity.

“What it represents in terms of journalistic ethics and integrity has been damaged almost beyond repair and this is a time when newspapers of that sort are needed more than ever. For us to recede from that push for freedom of speech, the First Amendment, for the search for truth is depressing to me.”

For many of Trump's critics, Washington feels like a city under occupation. Maraniss added: “It's the second occupation but it seems more pronounced than the first. My feelings are complicated by a double whammy of what's happening in my newspaper and in the city, in the country and in the world. It all seems wrapped together. In terms of Washington there's anxiety, a feeling of a darkness coming over the city and enormous uncertainty about what people should do.”

Numbers using satellite broadband system has been growing but users are having second thoughts due to Musk's role in Donald Trump's administration

Tesla sales have tumbled, X has had an exodus of users, and now it seems cracks are appearing among those who have turned to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system as a means of staying connected in remote areas.

While the number of Starlink users has been growing, some subscribers have been venting their frustrations over Musk's political machinations, saying they will no longer use the high-speed satellite internet system.

Barry Nisbet, a Scottish fiddler whose Shetland business combines music with seafaring, cited Musk's controversial salute at a Donald Trump inauguration event as one of the final straws for why he was leaving Starlink, even if it put him at a disadvantage.

Nisbet said: “I've been deeply uncomfortable for some time and the role he played in the US election, as well as the monopoly he has, deeply bothers me.”

While Starlink dominates its sector, signs of users' unease come as excitement grows among European tech enthusiasts about the prospect of a homegrown alternative finally emerging. The value of shares in Eutelsat, the French owner of London-based Starlink rival OneWeb, have shot up by 500% since Trump's Oval Office row with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Eutelsat's chief executive told Bloomberg the company could replace Starlink in a couple of months in places like Ukraine.

Viasat, which owns UK network Inmarsat, is also in talks with European governments about replacing Musk's Starlink.

In the UK, Starlink is used mainly by people and businesses in rural areas who have poor broadband access, although there is also a minority of “preppers” and people who buy the tech as fans of Musk.

An installer of Starlink for businesses and homes in southern England said that, for now, there was no better alternative to Starlink for those who needed fast access to the internet.

He said: “In the industry we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it's a necessary tool and a solution that exists in a lot of rural areas, especially with the poor investment in infrastructure. But on the other hand, we have now got to deal with Elon – to put it politely – being a twat.

“The majority of people who use it are those in need of it due to being a remote area, but there is also a small minority ‘tinfoil hat' brigade element.”

Richard Opie, a consultant living in a semi-rural part of Northumberland, said he had got Starlink during the pandemic because there was not enough capacity on BT, but was now considering whether to stay with the company.

He said: “It's a godsend, especially in remote areas, but things have developed politically since then. Elon Musk is a very different figure and Tesla showrooms are being burned to the ground. I'm uncomfortable with him getting into bed with Trump and the way he has thrown his weight around.

“It's something we have wrestled with and looked for alternatives but we're sort of stuck for the moment.”

Nisbet's comments on a Facebook “Starlink UK Users' Group” – that he could no longer justify supporting Starlink – sparked a spirited debate among users.

Mel Sayer, another Starlink user, wrote: “I refuse to go to Trump's hotels as I won't give a penny to Trump. I now don't want to fund ‘President Musk' on his endeavours after that salute.”

Mike Brown wrote: “I share your thoughts but am stuck with Starlink for now. Amazon are due to launch a rival service but probably not until next year. I'll be jumping ship as quickly as possible.”

Others are sticking with Starlink. Paul Feakins, a consultant in West Sussex, said: “People use Starlink because they can't get an internet connection any other way, yet these idiots think they're making a statement by cancelling it because they happen to disagree with Elon on something.”

Starlink has been approached for comment.

Starlink has grown rapidly in the UK, from 13,000 subscribers three years ago to 87,000 last year.

Such has been the popularity of Starlink in some areas of the UK that the company has been levying an extra “congestion charge” for those areas where there is high demand.

The company provides ultrafast broadband speeds via a constellation of satellites. British customers typically pay from £75 a month for a 30-day term, plus £299 for hardware.

For non-customers, Starlink may be better known for its use in Ukraine, which has been vital for Kyiv's battlefield communications, after Starlink terminals were rushed there after Russia's invasion in February 2022.

Lately, however, the prospect of Ukraine being cut out of Starlink has grown, with Reuters reporting that US negotiators have threatened Ukraine with losing the system. Musk posted on X at the weekend: “Their entire frontline would collapse if I turned it off.”

Treatment of Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, who has been suspended from senate, shines light on women's rights 

Last July, Nigeria's third-most powerful man gave a rare apology on the floor of the senate which he heads.

Godswill Akpabio had chastised his colleague Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan for speaking out of turn, saying: “We are not in a nightclub”. But after receiving what he said was a deluge of insulting text messages from Nigerians, he apologised publicly a few days later.

In recent weeks, the two have been at the centre of a political row that has gripped the country, after an interview that Akpoti-Uduaghan gave to the broadcaster Arise TV in late February in which she accused Akpabio of sexual harassment.

She alleged that in one incident Akpabio had told her that a motion she was trying to advance could be put to the senate if she “took care” of him. In another, she said that on a tour of his house he had told her – while holding her hand – “I'm going to create time for us to come spend quality moments here. You will enjoy it.”

Akpabio has denied the allegations.

Akpoti-Uduaghan submitted a petition to the senate alleging sexual harassment, but on 6 March the ethics committee struck it out on procedural grounds. It also handed her a six-month suspension without pay, citing her “unruly and disruptive” behaviour during an unrelated argument in the senate about seating arrangements.

The accusations have dominated conversations and highlighted longstanding women's rights issues in the socially conservative country, where no woman has ever been elected governor, vice-president or president.

Only four women serve in the 109-member senate, a drop from the seven female senators elected in 2015. The number of women in the 360-member House of Representatives has also declined, from 22 in 2015 to 17.

In a phone interview from New York on Monday last week, hours before speaking on the matter at a joint session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UN Women, Akpoti-Uduaghan railed against her suspension. “This was orchestrated to silence my voice,” she said. “That action is an assault on democracy … I am not apologising for speaking my truth.”

Women's rights groups have condemned her suspension, and hundreds of women and girls marched in the states of Lagos, Enugu, Edo and Kaduna on Wednesday during a “We are all Natasha” protest convened by the civil society coalition Womanifesto.

“Her suspension and the process that led to it was a shambolic show of shame,” said Ireti Bakare-Yusuf, a radio broadcaster and founder of the non-profit Purple Women Foundation, which is part of Womanifesto.

Ahmed Tijani Ibn Mustapha, a spokesperson for Akpabio, said Akpoti-Uduaghan's petition alleging sexual harassment had not followed guidelines because she had authored and signed it herself rather than asking another senator to do so.

He also said that after she had refiled the petition correctly, the senate began a four-week investigation into the claims.

Akpoti-Uduaghan, an opposition People's Democratic party (PDP) senator from the central state of Kogi, first tried to enter politics in 2019 with a run for Kogi governor. Thugs reportedly loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) jeered her during the campaign, calling her a sex worker, and on one occasion attacking her and her driver. “This is definitely not an election,” she told reporters at the time. “This is almost like a war zone.”

Four years later, on the eve of the senate election she was contesting, portions of the main roads leading to her district were excavated overnight. She accused the APC of attempting to prevent her from campaigning. Authorities said they were protecting residents against terrorist attacks, citing a December 2022 bomb blast by an Islamic State affiliate.

She lost the election, but in November 2023 a tribunal overturned the results, paving the way for her to become one of Nigeria's youngest senators.

Akpabio, a political veteran, was the subject of another sexual harassment allegation from a former public official in 2020. He denied the allegation at the time and recently said he would sue his accuser. He had previously made headlines in 2018 when he predicted an election victory for his APC party by drawing comparisons with Hitler's invasion of Poland. Last year, shortly after becoming senate president, he was involved in another controversy when a senator was suspended for saying there were inconsistencies in the budget.

After Akpoti-Uduaghan's suspension, other senators coalesced around Akpabio, a powerful ally of the country's president, Bola Tinubu.

One male senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan had fabricated the claims because she was angered by her removal as chair of a coveted senate committee in February. Current female senators dismissed her claims on national TV, while one former senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan's claims were “a sign of weakness” and that sexual harassment happened only in schools.

“Male senators do not surprise me,” said Bakare-Yusuf of the reaction. “They mansplain even the basic of black and white to justify their selfishness. As for the female senators, disappointed is an understatement [but] like all hegemonic structures, patriarchy also has gatekeepers.”

In the aftermath of her accusation, a false claim that Akpoti-Uduaghan had borne six children by six different men surfaced on social media. The senate spokesperson said a kiss she shared with her husband on the senate premises before submitting her petition was “unspeakable” and an act of “content creation”. Over the last two weeks, crowds of pro-Akpabio protesters have turned up in public to abuse her in Abuja.

“Politicians sided with the senate president whom they believe has the power to grant them favours … and the poor were paid by those who have the most money to protest,” said Glory Ehiremen, senior analyst at Lagos-based geopolitical risk advisory, SBM Intelligence.

Some opposition senators have visited Akpoti-Uduaghan to show support. She also said she had received supportive emails from women across Nigeria, including some who were afraid to speak up about their own experiences. “In Nigeria, most women who are sexually harassed in workplaces don't even tell their husbands because they are afraid of being judged,” she said.

As the episode unfolds, more women are praising her bravery, but few think Nigeria's #MeToo moment has arrived.

Ehiremen said an entrenched culture of impunity was a barrier to justice. “The elite Nigerian cannot get justice unless they have alliances with the ‘powerful',” she said. “Never mind the ordinary Nigerian.”

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) filed a lawsuit challenging as unconstitutional the Trump administration's actions to deport international students and scholars who protest or express support for Palestinian rights.The lawsuit, filed on Saturday in the US District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeks a nationwide temporary restraining order to block enforcement of two executive orders signed by US President Donald Trump in the first month of his term.  The lawsuit comes after the detention of a Columbia University student, Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old permanent US resident of Palestinian descent, whose arrest sparked protests this month.Justice Department lawyers have argued that the US government is seeking Khalil's removal because Secretary of State Marco Rubio has reasonable grounds to believe his activities or presence in the country could have "serious adverse foreign policy consequences." Rubio on Friday said the United States will likely revoke visas of more students in the coming days.

The First Amendment guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all persons within the United States, without exception," said Abed Ayoub, national executive director of the ADC.Chris Godshall-Bennett, the group's legal director, said the litigation seeks immediate and long-term relief "to protect international students from any unconstitutional overreach that stifles free expression and deters them from fully engaging in academic and public discourse."

BERLIN (AP) — An assailant poured a liquid over a woman on a tram in eastern Germany on Sunday and set her on fire, police said. The woman was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, while the attacker fled.

Police said no other people were hurt in the incident in the eastern city of Gera. Passengers stopped the tram by pressing an emergency button, and the assailant took the opportunity to flee as the doors opened. 

The tram driver immediately put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, and the 46-year-old woman was taken to a hospital by helicopter.

Police later said they were searching for the victim's husband, also aged 46. They called for anyone who sees him or knows where he is to inform them immediately, and said they couldn't currently rule out him posing a danger to the public.

There was no immediate word on a possible motive for the attack, or on what exactly the liquid used was.

A fire tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia early Sunday, killing 59 people, apparently after on-stage fireworks set the venue ablaze, authorities said, announcing arrest warrants for four people.They said 155 injured people had been taken to hospitals across the country, 18 of them in critical condition. Some of the serious cases were to be taken to other European countries for treatment.

The blaze started in the Club Pulse in the eastern town of Kocani around 3:00 am (0200 GMT), as the place was packed with more than 1,000 mostly young fans attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo called DNK.

"Initially we didn't believe there was a fire. Then there was huge panic in the crowd and a stampede to get out," one young woman who was at the concert told local media outside a hospital in the capital Skopje.

Fire crews and paramedics responded quickly and "tried to resuscitate people... but it wasn't enough", said the woman, who was waiting outside for one of her friends, who was being treated for burns to his hand.

The fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices "used for light effects at the concert", said Interior Minister Pance Toskovski, who visited the scene with Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski.

"Sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke," Toskovski said.

The interior ministry announced that arrest warrants had been issued for four people in relation to the tragedy, and a criminal investigation opened. They did not immediately give further details about those targeted by the warrants.

"According to the information that we have, there are 59 persons dead of which 35 are identified. Of the identified, 31 persons are from Kocani and four from Stip," Toskovski said.

"The number of wounded, according to latest information up to noon (1100 GMT), is 155 persons who are in hospitals across the country," Toskovski said.

"Preparations are being made to transport people seriously injured in the fire in Kocani to top hospitals in several European countries," the head of North Macedonia's Crisis Centre, Stojanche Angelov, said.

The head of the Kocani hospital, Kristina Serafimovska, told media that the patients being treated there were aged between 14 and 25.

"Seventy of the patients have burns and carbon monoxide poisoning," she said.

One of the members of the DNK duo that had performed, Vladimir Blazev, had burns to his face and needed assistance breathing, his sister told local media outlets.

- 'Very sad day' -

"This is a difficult and very sad day" for the country, Prime Minister Mickoski wrote on his Facebook account.

"The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the grief of their families, their loved ones and their friends is immeasurable," he said.

Pope Francis sent prayers to the victims and survivors and wished "the families of the dead, mostly young people, the expression of his deep condolence, signifying spiritual closeness to the wounded", the Vatican said in a message addressed to the bishop of Skopje, Kiro Stojanov.

Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire showed the use of "stage fountains", which are a type of indoor fireworks used during performances.

Other videos published by media showed huge flames emerging from the building, a two-storey white structure in Kocani, a town with 30,000 residents.

An AFP photographer in the town saw military medical vehicles arrive to reinforce staff at the local hospital tending to some of the injured.

Leaders of neighbouring countries offered help.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Rossen Jeliazkov spoke on Facebook of the fire being "a huge human tragedy" and offered to have his air force fly some of those injured to medical facilities in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and the city of Varna.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on X, formerly Twitter, that he sent "heartfelt condolences to the people of North Macedonia for the lives lost in the tragic fire".

"Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time," he added.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said he was "at a loss for words" and expressed readiness "to provide any assistance that may be needed".

There were also messages from parts of the European Union, which North Macedonia has ambitions to join.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on X that she was "deeply saddened about the tragic fire" and that "the EU shares the grief and pain of the people of North Macedonia".

Former talkshow host takes public her battle to remove her guardian, ordered by a court due to dementia and aphasia

The note dropped from the upper floor window of an assisted living facility in New York on the morning of 10 March contained a simple message: “Help! Wendy!!” it read.

For any patient inside, it would have been tragic. But, astonishingly, the writer of this note was Wendy Williams, a trailblazing television talkshow host and once one of the most recognisble daytime TV faces in America.

While half the nation pays attention to Donald Trump, the other half, it seems, is fixated on Williams, who has been under a court-ordered conservatorship since 2022 and whose clear struggles with her illness are captivating – and shocking – the US.

Williams, 60, wants to be released from her conservatorship, which she claims is similar to one that Britney Spears was place under, and has maintained in several interviews that she is “not cognitively impaired” as she was diagnosed to be two years ago.

Known as “the shock jock diva” and “the biggest mouth in New York”, Williams was taken to a hospital by police after dropping the notes, and later told the media that she passed a mental-capacity test, with questions including naming the current president, “with flying colors”.

“I am not incapacitated as I've been accused, and this floor that I live on is the memory unit,” Williams recalled telling officers upon their arrival. “The people who live there don't remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on?”

The talkshow host later “evaded staff” to get out of her facility and went to dinner with her niece at a NoHo restaurant, allegedly triggering a police report, but was spotted at her table writing in a journal and having a “super time”.

Her caretaker, Ginalisa Monterroso, now wants her to get an independent medical evaluation. But her court-ordered guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, didn't want her to undergo a police mental-capacity test and told Vanity Fair she sees “issues” with Williams's speech when it isn't scripted.

Tracking Williams, and her ups and downs, is a full-time job as an army of “Wendy Watchers” will attest.

Williams was diagnosed with dementia and aphasia in 2023, one year after she exited The Wendy Williams Show. But for more than a decade Williams, who grew up in a white New Jersey suburb, delivered hot takes on pop culture-dominated daytime talk TV. Before that she'd been on Hot 97 talk radio with a format similar to Howard Stern.

She was famous for high-profile clashes with celebrities. She feuded with Beyoncé in 2012, saying she was “fortunate” that her TV in the kitchen has closed-captioning “so I'll be able to understand what she says. You know Beyoncé can't talk. Beyoncé sounds like she has a fifth-grade education. She can't talk.”

She got into a beef with Whitney Houston over Houston's lesbian relationship with her friend Robyn Crawford, and her drug use. Houston threatened to stop by William's studio and beat her up. She called out Sean Combs, AKA Puff Daddy, long before he was charged with sex trafficking.

When Williams was eventually fired from Hot 97 in 1998, it was after she had shared a doctored image of Combs in a compromising position with another man on her website.

But Williams's feuds came against a backdrop of personal turbulence. Six years ago, she filed for divorce from her husband and former producer Kevin Hunter. She later appeared to confirm he had fathered a child with a younger woman.

“He inconvenienced my life with his attitude, a baby and a lot of affairs,” she told USA Today about Hunter in 2021. “And now I'm going to inconvenience his by letting him know that I've got the best apartment, I've got the best view, I've got the best concierge, I live the best life, I eat the best food. I have the best of the best.”

In her autobiography, Wendy's Got the Heat, she described how her dealer would bring cocaine to the studio and keep it in a green container on the kitchen counter. “I'd be on the couch at three o'clock, wide awake,” she wrote.

How far the public is willing to go in following the unfolding chapters of the Wendy Williams story is subject to the continued returns of attention capital investment.

“Even if you've never watched her show, she's been around,” said the Syracuse University media professor Bob Thompson. “Eventually it might become something everybody cares about, but it's not there yet. In the grand scheme of things – like will the constitution survive? – it's not much, but it's got the typical dramatic things: is it rehab, does she need rehab? Is she broke? She's pretty much got it all.”

Never one to shy away from the limelight, on Friday, Williams kept her struggles in the public eye and phoned in to the ladies of The View television show to complain about her guardian and the judge overseeing her conservatorship.

“These two people don't look like me, they don't dress like me, they don't talk like me, they don't act like me,” Williams said. “I need them to … get off my neck.”

It seems Elon Musk is drawing inspiration from his own viral haircut. He is bringing it back. Earlier this month, old photos of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO from 2021 resurfaced. The photos showed him with a distinctive, unconventional haircut. Now it appears the tech mogul is bringing back the controversial look which quickly caught the public's attention.

Musk's haircut went viral earlier this month as many found it similar to the looks kept by Adolf Hitler and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un which began a controversy online. However, it seems that he was unbothered by the buzz his haircut created online as Musk is bringing back the look.

In the latest post shared by him on X, the 53-year-old posed with his 4-year-old son X A-Xii. Along with the picture he wrote, “Going back to this haircut.” While he did not specify the exact haircut he was referring to, the haircut he does at the moment does look similar to his 2021 style which many netizens compared with Hitler's. The picture Musk posted showed side shaves with long waves at the top of the head.

A user wrote on X, “what's the haircut name?” A second user wrote, “Similar to a former world leader. I like it!” A third user wrote, “Bro chill my girl uses this app.”

Another user wrote, “So long as you are ready for the memes!” while one wrote, “Did you know hitIer also got haircuts.”

Many users also suggested Musk to try other hairstyles as one user wrote, “Elon, instead try this...”

Another user suggested, “I like this.”

Leaders on left bet on Musk's bravado to pull party out of political weeds as CEO eyes social security and health cuts

For most of the 17-minute interview, Elon Musk stuck to a script. He was just a tech guy on a mission to “eliminate waste and fraud” from government.

His slash-and-burn cost-cutting crusade was making “good progress actually”, he told the Fox Business commentator Larry Kudlow on Monday, despite sparking a backlash that has reverberated far beyond Washington.

“Really I just don't want America to go bankrupt,” he said.

But then Kudlow asked Musk to look forward. Would the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) still be in place in a year? He thought so – his assignment wasn't quite complete. Musk, the world's richest man, then pointed to social security, a widely popular federal program that provides monthly benefits to retirees and people with disabilities, and other social safety net programs: “Most of the federal spending is entitlements. That's the big one to eliminate.”

For weeks, Donald Trump and Republicans have insisted that social security, Medicaid or Medicare would not “be touched”. Now Musk was suggesting the programs would be a primary target. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, Democrats pounced.

“The average social security recipient in this country receives $65 a day. They have to survive on $65 a day. But you want to take a chainsaw to social security, when Elon Musk and his tens of billions of dollars of government contracts essentially makes at least $8m a day from the taxpayers,” Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a floor speech the following day. “If you want to uncover waste, fraud or abuse, start there.”

As the second Trump era comes into focus, Democrats have found a new villain: an “unelected billionaire” whose bravado – and sinking popularity – they believe may offer their party a path out of the political wilderness.

“There's nowhere in America where it is popular to cut disease research, to gut Medicaid and to turn off social security,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “So it's hard to see a place where what Musk is doing for Trump doesn't become an albatross for Republicans.”

The White House has championed Doge's work while reiterating that Trump would “protect” social security and other entitlement programs. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite mounting criticism of Musk, the president has embraced his beleaguered ally, who spent close to $300m helping elect him to the White House. This week, Trump hailed Musk as a “patriot” as he showcased Teslas from the south lawn of the White House. The president selected a red sedan, hoping to boost the electric car company, which has suffered a sharp decline in sales and stock prices since its chief executive launched his Doge operation. The White House has said that if conflicts of interest arise, “Elon will excuse himself from those contracts”.

But Musk and his chainsaw-wielding approach to downsizing government is playing a starring role in early Democratic ads and fundraising appeals. Progressive activists have staged “nobody elected Elon” protests across the country while other groups are targeting Tesla showrooms and dealerships. On a “fighting oligarchy” tour across the country, Senator Bernie Sanders pointed to Musk's growing political influence as a central threat to American democracy.

“Most American people, they can't name us. They don't know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration and Elon Musk and the GOP are planning for them,” Katherine Clark, the House minority whip, said on Friday. “It's why you're seeing this uproar in town halls.”

While Democrats have much to say about Musk, they are less sure of how to stop him.

Many of Doge's actions have been halted or stopped in the courts. This week two federal judges ordered government agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary employees who were fired as part of Doge's purge of the federal workforce.

Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats are under enormous pressure to use any leverage they have to block Trump and Musk. A Republican-authored bill to fund federal agencies through September and avert a shutdown fiercely divided Democrats this week. House Democrats and progressive activists erupted in anger at Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who ultimately relented and helped pass the measure rather than risk a funding lapse and, in his words, give Musk and Doge an opportunity to “exploit the crisis for maximum destruction”.

Public polling underlines Democrats' interest in Musk. A new CNN survey found that just 35% of Americans held a positive view of the billionaire Trump adviser, a full 10 percentage points lower than the president. The poll also found that he is notably better known and more unpopular than the vice-president, JD Vance.

More than six in 10 Americans said Musk had neither the right experience nor the judgement to carry out a unilateral overhaul of the federal government, though views broke sharply along partisan lines. Roughly the same share said they were worried the reductions would go “too far”, resulting in the loss of critical government programs.

A survey conducted by the left-leaning Navigator Research late last month found that views of Doge as a standalone cost-cutting initiative were marginally favorable, in line with other polls that have found Americans are broadly supportive of its stated mission to root out waste and improve efficiency. But there are signs Americans don't like the approach or implementation so far.

When the effort was framed as “Elon Musk's Doge”, views turned sharply more negative. The poll also captured the far-reaching impact of the cuts: 20% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal service; 19% say they or someone they know have lost access to a federal grant and 17% say they or someone they know has quit or been laid off from a federal government job.

“Musk is the face of everything that people are worried about in the Trump administration,” Ferguson said, adding: “To a lot of people, putting Elon Musk in charge of protecting the middle class is like putting Jeffrey Dahmer in charge of protecting a morgue.”

after newsletter promotion

Democrats believe Musk's comments on entitlement programs are particularly potent – the world's wealthiest man advocating for steep cuts to programs designed to help retirees and vulnerable Americans.

In the Fox Business interview, Musk claimed the programs were rife with waste and fraud, suggesting as much as $600bn to $700bn – or nearly a quarter of their budget – could to be cut. Federal watchdogs have long identified improper spending as a problem, but Musk's figure exceeds their estimates.

Musk has derided social security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”. As evidence of widespread fraud, Musk repeated a debunked theory, favored by Trump, that social security benefits are being paid to dead centenarians. The head of the agency has rejected the premise. Democrats have warned that Trump and Musk were using false or exaggerated claims of fraud as a “prelude” to slash the program or privatize it, as many conservatives have long desired.

After Musk's comments aired, the White House swiftly issued a “fact check” insisting that Musk had only advocated for eliminating waste and highlighted several occasions in which Trump has vowed to protect Americans' benefits.

Republicans also rushed to clarify Musk's comments. “Look, Elon Musk is a brainiac with an IQ that I cannot even fathom. He is not a master of artful language,” Mark Alford, a Republican representative of Missouri, said on CNN. “We are not going to eliminate social security, Medicare and Medicaid. That's sheer nonsense.”

It was a rare break with Musk, whom Republicans have been loath to cross, well aware that he not only has the president's full support and ear but a fortune to squash any dissent within the ranks. During Trump's address to Congress earlier this month, Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation as the president heaped praise on his work. They publicly warn that Democrats oppose Musk's fraud-and-waste removal efforts at their own political peril.

Yet there are signs that Republicans are beginning to worry. House Republicans have reportedly been advised not to hold in-person town halls after several widely publicized confrontations with constituents furious over loss of government jobs and services. And despite Trump's close alliance with Musk, even he seemed to indicate it was time to reign him in. “We say the ‘scalpel' rather than the ‘hatchet',” the president wrote in a social media post.

Republicans are weighing deep cuts to entitlement programs as a way to offset the cost of extending Trump's sweeping tax cuts aimed largely at the wealthy. Trump has praised the House plan.

“The Republican party at this point has wrapped both arms around the third rail and is holding on as the electricity flows,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin, where a contest next month will provide an early test of the party's anti-Musk strategy.

On Thursday night, Wikler hosted a People v Musk grassroots event to discuss the billionaire's impact on the 1 April state supreme court race, which will determine the balance of power between conservative and liberal justices on Wisconsin's highest bench. Musk has spent millions of dollars through his America Pac, in an effort to tip the scales in favor of Brad Schimel, a county judge and former Republican attorney general. Democrats are supporting Susan Crawford, a county judge and former attorney for Planned Parenthood.

Wikler said Musk's ascendancy in Washington – and his influence in the race – has turned liberal voters in the state from “concerned to panicked to outraged with the heat of that 1,000 suns”.

“If Susan Crawford wins this race, and Musk and Schimel lose,” he said, “then that will be a big bat signal in the sky to Democrats everywhere that fighting back is not only the right thing to do, it's good politics.”

Nightclub fire in North Macedonia kills 59, injures over 100

Fire ripped through a packed nightclub early on Sunday in the North Macedonian town of Kocani, killing 59 people and injuring more than 100, after sparks ignited the roof over a live band.

Arrest warrants have been issued for four people in connection with the fire, said Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski. State news agency Mia said police have detained the owner of the club over the incident.

One video from the event, verified by Reuters, showed a band playing on stage flanked by two flares firing white sparks into the air, some of which set the ceiling alight.

The fire caused immediate panic, and friends and loved ones were separated as people fled to the exits.

"Everyone was trying to save themselves," survivor Marija Taseva, 22, told local TV 5.

As she tried to escape, Taseva fell to the ground and people ran over her, leaving her with an injury on her cheek. In the rush, she lost contact with sister, who is still missing.

"We can't find her in any hospital," she said.

Health Minister Arben Taravari said 148 people were hospitalized in Skopje, Kocani and surrounding towns. Eighteen people were critically injured, Taravari said.

North Macedonia's MRT public broadcaster reported that 27 people were hospitalized at the Skopje City Hospital with severe burns, and another 23 were being treated at a clinical centre. Among the injured were minors, it said.

The fire, which began at about 3 a.m., was caused by "pyrotechnic devices" whose sparks triggered the blaze, Toshkovski said.

Ljupco Kocevski, North Macedonia's public prosecutor, said five prosecutors would investigate the incident.

"At the moment, orders have been issued for collecting of evidence" and some people were being interviewed, Kocevski said, without elaborating.

Firefighters doused the charred and smoking entrance to the Pulse nightclub, as ambulances rushed from the scene, TV footage from a local broadcaster showed. Reuters pictures showed the club's corrugated iron roof burned through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said on Facebook: "This is a difficult and very sad day for Macedonia! The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, the pain of the families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable."

After visiting injured in a hospital in Skopje, North Macedonian President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, dressed in black and fighting tears, said authorities were ready to do everything to help all affected.

"I simply cannot comprehend this ... what a disaster, what a tragedy."

Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Indian-American student, vanished while on a spring break trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The last person to see her, 22-year-old Joshua Riibe - now a person of interest - has provided conflicting accounts of the night's events.

Timeline of Events

Ms Konanki, a pre-med University of Pittsburgh student from South Riding, Virginia, travelled to the Dominican Republic with five friends on vacation. On March 5, Ms Konanki and her friends went out to party at a resort nightclub in Punta Cana. They were seen on surveillance footage at the club and later walking to the beach at around 4:15 am. By 5:50 am, most of her friends had left the beach, leaving Ms Konanki alone with Joshua Riibe, a college senior from Minnesota whom she had met that night.

CCTV footage from the Riu Republica Resort shows Ms Konanki walking arm-in-arm with an unidentified man, now believed to be Mr Riibe, along a resort pathway, accompanied by her friends. She was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, shorts, and her hair tied in a ponytail.

Who is Joshua Riibe?

Joshua Riibe is a college senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, pursuing a degree in land surveying. He is a pool lifeguard.

Described by his family as a "kind, humorous, and community-driven young man," Mr Riibe has been involved in student activities, sports, and volunteer work, ABC News reported.

He was not originally part of Ms Konanki's travel group but met her on the night of her disappearance.

Joshua Riibe's Testimony

Joshua Riibe told investigators he was with Sudiksha Konanki on the night she disappeared.

According to a transcript obtained by NBC News, Mr Riibe said they were "in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little" when a strong wave pulled them out to sea.

Mr Riibe, who is a trained pool lifeguard, claimed he tried to hold Ms Konanki under his arm while swimming back to shore, making sure she could breathe. He struggled to stay afloat, saying, "I took in a lot of water."

When they reached shallower waters, Mr Riibe set Ms Konanki in front of him and saw her "walking at an angle in the water." He last asked if she was okay but didn't hear her response as he began vomiting the seawater he had swallowed.

By the time he recovered, Ms Konanki was nowhere to be seen. Thinking she had left, Mr Riibe passed out on a beach chair. Surveillance footage later recorded him returning to his hotel alone, hours later.

Joshua Riibe's Conflicting Statements

Initially, Mr Riibe gave multiple versions of events.

Version 1: He vomited, saw her standing, and assumed she left.Version 2: He felt sick, left the water, and last saw her in knee-deep water.Version 3: He saw her walking along the shore before he passed out.

Joshua Riibe's Passport Seized

Authorities have named Mr Riibe a 'person of interest', not a suspect. His passport was confiscated, and he remains under police surveillance at his hotel.

Statement From Joshua Riibe's Parents

Albert and Tina Riibe, the parents of Joshua Riibe, released a statement now shared by various media outlets.

"We express our deep sorrow and solidarity with the family of Sudiksha Konanki during this painful time. Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through, and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible."

Joshua Riibe "is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning."

His parents claimed he was questioned under "irregular conditions" without official translators or legal counsel until March 12. They alleged he was confined to his hotel room under police watch since the investigation began and was repeatedly taken for long interrogations starting March 6, the day Ms Konanki disappeared.

Search Underway

Authorities, including the FBI, have launched a large-scale search using drones, helicopters, scuba divers, boats, and all-terrain vehicles to locate Ms Konanki. Dominican officials admit the chances of finding her alive are "minimal."While authorities suspect drowning, Ms Konanki's family fears she may have been kidnapped. Her father has urged officials to expand the investigation.

Ranjani Srinivasan, a Columbia University student from India who reportedly left the United States some days back, reportedly dodged federal immigration officials twice after her student visa was revoked.

The 37-year-old, who was pursuing a doctoral degree in urban planning recently found out that her student visa was revoked.

The Trump administration said on Friday it had revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student at Columbia, for "advocating for violence and terrorism".

Srinivasan opted to "self-deport" on Tuesday, the department said. Officials did not say what evidence they had that Srinivasan had advocated violence.

Her lawyers, however, have strongly denied that she engaged in any illegal activities or called for violence.

The first encounter occurred eight days ago on Friday when three federal immigration agents arrived at Srinivasan's Columbia University apartment, seeking the student who had recently discovered her visa was no longer valid.

Srinivasan did not open the door at the time, the New York Times reported.

The agents returned the next night, just hours after another Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil, was detained by immigration authorities. This time, Srinivasan was not at home.

After the arrest of another student, Srinivasan quickly packed a few of her belongings, left her cat with a friend, and boarded an immediate flight to Canada from LaGuardia Airport.

So, when the agents arrived for a third time last Thursday night, armed with a judicial warrant to search her apartment, she had already left the country.

“The atmosphere seemed so volatile and dangerous,” Ms. Srinivasan, 37, said on Friday in an interview with The New York Times, her first public remarks since leaving. “So I just made a quick decision.”

Columbia has come under immense pressure from the Trump administration in recent weeks, with the US government cancelling USD 400 million in federal grants and contracts to the school, much of it for medical research, as punishment for not cracking down harder on students and faculty who criticised Israel's military action in Gaza during large protests last spring.

President Donald Trump and other officials have accused the protesters of being "pro-Hamas", referring to the militant group that attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.

The administration threatened to permanently end federal funding to the Ivy League school unless it took a variety of steps, including changing its admissions process and ceding faculty control of its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department to a receiver for five years.

Columbia University's campus has been in crisis since the arrest on Saturday of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead last spring's protests.

 By Saleem Ahmed and Saud Mehsud 

 QUETTA - Separatist militants drove a vehicle laden with explosives into a paramilitary convoy, killing at least five in southwestern Pakistan, officials said on Sunday, just days after the same group hijacked a train and held hostages for 36 hours. 

 The Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack in the district of Noshki in the restive province of Balochistan. 

 Senior Superintendent of Police for Noskhi district Hashim Momand said more than 30 paramilitary force members were also wounded. 

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement condemned the attack, which came as Pakistan deals with a growing security crisis in its regions bordering Afghanistan. 

 The BLA on Tuesday took over the Jaffar Express in a remote mountain pass in Balochistan province, blowing up train tracks in an attack that killed 31 soldiers and civilians, the military said. 

 In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which lies to the north of Balochistan and also shares a border with Afghanistan, the provincial chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned a series of attacks on police across the province. 

 He did not provide casualty numbers, but the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Islamist militant group said there had been 16 attacks in the past 24 hours. 

 Pakistan's authorities have vowed to crack down on the growing insurgencies and said they are fuelled in part by militants finding safe haven in Afghanistan, a charge the ruling Afghan Taliban deny. Militant attacks often pick up in the warmer spring period as the cold winter months recede in mountainous border regions.

The United States is set to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison 300 alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang that it deports to the Central American country for one year, the Associated Press reported on Saturday, citing an internal memo."El Salvador confirms it will house these individuals for one year, pending the United States' decision on their long term disposition," AP quoted a memo from El Salvador's Foreign Ministry.

Thailand is known for being a vibrant tourist destination due to its diverse topography, which includes everything from turquoise waters, sandy beaches, forests with lush greenery, thrilling nightlife, and unique cultural experiences.With almost 1,000 islands and 2,400 km. of coastline, Israelis flock to the beaches in large numbers all year round, enjoying the ultimate relaxation together with amazing cheap food experiences. They are embraced by the Thai people with a smile, turning the visit into a rewarding vacation to cherish.  However, Thailand offers much more. Its northern parts are home to majestic Buddhist temples, heritage sites, ancient culture, karst cliffs, tropical jungles, animal sanctuaries, and awesome natural parks. Arriving in Bangkok, we did the unexpected. Instead of rushing to a majestic island, we aimed in the opposite direction for a four-day trip and found ourselves in the must-see Chiang Rai province. AdvertisementThe scenery here is dominated by pineapple plantation fields, and the delicious fruit can be found at every corner – even on the side the roads. Fresh, juicy, and tasty.Tea drinking is an ancient practice in the region, used for both celebration and ceremony. The Choui Fong Tea Plantation grows millions of tea plants, with the endless green hills leaving visitors speechless. The plantation covers an expansive area of over 1.6 sq.km. Here, tea bushes cascade along the hillside, creating a serene ambiance. A modern visitor center overlooks the marvelous hills,  where one can enjoy purchasing tea at the shop and admiring the Thai employees working in the hut. You can take your pick of a soft tea-leaf steamed bun, green tea, iced tea, or even a green tea cake.But Chiang Rai totally surprised us with its avant-garde temples, which were relatively new and quite unexpected. The unconventional “neo-traditional” style of Buddhist art is reflected in the Blue Temple, also known as Wat Rong Suea Ten, completed only nine years ago. What a striking modern artistic design.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The temple's construction was initiated by the local community in 1996 to replace an old abandoned temple that previously stood on the site. Its design by local artist Phuttha Kabkaew left us tongue-tied. AdvertisementHowever, when we came across the work of Kabkaew's teacher, our minds were completely blown. If there is a temple in Thailand that stands out from all others, it's the stunning Wat Rong Khun – the White Temple – designed, constructed, and opened to visitors in 1997.The genius behind this structural marvel is Chalermchai Kositpipat, and calling him a genius might be an understatement. Kositpipat, a Chiang Rai-born visual artist – primarily a painter – exhibits his works around the world. He is well-known for his use of Buddhist imagery in his art.His yet-unfinished White Temple complex is more than mere eye candy. It is a unique fusion of religious symbolism and contemporary art; traveling to this stunning destination was by itself worth the entire trip.  THE ATTRACTIONS here never cease to amaze. In front of a royal villa in a district of Chiang Rai, the admirable Mae Fah Luang Garden takes your breath away. This extraordinary botanical garden is bright and colorful, cultivated with rare plants and flowers that wrap around the grounds.But the highlight has yet to come. After an hour's drive north, we arrive at the Golden Triangle, a region where Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos meet on the Mekong River. Sailing on the mighty waterway is rewarding. The transboundary river is the world's 12th longest and the 3rd longest in East Asia. The Triangle has been famous as one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. After a four-hour drive southwest, we arrive in the Chiang Mai province. Soon, we discovered what a dream destination it was as well.Apparently, next year, Chiang Mai – Thailand's second largest city – will be celebrating its 730th anniversary. Ironically, its name literally means new city. King Mangrai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, which was, at the time, part of Greater India. The city became the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. The traditional temples we visited left us in awe. The magnificent Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is the most important temple, majestically looking from above at Chiang Mai city. Its exquisite golden pagoda is an architectural gem. Wat Sri Suphan, Chiang Mai's “Silver Temple,” is one of the most exciting and active temples, located outside its old walled city. The Wat Phra Singh golden temple is perhaps the largest Buddhist temple in town.  THE INTERCONTINENTAL Chiang Mai Mae Ping is an open museum of Lanna culture.

The province's breathtaking scenery makes Chiang Mai one of Asia's most attractive tourist destinations. The days there were just breathtaking.Thailand's jungle landscapeDoi Inthanon National Park is known as “the roof of Thailand” and is famous for its thick jungles and trails. The King and Queen Pagodas and adjacent beautiful gardens here are just marvelous. This project symbolizes deep respect for the Royal couple, serving as a unifying emblem for the Thai people.Hiking under a maze of bamboo, coffee, avocado, teak, sakura, wild banana, orchid, bird of paradise, and rubber trees and enjoying stormy waterfalls assures an unforgettable visit.THE JUNGLE landscape changes into cultivated rice fields, and we are at Longneck Karen Village, a refuge of Kayan tribespeople who migrated here from Myanmar.Women from this small minority are known worldwide for wearing rings around their necks to elongate them. In the past, it was meant to protect against tiger attacks. Today, it's considered a symbol of beauty and a modern-day accessory. The rings are heavy, but this doesn't deter the women from wearing them. What an experience it was.At the Baifern Valley elephant sanctuary, we fed a few friendly female animals. The elephants demonstrated some tricks and were enthusiastic when we stepped into the water to wash them. Rafting on the river was an adventure to cherish in Thailand's nature, away from the city.With Lanna – the ancient Thai state heritage – in mind, it was no wonder that our hotel in the city would significantly highlight the culture.

Before COVID, the owners decided to invest in massive renovation works to modernize and position it among the top hotels in the city. Their final decision not to run it as a local hotel anymore was part of a vision that Chiang Mai would soon attract many international visitors. The InterContinental brand was their choice.“We officially rebranded and opened the hotel in November 2023 after the first phase of renovations was completed,” revealed Dutch general manager Peter Pottinga.“Our hotel, featuring 240 elegant rooms and suites, is an open museum of the Lanna culture. It is an inspired décor to showcase traditional crafts,” he said. The public areas in this InterContinental are amazingly designed with the ancient Thai spirit in mind. The outdoor swimming pool is attractive and relaxing.Hong's Chinese Restaurant was constructed here with travelers from Thailand's northern giant neighbor in mind.“Chiang Mai is attractive to the Chinese market as it is a five-hour drive from the border or a one-hour flight. However, we are constantly aiming to attract new markets, mainly Americans, Australians, British, and the Israelis as well,” Pottinga shared.“Chiang Mai might surprise the newcomers. The airport is a 10-minute drive [away], and in one day, you can enjoy nine temples. No other destination offers such a variety.“I am calling [for] travelers to learn more about Thai culture and discover what the north has to offer. It is not enough to associate Thailand with the islands alone. Allow yourself to combine both [the] islands' sandy beaches and the Chiang Mai province for a unique experience,” said Pottinga.Lonely Planet's Best In Travel 2025 recently named Chiang Mai a Top Global City. These respected guidebooks, and lately also a website, focus on unique destinations. Their experts are, without question and beyond doubt, in favor of the attractiveness of this region for this year.

Fresh, juicy, and tasty.Tea drinking is an ancient practice in the region, used for both celebration and ceremony. The Choui Fong Tea Plantation grows millions of tea plants, with the endless green hills leaving visitors speechless. The plantation covers an expansive area of over 1.6 sq.km. Here, tea bushes cascade along the hillside, creating a serene ambiance. A modern visitor center overlooks the marvelous hills,  where one can enjoy purchasing tea at the shop and admiring the Thai employees working in the hut. You can take your pick of a soft tea-leaf steamed bun, green tea, iced tea, or even a green tea cake.But Chiang Rai totally surprised us with its avant-garde temples, which were relatively new and quite unexpected. The unconventional “neo-traditional” style of Buddhist art is reflected in the Blue Temple, also known as Wat Rong Suea Ten, completed only nine years ago. What a striking modern artistic design.

If there is a temple in Thailand that stands out from all others, it's the stunning Wat Rong Khun – the White Temple – designed, constructed, and opened to visitors in 1997.The genius behind this structural marvel is Chalermchai Kositpipat, and calling him a genius might be an understatement. Kositpipat, a Chiang Rai-born visual artist – primarily a painter – exhibits his works around the world. He is well-known for his use of Buddhist imagery in his art.His yet-unfinished White Temple complex is more than mere eye candy. It is a unique fusion of religious symbolism and contemporary art; traveling to this stunning destination was by itself worth the entire trip.  THE ATTRACTIONS here never cease to amaze.

The transboundary river is the world's 12th longest and the 3rd longest in East Asia. The Triangle has been famous as one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. After a four-hour drive southwest, we arrive in the Chiang Mai province. Soon, we discovered what a dream destination it was as well.Apparently, next year, Chiang Mai – Thailand's second largest city – will be celebrating its 730th anniversary. Ironically, its name literally means new city. King Mangrai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, which was, at the time, part of Greater India. The city became the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. The traditional temples we visited left us in awe. The magnificent Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is the most important temple, majestically looking from above at Chiang Mai city. Its exquisite golden pagoda is an architectural gem. Wat Sri Suphan, Chiang Mai's “Silver Temple,” is one of the most exciting and active temples, located outside its old walled city.

But Chiang Rai totally surprised us with its avant-garde temples, which were relatively new and quite unexpected. The unconventional “neo-traditional” style of Buddhist art is reflected in the Blue Temple, also known as Wat Rong Suea Ten, completed only nine years ago. What a striking modern artistic design.

This extraordinary botanical garden is bright and colorful, cultivated with rare plants and flowers that wrap around the grounds.But the highlight has yet to come. After an hour's drive north, we arrive at the Golden Triangle, a region where Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos meet on the Mekong River. Sailing on the mighty waterway is rewarding. The transboundary river is the world's 12th longest and the 3rd longest in East Asia. The Triangle has been famous as one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. After a four-hour drive southwest, we arrive in the Chiang Mai province. Soon, we discovered what a dream destination it was as well.Apparently, next year, Chiang Mai – Thailand's second largest city – will be celebrating its 730th anniversary. Ironically, its name literally means new city. King Mangrai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, which was, at the time, part of Greater India. The city became the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. The traditional temples we visited left us in awe. The magnificent Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is the most important temple, majestically looking from above at Chiang Mai city. Its exquisite golden pagoda is an architectural gem. Wat Sri Suphan, Chiang Mai's “Silver Temple,” is one of the most exciting and active temples, located outside its old walled city. The Wat Phra Singh golden temple is perhaps the largest Buddhist temple in town.  THE INTERCONTINENTAL Chiang Mai Mae Ping is an open museum of Lanna culture.

The days there were just breathtaking.Thailand's jungle landscapeDoi Inthanon National Park is known as “the roof of Thailand” and is famous for its thick jungles and trails. The King and Queen Pagodas and adjacent beautiful gardens here are just marvelous. This project symbolizes deep respect for the Royal couple, serving as a unifying emblem for the Thai people.Hiking under a maze of bamboo, coffee, avocado, teak, sakura, wild banana, orchid, bird of paradise, and rubber trees and enjoying stormy waterfalls assures an unforgettable visit.THE JUNGLE landscape changes into cultivated rice fields, and we are at Longneck Karen Village, a refuge of Kayan tribespeople who migrated here from Myanmar.Women from this small minority are known worldwide for wearing rings around their necks to elongate them. In the past, it was meant to protect against tiger attacks. Today, it's considered a symbol of beauty and a modern-day accessory. The rings are heavy, but this doesn't deter the women from wearing them. What an experience it was.At the Baifern Valley elephant sanctuary, we fed a few friendly female animals. The elephants demonstrated some tricks and were enthusiastic when we stepped into the water to wash them. Rafting on the river was an adventure to cherish in Thailand's nature, away from the city.With Lanna – the ancient Thai state heritage – in mind, it was no wonder that our hotel in the city would significantly highlight the culture.

The InterContinental brand was their choice.“We officially rebranded and opened the hotel in November 2023 after the first phase of renovations was completed,” revealed Dutch general manager Peter Pottinga.“Our hotel, featuring 240 elegant rooms and suites, is an open museum of the Lanna culture. It is an inspired décor to showcase traditional crafts,” he said. The public areas in this InterContinental are amazingly designed with the ancient Thai spirit in mind. The outdoor swimming pool is attractive and relaxing.Hong's Chinese Restaurant was constructed here with travelers from Thailand's northern giant neighbor in mind.“Chiang Mai is attractive to the Chinese market as it is a five-hour drive from the border or a one-hour flight. However, we are constantly aiming to attract new markets, mainly Americans, Australians, British, and the Israelis as well,” Pottinga shared.“Chiang Mai might surprise the newcomers. The airport is a 10-minute drive [away], and in one day, you can enjoy nine temples. No other destination offers such a variety.“I am calling [for] travelers to learn more about Thai culture and discover what the north has to offer.

The Al-Khair Foundation says staff were setting up a camp for displaced Gazans in Beit Lahia Saturday when back-to-back Israeli strikes hit their vehicles.

At least nine people were killed Saturday in strikes on Gaza, authorities there said, as Israel continues to launch operations during its ceasefire with Hamas.

Eight of the dead were killed in back-to-back strikes on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. They included seven humanitarian workers and a person from the camp, according to the Al-Khair Foundation, a charity based in Britain and Turkey.

At least 150 Palestinians have been killed in such strikes since the fragile truce took effect in mid-January, Hamas said Saturday, including 19 on Friday and Saturday.

Israel has said it will continue to target individuals and actions that threaten it. Local news media and civil defense authorities in Gaza have reported the deaths of civilians, including women and children.

The ceasefire was envisioned as a three-phase deal, but talks to extend it have stalled.

The first phase, during which some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners were released, ended on March 1. The second is supposed to include the release of all living hostages still held by Hamas, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and the end of the war, but the sides have yet to start negotiations.

Nine people were killed in attacks by the Israel Defense Forces in northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said. Their bodies were taken to the Indonesian Hospital.

Mohammed Abu Hasna, director of the Al-Khair Foundation's international offices, said humanitarian workers were opening camps for displaced Gazans when one of their vehicles was bombed. Two photographers, who were documenting the work, were killed.

The organization sent another car to evacuate the survivors, Abu Hasna said, but “as soon as they got into the vehicle, they were targeted and all killed.” The dead included seven foundation workers and someone from the camp, he said.

The IDF told The Post that it carried out the airstrike after it observed the group of men “operating a drone intended to carry out terrorist attacks against IDF troops.” The Israeli military named six of the people killed as members of the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups and accused two of them, Bilal Mahmoud Fouad Abu Matar and Mahmoud Imad Hassan Aslim, as being Hamas militants who “operated under the cover” of journalists.

Abu Hasna said “the claim that they pose a threat to the army” was “nonsense and unrealistic.”

There were no restrictions on setting up camps in the area, he said, the foundation typically documents its work, and the IDF was at least four kilometers away.

“This isn't the first time they've targeted humanitarian workers and then leveled false accusations,” he said.

Hamas called the attack a “dangerous escalation” that reflected Israel's “insistence of continuing aggression” and “intention to renounce the ceasefire agreement.”

Four boys were killed Friday in an Israeli strike in Gaza City, NBC News reported. Brothers Mahmoud Alerfan, 15, and Yusuf Alerfan, 13, and their friends Malik Althatha, 13, and Salim Hasnin, 15, had stepped outside to procure firewood for the evening meal to break the daily Ramadan fast.

Umm Mahmoud Alerfan clutched her sons' bodies and wailed: “I did not allow them outside, but today I did. Why did they come out today?”

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.

WASHINGTON — National security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday that “all options are always on the table” when asked whether direct military action against Iran would be possible.

His comments come after the U.S. launched airstrikes Saturday on parts of Yemen that are controlled by Houthis, an Iran-backed group that has attacked shipping vessels in response to the war in Gaza.

“All options are always on the table with the president, but Iran needs to hear him loud and clear,” Waltz said in an interview on ABC News' “This Week.” “It is completely unacceptable, and it will be stopped, the level of support that they've been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others.”

President Donald Trump announced the strikes on Saturday, saying in a post to Truth Social that Houthi attacks “on American vessels will not be tolerated.”

“We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,” Trump added.

Trump also warned Iran in the same post that its support for Houthis “must end immediately.” He told the nation to “beware” of threatening Americans and that “America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!”

The airstrikes on Yemen come as the Trump administration is also trying to end the war in Ukraine by meeting with Russian and Ukrainian officials to determine a path to a possible ceasefire.

Waltz said diplomacy is ongoing, but indicated that it was unrealistic to expect Ukraine would regain all of its territory taken over by Russia.

“We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest, is it realistic?” Waltz said when asked about territory that may be given to Russia despite Russia having launched the war by invading Ukraine.

“Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?” he asked, arguing that the Biden administration's strategy was “essentially endless warfare in an environment that we're literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months, and could escalate into World War III.”

“We can talk about what's right and wrong, and we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground,” Waltz said.

Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said in an interview on CNN's “State of the Union” that his recent meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin “was positive.” Witkoff has been active in ongoing talks about the future of Russia and Ukraine.

Witkoff said in the same interview that he expects Trump and Putin to have a call sometime this week.

During his presidential campaign, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine in one day or even before being sworn in.

During a “Full Measure” interview taped last week with journalist Sharyl Attkisson, Trump said he “was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that.”

The strikes differ from the Biden administration's, Waltz told "This Week."

The U.S. airstrikes that bombarded Yemen on Saturday targeted and "took out" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday.

Speaking on ABC's "This Week," Waltz argued to co-anchor Martha Raddatz that these latest strikes differ from the countless strikes the Biden administration launched against the rebel group, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth -- what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks," Waltz said. "This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible."

Waltz accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack U.S. warships and global commerce. Some 70% of global commerce is now diverting around South Africa to avoid the Houthis, resulting in higher shipping costs and supply chain issues, Waltz said.

"President Trump has found it unacceptable. What we inherited was -- was a terrible situation, and this is one of what will be a sustained effort to right that wrong and to reopen global commerce," Waltz said.

A source told ABC News Saturday that the strikes are not expected to be a single day event. On social media, President Donald Trump warned the Houthis that if their attacks do not stop, "HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"

Trump also issued a warning to Iran, calling on the Islamic Republic to stop supporting the Houthis, and adding: "Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!"

Here are highlights from Waltz's interview:

"Well, all actions are always on the table with the president. But Iran needs to hear him loud and clear. It is completely unacceptable and it will be stopped. The level of support that they've been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others. The difference here is the Houthis have incredibly sophisticated air defenses, and they also have anti-shipping cruise missiles, drones, sea skimming types of attack drones and other ballistic missiles even. They've launched dozens of attacks on multiple war ships, dozens of attacks, over 175 on global commerce, sank multiple ships. ... We will hold not only the Houthis accountable, but we're going to hold Iran, their backers, accountable as well. And if that means they're targeting ships that they have put in to -- to help their Iranian trainers, IRGC and others, that intelligence, other things that they have put in to help the Houthis attack the global economy, those -- those targets will be on the table, too."

"What the president has completely -- has repeatedly said is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one. And that's all aspects of Iran's program. That's the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences. But, either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button. We cannot have a situation that would result in an arms race across the Middle East in terms of nuclear proliferation. ... Iran has been offered a way out of this to make sure that we don't have a world that can be threatened by a radical regime, not only our ally Israel, but the entire world that would be threated with a – with – by a radical regime that could destroy, not only Israel, but its neighbors, and have the capability to hit the United States."

"A fundamental aspect of the approach here from President Trump is that, you know, this has to be permanent. That's what we continue to hear from the Ukrainians, that, you know, we cannot have a situation where this continues to break down. At the same time, we are engaging with the Russians. What we heard from President Putin was that he will absolutely consider a ceasefire. There are some other thing that he would like to see that President Trump's national security team has -- is considering over the coming days. So, this back and forth diplomacy is -- is ongoing."

"We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest? Is it realistic? We've talked to the Europeans about this, and the Ukrainians. Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea? And what the strategy of the Biden administration was, was, as long as it takes, as much as it takes, no matter what the timeline is, which is essentially endless warfare, in an environment that we are literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. And could escalate into World War III. ... We can talk about what's right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that's what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks."

The Houthis claimed a retaliatory attack on Sunday.

LONDON -- An Iranian general warned on Sunday of the potential for a "decisive and devastating" response to any executed threat, a day after the U.S. conducted strikes on Houthis in Yemen.

Gen. Hossein Salami also denied that Iran had backed the rebel group, which continues to wage a campaign against international ships in the Red Sea and off the Yemeni coast.

"We are not a nation to live in hiding. We are a valid and legitimate system in the world. We announce it if we attack anywhere," Salami said in a speech broadcast in Farsi.

The general did not say Iran had been threatened, but that the country would offer a "decisive and devastating response to any threat" against it.

Salami's words echoed those of President Donald Trump, who announced on Saturday he had ordered the U.S. military to launch a "decisive and powerful" strike against the Houthis in Yemen.

"They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft and drones," Trump said. "We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective."

A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that U.S. air and naval assets hit dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen, including missiles, radars, and drone and air defense systems. The official characterized the attacks as an opening salvo against the Houthis, and it sends a strong message to Iran.

On Sunday, the Houthis claimed a retaliatory attack they said targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier with "18 ballistic and cruise missiles and a drone." However, a U.S. official told ABC News this wasn't true. The Houthis said in a statement that it "will not hesitate to target all American warships in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea in response to the aggression against our country."

Yemeni health officials said the U.S. campaign had killed some 31 people, along with injuring another 101 people. Many of the wounded were "children and women," the Ministry of Health in Sana'a said on Sunday morning.

National security adviser Mike Waltz told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday morning that the U.S. strikes "took out" multiple Houthi leaders.

Waltz said the strikes were more significant than those conducted during former President Joe Biden's time in office, which the national security adviser criticized as "feckless."

"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible," Waltz added.

Asked if there was any chance of direct U.S. military action against Iran, Waltz replied, "All options are always on the table with the president, but Iran needs to hear him loud and clear." Iranian support for the Houthis, militias in Iraq, Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups "is completely unacceptable" and "will be stopped," Waltz said.

Trump has made clear that Iran "cannot have a nuclear weapon," Waltz continued. "All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one, and that's all aspects of Iran's program. That's the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences."

"But either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button."

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 36 people across six states. 

The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Forecasters assigned an unusual "high risk" designation to the system, which was also blamed for icy winter weather in northern parts of the country and severe thunderstorms, including on the West Coast, on Sunday.

In all, extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south.

Heavy thunderstorms in the forecast for Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, prompted schedule changes for the 2025 Players Championship, CBS Sports reported. The tournament moved up tee times Sunday and grouped golfers together to ensure the last 18 holes would be completed before the evening.

In Kansas, at least eight people died and numerous injuries were reported Friday after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm.  

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves reported six deaths across three counties as multiple tornadoes swept through the state. At least three others were missing, Reeves said. 

Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado.

"It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field," said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. "The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls."

Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri.

"It was a very rough deal last night," Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home from which he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing. "It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night."

Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said that first responders, volunteers and faith-based partners "worked tirelessly" through the night "in response to a series of devastating tornadoes and severe storms, and before that, dangerous and damaging fires." 

In Oklahoma, the governor said one person died on the road, presumably due to smoke.

In Arkansas, officials reported three fatalities in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight. Staff from the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) have been called to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) due to extensive storm damage across the state. 

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that she spoke with President Trump after Friday night's tornados in the state. 

"[Trump] said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes," she said in a post on X.

Further south in Texas, officials said four people died after weather-related fatalities, some during car crashes in the midst of a dust storm.

"It's the worst I've ever seen," said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state's department of public safety, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. "We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled."

Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.

"This is terrible out here," said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. "There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do."

The severe storm front sparked tornadoes in Alabama as it moved eastward, killing at least two people. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Sunday that the deaths were confirmed in Plantersville and Winterboro, both in the state's central region. 

Earlier, the weather service issued multiple tornado warnings across Alabama, advising residents to seek shelter Saturday night. In the east Alabama community of Elrod, a CBS News spotter reported that a possible tornado had uprooted trees and damaged at least one home. 

And in Sipsey, Alabama, north of Birmingham, a 911 call center told CBS News that a suspected tornado had caused possible injuries and damaged several homes.

At one point, weather service employees at the agency's Birmingham office were forced to abandon operations and take shelter themselves. 

"We're back. Much thanks to @NWSAtlanta for the help!" NWS Birmingham wrote on social media. 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm's continued shift eastward. Early Sunday morning, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency used its social media accounts to repost a National Weather Service tornado watch for parts of southeast Georgia. The watch warned of isolated tornadoes, hail and wind gusts of 50 to 70 miles hour.

On the East Coast, heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some areas on Sunday. 

Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

"What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity," said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. "And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area."

The Storm Prediction Center uses five categories to warn of expected severe weather, ranging from marginal to high. Its forecast maps are color-coded, with the lowest risk areas in green and the highest shown in magenta.

On Saturday, the area of highest risk includes parts of Mississippi and Alabama.

The "high risk" designation is used when severe weather is expected to include "numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes" or thunderstorms producing hurricane-force wind gusts and inflicting widespread damage, according to the agency's product descriptions.

On many days when the "high risk" designation was used in recent years, the forecasts became reality.

The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the Saint Louis area. Several buildings were damaged in the storm, including a strip mall in Rolla, Missouri, where a tornado was reported Friday afternoon.

The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.

"Potentially violent" tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.

On Saturday, Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Georgia due to damaging weather expected to move into the state overnight. It is scheduled to expire on Tuesday.

"This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed. Before they retire for the evening, I'm urging everyone to be prepared ahead of time and to remain weather aware as long as this system is in the state."

Wildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.

A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile to an estimated 32.8 square miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles before its advance was halted in the afternoon. 

In Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said a "complex of extremely dangerous fires" was located northeast of Oklahoma City, near Stillwater, and urged some people in the city of about 50,000 to evacuate on Friday evening. Officials issued mandatory evacuation orders via social media that included homes, hotels and a Walmart.

Overall, nearly 150 fires were reported in Oklahoma, Andy James, the state's Forestry Services fire management chief, told local media. The State Patrol said on social media that winds toppled several tractor-trailers. 

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said that 70,000 acres had burned in the state. About 293 homes and structures had been destroyed as of Saturday afternoon — including Stitt's own farmhouse, he said. 

Firefighters had been prepositioned in certain areas, which helps authorities jump on blazes early, James said. Firefighting aircraft were also deployed in some parts of Oklahoma and Texas but were generally unable to fly due to low visibility from smoke and dust, he added.

Officials urged people in some areas of central Missouri's Camden County to evacuate due to wildfires, and the State Highway Patrol warned via social media that they were nearing homes and businesses.

Roughly 120 miles of Interstate 70 in western Kansas were temporarily shut down due to blowing dust and limited visibility.

High winds also knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, according the website poweroutage.us.

The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were expected, with up to a foot possible.

Winds gusting to 60 mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions.

When British novelist J.B. Priestley visited the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, he described it as "all of Beethoven's nine symphonies in stone and magic light."

"If I were an American," he wrote, "I should make my remembrance of it the final test of men, art, and policies … Every member or officer of the federal government ought to remind himself, with triumphant pride, that he is on the staff of the Grand Canyon."

In February, as part of the Trump Administration's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, approximately 1,000 employees were laid off across the Park Service. When the federal government fired some of the Park Service staff who work at the canyon, this was the scene near the South Rim: 

In the weeks since, there have been protests at hundreds of park service sites, from Acadia to Zion.

Jim Landahl worked as a seasonal ranger for years, until he got a promotion to a permanent posting at Grand Canyon six months ago. Then came the termination email. He said it stated that "we lacked the necessary skills, qualifications, fitness to perform this job. And I didn't take that personally at all, because I knew that was a lie. I knew that was false. Whoever wrote that letter wasn't hiking with me down into the canyon in a hundred-degree heat to do our job." 

Landahl's work involved restoring habitat disturbed by the reconstruction of the park's failing Transcanyon Waterline, which provides water to lodges and other infrastructure. Since he'd been in this position for less than a year, he was classified as a "probationary employee."

"The project is a critical infrastructure project for Grand Canyon," said archeologist Leah Gallo. "And without it, there would be pretty much no Grand Canyon."

Gallo had only been working on the project for two weeks when she was let go. "I spent pretty much every dime to move here," she said. 

But this past Thursday, two federal judges ruled that the government must reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers across several agencies, finding that the layoffs were carried out under false pretenses – that performance wasn't a factor. 

It's currently unclear if and when Park Service staff might be back on the job.

Mindy Riesenberg is the chief of communications for the Grand Canyon Conservancy, a non-profit group that supports the park. As we enter the busy season, she says she's worried about people having to wait in several-hour-long lines just to get into the park. "We had almost five million visitors last year at Grand Canyon," she said. "And now I think we're down to about 11 fee collectors for the South Rim, for five million people a year."

When we visited the canyon last weekend, visitors were waiting up to an hour-and-a-half to enter the park. In New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns National Park had cancelled all ranger-led tours. Colorado's Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument announced it would be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the staffing cuts.

Cuts also impact ongoing projects visitors might not see, like the Transcanyon Waterline. Riesenberg said, "That project is going to be held up, because scientists and botanists and arborists who were replanting trees down there for shade, for safety, after that project, and that's all gonna stop. It's gonna hold the project up."

Chuck Sams, who served as the 19th director of the National Park Service, stepped down in January. He said, "To me, it looks like there's no rhyme or reason about why these things are taking place."

During his time as director, Sams said, "I absolutely felt that we needed more employees. National Park Service needs at least 15% to as much as 25% more staff on the ground in order to fully meet its mandate. It's important that these folks are out there. And now, we've seen a 10% reduction in staff. So it's gonna be detrimental to people's experiences in the parks."

Asked for comment, the National Park Service's Office of Public Affairs told "CBS Sunday Morning," "The National Park Service remains steadfast in its commitment to serving the American public and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to our care. However, NPS policy is to not comment on litigation related to personnel matters."

Meanwhile, a group of current employees known as the "Resistance Rangers" has been tracking the cuts, speaking out on behalf of their fired coworkers.

One ranger, who asked that we conceal their identity out of fear of retaliation, told us, "None of us want to be doing this. We're public land servants. We're civil servants who just want to be doing our job. I cannot separate myself from the mission. I am doing this for the love of public lands. I'm doing this for my nieces and nephews. I'm doing this for the people to come in 150 years."

The ranger is especially worried about the crush of visitors who will be headed to understaffed parks this spring and summer. "We were hobbled to begin with, and now our kneecaps are cut off," they said. "In addition to that, we have $12 billion in maintenance deficit. Like, every single national park you ask me about that I've been to, I can point out six or seven high-priority products that need to happen in order to protect the integrity of that place. We just had our highest visitation year ever in history; 331 million people went to parks last year. That is an absurd number of people."

Americans love their national parks. Last year, a Pew Research Center opinion poll found that, when it comes to federal agencies, the public has the most favorable view of the National Park Service. It ranked highest with Democrats AND Republicans.

Sams said, "During my service as the National Park Service director, I had never met a member of Congress that didn't love the park that was in their home state. And I generally saw bipartisan support for the National Park Service. Moving forward, there has to be a strong understanding that parks aren't partisan. The flora and fauna, the natural and cultural resources inside of the park don't belong to any political party."

Fired training specialist Lynda Jones joined the Park Service to serve her country. "Both my parents are veterans," she said. "They served in the military. And they instilled in me the importance of public service."

While Thursday's court rulings have reinstated her position at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (at least temporarily), the Trump administration has appealed – and a larger reduction in force is still possible. 

Which leaves park staff like Jones dealing with an uncertain future, worried about what's to come. "This is the story of America," Jones said, tearing up. "The story of the people who live here. And it doesn't matter your background or where you're from. These places belong to all of us. And they really are America's best idea."

Voters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump's handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Buoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump's approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.

Meanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump's election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as “excellent” or “good” — not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points, and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump's early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he's handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).

It's a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.

Overall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump's 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.

Voters narrowly disapprove of Trump's overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.

In another change from Trump's first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.

Voters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE's de facto head.

And voters are split evenly on which party they'd like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)

“While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump's upside-down numbers among independents “a flashing red light across the survey.”

McInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold — “or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election” in 2026, McInturff continued.

Trump's job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.

But they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the “honeymoon period” of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump's job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.

Underscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.

Among independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump's performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump's job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.

Vice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.

When it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he's bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue, while 25% say he's bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn't bringing change.

But that's the only one of the five issues tested in the poll — border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine — that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.

Forty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.

The split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News' “Meet the Press” in December: “I won on the border and I won on groceries.”

Just 1% rate the economy as “excellent” and 17% as “good,” with 39% calling it “only fair” and 43% rating it “poor.” While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.

About one-third (32%) of voters say their family's income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it's falling behind. Another 7% say their family's income is rising faster than the cost of living.

Asked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren't satisfied — 46% say they are “not at all satisfied” and another 9% say they are “not too satisfied,” while 20% are “somewhat” satisfied and 23% are “very” satisfied.

The NBC News poll also gauged voters' feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he's bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he's bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn't bringing change.

On trade and tariffs, 41% say he's bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.

Overall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he's bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he's not bringing change.

Voters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.

Forty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.

And Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.

Asked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government “should continue as much more needs to be done.” Meanwhile, 28% say “it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.” And another 33% say “it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.”

While Trump's standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling. Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.

Meanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.

Still, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year's midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.

As Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.

A plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it's been too supportive and 14% believe it's been too critical.

A near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.

And when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it's been too supportive, and 24% say it's been dealing with Trump the right way.

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Residents pounded by unusually vicious weather across parts of the U.S. surveyed damage Sunday from violent tornadoes, high winds and blinding dust storms that decimated homes and other structures and left at least 35 people dead.

National Weather Service meteorologist Cody Snell said tornado watches remained in effect Sunday morning for portions of the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida. He said the main threat would be damaging winds, but there is the possibility of more tornadoes.

“As we go through the day today, there still is the potential for severe weather from, say, the upper Ohio Valley and western Pennsylvania down through the rest of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast as we have this cold front that's still moving across the country, and it won't clear the East Coast until later on tonight,” Snell said.

The dynamic storm from Friday through Sunday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

At least three people were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornados swept across the state. Among those killed was an 82-year-old woman who was in a manufactured home that was destroyed by a twister, Dallas County Sheriff Michael L. Granthum said Sunday.

In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation center where over 200 people had taken shelter would be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.

“The Recreation Center has significant damage throughout the building,” the Parks Department said. “We are thankful the Lord provided protection over our community, and over 200 guests at the Recreation Center storm shelter on Saturday night."

Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbors found five bodies scattered in the debris Friday night outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

“It was a very rough deal last night,” Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home he said they rescued his aunt from through a window of the only room left standing. “It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night."

Authorities were still sifting through massive tornado damage.

On Saturday, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County described the “unrecognizable home” where one man was killed as “just a debris field.”

“The floor was upside down,” he said. “We were walking on walls.”

In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more were missing late Saturday.

Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched from their front porch in Tylertown as a massive twister struck an area about half a mile away near Paradise Ranch RV Park.

They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles.

“The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over. Everything was destroyed.”

Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself.

“Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.”

In Arkansas, officials confirmed three deaths.

Dust storms spurred by the storm system's early high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday. Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.

More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Gov. Kevin Stitt said Saturday.

WASHINGTON — The Voice of America may not live up to its ambitious name for much longer.

Michael Abramowitz, the director of VOA, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was placed on leave, along with “virtually the entire staff” of 1,300. The announcement comes one day after President Trump signed an executive order to gut VOA's parent agency.

Some of VOA's local-language radio stations have stopped broadcasting news reports and switched over to music to fill the airtime, according to listeners.

Even top editors at VOA have been ordered to stop working, so employees expect the broadcaster's worldwide news coverage to grind to a halt, according to half a dozen sources who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity.

“The Voice of America has been silenced, at least for now,” a veteran correspondent said.

Voice of America is part of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also runs networks like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. Those networks are also on Trump's chopping block, as networks' contracts with the operators have been terminated.

While Trump allies argue that the broadcasters are bloated and outdated, advocates say that by dismantling the networks, the United States is ceding the airwaves to China and other world powers, thereby harming American interests abroad.

The United States has been funding international news and current affairs coverage intended for global audiences for decades. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have supported the attempts to promote accurate news — and democratic values — in places that are saturated by foreign propaganda.

The agency's mission statement, codified in law, is to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.”

But the Trump administration has different expectations. An internal memo earlier this month said the mission is to “clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump Administration around the world.”

Trump appointed conservative media critic Brent Bozell III to run the parent agency and tapped election-denying former TV anchor Kari Lake to run VOA. Bozell's Senate confirmation hearing is months away, with Lake serving as a “senior adviser.” Lake signed some of the emails announcing Saturday's cuts.

Lake tweeted that the dismantling was taking effect because “the president has issued an Executive Order titled Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.”

Trump's order said affected agencies should stop performing all work that is not statutorily mandated, and do the rest with as few people as possible.

The order was in line with Elon Musk's declaration in February that government-funded international broadcasters should be shut down altogether.

“Nobody listens to them anymore,” Musk posted on X. “It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.”

Advocates for the outlets strongly disagree, pointing to the broadcasters as a bulwark for democracy. Those voices include Republican lawmakers.

“Gutting Radio Free Asia and other U.S. Agency for Global Media platforms counters the principles of freedom our nation was founded on and cedes leverage to the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea and other regimes,” Rep. Young Kim, a California Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on East Asia and Pacific, told Politico last week.

It is unclear what will happen next to the USAGM's various platforms.

In addition to the employees who were put on leave Saturday, some contractors who were working for VOA were told to hand in their badges.

Other staffers went to VOA offices on Saturday to gather their belongings because they feared being locked out altogether, sources said.

But in a recent memo, before Trump signed his order, Lake made it sound like the broadcasters will continue to exist in some fashion going forward.

“It is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet,” Lake wrote earlier this month. “That means we have an added responsibility to restore their trust while working efficiently and honestly to cover this consequential moment in our nation's history.”

Lake said she would modernize the agency “into something the American people are willing to support.”

Abramowitz said in his Facebook post that “VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard,” but sidelining the staff means that VOA won't be able to carry out its mission.

“That mission is especially critical today,” he wrote, “when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.”

The American Foreign Service Association released a statement Saturday that it “will mount a vigorous defense of USAGM and the Foreign Service professionals whose expertise is indispensable to its mission.”

Troyhann Santos checks the federal government's latest list of counter-tariffs and makes a crushing discovery. Starting immediately, she'll have to pay a 25 per cent tariff on most merchandise coming into her lacrosse equipment store, Lax Shack, in Pickering, Ont.

"To get hit with something like this is terrifying," said Santos. "It's a terrible gut punch."

Billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are on the line as Canadian businesses grapple with U.S. President Trump's tariffs, the bulk of which are set to take effect on April 2. 

Now, some businesses unaffected by Trump's tariffs are learning that they won't emerge unscathed from the trade war, because goods they import from the U.S. are getting hit with Canada's counter-tariffs. 

The problem is especially concerning for small businesses, which often don't have deep pockets to help them weather the storm. 

Last week, the federal government imposed its first round of 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods, such as many types of food and appliances. 

On Thursday, after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, Canada hit back with more tariffs, this time on $29.8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Targets include U.S. steel, aluminum, some electronics and — unfortunately for Santos — sports equipment.

Almost all of the lacrosse gear she sells, including sticks, balls and nets, is imported from the U.S.

"We have shipments that are coming in on a daily basis, so this will affect us immediately," said Santos. "We're going to have to increase our prices to reflect that 25 per cent increase."

She's not the only small business caught in the crossfire.

Cluck Clucks, a small but growing fast food chain in the Toronto area, says the counter-tariffs could hurt its expansion plans. 

Each Cluck Clucks requires between six and eight deep fryers to serve up its specialty: fried chicken. 

The fryers, which cost up to $27,000 each are made of steel and shipped from the U.S. Because Canada's counter-tariffs include cooking appliances made of steel, Cluck Clucks believes it will now pay 25 per cent more for each new purchase.

"We're expecting our costs to go up significantly," said Raza Hashim, Cluck Clucks' CEO. "So, overall, just not a good situation for us."

He adds that Canada doesn't manufacture deep fryers, so he can't solve the problem by switching to a domestic supplier.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says many small businesses may be affected by the counter-tariffs. The federation surveyed 2,500 independent businesses last month and almost half (47 per cent) said they import goods from the U.S.

"They are super concerned," said Simon Gaudreault, CFIB's chief economist. "We're talking here about 25 per cent counter-tariffs that can add a significant cost pressure on businesses. Some of them operate on very thin margins."

Gaudreault says owners can raise prices to cover the added costs, but doing so could make them less competitive. 

"So they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place."

Affected businesses can apply for financial support from Ottawa, but there are no guarantees they will get it. "The federal government will only consider [assistance] where it is required to address exceptional and compelling circumstances," the Deparment of Finance said in a statement. 

Canada's counter-tariffs hurting small businesses, but most support them

The CFIB poll also revealed something that surprised Gaudreault: Despite concerns over counter-tariffs, three-quarters of businesses surveyed said they support Canada's decision to impose them. 

"I think it comes from a sense that something needs to be done … not to just lie down there, and let's let the U.S. administration do whatever it is that they want," said Gaudreault. 

Although Cluck Clucks will now likely face higher costs each time it opens a new location, the restaurant is on the side of counter-tariffs.

"It is for the good of the entire country," said Hashim at a Cluck Clucks in Pickering. "As a citizen, as a naturalized citizen, we will bite the bullet for our adopted country." 

But back at the lacrosse store, Santos reveals that she's on the fence about the counter-tariffs, after learning that they will affect most goods sold in her store. 

"I want Canada to stand up for themselves and I'm a proud Canadian," she said.

"But on the other side of it, these increases in prices also hurt us."

Ownership of electric vehicles continues to rise in the U.S., with nearly six million battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids currently on the road. Even though that's still a fraction of the overall market and the growth rate of EV sales has slowed, automakers remain invested in the eventual transition away from gasoline, as 2024 sales of traditional internal combustion engine cars fell below 80% for the first time in modern automotive history.

Continued EV sales growth shows that at least for a significant portion of auto consumers, range anxiety is no longer an issue. But it is a persistent fear in the EV market that is getting a new test with the Trump administration looking to slash EV incentives from the federal government.

The majority of EV owners charge up at home, but from city streets and interstate highways to parking garages and airports, the EV industry is concentrated on installing enough chargers in public places to help end range anxiety, while building pure-play charging business models that can stand on their own and turn a profit.

According to the latest figures compiled by Paren AFDC+ Charger Database, there are 68,000 public and private Level 3 (fastest) and Level 2 EV charging stations across the country, each with one or more individual ports, for a total of around 266,000 ports. Installing, operating and servicing the chargers, it's an industry that is a fundamental driver of widescale EV adoption — and right now, it's an industry that is struggling to maintain traction in what has lately become an uncertain and politicized marketplace.

Despite a recent surprise Tesla's sales event at the White House, Trump and his top administration officials — from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Energy Secretary and former fossil fuels industry CEO Chris Wright — have made it clear that stripping away federal support for EVs is among changes being sought as they prioritize oil and gas in energy policy. Already impacted by the slowdown in EV sales, charging companies are battling a recent freeze on an important federal funding program, while also waiting to see how OEMs are affected by the Trump administration's tariffs and resulting trade wars, particularly involving essential steel and aluminum.

Former President Joe Biden, as part of his signature agenda to combat climate change, set a goal that half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 would be electric, which also meant having an adequate, reliable nationwide charging infrastructure by then. To address the build out, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program was authorized by Congress under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

NEVI earmarked $5 billion in grants, apportioned annually over five years, to states' departments of transportation to deploy a network of 500,000 high-speed EV chargers by 2030, primarily along interstate highways, but also rural roadways and low-income communities. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs. State DOTs are responsible for developing projects and coordinating with site owners and charging companies, which can be an arduous process, markedly different from planning routine infrastructure projects.

A national issue that the funding seeks to address is that while public chargers are relatively plentiful in big cities and suburbs where EV adoption is high — think San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Chicago, Miami and New York — they're lacking in rural and remote communities in places like Montana, Wyoming and upstate New York, where EVs sales are low. That geographic disparity contributes to charging anxiety. Drivers are worried that there aren't enough charging stations outside of metro regions, which accentuates their fears of running out of juice, especially on long trips. And harrowing tales of broken, vandalized or otherwise non-working chargers feed into the trepidations.

According to Paren, four of the five years of NEVI funding, or $3.2 billion, has been approved for all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Yet only $616 million has been awarded by 33 states to 104 applicants for 1,000 charging stations. To date, 60 charging stations with a combined 268 ports have been built, using $33 million of NEVI funds. While the federal government has not released figures, Paren estimates that perhaps less than $25 million has actually been transferred to states to reimburse charging companies for incurred expenses.

Stark evidence of the Trump administration's plans to target EV charging came on Feb. 6, when the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration issued a memo to state DOTs informing them that it was suspending NEVI. The memo stated that FHWA will publish revised NEVI guidelines this spring and solicit public comment before final rules are determined. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy subsequently told Fox Business News that any existing contracts that have been signed "are still going to be funded, but there will be no new funding priorities or projects as we go through a review process."

The NEVI freeze created immediate confusion among state DOTs, especially as to whether the approved funds will indeed be allocated. "We need that to happen, because this program works on a reimbursable basis," said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Many states, he said, "have essentially issued stop work orders, even for existing contracts, because they don't want to be left holding the bag if the feds decide not to reimburse for any work."

Historically, new administrations have set their transportation priorities and shifted them accordingly. Yet amending programs and funding that are authorized in law — including NEVI, for which funding has been delayed — would require an act of Congress. The Trump administration, nonetheless, sidestepped Congress and unilaterally suspended NEVI and its funding formula while it considers new guidelines.

In the interim, if those approved funds are not allocated to states, the courts may end up determining whether the freeze is legal. In a ruling on March 6, a federal judge blocked the president's hold on congressionally approved funds obligated to state agencies and governments, which could conceivably apply to any attempts to renege on NEVI funding.

Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, has a jaundiced view of the motivation behind the NEVI pause. "The administration's plan is not to actually impact the deployment of charging infrastructure," he said. "It's to drive the narrative that we're killing those evil EVs and EV chargers."

For the small sector of EV charging companies, headlined by a trio of publicly owned pure-plays — ChargePoint Holdings, Blink Charging and EVgo — all of the EV uncertainty has been enough to keep shares under considerable pressure, with year-to-date declines of 35% to 50% and two of the three stocks currently trading below $1.

ChargePoint provides infrastructure hardware, software and services to businesses and fleets that operate EV charging networks. Competitors Blink and EVgo own and operate their own chargers and networks, while also supporting third-party operators. All three experienced substantial stock falloffs starting in 2024, and investors are keeping a wary eye on their performance over the coming months.

The rest of the EV charging industry encompasses a diverse array of players, among them privately held startups, a joint venture between eight automotive OEMs known as IONNA, highway truck stop and travel centers like Love's, Kwik Trip and Pilot Flying J, convenience store chains including Wawa, Sheetz and 7-Eleven, and big-box retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco.  

Nearly half of the NEVI awardees are members of the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, the trade association for more than 250 highway truck stops and travel centers, and SIGMA, which represents fuel marketers. David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for both groups, is critical of NEVI's "incoherent patchwork, not only of grant requirements, but of regulatory and market backdrops in different states that are wholly untethered to one another." So if the program's pause "is a bona fide effort to turn it into something more market-oriented and consumer-oriented," Fialkov said, "we think that's ultimately better for the market."

McDonald says a look at the industry numbers shows that the reality is, "whatever they attempt to do is probably going to have little to no actual impact on deployment."

In 2025, for example, about 10% of fast-charging ports may be funded through NEVI. McDonald estimated that a total of about 16,000 new fast-charging ports will be added this year. "From a macro perspective, the industry is not dependent on federal funding," he said. At most, he added, "only about 1,500 of those will be NEVI-funded, and maybe even fewer," depending on the breadth of changes to the program.

During an earnings call on March 4, Rick Wilmer, president and CEO of ChargePoint, told analysts that NEVI-related deals represented an "insignificant portion" of its revenue in 2024 and the company did not anticipate NEVI changes would have a material effect on its business.

According to Paren data, ChargePoint has received three NEVI awards totaling $1.75 million.

Separately, Wilmer told CNBC that in the context of NEVI, ChargePoint supports its customers that operate charging stations and sell electricity. "We're very intentional about not doing that, because it would put us in direct competition with them," he said. "We provide the technology and the solutions and help our customers apply for and win NEVI funding. So in the grand scheme of things, NEVI is a very small portion of our business."

ChargePoint reported positive results for the fourth quarter of its FY2025, ended in January, though full-year revenue declined more than 17%, and its stock has fallen roughly 60% over the past year.

The EV charging industry is going through an evolution right now, according to Craig Irwin, an industry analyst at Roth Capital Partners, and companies not dependent on subsidies have better prospects. "The focus on putting credible products out there without subsidy dollars is a winning strategy," he said. "People want chargers in front of their libraries, real estate developments and other public places. The demand is still there."

A spokesperson for EVgo, which sites its public chargers in just such high-use urban and metro areas, said that it has received minimal funding through NEVI. The company generates revenue from the utilization of its charging network and taps into other incentive programs offered by state governments and utility companies, whose programs do not include the same geographic constraints as NEVI.  

In December, EVgo announced the closing of a $1.25 billion guaranteed loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, a financing commitment it has pointed to as a sign of certainty. "This loan ensures we are fully funded to add at least 7,500 [ports at roughly 1,100 charging stations], more than tripling our installed base over the next five years," CEO Badar Khan told analysts during its earnings call earlier this month.

Yet the Trump administration has threatened to find ways to retroactively pull DOE loan funding approved in the last days of the Biden administration, which sprinted to get deals finalized before Trump's inauguration.

EVgo has been growing, reporting fourth-quarter 2024 revenue up 35% year-over-year, and up 60% for the full year. But despite those gains, the company continues to operate at a loss.

Blink says it does not depend much on NEVI to fund its charging infrastructure, relying instead on hardware sales, software subscriptions, charging revenue and corporate partnerships. "The majority of our other funding is within the largest utility companies," said CEO Mike Battaglia. "There are some [state] grants out there, as well, that we take advantage of."

Blink achieved record charging revenue last year, and significantly grew the Blink-owned network, according to its recent Q4 and full year report on March 13. Yet, revenue declined in the fourth quarter and for the full year in comparison to "exceptionally strong equipment sales in 2023," Battaglia said. The company said it expects revenue will pick up in the second half of 2025 and to have a better idea as to when it will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability later in the year.

Then there's the elephant in the room — Tesla, whose sales and stock price have plunged lately following a post-election surge. Tesla is in a unique position, as a manufacturer of both branded EVs and charging stations — and whose CEO Elon Musk has emerged as a central character not just in the sector, but across the entire economic and political landscape.

It has heavily invested in building out its network of superchargers, which are compatible with a growing number of other OEMs' EV models, including GM, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Rivian. And its proprietary NACS charging connector and port is being adopted by other charging companies. Ironically, considering that Musk favors getting rid of EV subsidies, Tesla is the second-largest recipient of NEVI funds, granted more than $41 million for 99 sites. Elon Musk said in the lead-up to the election that any Trump policies that hurt EVs would hurt his competitors more than Tesla, but recently, Tesla and other Musk firms have been lobbying the government, at least on the issue of tariffs.

With so much uncertainty looming over the EV charging industry — plus the shakeout that typically occurs among nascent tech industries — there's bound to be consolidation this year. Several companies have already declared bankruptcy or gone out of business, including the North American affiliates of European utility-owned charging companies, Enel X and EVBox, and Tritium, which runs an EV charging equipment plant in Tennessee and was acquired by an Indian conglomerate after declaring insolvency in 2024.

Depending on the outcome of the NEVI situation, companies that heavily rely on its funds and can't access alternative capital sources may go belly up or partner with other entities. The fate of the public companies remains to be seen, while Tesla spins in its own topsy-turvy orbit. In the meantime, EV adoption does continue to increase, and more chargers will be installed in a growing number of places. It's the pace, and the winners and losers, that are yet to be determined.

Oops, something went wrong

Girls just want to have funds, to paraphrase the Cyndi Lauper tune.

Cary Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and the author of the new book "Women and Wealth," knows all about that.

Her decades of being a sherpa for women in the male-dominated financial services field serves as the backdrop for this book, which is aimed at teaching her colleagues about the psychology behind women's financial mojo and the best ways to attract and retain female clients.

It's also flush with insights and strategies for individual women working to take control of their money lives.

I know firsthand what it's like to sit in front of a male financial adviser who only directed his attention to my husband, leaving me feeling dismissed and unheard. We fired him.

Carbonaro's mission is to help women and their financial advisers align so that doesn't happen to others. I asked her to share some of her strategic insights. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Kerry Hannon: Women and financial advisers have had a long history of not getting each other. Is that why you wrote this book?

Cary Carbonaro: The next wave of growth in wealth management is women. That was the basis for writing this book. The industry hasn't done anything for the upcoming wealth shift. Thanks to their longer life expectancies, women will inherit wealth, both from baby boomer parents and spouses. In five years, women are expected to control a significant portion of the trillions in financial wealth that will be transferred. The timing is now.

What are the challenges that women face?

The wage gap with their male counterparts. Longevity — women live longer than men. We spend more money in retirement on healthcare than men. We've got a confidence gap related to managing money. We have time out of the workforce for caregiving. Finally, in general, women are more conservative than men when it comes to investing.

You write that women set themselves up for failure when managing money. In what way?

In my experience, women are emotionally tied to money. Feelings and emotions get wrapped around money with women more than men. They get attached to all kinds of things, houses, and stocks. There's an emotional tie to it where they sometimes can't make a clear decision because their feelings are involved. Guys don't have that issue as much.

How can financial advisers better serve women?

They can work on better communication. Women want to be spoken to in a language that's comfortable to them. The industry is all about male terms. Male advisers talk about beating the S&P 500 and use sports analogies.

That doesn't resonate with many women. Women don't care about beating the S&P 500. Women care about, am I going to be okay? Am I going to run out of money? Are my children going to be okay? Am I going to be a bag lady? Can I go on this vacation? Can I buy a second house? Women want to tie money to life events.

I'm not dumbing it down at all for women. I'm just telling them I'm putting it in life goals rather than dollars and cents and jargon. Totally different.

You also see a role for financial advisers to help women with career building. How so?

I help my female clients in negotiating for themselves as they ask for raises and salaries when they're going for jobs. I coach all of them on that because it's part of wealth-building.

Why aren't there more women advisers?

Women make up only about a quarter of all certified professional advisers, CFPs, or 24,546 out of a total of 103,093.

It is so hard to get women involved. Younger women don't think of it as a career path. Once we do bring them in, it's hard for them to stay. They get burned out. Out of those 23%, very few of those women are rainmakers. There is still cultural bias about women not being as sophisticated about money even as advisers.

Read more: What is a financial adviser, and what do they do?

More women are the breadwinners in their homes these days. How does this impact their financial outlook?

What's super exciting about this is that the numbers of women breadwinners have been moving up. By 2030, women are finally going to be majority breadwinners in the United States for the first time in history. Mind-blowing, right?

The challenge is having a spouse supporting them. You really need to have a very strong spouse who is OK with you making more money, and who is going to take a secondary role to help with the children and the caregiving and the household.

Another challenge for women breadwinners is how they relate with their friends. Are their friends supportive? Is their family supportive? Or are they taking shots at them because they don't spend more time with the kids, go to PTA meetings, and get involved with fundraisers?

As an adviser, I work with them to learn to be a strong financial person not just making the money but knowing what to do with it once they have it, and balancing that piece with the rest of their life.

What makes you crazy about how women view their financial future?

Many younger women still think someone else will be in charge of their financial future and take care of it for them. I recently gave a presentation at a very elite high school. It was a mixed group of girls and guys. I asked the group of girls how many thought that they were going to be responsible for their own financial future. And maybe 5% of the hands went up.

About 90% of women are going to be responsible at some point in their lives for their finances. They will either be divorced, single, or widowed. I don't want women to get in those situations where they're vulnerable, and they don't know anything, and then they trust the wrong person.

What role does fear play?

Fear has made me a huge saver and investor and better adviser. I have always saved up to 50% of my pay, which is a crazy number. I don't spend what I make. I never have. I never will. I'm now 57, and I'm finally spending, because there's no reason not to spend at this point in my life. I have to turn the spending spigot on, which is really, really hard for me because fear has kept me from spending all these years. I work with many women in the same situation.

If they have turned off the spending spigot for all these years, when I tell them they can turn it on, they're like, what? I don't even know how to do that. It's such a different shift in mindset.

You write about the designer bag lady syndrome? Explain.

Loads of women who make over $200,000 a year still have the bag lady fear. I am one of them. This is really personal to me. We still feel there's a chance that we could be penniless, homeless, and a bag lady. It's a fear — even if it's irrational in some cases, but it's what drove them and me all these years to feather my nest.

What keeps you up at night these days?

What keeps me up at night is that my profession is not changing and is not helping women enough. I want to make a dent in this profession, and I want to change the way women are treated in meetings with their advisers.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's antitrust enforcers are not backing down from legal fights with Big Tech, even as the administration signals a willingness to take a lighter touch with artificial intelligence.

The administration is pressing ahead with two antitrust lawsuits already taken to trial against Google (GGOG, GOOGL) and prepping for new antitrust trials against Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (APPL).

Trump officials at the Federal Trade Commission are also broadening a probe into Microsoft (MSFT) and its relationship with AI upstart OpenAI while challenging Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard.

"This isn't the Bush administration," Trump's FTC chair Andrew Ferguson told a group of American CEOs on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., referring to one of the weakest US antitrust enforcement periods in modern history.

But Trump is also showing he may take a lighter approach to AI as the US competes with China for world supremacy in that ascendant technology.

In a March 7 filing, Trump's Justice Department argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up.

"The DOJ action is not just a signal on how the President will treat AI, it is a reaction to, and clear response to, the policy of the president and vice-president," said JD Harriman, former outside patent counsel for Steve Jobs at Apple and a partner with Foundation Law Group.

Boston College Law professor David Olson agreed that the DOJ's decision not to interfere with Google's AI ambitions is evidence of a shift from the Biden era.

"Just from a policy standpoint, I think that it's telling that they might be walking back [AI remedies], specifically," Olson said. "Of all of the things they could have walked back, that was the one they decided."

The tech world is trying to determine how aggressive Trump's antitrust enforcers will be following four years of a Biden administration marked by legal fights with many of Silicon Valley's biggest names.

Trump FTC boss Ferguson made it clear in his speech that his agency wouldn't be backing down. The FTC, he said, would challenge mergers it suspects would harm Americans economically but leave the rest alone.

To that end, the FTC told a judge this week that it was ready to start a trial against Amazon in September.

The FTC also plans to widen its investigation into Microsoft, according to Bloomberg. The probe was first launched by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, a key architect of a new movement seeking to expand the legal theories that can give rise to antitrust claims.

By sustaining many of these cases and probes against Big Tech, Trump has parted ways with traditional Republican-style enforcement, said Peter Salib, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

"It's very hard to say what's going on," Salib added.

Antitrust attorney Mark Wagoner noted following Trump's win in November, "I am not necessarily convinced that we're going to go back to what people would call sort of the regular order of Republicans."

"The new Republican Party is very much a populist party," he added. "It's no longer the party of big business."

Salib said Trump's motivation for going after companies like Meta (which owns Facebook) and Google is to curb censorship of conservative content.

"The reason they're treating [tech] this way is so different," Salib said. Under Biden, "big was bad for all kinds of reasons."

But it's clear the administration shares some of the same competition concerns that bothered the Biden administration.

That may come to the fore again next month when FTC is set to face off against social media giant Meta (META) in an antitrust lawsuit brought during Trump's first term in office.

Starting April 14, the parties are scheduled to appear for trial in the federal district court for the District of Columbia. The government seeks to unwind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

The government alleges the company leveraged its acquisitions to block rivals from the market for personal social networking services.

This spring, the Justice Department will also be involved in a trial that will determine what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire. That decision is in the hands of federal Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for "general search" and "general search text.”

The DOJ has stuck to a Biden-era request for a federal judge to break up Alphabet's Google, calling for divestment of its Chrome browser.

But in the same request, the DOJ also stood down on the prior administration's push for Google to sell off its AI investments.

This lighter touch with AI has support from Congress too, according to Harriman, a partner with Foundation Law Group.

In December, he said, a congressional bipartisan task force on AI made it clear in a report that lawmakers would take a "wait and see" attitude on AI regulation.

They expressed concern over China's AI advancements and the industry's potential impact on military strength, noting that the country had secured more AI patent applications, journal publications, and journal citations.

"This gives the President a clear path to drop the pressure on Google to divest, without fear of congressional override or even complaint," Harriman said.

There have been other signs of AI restraint as well. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order issued by President Biden that directed AI developers to apply AI "responsibly,” including by disclosing their safety test results to the government.

Trump instead issued an executive order titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," which emphasized deregulation in the interest of encouraging American dominance.

The order directed federal advisers in technology and national security to "enhance America's global AI dominance."

At the Paris AI Summit on Feb. 11, Vice President JD Vance then emphasized AI opportunity over safety concerns.

"I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago," Vance said. "I'm here to talk about AI opportunity."

"[T]o restrict its development now would not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations."

Oops, something went wrong

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has entered correction, falling 10% from its February all-time highs as political uncertainty has driven fears over the market outlook. 

"There's been a sentiment shift," Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. "The sentiment and the client and investor focus has completely swung upside down versus where we started the year."

Entering 2025, the consensus on Wall Street called for the US economy to grow at a healthy pace and lead continued outperformance of the US equity market against the rest of the world. Now, the prevailing market fear is that President Trump's current economic policies — namely tariffs, federal job cuts, and strict immigration — could further slow economic growth. This has prompted several economic research teams to lower their GDP forecasts, some strategists to cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, and stocks around the rest of the world to outperform the US market.

Still, few are calling for an overall lackluster year in US stocks. In a note to clients this week, Yardeni Research cut its 2025 year-end S&P 500 target from 7,000 to 6,400, which represents a roughly 14% increase from current levels. Notably, the forecast didn't come with a projection for lower earnings growth this year. Instead, the Yardeni team is now just assuming the S&P 500 won't return its record-high valuation seen entering the year.

"We still think earnings growth is going to be good," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "There hasn't been a lot that's actually fundamentally changed about the economy. It's more so just uncertainty is weighing on [valuation] multiples."

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

To Wallerstein's point, while views on the economic outlook have soured, most economists and equity strategists aren't actually calling for a recession. And some have even argued that since the S&P 500 has sold off so far on the growth concerns, the market's rerating may be overdone. BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri told Yahoo Finance her team remains "overweight US equities."

"We're not really worried about a recession yet," Gargi Chaudhuri said. "So if there was a concern around recession, the conversation that we would be having would be a little bit different right now. This is just a pullback from some of the price to perfection that we had in the beginning of the year coming into this year, and this is a healthy pullback."

Research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high.

Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. But only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market.

"We do not see a bear market coming," Detrick told Yahoo Finance. "Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening."

The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market.

"These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more," Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added that this makes him "very comfortable" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500.

"In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red," Belski said.

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The end of the first quarter is nearing, and President Trump just passed the 50-day mark in his second tour at the White House.

It's safe to say this will be a face-ripping year for investors.

More volatility in markets. More earnings misses and warnings. More negative economic surprises. More stock rating downgrades. And trades that have worked amazingly well in the past few years (looking at you, Nvidia (NVDA)) not working so amazingly anymore.

Watch: Why Lego's CEO is worried about tariffs

And when it seems like these things are over and the coast is clear, all the negativity is rinsed and repeated — causing more face-ripping moments at your trading screen or in chats with a financial adviser.

"We've had a couple of pretty sanguine years and years where we didn't see the usual two or three pullbacks of 5% to 15%," Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). "That's a very typical thing to happen. And so, in a moment where we've got uncertainty from policy and tariffs and things like that, the markets are reacting. It was to be expected. And so investors are reacting."

Boy are they reacting!

As it stands, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has pulled back 10% from its Feb. 19 high.

Nvidia is down 14% year to date, and Tesla (TSLA) is down 40%. So much for money-minting momentum names!

The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1%, according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. At this point last year, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was "abnormally" low.

"The market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.

Listen: Rubbermaid CEO says tariffs are bad for business

Yet despite a lot of the bad news being known by investors, what is there to be excited about in the markets at this precise time?

Sure, if you want to buy and hold a dividend-paying company (or even an Nvidia) for the next 25 years you will probably be wealthier than you are today. But from a near-term perspective, the tape stinks and there looks to be a wave of bad economic and corporate news coming (see the first quarter earnings season start, if the latest warnings from Delta (DAL), Southwest (LUV), and American Airlines (AAL) are any sign as to what's ahead).

So here are 13 basic things I just do not like about the market right now. Don't agree with me on any of these? That's cool. I don't have all the answers. I do want to know your thoughts though. Drop me a line on X @BrianSozzi.

The defensive trade — see healthcare and staples — continues to outperform.

The crypto sell-off continues, and the asset class is no longer viewed as a relatively safe haven.

Markets continue to sell off on tariff headlines — suggesting the issue is not priced in yet.

The dips are not being bought with any degree of confidence.

Financial warnings have surfaced because of growth concerns (see airlines).

Investors are hammering companies that warn, suggesting they have been too sanguine.

Dysfunctional government is a risk, which Sen. Ted Cruz reminded me of in a chat.

CEOs are beginning to articulate worse scenarios to investors due to government policy changes after not doing so late in 2024.

Investors still aren't fearful enough (the conversations I had with the CEOs of Edward Jones and Charles Schwab (SCHW) reminded me of that this week).

Recession calls are startling markets.

There are increasing signs of economic weakness in less mainstream economic reports.

There are no table-pounding sell-side calls on the "Magnificent Seven" stocks in the face of major sell-offs.

Price target cuts have been trickling in on widely held names (see Morgan Stanley this week on Apple (AAPL)).

Oops, something went wrong

Overwhelmed by out-of-pocket medical costs, Valerie Towe and her husband, Paul, saw their debt load begin to swell last year.

Facing a steady stream of bills for 77-year-old Paul's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and neuropathy, Valerie began to tap credit cards to keep up.

“I wasn't able to make ends meet,” Valerie, 65, told Yahoo Finance.

The cost of weekly groceries added to the strain — nearly doubling last year, she said. And to top it off, as her caregiving duties ramped up, Valerie shifted to a part-time job.

“When you're a caregiver, you can't work a full-time job,” she said.

The worst of it, as anyone who has rolled over credit card balances month to month knows, is the ballooning debt that accrues when you can only pay the minimum amount of the balance on credit cards that are ladened with interest rates topping 20%.

That's all Valerie has been able to do, and the result is a gut-punching credit card debt nearing $30,000, she said.

Nearly half of adults 50 and older who carry credit card debt use credit cards to pay for basic living expenses, according to a new AARP report. And roughly 3 in 10 older adults with credit card debt have more of it than a year ago.

More sobering: Nearly half of them owe $5,000 or more, and 28% carry a balance of $10,000 or more.

That has serious repercussions for retirement savings.

“Many older Americans with credit card debt who hope to retire soon will have to make the difficult decision of whether to pay down debt or save for retirement,” Indira Venkat, senior vice president of research at AARP, told Yahoo Finance. “For those who have already retired and are living on a fixed income, it can be a challenge to both pay down a credit card and make ends meet.”

She's right on that one. When people say what they regret the most after they retire, a biggie is retiring with too much debt.

In 2024, almost 7 in 10 retirees with debt reported having credit card debt outstanding, per a survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). That's up from 4 in 10 four years ago.

And while the rising cost of groceries, housing, and vehicles are the byproducts of sticky inflation, one of the biggest culprits of credit card debt is out-of-pocket medical costs such as prescription drugs, which the Towes are grappling with. Dental and vision care add up too, Venkat said.

If they could turn the clock back, nearly a quarter of retirees say they would have made paying down credit card and other debts a priority before they exited the workforce, according to a new Fidelity Investments report.

The emergence of credit card debt for older Americans is not fading away anytime soon. Roughly 1 in 5 expect to take more than five years to pay it off, per the AARP report.

The decision to pay down debt or save for retirement is a reality for many older Americans as they near retirement. More than half of those currently working say that their debt is interfering with their ability to save, a recent report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found.

Troubling, too, is that the debt has pushed them to tap into existing retirement savings. One in 3 workers has taken a loan, early withdrawal, or hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) or similar plan or IRA, per Transamerica.

Among those who have taken out a loan or withdrawn from their 401(k) or similar plan, the most frequently cited reasons are medical bills and paying off credit card debt.

More evidence: Last year, hardship withdrawals increased over 2023, with 4.8% of participants tapping their retirement savings, up from 3.6%, according to Vanguard Group, which administers 401(k)-type accounts for nearly 5 million people.

When you withdraw from a traditional 401(k) account, you get slapped with paying income tax, and typically a 10% penalty if you're younger than 59 1⁄2.

Here's an easy first step: Call your credit card issuer and ask for a lower interest rate, pointing out — if true — your history of on-time payments.

If your provider won't budge, shop for a 0% balance transfer card. You can shift your current high-cost credit card debt over to a new card with a 0% promotional rate lasting as long as 21 months. There is, however, a 3%-5% transfer fee of the total amount you transfer, but that long interest-free period will give you some space to begin to pay the balance down.

Automating your monthly payments and paying more than the minimum is the ticket to whittling away at your debts.

There are a few strategies to consider for reducing your overall debt. The avalanche method involves paying off debt with the highest interest rate first. Other people opt for the snowball method, which focuses on smaller debts first. I'm in the avalanche school, but whatever works best for you matters.

Alternatives also include consolidating all of your credit card debt with a personal loan. It's possible to land an interest rate as low as about 7% over seven years if you have strong credit, which regrettably is not often the case if you've accumulated too much debt.

If you have multiple balances across several cards and a balance transfer card or personal loan won't cover the total debt, I recommend tackling the highest annual interest rate first, while still making payments on the rest to steadily lower the interest charges.

A nonprofit credit counselor may also be able to negotiate with your credit card issuers to give you a break on rates, but you will pay a fee for the service. The Justice Department website provides a list of approved credit counseling agencies.

A business that is looking to open a travel plaza in Ripley has purchased additional land.

 Analysts split opinions on Bitcoin's next price move, but technical charts look promising for BNB, TON, GT and ATOM. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to break above the 200-day simple moving average ($84,000), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin needs to achieve a weekly close above $81,000 to signal resilience. Selling could accelerate if the price plummets below $76,000.

Another cautious voice was that of Markus Thielen, head crypto researcher at 10x Research. Thielen told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin's chart structure “suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation.” Thielen remains doubtful of a strong price recovery in Bitcoin at the current juncture.

However, Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson has a different view. In an X post, Peterson said that April and October are the two months that generate a large portion of Bitcoin's annual performance. That suggests Bitcoin could rise to a “new all-time high before June.”

Could buyers drive Bitcoin above the short-term overhead resistance levels? If they do, what other top cryptocurrencies may rally in the near term?

The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($86,188) suggests that bears are in command, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates that the selling pressure is reducing.

If the price turns down from the current level, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $80,000 and then to $76,606. 

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the markets have rejected the breakdown below the 200-day SMA. The pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($93,033) and, after that, to $100,000. Buyers may find it difficult to surpass the psychological barrier at $100,000.

The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to drive the pair above the resistance line to gain the upper hand. The pair may climb to $92,810 and then to $95,000.

The downside support is at $80,000 and next at $78,000. If the supports crack, the possibility of a drop below $76,606 increases. 

BNB (BNB) started a recovery from $507 on March 11, which is facing selling at the 50-day SMA ($621).

The 20-day EMA ($595) is the critical near-term support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are buying on minor dips. That improves the prospects of a break above the 50-day SMA. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally toward $686.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bears are fiercely defending the 50-day SMA. The pair may tumble to $550.

The 20-EMA has turned up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating a bullish sentiment. There is resistance at $632, but if buyers overcome it, the pair could jump to $680.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. The pair may dip to the 50-SMA, which is again likely to attract buyers. A break below the 50-SMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

Toncoin (TON) rose sharply from $2.35 on March 11 and reached the 50-day SMA ($3.64) on March 16.

The correction from the 50-day SMA is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($3.15). If that happens, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the possibility of a rally above the 50-day SMA. The TON/USDT pair could climb to $4 and later to $5.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then drop toward $2.50.

TON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows the up move is facing selling at the $3.60 level, but buyers are expected to defend the 20-EMA on declines. If the price turns up sharply from the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the price above $4.15. If they manage to do that, the pair could jump toward $4.67.

Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may drop to the 50-SMA and subsequently to $2.50.

Gate Token (GT) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.

GT/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($21.06) is flattening out, and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers drive the price above the triangle, it will signal the resumption of the upmove. The GT/USDT pair could climb to $24 and eventually to $26.

If the price continues lower and closes below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the triangle for a while. The bears will be back in command on a break below the triangle.

GT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are finding it difficult to maintain the price below the 20-EMA. That suggests demand at lower levels. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they do that, the pair could rally toward $24.

Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will signal that the bullish momentum is weakening. The pair may descend to $19 and eventually to the support line.

Cosmos (ATOM) broke above the 20-day EMA ($4.31) on March 15, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The RSI has formed a positive divergence, suggesting that the bearish momentum is weakening. The 50-day SMA ($4.73) could act as resistance but is likely to be crossed. A close above $5.15 could open the doors for a rally to $6.50.

The 20-day EMA is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. If this support gives way, it will signal that the bears remain sellers on rallies. That could sink the ATOM/USDT pair to $3.50. 

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The pair started a pullback in the near term, which could reach the 20-EMA. If the price turns up from the 20-EMA, it will signal a positive sentiment where the bulls are buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a break above $5.15. If that happens, the pair may surge to $5.50 and then to $6.50.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-SMA and later to $3.80.

Key Takeaways:

On March 13th, the State Senate unanimously passed House Bill 701 (HB 701), positioning Kentucky to lead the nation on cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Dubbed the Bill of Rights for Bitcoiners, this landmark piece of legislation is formally titled An Act relating to blockchain digital assets and its focus is on (1) securing an individual's right to self-custody of Bitcoin and (2) implementing fair regulations for digital asset mining operations in the state. The stunning unanimous vote, 37-0, was a strong, bipartisan endorsement of the burgeoning crypto industry and its promise.



HB 701 originated in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where it also received unanimous approval and passed by a 91-0 vote on February 28, 2025. The bill's seamless passage through both legislative chambers reflects the recognition among Kentucky lawmakers that embracing digital asset technologies and the related innovation underpinning them is critical for the state.

Sponsored by Representatives Adam Bowling and T.J. Roberts, HB 701 addresses key concerns of both individual Bitcoin users and businesses operating in the digital asset space:

Self-Custody Guaranteed: The proposal guarantees the right of individuals to utilize and hold their digital assets in self-hosted wallets, giving them ultimate custody of their crypto. Adam said this measure is critical to protect people's financial freedom and prevent government overreach into Bitcoin. This is a victory for Bitcoin supporters who have faith in decentralization and independence.

Mining-Friendly Zoning Ordinances: The most important provision of HB 701 is its prohibition of discriminatory zoning laws targeting the digital asset mining industry. Specifically, the legislation will prohibit governments from imposing zoning changes intended to block or destroy Bitcoin mining activities. This ensures that miners in Kentucky will not face unfair regulatory targeting, Representative T.J. Roberts stated.

Exclusion From Money Transmitter Licensing: In Kentucky, home-based Bitcoin miners and digital asset mining companies are excluded from the requirements of Kentucky's money transmitter law. This eliminates regulatory obstacles and encourages innovation to be a destination in mining.

As HB 701 was up for debate in the Kentucky Senate, Bitcoin experienced a significant recovery from a recent slump to reach $85,301 after dipping to $77,000. This bounce paralleled a wider recovery across the cryptocurrency market as altcoins including Solana, Chainlink and XRP also enjoyed a price rise.

The passage of HB 701 through Kentucky's legislature—despite the volatility of the crypto market—underscores its commitment to fostering a long-term sustainable ecosystem for digital assets in the state. Lawmakers seem to be recognizing that Bitcoin's technology and broader implications go far beyond mere price speculation.

HB 701 in Kentucky could provide a model for enacting similar reconciliation measures in other states as they seek to applicability of rules in the often fuzzy world of crypto. Kentucky is building a more attractive ecosystem for innovation and investment through establishing clear legal frameworks for both Bitcoin self-custody and mining activities.

Most other states are still figuring out how to best regulate cryptocurrencies, and some have been more cautious or even restrictive. The recent assertiveness announced by Kentucky may motivate other states to implement similar progressive policies, creating a more cohesive and supportive regulatory environment for the digital asset industry as a whole.

CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange James Davies noted that the recent crypto recovery seemed connected to macro factors. This indicates that external factors also play a significant role in crypto adoption.

The last step in the journey for HB 701 is the Governor's signature. Once the bill is signed into law by the Governor, it will officially cement Kentucky as one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the country. This sends a strong signal to the cryptocurrency industry and could bring another influx of businesses and investors in the state.

Kentucky is poised to become a financial hub due to its proactive regulatory approach and commitment to innovation. The passage of HB 701 is a pivotal step toward that vision.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against other best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now.

Cryptocurrency stocks are on the move in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump announcing plans for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” The possibility of a cryptocurrency reserve is a significant step toward Trump's goal of making the United States the global center of cryptocurrency.

The United States already possesses several strategic stockpiles, such as medical and military assets. In times of need, the government draws from these unique reserves. To keep the Federal Reserve afloat, the government would probably be actively purchasing and disposing of cryptocurrencies as part of the strategic reserve push.

“This move signals a shift toward active participation in the crypto economy by the U.S. government,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, a digital assets investment management firm. “It has the potential to accelerate institutional adoption, provide greater regulatory clarity, and strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in digital asset innovation.”

Additionally, some Bitcoin holders think that a cryptocurrency reserve may act as an inflation hedge. They contend that at times of global economic crisis, the value of Bitcoin may surpass that of the dollar, citing the currency's declining worth over time. However, cryptocurrencies have shown to be highly volatile during recent geopolitical events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, some experts believe that the US government purchasing Bitcoin could endanger the dollar's standing internationally.

Critics contend that cryptocurrency is a speculative investment and has historically been volatile, while proponents claim that the proceeds may be used to pay down the country's massive debt. Approximately 200,000 Bitcoin tokens are thought to be held in the United States due to illegal seizures. The total value of that exceeds $17 billion. With a reserve, these holdings might be expanded to include three lesser-known cryptocurrencies, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, in addition to Ethereum.

Amid the “crypto strategic reserve” push, cryptocurrency stocks' popularity is growing as investors explore ways of diversifying their investment portfolio beyond traditional asset classes. The stocks stand out partly because they offer crypto exposure without requiring one to own the underlying volatile crypto asset. Additionally, the stocks provide both growth potential and innovation. Many experts regard them as being safer than direct cryptocurrency investments.

To determine the 13 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now, we analyzed the US market for companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Our in-depth analysis focused on firms with solid prospects due to their investments in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. We reviewed ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the hedge fund stakes in them during Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Average Upside Potential as of March 11: 129.41%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, holding 499,096 BTC as of February. Similarly, it was the best-performing cryptocurrency in 2024, rallying by more than 140%. The impressive run came on the company, delivering solid financial results that were helped by Bitcoin prices rallying to record highs.

On February 5th, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) revealed its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. While its revenue from subscription services rose 48% to $31.9 million, its reported revenue of $120.7 million was down 3% from the previous year. Revenue from product licenses increased 18.3% year over year to $47.2 million.

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) also announced plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years. A good chunk of the funds will bolster the company's Bitcoin holdings. It also announced the completion of $20 billion of its $42 billion capital plan, often known as the 21/21 plan. It also updated its annual Bitcoin yield target to 15% for 2025.

Overall, MSTR ranks 5th on our list of best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Kevin Segal, a self-proclaimed “Bitcoin billionaire” who allegedly failed to appear for a court hearing after a friend posted his $50,000 bond.

Prosecutors accuse Segal of swindling Wyoming businesses out of more than $212,000. The 30-year-old California resident faces up to 141 years in prison if convicted. 

According to a report by The Daily Mail, Segal posed as a wealthy businessman attempting to purchase millions in real estate in the Jackson Hole area while leaving a trail of unpaid bills at luxury resorts and businesses. 

Judge Bill Simpson issued a bench warrant across all 50 states after Segal skipped his Wednesday court appearance and allegedly failed to surrender his passport as ordered.

Jason Irvine, who posted Segal's bond, told Cowboy State Daily he maxed out three credit cards to help what he believed was a friend in need. Irvine claims Segal had promised him “a large Bitcoin payout that equated to half a million dollars” in exchange for posting the bond but disappeared after being released from jail on Feb. 14.

“He explained the situation and was basically denying all the charges written in the newspaper,” Irvine said. “[He] said it was libel and slander; and he didn't intend to defraud anybody. He was locked up in jail, and [said] that's why he couldn't pay anybody off.”

After feeling betrayed, Irvine sent Segal a text message: “You screwed me over, and now I really don't believe anything you say anymore. Irvine is now considering bankruptcy due to the financial damage.

Investigators discovered a pattern of fraudulent activities throughout Wyoming. Segal reportedly stayed at the luxurious Amangani resort with his mother and a friend, allegedly leaving a $2,725.76 bill unpaid.

At Spring Creek Ranch, three cards he used for bills totaling over $22,000 were reported to be fraudulent. It was also reported that he left the Mangy Moose Saloon with an unpaid $3,055.28 tab.

The alleged scams extended to individuals as well. Prosecutors say Segal hired a man to purchase a DJI drone in Colorado with a promise of reimbursement, then wrote a check for $3,281.46 that failed to clear.

In another instance, he sent a delivery man to drive a Dodge back to Los Angeles, promising to pay for return flights that were allegedly never purchased. The men were stranded and forced to buy their own tickets home, with Segal later sending a fake wire transfer screenshot to cover their $3,101 in expenses.

This isn't Segal's first legal trouble. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail show he previously faced a civil lawsuit claiming he falsely claimed to have stocks exceeding $340 million and a successful company to lease a Los Angeles property. 

If caught, Segal will face a substantially increased bond of $750,000 cash-only.

According to data provided by analytics platform Lookonchain, a Bitcoin whale recently opened a short position of $332 million in Bitcoin with an entry price of $84,040. 

The position was opened with 40X leverage, which means that the trader is borrowing 40 times the initial capital. 

Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $83,945, according to CoinGecko data. The cryptocurrency is down 2.3% over the past week. 

The massive position will get liquidated if the price of the leading cryptocurrency ends up spiking to the $85,000 level. 

The trader in question previously managed to rake in a whopping $16.39 million within a single month on popular decentralized perpetual trading platform Hyperliquid. Notably, all of his eight trades were profitable across two wallets. 

Some X commentators are now predicting that the trader will inevitably get liquidated given how precarious his position is.

"These types of guys will lose it all," one social media user said. 

The 40x leverage dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. It would take a mere 2.5% move to wipe out his entire position.

According to data provided by CoinGlass, a total of $94 million worth of crypto has been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with shorts making up the majority of the sum ($49 million). The largest single liquidation took place on Binance ($582,130 with the BTCUSDT pair). Overall, more than 65,000 traders have been liquidated over the aforementioned period of time. The Binance exchange accounts for 38.79% of the total liquidations.

Hi, 

Logout

The United States has created a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," an initiative that further highlights President Donald Trump's support for the cryptocurrency space. 
 

The reserve, which Trump described as "a digital Fort Knox," was established via an executive order earlier this month. 
 

"Fort Knox" is the US Army post in Kentucky that stores gold bullion and other valuables.

Funding details

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by some 200,000 bitcoins, worth about $17 billion. These bitcoins have been confiscated in the US as part of civil and criminal prosecutions. 
 

The reserve is meant to be secured indefinitely, with more Bitcoin allowed as long as it doesn't cost taxpayers anything.

Response

While the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initially caused a dip in Bitcoin's price, it has since stabilized. 
 

Analysts have attributed this lackluster response to the failure of the government to immediately purchase more Bitcoin. 
 

Dessislava Aubert from crypto data provider Kaiko stated that legally, "the US government must return Bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack."

Return

Aubert estimated that a large chunk of the seized Bitcoin, nearly 198,000 tokens, would have to be returned to victims of a hack at crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016. 
 

Observers are also closely watching if other digital tokens will be added to the reserve, as hinted in Trump's executive order.

Criticism

Critics have raised concerns about the US Bitcoin reserve, arguing that unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are risky assets with no intrinsic value. 
 

However, David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, believes that by storing Bitcoin over time, the government would protect itself from the cryptocurrency's massive short-term volatility. 
 

Some experts argue that like gold, Bitcoin can benefit from its rarity due to a limited supply of 21 million tokens.

Global trends

Brazil is also considering creating a cryptocurrency reserve, while Switzerland's central bank recently rejected the idea. 
 

Governments across the globe are actively participating in cryptocurrency, especially by selling court-seized digital assets. 
 

El Salvador made Bitcoin one of its official currencies but reversed the decision this year due to low citizen acceptance. 
 

Meanwhile, Bhutan holds nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin, nearly 30% of the kingdom's GDP.

Bitcoin dropped below $83,000 on Sunday as the crypto market continues its downward trend, yet several altcoins like Ancient8 and Apu Apustaja have turned bullish.

A8 has surged 160% in the past day, trading at $0.259 from a low of $0.09628. This massive price movement follows Bithumb's listing of A8 several months ago. 

The South Korean exchange, one of the largest in Asia, appears to have created a delayed effect as attention turns toward the token.

Market analysts point to three key factors behind this surge: increasing global attention, growing adoption rates, and a combination of strong holders and new market entrants. Beyond these market factors, there have been no major project developments to explain the sudden price jump.

Second on CoinGecko's top gainers list, APU has climbed 85% over the last 24 hours, reaching $0.0002479 from $0.0001325. The meme coin has also been trending on X recently. However, like many meme coins experiencing sudden pumps, there are no fundamental updates or developments behind the price movement.

Third on the list, ROAM Token has seen a 41% increase in the past day, moving from $0.136 to $0.1917.

The DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project, which focuses on creating an open wireless network through OpenRoaming and eSIM technologies, recently received a shoutout from Solana's (SOL) official X account.

Adding to its surge, ROAM announced it has reached a milestone of 2 million nodes globally, showcasing the growing adoption of its decentralized network infrastructure.

Despite these isolated bright spots, the overall crypto market continues its correction phase. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to $82,471 shows ongoing selling pressure that has affected most major cryptocurrencies. 

At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has also dropped to the $1,900 level.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been embraced by world leaders in recent years, with U.S. president Donald Trump reportedly planning to buy up huge swathes of bitcoin.

The bitcoin price has surged to around $80,000 per bitcoin, up from around $50,000 this time last year, though one legendary trader's prescient bitcoin price prediction has forecast a huge shift has already begun.

Now, as traders scramble to get ahead of countries that could rush to follow the U.S. into bitcoin, a leak has revealed Russia is using crypto to trade with China and India and skirt international sanctions—as the Bank of Russia opens up bitcoin and crypto buying to a “limited circle of Russian investors.”

Oil companies in Russia are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including ethereum and the stablecoin tether to help convert rubles to China's yuan and India's rupee, it was reported by Reuters, citing anonymous sources.

Bitcoin and crypto are now favored as a means of trade among Russia's oil companies to the extent they would continue to be used even if sanctions were lifted and the U.S. dollar could be used again, according to the report.

Russian oligarchs and billionaires hit by severe financial restrictions following the country's invasion of Ukraine reportedly turned to bitcoin and crypto as far back as 2022.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has announced this week it intends to allow a “limited circle of Russian investors” to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

“In accordance with the instructions of the president of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,” a translated announcement read.

"This is a new status that ... citizens will receive if their investments in securities and deposits exceed 100 million rubles or if their income over the past year was more than 50 million rubles.”

Russia's central bank has gradually softened its opposition to bitcoin and crypto, last year backing a law that allowed businesses to use crypto for international trade.

Russia's growing support for bitcoin and crypto comes as Donald Trump's administration gears up to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset, freezing the planned sale of bitcoin and crypto the U.S. has seized.

This week, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump's top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible—helping the reverse a bitcoin price sell-off that was triggered by Trump's bitcoin reserve plans falling short of expectations.

In December, a leak revealed Russia lawmakers were pushing for the country to create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to that proposed by Trump.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin had earlier praised bitcoin as an alternative to foreign currency reserves following the seizure of its funds by Western governments in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine.

Cathie Wood is one of the most vocal bulls on Wall Street when it comes to the potential of the technology sector. She founded ARK Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on investing exclusively in innovative technologies like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and more.

In fact, ARK was one of the first firms to win approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF last year. Wood and her team are extremely bullish on the world's largest cryptocurrency, predicting it could soar 1,660% to $1.48 million per coin by the year 2030.

The crypto currently trades at around $84,000, which is 21% below its record high. If ARK's prediction is right, the recent dip could be a great buying opportunity.

Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, which accounts for more than half of the total value of every cryptocurrency in circulation across the industry. If it were a company, it would be the seventh largest in the entire world. 

It's a speculative asset because it doesn't generate any revenue or earnings, nor does it have a legitimate use case in the real world. Therefore, its value is very hard to pin down.

Nevertheless, it has a series of unique qualities that have led investors to believe it's a good store of value, like a digital version of gold.

It's completely decentralized, which means it can't be controlled by any person, company, or government. It also has a capped supply of 21 million coins, which won't be fully mined until around the year 2140, so it offers the perception of scarcity. Lastly, as I touched on earlier, it can be purchased through dozens of ETFs from different issuers, allowing financial advisors and institutional investors to own it in a safe, regulated manner.

Those attributes have paved the way for Bitcoin to march to new record highs recently, despite most other cryptocurrencies failing to break above their best-ever levels from 2021 (or in some cases, even earlier).

In fact, had you bought Bitcoin 10 years ago and held on, you would be sitting on a 29,100% return -- enough to have turned an investment of $10,000 into $2.9 million! It has obliterated every other asset class over the last decade, from stocks to real estate to gold:



Bitcoin price data by YCharts.

In a report issued in 2023, ARK highlighted eight potential factors that could drive Bitcoin higher over the long term, but not all of them make sense, in my opinion. For example, it thinks Bitcoin could become the currency of choice in emerging markets, but even after El Salvador became the first country to adopt it as legal tender in 2021, it appears most consumers still aren't willing to use it (partly because of its volatility). 

Moreover, ARK believes individuals with a high net worth will increasingly own Bitcoin because it's harder for governments to seize than cash and other traditional assets. However, we know the U.S. government alone has successfully confiscated over 200,000 bitcoins, which are worth $17 billion at the current price. So, this particular theory doesn't really hold water. 

With that said, three of ARK's eight catalysts are somewhat plausible:

Setting my opinions aside for a moment, ARK believes Bitcoin could soar as high as $1.48 million per coin by 2030 based on the eight catalysts it outlined. That would give investors a potential return of 1,660% from where it currently trades.

Wood even went a step further at the Bitcoin Investor Day in March 2024. She said it could surpass ARK's bullish forecast and reach $3.8 million instead, based on the idea that ETFs could lay the groundwork for institutional investors to allocate 5% of their assets to the cryptocurrency. If she's right, that implies a potential upside of 4,420%.

If Bitcoin rose to a price of $1.48 million, it would have a fully diluted market capitalization of $31 trillion. In other words, it would be almost 10 times more valuable than Apple, which is currently the world's most valuable company with a $3.2 trillion market cap. It would also be worth more than the output of the entire U.S. economy, which was around $29.7 trillion last year. 

Does that sound realistic for an asset that produces no revenue, no earnings, and has struggled to generate traction as a currency? For me, the answer is no.

Despite Wood's enthusiasm for the potential of ETFs, they have attracted less than $100 billion in inflows so far, which is a mere fraction of Bitcoin's current market cap. Granted, these securities have been available for only one year, but I don't see a catalyst on the horizon that would cause inflows to accelerate from here -- they seem to be slowing down instead.

A more realistic price target might be $942,800 per coin. At that level, Bitcoin's market cap would be $19.8 trillion, which matches the total value of all above-ground gold reserves right now.

I'm not suggesting this will happen, because I believe gold has more intrinsic value than a digital token thanks to its physical state and because it has been accepted as a store of value globally for thousands of years.

However, if Bitcoin does become universally accepted as the digital alternative to gold, that price target still presents investors with an incredible potential return of 1,020% from here.

Fox News host Lara Trump speaks with O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary and Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia about the future of cryptocurrency on ‘My View with Lara Trump.'

Mr. Wonderful is casting a glimmering light on the cryptocurrency industry, arguing it is entering a "new phase" under the Trump administration. 

"The reason they're not comfortable with it right now is they've watched the cowboy era of crypto, but all the crypto cowboys are in jail or out of business. So now we're in a new phase. There's a new tone with the government. Trump has put it forward," O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary said on "My View with Lara Trump" Saturday. 

"They're going to provide regulations to allow this to become integrated with the financial institutions of America. It's going to become a payment system, an investment vehicle. It's going to become part of all the sectors of our economy. We have 11 sectors. Eventually, I believe crypto will be the 12th."

TRUMP'S CRYPTO CZAR DECRIES GOVERNMENT'S LACK OF BITCOIN ‘LONG-TERM STRATEGY'

President Donald Trump made headlines on the campaign trail last year for embracing the crypto industry as a key issue for the 2024 election. 

During an address at the world's largest bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee in July, Trump vowed for the U.S. to become the "crypto capital of the planet" and a "bitcoin superpower of the world." 

The now-47th president has made good on many of his crypto promises since taking office in January. 

TRUMP CREATES STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE, OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BE USED IN STOCKPILE

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week, just a day before the first-of-its-kind crypto summit. 

"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump wrote.

"I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" he added.

Crypto czar David Sacks celebrated the move via a post on X. 

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," he wrote. "It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government's digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.'" 

"The big news is that this will be the first administration that's going to say this sector belongs in America. The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it. Other administrations didn't do that, and I think we should celebrate it because I think we shouldn't fall behind on this," O'Leary told Fox News host Lara Trump during his interview at Pubkey bitcoin bar in New York City. 

Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia also weighed in on the future of crypto under Trump, noting the leadership under President Biden was "atrocious."

"For four years, it was a very aggressive administration. I think the biggest win was just moving on from that and not getting stuck with another 4 or 8 years of that. It was very, very punitive. And there was no conversation. It wasn't something that you could go and talk about with the administration."

Trump's return to the Oval Office is a "massive seat change for the industry," Pacchia added.

Mice will lick the faces and pull at the tongues of other mice if they're found unconscious, with more vigorous grooming resulting in faster recovery.

Mice appear to administer first-aid if they find a fellow mouse unconscious, scientists have discovered.

They attempt to revive companions by licking at their faces, or even by pulling at their mouths or tongues, according to a study published Feb. 21 in the journal Science.

More aggressive mouth-pulling, biting and licking behaviors were seen in mice that had spent more time with the mouse in need of help, resulting in a faster recovery, the researchers report.

"The most striking discovery in this study is the existence of instinctive emergency responses in animals to revive unconscious — and even freshly deceased — partners. This study provides the first documented evidence of resuscitation-like behavior in naïve, untrained mice," study lead author Wenjian Sun, a researcher at the University of Southern California, told Live Science in an email.

Helping other animals that are injured or sick has been observed in a number of species, including dolphins, elephants, and non-human primates, Sun explained.

"These behaviors often include touching, grooming, nudging, and, in some cases, more intense physical actions such as striking. However, specific behaviors like tongue biting and tongue pulling, as observed in this study, have not been previously reported," Sun said.

In the paper, the researchers describe how dozens of mice reacted after being introduced to another mouse in a state of need. These states included the other mouse being stressed and unconscious.

Mice spent more time in physical contact with the other mouse if it was unconscious rather than awake, with the intensity of the grooming increasing over time if the other was unconscious. Mice spent an average of 47% of the 13-minute test interacting with an unconscious partner.

Grooming increased in vigor over the test period from sniffing and licking to biting at the other mouse's mouth and tongue, with more aggressive actions being seen in pairs of mice that were more familiar with one another. Over 50% of the mice ended up pulling at the tongues of their unconscious companion.

The mice were also able to detect that their companion was unconscious without relying on visual cues, initiating the grooming behaviors even in the dark.

The more intense grooming behaviors were correlated with better recovery in the unconscious mice, with a more rapid return to consciousness afterwards. When their companion awoke, the first-aider mouse stopped performing the grooming behaviors.

"The animal appears to be able to recognize the unconscious state of its partner, with the unresponsiveness triggering the behavior and regaining of responsiveness terminating the behavior," Sun said.

While these findings indicate that mice have an instinct to help others like humans do, the researchers can't be certain why they act in this way.

"We do not exclude the possibility that the animal is simply driven by instinctive impulses to perform these actions — an instinct that may have evolved over time during evolution — rather than acting with a conscious intent to revive its partner," Sun said.

In another paper, also published on Feb. 21 in Science, other researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles describe the neuronal mechanisms behind this behavior. They found that the grooming is likely driven by the release of oxytocin — a hormone that plays a crucial role in social bonding, sex, and childbirth — in areas of the brain called the amygdala and hypothalamus.

"Inactivation of oxytocin neurons or blocking oxytocin receptors impaired the behavior, confirming that oxytocin is essential for this emergency response. This aligns with the oxytocin's well-known role as the 'love hormone' which is associated with trust and affection in humans and promotes social bonding," Sun explained.

"Since oxytocin receptors are expressed in many brain regions, future research will focus on identifying the specific neural circuits involved in this behavior."

PHOENIX — The Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine (SWSIE), a multi-institutional tech group spearheaded by Arizona State University, announced Wednesday it has invested $1.5 million into eight startup companies in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.

SWSIE was launched in 2024 as one of the first 10 tech groups under the umbrella of National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Engines. It specifically received its own startup funding of $15 million to research and execute solutions for water scarcity and equitable energy access in extreme desert conditions.

The eight startup companies being doled out funding are being supported in the commercialization process of their “proven model or prototype,” according to a press release. Models or prototypes awarded funding deal with finding industry solutions for semiconductor manufacturing, solar power, mining, atmospheric water harvesting and other environmental issues.

SWSIE processed more than 220 grant applications from 16 states before ultimately narrowing down their selections.

“These startups emerged from a competitive selection process due to the promise of their technologies, which stand to advance new industries and future-proof existing ones,” SWSIE CEO Brian Sherman said in the release.

Sherman added SWSIE's funding is just beginning, as this will be the first of “many funding cycles” while the innovation group continues to grow itself.

A few solutions SWSIE is actively working on in the Valley are saving water needed for semiconductor manufacturing (it is estimated to use eight million gallons daily by 2030), expanding the capacity of silicon-based solar cells and recuperating carbon emissions into fuel and “other sustainable carbon products.”

In addition to receiving funding for prototypes, the eight startups will have the opportunity to introduce their businesses to investors at SWSIE's Innovation Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 21-22.

“The overwhelming response to this funding opportunity underscores the dire need for investment in technologies at this stage, as well as the broad interest in new solutions for critical resource management,” SWSIE chief innovation officer Katie Pettinger said in the release.

In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it can be a daunting task to keep up with all the important news. To make it easier for readers, we've put together the Weekly Tech Recap, where we take a look at the top news stories making waves in the tech world. This week, Google confirmed that its Google Assistant will soon be retiring, Samsung began rolling out the One UI 7 beta update, and more.



Google has officially confirmed that its classic Google Assistant will be retiring later this year, and Gemini will take up the mantle of default assistant app on Android. In a blog post about the big change, Google said that the classic Google Assisstant will no longer be available on most Android devices or for new downloads.

The company also confirmed that tablets, cars and other devices that connect to the phone, such as headphones and watches, will also be upgraded to Gemini. The tech giant also confirmed that it will be bringing Gemini to other home devices such as speakers, displays and TVs.

Samsung has begun rolling out the Android 15-based One UI 7.0 beta update for its Galaxy S23 series in select regions, including India, the United States, and South Korea. The update, which was previously restricted to the Galaxy S24 series, is now available for users of the Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23+, and Galaxy S23 Ultra who wish to test Samsung's latest custom interface ahead of its official release.

As per user reports on Samsung's community forums, the beta update is currently available only for unlocked models. In India, the Galaxy S23 is receiving the update with firmware version S918BXXU8ZYC3, while the Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 Ultra are receiving firmware versions S918BOXM8ZYC3 and S918BXXU8DYC3, respectively.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has introduced Copilot for Gaming, an AI assistant aimed at improving the gaming experience. Announcing the feature on social media platform X, Nadella said, “With Copilot for Gaming, you can jump back into games faster, get real-time coaching, and stay connected... all on your own terms.”

A promotional video posted by Nadella demonstrated the AI assisting a user in downloading Age of Empires IV using voice commands on a smartphone. The AI also provided guidance in Minecraft, suggesting the next move in a survival scenario and aiding in-game strategy.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has officially confirmed the company's plans to replace the iconic Alert Slider, a feature that has been synonymous with OnePlus smartphones for years. The decision, long speculated upon, has now been made public through a community post from Lau, who framed the change as an “evolution” rather than a removal. However, for many devoted OnePlus users, the news marks the end of an era.

For years, the Alert Slider has been a hallmark of OnePlus devices, allowing users to toggle between sound profiles – a feature particularly useful in meetings or quiet settings. Its removal is set to disappoint loyal OnePlus fans who appreciated the convenience it offered.

OpenAI is reportedly geared toward introducing several artificial agents soon. Various reports hint that the tech giant is working to roll out these AI agents on specialised domains.

A recent report from The Information hinted that OpenAI is working to launch three different AI chatbots. These AI chatbots are believed to offer specialised knowledge-based information on various domains. Citing sources, the publication suggested that these AI agents will be launched with monthly charges of up to $20,000 (approx  ₹17,40,800).

New Delhi: Nine miniature satellites designed and developed by Israeli high school students were launched into space, according to the Israel Space Agency (ISA).

Calling it "the largest Israeli satellite constellation built by students in nine municipalities," the ISA said on social media platform X that the satellites were launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base.  

According to SpaceX, the satellites were launched at 8.43 a.m. local time, Xinhua news agency reported.  

The satellites, including the first-ever Druze satellite developed by students from the Druze community, were deployed into an orbit about 500 km above Earth, where they will remain for about three years with the mission of measuring cosmic radiation and its effects on electronic components, the ISA said in a separate statement on its website.  

The development of the satellites was part of the Tevel 2 national project led by the ISA and Tel Aviv University, at a cost of 10.5 million shekels (about 2.88 million dollars), the statement said.  

The project aims to connect different Israeli communities and promote equal opportunities in science and technology education, the statement mentioned.  

The Innovation, Science, and Technology Ministry, in partnership with Tel Aviv University and nine local authorities, has launched the Tevel 2 project with a budget of NIS 10.5 million.  

This initiative involves setting up satellite communication stations, allowing students to track mission data and manage operations.  

"We are witnessing a winning combination of scientific excellence, technological education, and societal integration," Uri Oron, director of ISA said.  

He added that the Tevel 2 project is a testament to the power of Israeli innovation.  

"These satellites will not only provide crucial scientific data but also serve as an inspiration for the next generation of Israeli space scientists," Oron stated.  

Designed to operate for about three years, the project aims to inspire Israel's next generation of space engineers and scientists.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — After being gang-raped by armed men while collecting firewood, the 28-year-old tried in vain to get help. Some clinics were closed, others told her to return later and she had no money to access a hospital.

Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. “I felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,” she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.

Tenney

GENEVA — A group that calls itself Concerned Citizens of NY24 is hosting a forum Tuesday night on the impacts federal actions are having on healthcare.

And, they're hoping the region's congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will attend during a legislature recess scheduled for next week.

The forum will be held from 7-8:30 p.m. at the Smith Opera House, 82 Seneca St. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.

Other forums are planned, the group said.

“Hearing that public concerns of the constituents of New York's 24th Congressional District were not being heard, a group of citizens has come together to hold a series of public forums in order to give people a place to voice their concerns and ask questions with the hope that the congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will hear and represent the consensus,” said Scott Comegys, chair of the Wayne County Democratic Committee.

The Geneva forum will include Dr. Laurel Dallmeyer, a retired physician who worked in Geneva for many years, along with other retired and current healthcare industry professionals, including Anne Ruflin, Jennifer Scott, and Dr. Robert Scott.

Comegys said Tenney “has been invited to attend and participate, although at the time of this release (Friday morning) the representative has not responded to the invitation that was hand-delivered to their Canandaigua office.”

Tenney's office did not reply to a request for comment as of Friday morning's print deadline.

HBO's third season of “The White Lotus” is underway. A mostly new cast of guests flock to Thailand's Koh Samui to stay at the show's namesake luxury spa and wellness sanctuary. Here, spirituality and a possible whodunnit are served up to loyal fans of the beloved comedy-drama series. 

This season begins similarly to others, with plenty of intrigue, leaving behind a string of mysteries about who died and how. The show opened with gunshots and a dead body, this time floating face down in a lotus pond. 

As storylines are introduced, a surprising theme running throughout this season is the frequent mention of lorazepam, a prescription medication used to treat anxiety and certain types of insomnia.

Victoria Ratliff, played by Parker Posey, whose Southern drawl brings a distinctive ring to the word “lorazepam,” can't seem to get through the day without popping these anti-anxiety pills like candy, sometimes downing them with white wine at dinner.

Her overuse of the pills leaves her slurring her words, zoning out, and dozing off at the dinner table. At one point in episode 4 (which was released on March 9), Victoria's daughter Piper exclaims, “You don't have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”

In this episode, Victoria's husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. While attending a yacht party with their three children, he steals Victoria's prescription bottle from her bag, drinks a few glasses of what looks like whiskey and becomes incoherent.

If you're wondering about this drug and whether it's safe for anxiety, read on. We'll break down how the drug is meant to be used, the main risks, and other ways to manage your anxiety.

Lorazepam is the generic name for the prescription medication Ativan. It belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which also include: 

“Lorazepam is a commonly prescribed medication for anxiety. It's also used to treat panic attacks and can be used for insomnia,” said David Merrill, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

The drug works by slowing the activity in the brain, which promotes relaxation in the body and a reduction in anxious thoughts.

However, “the first-line treatment [for anxiety] is typically antidepressants like SSRIs [antidepressants], plus psychotherapy,” Merrill told Healthline.

“Something like cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction — where you get a better understanding of what's driving your anxieties and how to manage the anxiety when it comes up, versus just popping a pill like is done on a TV show.”

Victoria L. Leigh, DO, FACOI, an internal medicine specialist with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, CA, said in certain cases, benzodiazepines may be used first, such as with anxiety experienced by cancer patients and hospice or palliative care patients.

Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine.

One 2024 meta-analysis of previous studies found that benzodiazepines were more effective than SSRIs at reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety. Both drugs were similarly effective at reducing the psychological symptoms. 

However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder.

Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. These are a normal part of the body's stress response, said Merrill, not something that is dangerous or harmful.

“If you learn how to counteract those sensations when they come up, whether by taking a deep breath or taking a break from what you are doing, you can keep them from becoming a full-blown panic attack,” Merrill said.

Some people can manage their anxiety without medication, using therapy alone. However, “with more severe cases of anxiety, we see the best outcomes with a combination of meds and therapy, at least over the short-term,” Merrill noted. “Then sometimes people can taper off the medications when their anxiety is under better control.”

When used as prescribed, lorazepam can cause the following side effects:

More serious problems, such as life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma, can occur if lorazepam is used alongside opioid medications such as codeine, oxycodone, and tramadol. 

Drinking alcohol or using certain illegal drugs alongside lorazepam can also increase these risks.

“Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”

People who are using illegal drugs or other substances should not use lorazepam. People with a history of alcohol dependence or abuse should not use lorazepam unless recommended by their doctor.

“Because lorazepam is short-acting, its onset is faster, making addiction more likely,” Leigh told Healthline. In addition, “withdrawals from this medication are more abrupt than the longer-acting medications in this family.”

Once dependence occurs, “if lorazepam is stopped suddenly, withdrawal symptoms can lead to seizures, altered [thoughts], and can be fatal,” she said.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines can cause physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, even when taken as directed. 

The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend upon the dose you are taking, how long you've been taking the drug, other sedating drugs you are taking, and other factors.

Symptoms of withdrawal include:

Merrill said other signs of lorazepam dependence include:

If you are experiencing physical dependence or if you had withdrawal symptoms when you tried to stop taking lorazepam, ask your doctor about tapering your dose. Tapering means taking smaller doses over the course of a few or several weeks until you can safely stop the drug.

To find a psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in substance misuse issues, search the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) database or call SAMHSA's national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

Many non-medication options have been shown to help relieve anxiety symptoms. Some of these may include:

“Focusing on exercise can also help to balance the ‘fight or flight' nervous system response that drives anxiety-related feelings,” said Leigh. “Reduction in alcohol consumption and focusing on a balanced diet can also impact the ‘gut-brain axis' and can improve mental health as well.”

For Amanda Armstrong, founder of Rise As We and author of “Healing Through the Vagus Nerve,” the missing link to healing from anxiety is often the autonomic nervous system.

This part of the nervous system controls unconscious processes such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. It's also in charge of keeping us safe through the body's fight, flight, fawn and freeze responses.

“Understanding the role of the nervous system really shifts the paradigm from ‘I'm broken,' to seeing that your symptoms make sense when put into the context of basic biological needs, your past trauma history, and how that gets stored in your body,” said Armstrong, who is based near Washington, D.C.

When viewed through the lens of the nervous system, anxiety symptoms are a survival response, one that makes sense in the context of the human body and a person's current and past experiences.

Other factors can also contribute to anxiety, such as sleep deprivation, being overstressed or over-caffeinated, suffering from micronutrient deficiencies, or lacking connection to other people and community.

In her practice, Armstrong teaches clients two types of tools for managing their anxiety.

First are tools that people can use in the moment if they are feeling anxious or having a panic attack. This includes visual orienting (slowly looking around your space), biting into a lemon, and certain kinds of breathing.

These help people move up what Armstrong refers to as the autonomic nervous system ladder — away from the sympathetic activation response (also known as fight or flight mode) toward a state of calm and connection.

The other group of tools helps reduce people's anxiety symptoms long-term. Part of this proactive approach is helping people understand what might be contributing to their anxiety symptoms, including: 

Once clients have mapped out these factors, Armstrong asks: “What feels meaningful, and what feels accessible for you to take on right now?”

While Armstrong said there's a time and a place for the use of anti-anxiety medications, she empowers clients by educating them about how their bodies work and giving them tools to manage their anxiety.

This approach can also pave the way for deeper work with a therapist, whether it's talk therapy, shadow work, or somatic parts (aka inner child) work. If the nervous system is well regulated, therapy is often more productive.

Overall, “the approach I use gives you an entire new framework for understanding yourself, and navigating your world and your symptoms in a way that is not associated with brokenness,” Armstrong told Healthline. “There's also more space for compassion and curiosity.”

In Season 3 of the HBO series “The White Lotus,” some characters appear to pop lorazepam like candy. This prescription drug is used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia due to anxiety or situational stress.

Studies show that benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective for treating both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. However, antidepressant SSRIs are more commonly used first because they have a lower risk of severe side effects.

Lorazepam carries a risk of dependence and potential for misuse. This drug can also cause life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma when used alongside opioid pain relievers, alcohol, or certain illegal drugs.

For many, the Shriners are a bit of a mystery, known for their distinctive fezzes, parade appearances, and charitable work, but not always for the details of their organization. While some might joke about them being a "secret society," the reality is much simpler: the Shriners are a fraternal organization dedicated to fun, fellowship, and philanthropy, particularly through their support of children's healthcare.

The Shriners organization was founded in 1872 in New York City by a group of Freemasons who wanted to create a fraternity with a focus on both camaraderie and charitable work. Over the years, the group has attracted notable members, including Presidents Gerald Ford and Harry Truman, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, General Douglas MacArthur, and even cultural icons like John Wayne and J. Edgar Hoover.

The Shriners' commitment to philanthropy led to the establishment of Shriners Hospitals for Children, a network of 22 hospitals across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These hospitals specialize in treating children with orthopedic conditions, burns, cleft lip and palate, and other disabilities. Until 2012, all care was provided entirely free of charge. Today, while insurance is billed when available, any costs not covered are absorbed by the hospital—ensuring that families never have to pay out of pocket for necessary medical care.

Bulloch County has its own Shriners group, the Statesboro Shrine Club, which was rechartered in May 2016. Though still a relatively young club, its members are working to grow their presence in the community and increase awareness of their mission. The club specifically supports the Shriners Children's Hospital in Greenville, South Carolina, which provides life-changing treatment for children in need.

To raise funds, the club engages in a variety of community events. A key initiative is their paper sale, where members stand on street corners handing out papers in exchange for donations, with 100% of proceeds going directly to the children's hospital. While the exact date for this year's sale is still being determined, they are aiming for April or May to avoid extreme summer heat.

The club also participates in local parades, where their brightly decorated vehicles and enthusiastic members bring smiles to children and adults alike. Beyond just entertainment, these appearances help build awareness of the Shriners' mission. One of their biggest annual events in Bulloch County is their boiled peanut sale at the fair, which has grown significantly in the past two years. The club also takes part in community activities like Trunk-or-Treat events, strengthening their ties to local families.

Despite their rich history and ongoing charitable work, the Shriners are still working to establish a stronger presence in Statesboro and Bulloch County. While cities like Vidalia have long-standing and well-known Shriners groups, the Statesboro Shrine Club is still growing its local reputation.

One unique approach they take is holding their meetings at different local restaurants each month. This not only helps the club engage with the community but also supports small businesses in Bulloch County. Eventually, the club hopes to raise enough money to purchase its own meeting space, but for now, it remains focused on outreach and engagement.

One key requirement for joining the Shriners is that members must first be Freemasons. While Masonic membership may seem mysterious to outsiders, the process is relatively simple: you have to ask to join. Those interested in becoming a Mason, and, by extension, a Shriner, can reach out to a local Mason or Shriner for more information on the process.

Beyond membership, community members can support the Shriners' mission by attending their events, donating to their fundraisers, or simply spreading the word about their work.

The Statesboro Shrine Club is actively looking for ways to expand its reach, increase participation, and deepen its impact on the community. For those interested in supporting their efforts, keeping up with local events, and learning more, Grice Connect's events calendar is a great resource for staying informed about upcoming fundraisers and activities.

Additionally, the club is seeking photos from past events to help showcase their work. If you've attended a parade or fair and have pictures of the Shriners in action, they would love to see them!

With 200,000 members worldwide and a network of hospitals providing life-changing medical care, the Shriners' impact is undeniable. And as the Statesboro Shrine Club continues to grow, so too does its ability to make a difference right here in Bulloch County.

Franciscan is building a new cancer center at the campus of its new Crown Point hospital at I-65 and 231.

The new Franciscan Health Crown Point opened in 2024.

Franciscan Alliance is set to recognize our 150th anniversary at the end of this year.

Many things have changed in healthcare during that century and a half and we have adapted to meet the changing needs of our communities with state-of-the-art innovations throughout. What hasn't changed is our Catholic nonprofit healthcare ministry's fidelity to our mission of continuing Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition.

Last year, Franciscan Alliance set into motion multiple projects that support our regional approach to healthcare, optimizing facilities and resources with state-of-the-art services to improve the level of care for all of Northwest Indiana.

The year began with the opening of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point at the corner of U.S. 231 and Interstate 65, which replaced the 50-year-old Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital on Main Street.

This facility was constructed to support the highest acuity of patients in a convenient location and designed to keep patient care and safety at the center while enveloping employees, patients and families in our Catholic traditions.

The hospital includes 207 inpatient beds with room to expand to 300, as well as an attached medical office building and expandable diagnostic and treatment centers. It includes a hybrid operating room with the latest technology to care for cardiac patients, enhanced patient safety and convenience and private rooms in the neonatal intensive care unit, which is staffed by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago neonatologists.

In July, Franciscan Health Crown Point and Lurie announced their expanded partnership with the addition of a Lurie Children's pediatric hospitalist to serve young patients admitted to the pediatric unit. The partnership allows for board-certified/board-eligible Lurie pediatricians to provide daily management of pediatric inpatients, in-house care 24/7 in the pediatric inpatient unit, coordination of care with the child's pediatrician, management of care for newborns and pediatric consultations in the emergency department.

In the past, when children would require hospitalization, they would often be transferred by ambulance to hospitals hours from home, creating added stress for families during an already challenging time. This collaboration helps to ensure children and adolescents from across Northwest Indiana receive exceptional, comprehensive care close to home.

Franciscan Health Crown Point saw the groundbreaking in September of The Dean and Barbara White Cancer Center, which is slated to open in early 2027. This project was made possible in part by a $30 million donation from The Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation in November 2023, the largest gift ever received by the Franciscan Health Foundation, the fundraising support arm of our nonprofit healthcare ministry.

The 71,000-square-foot, three-story cancer center is being constructed by Tonn and Blank Construction on the campus of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital. This state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment center will consolidate existing Franciscan Health Crown Point cancer care services into one convenient location.





Providing kind, considerate and well-connected care throughout a family's journey through oncology treatment and recovery is our mission, and we are pleased to have such an aligned partner in the White family.

Franciscan Health Michigan City saw a groundbreaking in October for a new medical office building in Valparaiso. The two-story, 82,881-square-foot building is being built by Tonn and Blank Construction at the southeast corner of State Roads 2 and 49. It will house an ExpressCare, primary care and specialty physician offices, diagnostic imaging, CT, MRI, ultrasound and laboratory services.

We are excited to be significantly expanding our presence in Valparaiso with this project. The new building is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

In early November, Franciscan Health also broke ground on a new medical office building in St. John. The building mirrors the Valparaiso building in design and services and is also being built by Tonn and Blank Construction, at 10323 Wicker Ave. This building is also scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

Also in November, we announced that Franciscan Health Dyer will transition in late 2027 to a campus dedicated to treating behavioral health patients, a move designed to meet the growing need for behavioral health treatment while supporting Franciscan Alliance's regional approach to healthcare.

The transformation into a behavioral health campus will allow for the expansion of the current 92-bed inpatient behavioral health unit and the addition of behavioral health services. The existing Dyer emergency room will be transformed as well, with the space being used to house a new high acuity Franciscan ExpressCare for patients seeking medical care and the addition of an emergency intake department specifically dedicated to behavioral health. Patients seeking emergency room care may seek treatment at Franciscan Health Munster, just 2 miles away.

Inpatient, emergency and surgical services will move from Dyer to the expanded Munster campus in late 2027. Inpatient rehabilitation will also move from Dyer to a new rehabilitation facility on the Munster campus around the same time.

The expansion of the Munster campus is already underway and includes a three-story addition to an existing three-story medical structure and the construction of a new five-story medical structure.

Franciscan also offers a multitude of Community Health Improvement programs designed with input from community health surveys. From a variety of food insecurity programs to diaper pantries, the Prenatal Assistance Program, free health-related classes and much more, our Community Health Improvement programs further support our values of compassionate concern and Christian stewardship.

Backing these and many other initiatives is the Franciscan Health Foundation, which exists to support our mission. From cancer and cardiac care to community education, family health programs, women and children's services, educational scholarships and more, the Foundation supports Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition by caring for our neighbors with compassion and the love they need during their most trying times.

As we prepare to look back on 150 years of service, we are proud to look toward the future with hope for a more resilient, healthier Region, with the needs of our neighbors being met at locations closer to their homes than ever before.

Dean Mazzoni is the president and CEO of Franciscan Health Dyer, Michigan City and Munster. Daniel McCormick, MD, is president and CEO of Franciscan Health Crown Point. The opinions are the writers'.

Don't miss the showpiece finals as Sabalenka plays Andreeva and Draper takes on Rune

After two weeks of intense action, we're down to the final four players. In the women's final, world number one Aryna Sabalenka takes on teen sensation Mirra Andreeva before British ace Jack Draper faces a resurgent Holger Rune in the men's final.

Read on and we'll show you how to watch the 2025 Indian Wells men's and women's finals from anywhere with a VPN.

► Date: Today (March 16)► Start time: 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT / 6 p.m. GMT / 5 a.m. AEDT• U.S. — Tennis Channel via Sling or Fubo• UK — Sky Sports• AUS — beIN Sports (7-day trial)• Watch anywhere — Try NordVPN 100% risk free

Russian ace Andreeva is currently the form player on the WTA Tour and now has the chance to win her second straight tournament. The 17-year-old became the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai last month and reached the final with a stunning 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 win over second seed Iga Swiatek in the last four.

Andreeva will now play top seed Sabelanka in the final after the Belarusian avenged her Australian Open final defeat by Madison Keys with a brutal 6-0, 6-1 victory. The two have met on five occasions, with Sabalenka boasting a 4-1 record against the teenager.

In the men's final, Draper will play in the biggest match of his career after stunning defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals. The 23-year-old secured a 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 win over the Spaniard and will now be inside the world's top 10 for the first time.

Standing in the Brit's way is Rune who reached the fourth Masters final of his career with a comfortable 7-5, 6-4 victory over Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev. The Dane has only played Draper once before, securing a straight set victory last year in Cincinnati.

You won't want to miss any of the action so read on for all of the TV and streaming details and how you can watch the Indian Wells men's and women's finals from anywhere.

Away from home at the moment and blocked from watching the tennis on your usual subscription?

You can still watch Indian Wells live thanks to the wonders of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The software allows your devices to appear to be back in your home country regardless of where in the world you are. So ideal for sports fans away on vacation or on business. Our favorite is NordVPN. It's the best on the market:

There's a good reason you've heard of NordVPN. We specialize in testing and reviewing VPN services and NordVPN is the one we rate best. It's outstanding at unblocking streaming services, it's fast and it has top-level security features too. With over 7,000 servers, across 110+ countries, and at a great price, it's easy to recommend.

Get 70% off NordVPN with this deal

Using a VPN is incredibly simple.

1. Install the VPN of your choice. As we've said, NordVPN is our favorite.

2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance, if you're in the U.K. and want to view an Australian service, you'd select Australia from the list.

3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to beIN sports or another service and watch Indian Wells.



Tennis fans in the U.S. will need the Tennis Channel to watch the 2025 Indian Wells men's and women's finals.

The Tennis Channel is available through most cable packages as well as some of the best cable TV alternatives, including Sling TV, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream. Of these options, we recommend Sling and Fubo.

If you're not already a Sling TV subscriber, you'll want Sling Orange to watch the Tennis Channel. It costs from $45.99/month and includes dozens of other great channels. New users get a 50% discount on their first month, too.



Sky Sports will be showing all the action from Indian Wells in the UK, including the men's and women's finals, so if you already have a Sky subscription that doesn't include Sports, you'll need to pay £18/month to add those channels. The game will be shown on Sky Sports Tennis.

Whichever package you go for, you'll also gain access to coverage in 4K and HDR, so long as you also have an HDR-ready Sky Q box and HLG-compatible TV.

Sky Glass is another option. This gives you Sky TV within a 4K TV that has a built-in Dolby Atmos soundbar, and without the need for a dish. Prices start at £13/month for the TV, plus a sky sub on top of that.

If you don't want to shell out for a full Sky subscription, you could also consider its Now Sports streaming service. This gives you 24-hour access for £11.99 or month-long access for £34.99.

All sounds great, right? But if you're not in the UK, you can still follow the 2025 Indian Wells tournament live stream by using one of the best VPN services, such as NordVPN.



Tennis fans in Australia can watch every Indian Wells match, including the men's and women's finals, on beIN Sports.

To access beIN sports you will have to pay $14.99 a month or $149.99 a year. Both options include a 7-day free trial. You can also use the beIN Sports Connect app to stream the BNP Paribas Open 2025.

Traveling outside Oz? Don't worry — you can watch via a VPN instead. Our favorite VPN service right now is NordVPN, but you'll find others in our best VPN services list.

We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service). 2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad. We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services.

The Hurricanes (6-5, 2-1) showed Notre Dame (12-3, 2-2) their fight on Friday as Miami Women's Tennis shut them out (4,0) at the Neil Schiff Tennis Center.

Junior doubles partners Raquel Gonzalez and Xinyi Nong kicked off the battle against Notre Dame with a 6-4 win over Notre Dame's Carrie Beckman and Maria Olivia Castedo.

Miami took home the doubles point after Alexa Noel and Maria Paula Vargas won a 6-4 matchup with Bianca Molnar and Akari Matsuno.

Following the doubles, Alexa Noel continued her successes for the day in singles play with an easy 6-0, 6-3 win over Akari Matsuno, and Hurricanes Jaquelyn Ogunwale and Aely Arai finished off the day with singles wins of their own. 

This win comes as the team's first top-25 win of the season, and Miami looks to continue its success as it faces Louisville on Sunday.

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year.

							By 

	Lev Akabas


Data Reporter


	A number of sports leagues face the same issue: Modern playing styles that put increased physical demands on athletes' bodies are contributing to an increase in injuries.


	The average NBA star player in the 2020s misses more than a quarter of each season, nearly twice the number of missed games as the 2000s, when there were roughly 10 fewer possessions per game than today's “pace and space” era. Nearly 40% of all MLB pitchers who played in 2024 have undergone Tommy John surgery (UCL reconstruction), up from 27% in 2016, as throwing velocities and spin rates have increased.

	











	Tennis might be next.




	There have been 37 instances on the 2025 ATP Tour of a player retiring during a match or withdrawing mid-tournament prior to a match, accounting for about 6% of all matchups. That equals the highest number at this point in the tennis calendar over the past 20 years and 50% higher than the annual average of 23.8.


Novak Djokovic retired from his Australian Open semifinal versus Alexander Zverev with a muscle tear after one set and was met with boos from the crowd. Earlier in January, Reilly Opelka had to call it quits in the Brisbane International final after just 13 minutes of play. 


	The injury bug has not made its way to the WTA Tour, which has seen only 23 retirements or walkovers through the 2025 Indian Wells Open, just a tad higher than the 20.6 average from the past decade.


	Interestingly, this outlier year in men's tennis follows what had appeared to be a decrease in injuries. On average, there were slightly fewer retirements and walkovers in the early portion of the season between 2015 and 2024 than there had been between 2005 and 2014.


	This year's heightened total, therefore, could simply be a fluke. The sample sizes are small. Additionally, a stomach illness forced the withdrawals of multiple players from the Mexican Open in February.


	There are several concerning trends, however, when it comes to player health. The first is that they are simply spending more time on court. An analysis of ATP data by The Athletic in 2023 showed that men's Grand Slam matches are 23% longer than they were in 1999. Data from the WTA only goes back to 2008, but demonstrated a 5% increase during that time.

	











	Changes in racket technology have led to improvements in groundstroke velocity and topspin, meaning there are more grueling rallies from the baseline and fewer serve-and-volley points than there were 20 years ago. Players are also faster than in previous eras, allowing them to extend points with their defense and keep balls in play. All in all, points have gotten longer and require more physical exertion.


	A study by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) concluded that longer points increase the risk of injury. “The metric of minutes per point is notably significant,” the report said, “with injured players experiencing longer points per minute compared to the average player.”


	Then there are the balls. Many players across both tours have been outspoken about the quality of the tennis balls, which vary from tournament to tournament. The consensus seems to be that the newer balls are less aerodynamic and slower, requiring more power to drive them through the court, which again adds to players' physical toll.


	“Every week, practically every week, we have different balls,” No. 3 ranked Carlos Alcaraz said at a press conference in February. “I think last year there were many injuries, many players with elbow or shoulder issues. Something needs to change. I know they will change it.”


	Modern players are playing longer matches and engaging in a more demanding style of play, but they are not playing fewer matches. In fact, the average number of tournaments played by the top 100 ATP players in 2024 (25.12) was almost exactly the same as it was in 1999 (25.10).


	The early injury trend in 2025 is a concern for professional tennis given that physical ailments tend to increase as the year goes on. For instance, since 2009, there have been 50% more retirements or walkovers in the men's draw of the U.S. Open, the final major of the year, than in the Australian Open, which takes place eight months earlier in January.


	And while Sportico's analysis is limited to the first few months of the tennis calendar, a study published in the European Journal of Sport Science corroborates the overarching finding, stating that “an increasing trend in match retirements has been observed in both Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) events, especially in recent years, indicating a growing issue in professional tennis.”

	











	Tennis already has an unusually long season and short offseason when compared to other sports. Recently, the WTA has increased the number of mandatory tournaments on the calendar, while the ATP has also lengthened several Masters 1000 events to two weeks and provided a financial incentive for competing in more tournaments by way of a bonus pool.


	“Most sports have four months off, sometimes even six,” No. 2 ranked Iga Świątek said at a press conference last August. “Our schedule is crazy, and it's getting more crazy every year, which is scary.”


	Compounding the problem is the emergence of numerous high-profile exhibition tournaments throughout the year. Alcaraz, who voluntarily participated in The Netflix Slam, the 6 Kings Slam and The Garden Cup exhibitions last year, told the BBC in September that the sport's condensed schedule is “going to kill us in some way.”


	Indeed, the aforementioned PTPA report writes that “it is imperative to consider strategic adjustments to their playing schedules” and that “reducing the number of matches and extending the intervals between tournaments could prove beneficial.”


	Neither the ATP nor WTA provided comments for this story.


	Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the ATP Tour, suggested last fall that top players could choose to play fewer exhibition and lower-level events if they feel overtaxed, and that the eight required Masters 1000 tournaments per year is “not a lot.”


	For now, the expansion of the calendar continues unabated, as the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Open will grow to 12-day events in 2025. But discussion surrounding the physical demands of the schedule has already begun, and a sustained uptick in injuries will only accelerate those talks.

Indian Wells

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Conchita Martinez, one of the queen bees of tennis, had done just about everything there was to do in the sport.

She had won Wimbledon. She had coached Garbine Muguruza to win Wimbledon. She had won five Federation Cup titles as part of Spain's women's national team, going on to captain the team and then to run the entire tournament, by which time it was known as the Billie Jean King Cup. She found time to captain the men's national team in the Davis Cup, too.

But last spring, a new type of opportunity arrived: molding a teenager with the chance to be a generational talent. Did she want to coach Mirra Andreeva, the Russian already making waves on the WTA Tour at 16?

Muguruza was in her early twenties when Martinez helped guide her to the Wimbledon title in 2017. There's only so much a coach can do at that point. Coaching a teenager is a chance to help define their tennis for the better, perhaps forever. It's also coaching a teenager … yikes!

Not really. A year later, Andreeva, 17, is the toast of tennis. She is the ascendant player on the WTA Tour, on a 10-match winning streak that brought her a debut WTA 1,000 title in Dubai, UAE, and took her into the top 10 of the rankings for the first time. Coco Gauff did not win one of those titles, one rung below a Grand Slam, until she was 19.

She has beaten all comers in that streak: Iga Swiatek, the world No. 2 and the dominant player in the sport the past three years, was demolished in Dubai. Andreeva beat Elena Rybakina there too, and when she played the 2022 Wimbledon champion again at Indian Wells on Tuesday night, it wasn't even competitive. Andreeva produced a 6-1, 6-2 masterclass.

Thursday afternoon brought tighter competition against Elina Svitolina, a former world No. 2, but the same result: 7-5, 6-3 to the young Russian. Andreeva didn't just win. She confused and beguiled an opponent 13 years her senior, moving Svitolina around the court, interspersing drop shots with power and angles in a way that teenagers rarely do. They are supposed to be one- or two-dimensional in their first years, and then develop an arsenal.

And then came Friday, a rematch with an extra-motivated Swiatek, still smarting from the loss last month in Dubai and trying to win a tournament for the first time since the French Open last year. She blasted her way into their semifinal with her usual brutal efficiency. Surely this was too tall a task for Andreeva, especially as she kept slipping behind in her service games, setting up moment after moment when Swiatek's opponents so often crumble.

Andreeva did the opposite of that, in a flurry of those flat, cross-court and down-the-line backhands that Swiatek couldn't touch. Or she hung in rallies until Swiatek's impatience got the better of her and the former world No. 1 sent forehands wide and backhands into the net. Swiatek had inroads in nearly all of Andreeva's service games, but she rarely took them to break points. Soon, she was swatting balls in anger and snapping at her coaches. Andreeva, cool and collected and courageous when it counted most, was marching into the final, having won fewer points and been under more pressure.

“I don't know why I felt so much confidence,' Andreeva said in her post-match news conference.

That may have something to do with the 52-year-old Spanish woman sitting in Andreeva's box, often with a resting grin-face as she watches her latest charge. Andreeva said Wednesday that she was always smaller than her competition growing up — at 5ft 9in (175cm), she isn't anymore — and that forced her to find ways to win without overwhelming power. She learned to use her legs, to counterpunch and to spin the ball in all directions. Those attributes propelled her during her breakout tournaments, the 2023 Madrid Open and the 2024 Australian Open, where she put top players to the sword and puzzled lost positions into winning ones.

Martinez, Andreeva said, has taken those skills to a different, more aggressive level. Now she uses her tricks on offense as well as defense.

“Conchita is helping me to not be defensive all the time, when I have a chance to step in and try to be aggressive and to go for my shots,” she said in her news conference after beating Svitolina. “It's working pretty good.”

It is. In 2025, Andreeva is winning a lower proportion of return points than she did in 2024, according to data collated by Tennis Abstract. She's making fewer of her first serves. But she is winning a higher proportion of points behind those serves — 69 percent vs. 64 — and her dominance ratio, which divides the percentage of return points won by the percentage of serve points lost, has increased from 1.14 to 1.22 despite her drop-off on return. She is dictating more than she is being dictated to.

Beyond the results, Martinez has evolved into an Obi-Wan Kenobi to Andreeva's Luke Skywalker, but only sort of. Skywalker never really tried to prank Kenobi as Andreeva often does Martinez, including Wednesday afternoon, when her coach was attempting to have a quasi-serious conversation with a journalist.

Cue the goofy faces and poses about 15 feet behind said journalist, attempting to mess with Martinez's game face. Mission accomplished. Then off went a giggling Andreeva, simultaneously embarrassed and thrilled to have one of the legends of the sport kvelling about her.

Oh, to be 17 and have it all happening for you, in ways that sometimes even Andreeva does not understand.

“I don't know why people are supporting me this much because honestly, when I was playing in U.S., my results were not great,” she said in her post-match news conference after easing past Rybakina. Andreeva lost in the first round in her only previous appearance here last year and lost in the second round in her two U.S. Open appearances.

“People are so energetic,” she said. “It kind of lights me up.”

Once that happens, watch out. Here comes a drop shot on an angle, followed by a whistling topspin lob. Or another searing, flat backhand diving onto the knot of the singles sideline and shooting off the court. Or, and perhaps most often, there's her forehand squash-shot slice, which converts a position of stress into one of control.

In Andreeva, Martinez has found a near perfect muse, a player who aspires to play with the creativity that Martinez had, with her own style of quiet determination and passion. Andreeva barely had a slice a year ago. Now, she can use it for defensive or offensive shots. Martinez wants her to develop a heavier forehand with more spin to make it more difficult for an opponent to get the ball back. She's working with her to play around with different trajectories, “instead of just hitting flat from nowhere.”

She wants her to have choices and is trying to teach her how to make the good ones.

“She's not making a lot of stupid decisions on the court,” Martinez said. “It's about having the good choices, waiting for the right ball, to compete against any player.”

Coach-player relationships can be overrated in tennis, a sport where there are few chances for a real tactical discussion and no timeouts. Plenty of players run through coaches like toilet paper, jettisoning them at the first patch of poor results.

There are some relationships, though, that evolve into so much more than discussions about forehands and backhands, serves and returns. Carlos Alcaraz has one of those with Juan Carlos Ferrero, Martinez's compatriot and a former world No. 1. Ferrero has guided Alcaraz for seven years, since he was 14.

Andreeva and Martinez have some way to go to catch up with them, but they are off to a good start. They are living similar versions of the same life in different eras. Martinez was just 16 when she made the fourth round of the French Open, in her third professional tournament. The next year, she reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros and finished the year as the world No. 7. She and her compatriot, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, captured the imagination of the sport, a creative and passionate yin to the brutalist, machine-like yang of Steffi Graf.

Martinez knows what it's like to be on the verge of the world discovering you, and then to make that leap from tennis being an exercise in what is fresh and fearless to a world of expectation. First, they ask, “How did you do that?” Then it becomes: “Why didn't you do that?”

“Tennis forces you to grow up quickly but she maintains that playfulness in there, she likes to joke around,” she said. “I am very much like that too. I like to joke around. I like to bother her. She likes to bother me.”

Andreeva is a student of the game's history. She passes evenings in bed watching old tennis matches on YouTube. She knew all about Conchita Martinez. During her first months on the tour, though, she didn't realize that Martinez was the woman who kept smiling and nodding to her at various tournaments.

When she finally did, she couldn't believe that Martinez knew who she was, or that she would take the time to be cordial to her. Then, after she split with her coach and Muguruza retired, Andreeva's management team floated Martinez as a potential match.

Andreeva knew the resume. Wimbledon champion, coach of a Wimbledon champion. Good enough for her.

They had several talks to feel each other out, which was more Martinez taking the measure of this teenage girl born in Siberia, raised in Sochi, Russia, and who moved to the south of France to traipse the tennis world. She needed to make sure that Andreeva was ready to be serious, that she was hiring a coach and not a babysitter.

She quickly realized that Andreeva is mature beyond her years. She eats right, she rests, she listens to adults older and smarter than she is. She could look someone in the eye and have a serious conversation in three languages, soon to be a fourth as she picks up Spanish.

“She's a sponge,” Martinez said.

They tried a tournament together and Andreeva said she immediately felt comfortable with Martinez. “Super great,” is how she described their chemistry.

“She told me that it was the same for her, so thank God it's not just me,” she said the other day in a news conference, with her trademark grin and twinkle in her eyes. “I completely trust her with everything. I think she knows everything that's going on in my life. I don't know if it's good or bad, but, no, it's just like this.”

When they first started, Martinez worried that Andreeva might not be enough of a teenager, rather than too much of one. On the practice courts in France or in Barcelona, where Martinez lives, Andreeva would hit 10 great shots in a row, miss on the 11th and drama would ensue.

Martinez told her to give herself a break, maybe focus on the 10 good ones instead of the last miss. And when she hit a great shot, she needed to learn to acknowledge it, to enjoy it and be proud of what she has accomplished.

“I always tell her, ‘Wow, amazing',” she said. “You need to have fun with those things. Amazing drop shots, amazing angle. Wow, great, don't take it for granted. Enjoy that.”

There has been plenty to enjoy lately. Andreeva's ranking was hovering around 40 when Martinez came on the scene. She finished last year making the final of the Ningbo Open in China, where she lost against Daria Kasatkina from a winning position and broke down in tears at the trophy ceremony. Then she made the fourth round of the Australian Open, went 1-1 in Qatar and 6-0 in Dubai. Until very recently, she was the only teenager in the WTA top 100.

While the tennis world had long expected Andreeva's ascendancy, the steepness and immediacy of this year's trajectory has been a surprise. Not for Martinez. She couldn't make much of an impact last year, because she started with Andreeva in the middle of the season, but the off-season let the Russian get the full Martinez treatment. They combined fitness and weight training with their goals to achieve a certain style of play.

Now comes the task of maintaining the work ethic that has lifted Andreeva to her lofty heights so quickly. People think getting to the top 10 is the hard part. It isn't, Martinez said.

“It's not getting there, it's staying there — year after year, dealing with the pressure of defending those points and staying in a good frame of mind. And doing it all over and all over again,“ Martinez said.

She has shown few signs of doing anything else. Even after she got steamrollered in the second set against Swiatek, she told herself to run and fight for every point, to not worry how she got balls back but to get them back, however she could. When it was over, and Andreeva was 7-6(1), 1-6, 6-3 winner, Andreeva gave a nod to Martinez, a two-time finalist at Indian Wells, and a little ribbing, too.

“My coach lost in the finals,”  she said. “I'm going to try to do better than her.”

Nothing would please Martinez more.

Pakistan won the bronze medal at the International Tennis Federation Masters 45+ World Championship after defeating Germany 2-1 on Sunday, according to a statement by the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF).

A total of 21 nations participated in the men's team event that was held in Manavgat, Turkiye in the 45+ age category known as the Dubler Cup.

Pakistan had dominated the group stage with emphatic 3-0 victories over Romania and the host nation, according to the PTF.

“Pakistan's tennis team made history by securing a bronze medal at the ITF Masters 45+ World Championship in Manavgat, Turkey.

“Competing for the first time in this prestigious event, the team, led by captain Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and featuring Aqeel Khan and Shehryar Salamat, delivered an outstanding performance against some of the world's top tennis nations.” the statement said.

In the quarterfinals, the team overcame Czech Republic 2-1 to secure a place in the final four, the statement added.

“In a hard-fought semifinal battle against France, Pakistan fell just short, losing 2-1, despite an epic singles victory by Aqeel Khan. The doubles match proved decisive, where France edged out Pakistan,” it continued.

Team Pakistan then rebounded in the third-place match, defeating Germany 2-1 to clinch the bronze medal. In this crucial encounter, Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi had retired in his singles match whereas, Aqeel Khan had secured a commanding singles win, the statement continued.

Consequently, Qureshi and Khan teamed up to win the decisive doubles match against Germany. Pakistan players will now compete in individual events in the second week of the championship, the statement concluded.

Earlier in the week, Pakistan's senior tennis player Talha Waheed aced his way to a world record, smashing the mark for most tennis serves in a minute, Guinness World Records had said.

Waheed destroyed American John Perry's 2019 record of 42 by delivering 59 successful serves in a November attempt that was ratified this week.

Earlier this month, Pakistan defeated Iran 2-1 to secure the bronze medal at the BNP Paribas World Team Cup Wheelchair Tennis Asian Qualification Event.

The doubles decider saw Asif and Fida edge past the Iranian pair 6-4, 6-4 to clinch the medal.

Pakistan won the Davis Cup Juniors 2025 tournament after defeating Indonesia 2-1 in the final, according to a statement by the PTF on Saturday.

“With this historic win, Pakistan remained unbeaten throughout the championship, showcasing exceptional talent, determination, and teamwork,” the statement said.

After this victory, Pakistan have now qualified for the ITF Asia/Oceania Davis Cup Juniors Qualifying Event, scheduled to be held in Kazakhstan from May 19-24, the PTF said.

This competition will feature the top 16 teams from Asia and Oceania, competing for a place in the World Group, it added.

Pakistan team captain Shahzad Khan was quoted as having said, “I am extremely happy with the way the boys played from start to finish. Their dedication and hard work paid off, and I am incredibly proud of all the players.”

PTF President Aisamul Haq Qureshi also congratulated the team on their historic achievement, calling it a moment of immense pride for Pakistan, the statement added.

He commended the players, Mikaeel Ali Baig, Abubakar Talha, and Hamza Roman as well as Captain Shahzad Khan for their dedication and commitment, the statement continued.

Qureshi highlighted the remarkable progress made in international competitions, noting that while the team finished 16th out of 16 in 2023, and 5th out of 16 in 2024, it had won the championship this year indicating that the country's tennis was on the right path.

Jack Draper will make his Top 10 debut next week, rising to No. 8.

Holger Rune is bidding for his second Masters 1000 title. 

Both Rune and Draper have earned two Top 10 wins to reach the final. 

Two immensely talented players have come of age on the big stage at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden over the last ten days. Now, they'll go head-to-head in the final, as Rune and Draper will contest Sunday's men's singles final after pulling major upsets on semifinal Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open. 

Rune claimed his only previous meeting with Draper, a quarterfinal tilt at last year's Cincinnati Open, 6-4, 6-2, and the 13th-ranked Dane, who won his lone Masters title in 2022 in Paris, comes into Sunday's final carrying full confidence in his game. 

He's not gripping and ripping – Rune is playing a sustainable brand of tennis that can cause problems for anyone, anytime. 

“I feel like I can play like this day in and day out,” he said on Saturday after toppling two-time finalist Daniil Medvedev, 7-5, 6-4. “I'm not closing my eyes and hitting the lines on every shot like you can maybe do once per year. I feel like I'm definitely building the points, mixing up the tempo, grinding, finding solutions when they're tough. 

“I really try to focus on what I can control, and I try to find a way to win really.” 

Rune has upset No. 8-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas and No. 5-seeded Medvedev en route to his fourth career Masters final, but he has also rallied from a set down against France's Ugo Humbert and Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor. 

That type of grit has the Dane believing that he's evolved considerably, as a player and a competitor. 

“I don't believe I have become a worse player the last two years,” he said. “I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.”

Draper can say the same thing about himself. The Brit played the match of his life on Saturday, dethroning defending two-time champion Carlos Alcaraz with an inspired effort that put all his firepower and problem-solving skills on display. At times the 23-year-old's game was too hot to handle, even for a four-time major champion that has owned this court for the last three years.

Next he'll seek to put the cherry on top of a run that has already assured him of a Top 10 debut in Monday's ATP rankings. He knows he'll have to come down from an extremely emotional victory to finish the deal.

“To come through the match today, that means so much to me, especially against a player of Carlos' caliber,” Draper said after upsetting Alcaraz 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 in Saturday's second men's semifinal. 

“I'm looking forward to tomorrow already. That's the thing with tennis. You've got to get over wins like today, and all my focus and energy is on making sure that I do all the right things to give myself the best chance to win the tournament tomorrow.”

The Dane is into his first Masters 1000 final since 2023.ByDavid KanePublished Mar 15, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 15, 2025

Before the start of 2025 members of our very own TENNIS.com panel asked if 2025 could be a make-or-break season for Holger Rune, a player with obvious potential but one who was falling behind Slam-winning peers like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.As of Indian Wells, the former world No. 4 looks to be back on track with a first Masters 1000 final since 2023, defeating Daniil Medvedev, 7-5, 6-4 at the BNP Paribas Open to snap a seven-match losing streak in tour semifinals."It means everything," Rune said after the match. "The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing, for sure. Playing Daniil is, I think, for me, one of the toughest challenges on tour. We know each other well and we've practiced a lot, so it was super difficult. I obviously had the right tactic but he still made it so difficult because he's putting in great effort and great shots, just being super solid. I'm very proud of myself."The No. 12 seed fell as low as No. 17 in the ATP rankings last year after struggling to back up a breakthrough 18 months that featured a 2022 Masters victory over Novak Djokovic in paris and two more Masters finals in Monte Carlo and Rome. The 98-minute victory over the fifth-seeded former world No. 1 not only puts him into his first ATP final since January 2024 (Brisbane) but also on the precipice of returning to the Top 10.

The 98-minute victory over the fifth-seeded former world No. 1 not only puts him into his first ATP final since January 2024 (Brisbane) but also on the precipice of returning to the Top 10.

Still just 21 years old, Rune posted mixed results through the first quarter of 2025, pushing eventual Australian Open champion Sinner to four sets in Melbourne but failing to win back-to-back matches in any of his other ATP appearances, arriving under the radar to Tennis Paradise.A narrow win over No. 18 seed Ugo Humbert looked to reignite the Dane's famed fighting spirit, and he backed up the result with a statement victory (including a sick tweener) over No. 8 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, himself fresh off a title run at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. A first win over Dutch nemesis Tallon Griekspoor booked a rematch with Medvedev, who had won their last two head-to-head meetings—most recently at this very tournament 12 months ago.But Medvedev, too, has struggled to get going in 2025, posting solid results in February but lacking a signature result after bowing out of the Australian Open in the second round. The 2021 US Open champion scored an emotional victory over No. 20 seed Arthur Fils—where he quite literally jumped for joy after winning a third-set tiebreaker—but struggled in the key points against Rune on Saturday."It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got decent leg work to reach many balls, but it was a very specific tactical plan that I made with my coach yesterday evening and this morning. It was all about finding the right pace and the right shots to hit. So many players miss too many shots against Daniil because he gets so many balls back and it makes you want to hit the ball even stronger and go for more. I'm super proud I found the right rhythm, the right tempo, and that I stayed super composed at the end."

Rune scored the crucial break of the opening set, edging through the final two games from 5-5, and broke early in the second set to put himself in position for the win. Medvedev played strong with the finish line in sight, holding to love down 3-5 and taking a 0-30 lead as Rune served for the match, but Rune reeled off the final four points to clinch victory in just over an hour and a half on Court 1."Mentally, I want to stay like I did today because today was a big match; I'd had two losses against Medvedev in a row. I think, in the past, I wasn't there mentlally, and it wasn't about the level. No matter who I play tomorrow, I need to stay focused, composed, and stay relaxed so I can go for it."Standing between Rune and his biggest title in over two years could be defending champion Alcaraz, who will take on No. 13 seed Jack Draper in the second semifinal. Rune scored his lone win over the four-time Grand Slam champion via retirement in 2022, where he went on to win his Masters title in Paris-Bercy. Their most recent encounter came at Wimbledon in 2023, Alcaraz winning in straight sets en route to his own title.

There it was in my inbox, greeting me at lunchtime on the final day of February with the subject line of, “On Sale! Louis C.K. "Ridiculous Tour,” hovering over a giant photo of the comedian wearing his signature “well, shucks” grin.

The notice came from a Seattle venue best known for being the home of our local ballet and opera companies, a place that generally programs highbrow acts. When Patti LuPone came to the city in 2023 to headline a benefit concert, this venue hosted her. Ditto for John Cleese.

But with a few exceptions, a venue will host whoever and whatever the market demands. C.K., as the email boasts, is a six-time Emmy Award and three-time Grammy Award winner. One of those Grammys was awarded after five women came forward in 2017 to accuse him of sexual misconduct which, funny enough, wasn't mentioned in the email.

To anyone scoffing at this with a “Why would they?” — well, why not? C.K. transformed his accusers' horror at having him masturbate in their presence without their consent not simply into material but, you know, his “thing.” A sexual kink instead of sexual misconduct, a bit of light oopsie-doodle haha.

“I like company. I like to share! I'm good at it, too. If you're good at juggling, you wouldn't do it alone in the dark,” he jokes in 2020's award-winning “Sincerely Louis CK.”

It's all out there, so why wouldn't the theater's PR team be as upfront with it as C.K. continues to be? “Six-time Emmy Award, three-time Grammy Award winner and five-time non-consensual masturbator – that we know of!” Now there's an attention-grabber. Maybe insert a slide whistle sound effect! No reason to hold back. We're well into the age of everything being permissible.

This is not expressly about one entertainer whose upcoming tour is selling out large venues across the country, proving his command over his fandom holds firm. And that is not an argument for his absolution, it's a factual statement on par with saying that shopping at Amazon is convenient and Tesla car batteries tend to explode.

These are apt comparisons. Before Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a buzzsaw to our trust in constitutional checks and balances, people were still buying his cars despite multiple allegations of racist abuse at his plants and fatal accidents related to Tesla's self-driving system failures.

The New York Times exposing Amazon's brutal work culture a decade ago didn't slow its march to becoming a multitrillion-dollar company.

Americans do not let the mistreatment of a few people, whether five, 500 or 5000, get in the way of their comfort or good time.

Last week when Netflix announced its three-special deal with Tony Hinchcliffe, the comic who referred to Puerto Rico as "a floating island of garbage" at Donald Trump's pre-election Madison Square Garden rally, my reaction was the same as how I greeted that on-sale email for C.K.'s tour. “Of course.”

Fellow comic Marc Maron already called it days after Hinchcliffe dropped his rally set, as I previously quoted. “Fascism is good for business if you toe the line. Popular podcasts became tribal and divisive years ago,” he wrote. “Now they may be in the position to become part of the media oligarchy under the new anti-democratic government.”

The broader mainstream may have been introduced to Hinchcliffe by way of that Madison Square Garden tight 10, but he was already a star. Hinchcliffe hosts the top live podcast in the world, “Kill Tony,” which is considered a main launching pad for aspiring comedians.

He's also a superstar in Joe Rogan's Comedy Mothership solar system, tied to Rogan's Austin, Texas comedy club and its accompanying cadre of right-leaning headliners.

Netflix is a digital, for-profit venue following the money. According to a report in The Ankler citing Social Blade data, Hinchcliffe gained more than 36,000 new followers on X and 23,763 more on Instagram after the Trump rally.

“It was never my intention to swing an election,” The Ankler quoted him as saying onstage at the Mothership, “but god****t — right place, right time, I guess.”

As people frantically paraphrase Martin Niemöller's famous “First, they came for the socialists” poem in response to the detention and attempted deportation of activist Mahmoud Khalil, some have gotten bogged down in arguing which constituency they came for before Palestinians and campus protesters. Somebody will build that into a bit, I'm sure. 

But here's what we know: people are exhausted with all their anger and demands for justice resulting in nothing, including from figures they expect to do better.

Even Maron is about ready for the world to put a fork in him, addressing his cynicism over boycotts in his March 3 post. “Maybe public perception will change and maybe more angry people will once again believe that civil service in the form of candidacy will manifest,” he wrote. “. . . That's if voting remains a thing. But in the meantime, if you want to go out in the world and shop at actual stores and stop buying Teslas, all the power to you. Whatever gets you through the day.”

Joking about terrible things disempowers them. Joking about vilified people reduces their humanity. "Everybody READ the 'first they came for' poem," posted one Bluesky user, "And then IGNORED it because they decided who they were coming for was 'content' rather than humans."

Now, now, you may be saying. If these guys aren't intentionally out to harm anyone, as they often claim, what reason do we have to fuss? Besides the shout-outs they've received from a White House that's dedicated to legislatively and extralegally inflicting maximum harm?

Comics are only out to make money. We would understand that if we only knew them through their podcasts.

Andrew Schulz, another Rogan crewmember, recently released his special “Life” on Netflix. He and his wife's fertility struggle and his entry into fatherhood are the heart of the set. He also finds room to bust out a joke – which kills, by the way – that every newborn baby looks Puerto Rican.

You may wonder what is with these guys knocking around Puerto Rico. One theory, and hear me out, is that the right wing made the island and its residents a safe target to be “othered.” Since many don't realize its Spanish-speaking people are fellow Americans, the ignorant can gleefully lump them in with other so-called immigrant invaders. Go ahead and joke about deporting them, because you can't.

If you don't follow Schulz's podcasts or, say, listen to him lovingly rave about how much New Yorkers love Puerto Rico and its people on Shannon Sharpe's “Club Shay Shay,” you might not know that he's laughing with them, not at them.

The thing is, the average giggler isn't a student of nuance, and even Schulz's avid listeners may not see anything wrong with him and his co-hosts taking casual swipes at marginalized people. It's all with love. Except, maybe, when it comes to the transgender community.

Schulz riffing on his infant resembling a Puerto Rican may be a tad more defensible than Hinchcliffe's bigotry nuke at Madison Square Garden. But Schulz helped a brother out in his recent conversation with Sharpe, explaining that Hinchcliffe was trying to joke about the very real environmental disaster that is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (which we're specifically naming since he did not).

“He was actually referencing, like, an actual climate issue with, like, recycling,” Schulz said, “But still, I think that if he was, like, in New York and working it out at clubs, he'd be like, ‘Oh, they're not going to get this. Let me change this for something else.' I don't think he, like has a personal vendetta, for Puerto Rico.”

Oh. Of course.

Comedy employs equations that decode the American psyche, like the classic “tragedy plus time” math, or a certain comedian's popular “of course, but maybe” bit. For example, of course former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo should have stepped down after he was accused of underreporting thousands of deaths among elderly residents in his state's nursing homes during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect his reputation. That was dishonest and wrong.

But maybe that doesn't disqualify him from running for mayor of New York City; how much longer were those sick old people going to live anyway? Would Cuomo be worse or more corrupt than the hilariously bent Eric Adams? Debatable.

Cuomo also faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment, but maybe that's not disqualifying in the age where everything is permissible.

Adams denied the misconduct claims against him — of course! — as did fellow candidate Scott M. Stringer, who the New York Times reports was accused of sexual harassment decades earlier by two women.

Only two? That's not so bad. Besides, we've already established legislatively and recreationally that nobody cares about women's safety or well-being.

If they did, we wouldn't be talking about the real possibility of the Trump administration re-arming Mel Gibson, whose gun ownership rights were stripped away from him in 2011 under a 1996 federal law that prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms.  

Gibson pleaded “no contest” to a misdemeanor battery charge for physically assaulting then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva while she was holding their infant daughter. 

But that was such a long time ago, and Gibson has made so many wonderful movies since then. The man directed 2016's “Hacksaw Ridge” and that was nominated for, like, a bunch of Oscars and Golden Globes. What's the worst that could happen if he loses his temper while packing heat?

We joke. We kid! That is pretty much all the energy we can muster to face life right now.

Experts on fascist regimes have been counseling all who will listen that among the first tactics employed by those seeking power is to overwhelm the masses to silence and inaction.

What we hadn't considered is the extent to which a complicit entertainment industry has been softening us up by elevating clowns into sages.

Before the legislative attacks on transgender people came jokes. Lots of jokes. Before that came #MeToo, which was dismantled by the near total lack of accountability for the famous men it ensnared, and jokes.

Helping that along were years' worth of jokes minimizing rape culture, and the racist, sexist yuks that were the hallmark of the ‘90s and aughts' political correctness backlash.

It's better to laugh than to sweat the giant nightmares, like the next coming of Roseanne Barr, or our accelerating slide into a dictatorship under a game show host. As long as misery isn't banging on your doorstep, everything's laughable and nothing matters. And if nothing matters, then anything goes.

Millie Bobby Brown has quite the growing family.

The 21-year-old Stranger Things star, who lives on a farm in Georgia, recently revealed that she owns 62 animals.

"I have 25 farm animals, and then I have 23 foster dogs, and then I have 10 dogs in my house that are my personal dogs, and four cats," she told BBC Radio 1.

As far as the dogs who live in the house, she said: "I have gotten them real single beds."

Her husband, Jake Bongiovi, set strict rules about the animals and where they sleep, she said.

"Only one is allowed in the bed now because Jake said, 'No more in the bed.'"

The dogs include a rottweiler, a golden retriever, a Great Dane, and "an 18-year-old blind dachshund called Rigby" who she found "left on the side of the road" and decided to take him in.

"I took him thinking, 'He's not got long left, he's blind, can't find his way through.' Well, this dog is jumping on my couch now. It's found a new lease [on] life," Millie said.

"He is thriving. I mean, killing it. Knows the house. I feel like he's becoming unblind. He starts to look around and he knows where the food is and the bedroom is. He's getting really good. I used to call him Rigor Mortis because I really thought he was on his way out. He is nowhere close to death. Let me tell you, this dog is — he is killing it."

She's got at least one more coming: "My donkey is pregnant. Betsy and Bernard got together, had a great night out, and now she's preggers."

Millie also said the donkeys don't get along with her dogs.

"They will kill a dog if they see a dog. The reason I got them is because I get coyotes, so I got a donkey to deter the coyotes from eating my little dogs," she said. 

"I have two donkeys, and one day I went out and Betsy was just — she had a very big stomach, and I got my ultrasound machine out and I saw ribs, and they weren't Betsy's."

Millie is also one of several stars who got married at a very young age.

Watch her explain her current pet situation...

Brenda Song refers to fiancé Macaulay Culkin as "a very unique human being" and "the most famous child actor in the world" for a few reasons. 

The Suite Life of Zack & Cody alum recently opened up about unique skills her future husband, with whom she shares children Dakota, 3, and Carson, 2, per Page Six, has yet to possess as he approaches his 45th year. 

"I always say Mac is a very unique human being the most famous child actor in the world. He still doesn't know how to drive! I took him out to drive in our neighborhood. I was terrified, let me tell you," Song revealed during a recent guest appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show. 

The star, who met Culkin in 2014, also admitted her beau didn't know how to fold laundry until they were dating, a trait which she attributes to his childhood in the spotlight. 

"He lived and grew up in hotels. He had just never really done laundry, and I was shooketh. I've been doing laundry since I was 10 helping my mom. It's funny, teaching him how to do laundry." The Home Alone actor asked Song to be his wife in 2022, and the rest was history. 

Speaking of the iconic Christmas film, Song revealed that she and Culkin have only watched it together once, and that the actor told her a handful of behind the scenes details as they watched it. 

"I was like stop...STOP! You're ruining it for me. You are ruining it."

James Van Der Beek is opening up about his cancer battle.

The 48-year-old Dawson's Creek alum spoke out about his battle with Stage 3 colorectal cancer in a post on social media.

In the post, he explained how it also affected his marriage to Kimberly Van Der Beek as well as the lives of their six kids—Olivia, 14, Joshua, 13, Annabel, 11, Emilia, 8, Gwendolyn, 6, Jeremiah, 2.

"Today's my birthday, and it has been the hardest year of my life," he explained.

"When I was younger, I used to define myself as an actor...which was never really all that fulfilling. And then I became a husband, and that was much better. And then I became a father, and that was the ultimate," he said.

"I could define myself then as a loving, capable, strong, supportive husband, father, provider, steward of the land that we're so lucky to live on. And for a long time, that felt like a really good definition to the question, 'Who am I? What am I?' And then this year, I had to look my own mortality in the eye."

"I had to come nose to nose with death," he continued. 

"And all of those definitions that I cared so deeply about were stripped from me. I was away for treatment, so I could no longer be a husband that was helpful to my wife. I could no longer be a father who could pick up his kids and put them to bed and be there for them. I could not be a provider because I wasn't working."

James said he "couldn't even be a steward of the land" because he would sometimes be too weak to prune trees.

"As I move through this healing portal toward recovery, I wanted to share that with you because I think that revelation that came to me was due in no small part to all the prayers and the love that had been directed toward me. So I offer that to you, however it sits in your consciousness, however it resonates—run with it."

"And so I was faced with the question," he continued, "If I am just a too-skinny, weak guy alone in an apartment with cancer, what am I?"

"I meditated and the answer came through," he said. 

"I am worthy of God's love, simply because I exist. And if I'm worthy of God's love, shouldn't I also be worthy of my own? And the same is true for you."

He added: "And if the word 'God' trips you up, I certainly don't know, I can't claim to know what God is or explain God. My efforts to connect to God are an ongoing process that is a constant unfolding mystery to me. But if it's a trigger, it feels too religious, you can take the word 'God' out and your mantra can simply be, 'I am worthy of love.' Because you are."

"Thank you for the love and prayers, everyone. Have a blessed day," he concluded.

We are wishing the best to James and his family. 

It was also revealed that he was selling items to pay for his expensive cancer treatment.

Megan Stalter has no interest in using Ozempic for a very particular reason. 

The 34-year-old Hacks star called out other celebs who lie about using the weight loss drug, as she says it has a very noticeable side effect.

"Let's just say the trips to the bathroom would say otherwise, okay? We know if you're on it because you're s—ing your pants,” Megan said on a recent interview on the “Grindr Presents: Who's The A—–? with Katya” podcast.  

"How is that hotter than being fat? That is insane to me. I would rather be 500 pounds than s—ing all day. That's so gross. Unless you have a sickness then that is something you were born with, but if you're taking a drug on purpose just so you lose 10 pounds then, honey, we liked you a little chubbier," she added. 

If you didn't see, in January, another popular comedian talked about her experience with Ozempic, and why she decided to stop using it.

Michelle Obama is addressing the rumors about Barack Obama.

The 61-year-old former First Lady of the United States spoke about her 60-year-old husband and former President of the United States in a live taping of her IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson podcast.

During the episode, she addressed "negative energy," "gossip," and speculation regarding their marriage.

“People always ask me and Barack, how did we stay hopeful in, not just the eight years that we were in the White House, but beyond?” she said.

“Because, let me tell you, there was a lot of negative energy flipping our way — a lot of rumors, a lot of gossip, a lot of, you know, my husband wasn't born in this country … we weren't patriotic, he didn't get into Harvard.”

“But through it all, what kept us sane — and we tried to instill this in our daughters — is, you cannot live through social media,” she said, adding that she's fairly sure she's never “once looked at a comment section.”

“Don't let that negative energy enter into your space. These are people who don't know you. A lot of this stuff is made up, and it does not feed you,” she continued.

“That doesn't mean you don't stay informed, but staying informed has nothing to do with the comment section. It has everything to do with the content of the stories that you take in," Michelle said.

She added that she feels it's not helpful for people to get “so trapped by social media that we feel so caught up into the one way we get information.”

“We've got to broaden our spectrum, and we have to get off the phone,” Michelle concluded.

Jack Quaid's Novocaine is No. 1 at the box office - but the numbers aren't great for the movie industry overall.

In its opening weekend, the movie brought in $8.7 million, via Variety.

This marks one of the worst debuts to still go to No. 1 spot, at least since the days of the pandemic.

In fact, this weekend was among the year's lowest grossing to date, with roughly $54 million across all films, according to the report.

Novocaine also opened behind $10 million to $12 million projections from 3,365 North American theaters. 

That said, the movie only cost $18 million to make before marketing. It's earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore and an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

In the film, when the girl of his dreams (Amber Midthunder) is kidnapped, everyman Nate (Quaid) turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected strength in his fight to get her back.

Perhaps love really is in the air for Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas.

In photos published by People on Saturday, March 15, the actors were spotted arriving via helicopter at the London Heliport on Friday evening. Both Cruise, 62, and de Armas, 36, sported casual looks for the outing —the Top Gun star wore black jeans and a brown button-down shirt and Armas rocked a white T-shirt, jeans and white sneakers under a black trench coat.

The pair appeared to be in good spirits, and were seen chatting and laughing with Heliport staff.

Neither Cruise or de Armas have confirmed the nature of their relationship. Us Weekly has reached out to their reps for comment.



The outing comes one month after Cruise and de Armas were initially seen out to dinner over Valentine's Day weekend. The duo were all smiles as they were photographed in the Soho area of London on February 13 — carrying takeout bags and posing for photos with excited fans before hopping in a car together.

After the photos were published, de Armas was asked about her meetup with Cruise during a stroll in Madrid. She declined to answer whether their relationship was personal or work-related, as seen in a video posted by Spanish news agency Europa Press on February 17.

That same day, de Armas was also spotted out with Manuel Anido Cuesta, stepson of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, whom she's been seen with over the last few months. She's yet to comment on the nature of that relationship, too.

The Blonde actress was briefly married to Spanish actor Marc Clotet until 2013 before making headlines for her relationship with Ben Affleck, whom she dated from 2020 to early 2021 after they met on the set of Deep Water. More recently, she was linked to Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis and Cuesta.

Cruise, for his part, has been married three times — to Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990, to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001 and to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. He shares adult children Isabella, 32, and Connor, 30, with Kidman, 57, and daughter Suri, 18, with Holmes, 46.

He has also been romantically linked to a handful of Hollywood stars, including Heather Locklear, Penélope Cruz and Hayley Atwell. Most recently, he was reportedly dating Russian socialite Elsina Khayrova.

Us confirmed in December 2023 that Cruise had been quietly seeing Khayrova, 37, for “a while” before they publicly stepped out at a London party that same month. “They're very happy,” the insider shared. “And Tom's extremely confident about it working out for the long term.”

Yet, the pair split shortly after, with a source telling Us in March 2024, “They weren't gelling and realized they weren't romantically compatible.”

Vicky Kaushal and Akshaye Khanna's film Chhaava is at the end of its spectacular 5th weekend today.

Today is the 31st day of the film's release and Vicky's period drama rocked the box office. The initial data related to its earnings has also come out. So let's know how much the film has earned so far.

According to official figures, Chhaava earned Rs 540.38 crore in Hindi and Rs 11.80 crore in Telugu, making a total of 552.18 crore in 4 weeks. According to Sacnilk, the film earned 7.5 crores and 8 crores on the 29th and 30th day in Hindi and Telugu combined. This means that the total collection of the film in a month has become 567.68 crores. Now, Chhaava has earned 3.8 crores till 4:30 pm today and has made a great collection of 571.48 crores. These figures are not final yet and can witness some rise as well. 

Chhaava moving from top 3 to top 2

Chhaava has secured its third place in the list of top 3 highest collections in Hindi films. The film has secured this place by breaking the record of Animal (Rs 553.87 crores) in the domestic box office collection. Currently, Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan (Rs 640.25 crores) is at the first position in this list and Stree 2 (Rs 597.99 crores) is at the second position. Chhaava still has about two more weeks. Seeing the speed of the film, it seems that the film can break the record of Stree 2 soon. Currently, the film is about 25 crores behind Shraddha Kapoor- Rajkumar Rao's film.

About Chhaava

Made on a budget of 130 crores, this film is based on the life of Sambhaji Maharaj, whose role is played by Vicky Kaushal and his wife's role is played by Rashmika Mandanna. Akshaye Khanna, Vineet Kumar Singh and Ashutosh Rana are also in important roles in the film. The film is directed by Laxman Utekar and produced by Maddock Films.

Jerry Lewis remains one of Hollywood's most influential comedy stars of all time – but the actor and director was also well known for his explosive personality away from the cameras.

Lewis was never afraid to speak his mind when he was unhappy, whether he was beefing with comedy rivals like Joan Rivers or complaining about being snubbed by the Academy Awards. While the comedian was widely recognized as a humanitarian for his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), his partnership with the charity eventually soured as well near the end of his life. Lewis even managed to hold a grudge from beyond the grave, as he notoriously disinherited his sons and grandchildren from his first marriage to Patti Lewis.

On what would have been Lewis' 99th birthday on March 16, keep scrolling for a look back at some of the comedy legend's most notorious public feuds:

Lewis's personal and professional life was defined by his on-stage partnership with Martin. The pair became one of the world's most successful comedy duos after World War II, starring in 16 movies and selling out live venues across the globe.



Lewis wrote in his 2005 book Dean and Me that the pair started to butt heads at the height of their success over Martin's reluctance to follow his partner's creative guidance. Martin was anxious to pursue solo projects, while Lewis was insistent that they were most successful when working together.

The two stopped speaking around the time of their final live performance at the Copacabana on July 25, 1956 – 10 years to the day after their first-ever performance – and would not reconcile for another 20 years.

Lewis told People in 2002 that he “broke up the act,” which he said “hurt [Dean] desperately.” The pair's mutual friend Frank Sinatra famously organized a surprise reunion for Martin and Lewis on the 1976 MDA Telethon. The old friends briefly appeared together on stage to raise money for Muscular Dystrophy but didn't reprise any of their old routines.

In the biography King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis, author Shawn Levy wrote that Lewis made “a few overtures” towards reconnecting with Martin after their TV reunion but was ignored. The pair wouldn't speak regularly again until Martin's son, Dean Paul Martin, died in a botched military training flight for the California Air National Guard in 1987.

The comedy icons took plenty of light-hearted jabs at one another throughout their careers, but it turned serious when Rivers publicly criticized Lewis' charity work with MDA. During an appearance on Sirius XM Radio in 2014, Rivers vowed to never perform on the MDA telethon after observing Lewis openly discussing death in front of the children he was raising money for.

“You don't say in front of a little boy who's going to die, ‘This child is going to die,'” Rivers angrily declared. “Who are you? You unfunny, lucky, stupid a–hole? So, he took umbrage!”

Rivers was perhaps underestimating Lewis' reaction, because he accused her of “setting the Jews back 1,000 years.” In his own Sirius XM interview that same year, Lewis said he would “always feel bad when someone passes away except for Joan Rivers.”

“She went to Israel and uprooted two trees in my name,” he joked during an interview with Maria Menounos.

Lewis objected to Rivers's claim that the MDA telethon benefited his sagging career, adding: “I wrote her a note that night. I said: ‘Dear Ms. Rivers, we never met and I'm looking forward to keeping it that way.'”

The pair reportedly never reconciled before Rivers died as a result of complications from a throat procedure in September 2014.

One of Lewis's most iconic movie performances was his dual roles playing neurotic professor Julius Kelp and sinister playboy Buddy Love in 1963's The Nutty Professor. Because Lewis cowrote and produced the comedy classic, Murphy had to get his permission to remake The Nutty Professor in 1996.

Lewis consented to Murphy's remake, though he was disappointed by the film. Murphy spoke in press interviews around the time of The Nutty Professor‘s release about why he only loosely adapted Lewis's original movie.

“The Nutty Professor is the skeleton of the script, and we stripped down the story to its bare bones and built it up to this whole different thing,” Murphy told the Los Angeles Times.

Despite Murphy describing his version of The Nutty Professor as “an homage to Jerry and how brilliant he was,” Lewis told Entertainment Weekly in 2009 that he regretted his involvement in the remake.

“I have such respect for Eddie but I shouldn't have done it,” Lewis insisted. “What I did was perfect the first time around and all you're going to do is diminish that perfection by letting someone else do it. When he had to do fart jokes, he lost me.”

Lewis' reservations aside, The Nutty Professor remake ushered in a career renaissance for Murphy and made a staggering $273 million at the worldwide box office.

In the early 1950s, two comedy duos ruled the roost in Hollywood – Martin and Lewis, and their predecessors Crosby and Bob Hope. All four men came together for a 1952 U.S. Olympics telethon, hosted by Hope and Crosby, where bad blood between the duos came to the surface live on air.

After being introduced, Lewis rushed to the stage and jumped on Hope, kissing him and hugging him in the trademark style of his energetic alter-ego “The Little Boy.” Crosby wanted no part of Lewis's act and immediately left the stage. Lewis and Martin repeatedly called for Crosby to come back so they could continue their planned routine, but the cohost flatly refused.

“He's hiding and I don't blame him,” Hope joked to viewers.

Crosby never explained his live TV walk off, but there was speculation that he was afraid Lewis would pull off his toupee. In a TV interview decades later, Lewis confirmed that he “never spoke to Crosby” again after their telethon debacle.

“That he didn't know me well enough to know I would never do such a thing [as pull off his toupee],” Lewis insisted. “I was so offended by it that, that was '52, in the next eight years, I never talked to Crosby and our dressing rooms were right adjacent to one another.”

Lewis was the public face of the Muscular Dystrophy Association for more than 40 years and host of its annual Labor Day weekend telethon. The charity leaned into its association with the Hollywood superstar by referring to Muscular Dystrophy patients as “Jerry's Kids.”

Throughout their decades of association, Lewis and MDA were criticised by some for using a “pity approach” to generate donations. Disability activists – including a group calling itself Jerry's Orphans – complained about MDA's fundraising tactic, saying it took away the agency of people living with Muscular Dystrophy to depict them as pitiable.

By the 2010s, the professional partnership between Lewis and MDA soured. Lewis famously had to apologize for using a homophobic slur in a joke on the telethon. He also had a history of making controversial statements during the annual show, such as the time he encouraged drug-traffickers in Miami to donate their earnings to MDA in order to absolve their guilty consciences.

In 2011, MDA announced that Lewis was abruptly stepping down from his role within the organization, though neither side offered any explanation as to why. Negotiations took place about Lewis saying goodbye to viewers on that year's telethon, but terms were never reached. MDA declined to mention its long association with Lewis at all in all of the press materials for its telethon in 2012.

Lewis initially stayed silent about his split from MDA, but ultimately made it clear to Time magazine that he was unhappy about the way his departure was handled.

“That's not a place I want to go. Because if I go there, you'll never get me back,” he warned in 2012. “It's not that I don't want to talk about it. But I have already ingested all that I want from that whole f—ing adventure.”

MDA rebranded its yearly televised fundraising drive as its Show of Strength, rather than calling it a telethon, following Lewis's departure. In more recent years, Kevin Hart has become a spokesperson for the group in a role similar to the one Lewis once held.

Lewis had an acrimonious split from first wife Patti in 1980, with a legal war between the former couple carrying on for three years until they finally reached a divorce settlement in 1983. Jerry allegedly had a child with Lynn Dixon Kleinman outside of his marriage in 1952.

Following his divorce, the comic reportedly had a rocky relationship with his and Patti's six sons, especially after he married second wife SanDee Pitnick in 1983. Jerry and SanDee's daughter Danielle was born in 1992 and frequently appeared with her father on his annual MDA telethon.

In 2009, Jerry's youngest son, Joseph Lewis, died by suicide after struggling with addiction throughout his life. Jerry reacted to his son's death five years later by telling The Hollywood Reporter that the tragedy was “unfair.”

“To this day I don't understand it because it's unfair — not unfair to me, but unfair to him,” Lewis said . “That he went that way made the unfairness stupidity. But he was my son and he's gone, and there's not a lot I can do about that. I beat myself a thousand times. Sam will come to me and say, ‘Are we beating ourselves again?' I will say, ‘A little bit.' [She'll say]: ‘You had nothing to do with that. You sent him out into the world when he was 25. You sent what you thought was a perfect human being. What he did with his time away from you is what the end result showed.' But I'll tell you this: You don't get over that.”

Jerry died from heart failure at age 91 in 2017. It was later reported that Jerry's will specifically stated that his sons and their children “shall receive no benefits” from his fortune.

Jerry's son Gary Lewis – a musician who had a Billboard No. 1 hit with “This Diamond Ring” in February 1965 – was quoted saying his father was “never loving and caring” towards his children. However, Jerry and Patti's son Christopher Lewis offered a more positive portrait of life with the comedian in a 2025 interview with Closer.

“I can't tell you how many dinners I sat at that I couldn't eat because I was laughing so hard,” Christopher recalled. “My mom would be so mad at him. She's like, ‘Would you stop and let them eat?' Which would inspire him more to make us laugh.”

Meghan Markle is facing a lot of criticism.

Her lifestyle series "With Love, Meghan" was widely panned and both that show and her upcoming podcast "Confessions of a Female Founder" have faced accusations of stealing names and ideas.

After Markle announced the podcast – her second after her Spotify podcast "Archetypes" was canceled after one season – on her Instagram this week, people were quick to pile on, noting its name is very similar to several others that are lesser known.

"Maybe you would like to know, Meghan Markle has ripped off another woman's podcast called ‘confessions of a CEO,'" one user wrote on X. "A simple Google search would help Meghan."

Another user found a second woman posting videos on YouTube under the exact name, "Confessions of a Female Founder." "Stealing ideas again," the user wrote on X.

However, "Confessions of a Female Founder" YouTuber Kady Méite is defending the duchess.

"I completely understand why people are drawing connections, and I truly appreciate the support and understand their intention," Méite told Yahoo Lifestyle on Thursday, "but I also understand coincidences as well. It is highly unlikely Meghan even came across my channel, but I am flattered by the thought."

She went further to say: "What does concern me is how quickly this is turning into another reason to drag a woman down. That's not something I want to contribute to. I know firsthand what it feels like to have my work actually copied...this isn't that."

The Duchess of Sussex's new podcast will premiere April 8.

"I'm so excited to share with you something else I've been working on: ‘Confessions of a Female Founder,' my new podcast with @lemonadamedia!" Markle wrote on her newly-created Instagram also on Thursday where she has been promoting her new media ventures, including her lifestyle brand "As Ever," which has also faced accusations of copying its logo.

She continued, "I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities, and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses. They're opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever. It has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what's the point if we can't have some fun on this wild adventure?)"

The duchess also confirmed a week ago – despite bad reviews from critics – that "With Love, Meghan," has been renewed for a second season on Netflix.

Hollywood actor Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas are unmistakably head over heels for each other. Following a romantic Valentine's Day, the rumoured couple reunited for their second joint public appearance in London.

According to People magazine, Tom and Ana were spotted out together in London again. The actors were seen arriving at the London Heliport via helicopter the evening of March 14. Both Tom, 62, and Ana, 36, opted for relaxed, casual attire, exuding a laid-back vibe as they stepped out together.

The Top Gun: Maverick star dressed down in black jeans and a brown button-down shirt, while Ana layered a chic black trench coat over a crisp white tee, paired with jeans and sleek white sneakers.

 

Tom and Ana appeared to be in high spirits, engaging in lively conversation and sharing laughs with the Heliport staff as they went about their day. The rumoured couple was also spotted together at the same heliport on Thursday.

The entertainment portal has reached out to the actors' representative but has not received an immediate response.

Tom and Ana first sparked romance rumours over Valentine's Day weekend last month when they were photographed together for the first time. They were spotted walking in London's Soho neighborhood, with the Deep Water actor carrying bags of takeout from a restaurant. Both stopped to chat and take photographs with fans.

Neither Tom, who has been filming an Alejandro G. Iñárritu movie in England in recent months, nor Ana have commented on the rumours.

After a few days, the actor asked during a stroll in Madrid whether her outing with Tom was personal or work-related. She declined to answer, as seen in a video Spanish news agency Europa Press posted on February 17.

Ana has been previously linked romantically to Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis in 2023 and dated Ben Affleck from 2020 to 2021.

Television actors Priyanka Chahar Choudhary and Ankit Gupta, who rose to fame with their show Udaariyaan, have long been rumoured to be dating. However, according to Instant Bollywood, the two have now unfollowed each other, leaving fans wondering if they have parted ways.

(Also Read: Bigg Boss 16: Ankit Gupta says Priyanka Chahar Choudhary and he were targeted on show, but she ‘got lucky')

Priyanka and Ankit participated together in Salman Khan's show Bigg Boss 16. Though they maintained that they were only friends, their chemistry had fans believing otherwise. After the show ended, they were often seen spending time together and sharing affectionate pictures on Instagram. In fact, recent rumours about their marriage were circulating on the internet. Amid this buzz, the portal shared a screenshot showing Ankit and Priyanka unfollowed each other on Instagram.

A post shared by Priyanka Chahar Choudhary (@priyankachaharchoudhary)

Their fans expressed disappointment, with one commenting, "Oh no! How is this possible? One of my favourite jodis, Priyankit—I thought this relationship would definitely get a name." Another wrote, "Impossible, yaar… Aisa nahi ho sakta (this cannot happen)." One fan remarked, "Nazar is so real." Another hopeful comment read, "They'll come back stronger than ever."

Although the Udaariyaan stars have unfollowed each other, they have not deleted any images from their time together. However, this has left fans speculating whether they have split up. Neither of them has ever confirmed their relationship, consistently referring to each other as “best friends.”

Ankit and Priyanka first met while filming their show Udaariyaan. Their on-screen chemistry won over fans, making them one of television's most beloved couples. They later entered Salman's reality show Bigg Boss 16, where their cute banter had fans rooting for them. Salman himself was often seen teasing them about their bond in the house. While Ankit was evicted by the housemates, Priyanka finished in third place but remained content with her journey.

In addition to their TV careers, the two have appeared together in several music videos, including Kuch Itnee Haseen, Baar Baar, and more. Priyanka and Ankit are now set to reunite on screen in Sargun Mehta and Ravi Dubey's show Terre Ho Jaayein Hum, which will stream on the YouTube channel Dreamiyata Dramaa.
