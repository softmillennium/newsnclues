The blaze in Kocani appeared to have been ignited by pyrotechnics used as part of a local pop band's performance, the interior minister said. Video on social media verified by Reuters appeared to show sparklers onstage causing the low ceiling to ignite while the musicians performed. Local outlets identified the venue as Club Pulse, which was hosting a performance by the pop duo DNK on Saturday night, according to its Instagram page. Officials issued arrest warrants for four people in connection with the blaze, Toshkovski said Sunday. “The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the pain of families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable,” he wrote.</p>

Macedonian Interior Minister Pance Toskovski speaks to media after a massive fire in the town of Kocani, North Macedonia, Sunday, March 16, 2025. “We have grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption in this case,” he told reporters without elaborating. Health Ministry officials said the government had accepted offers of assistance from several neighboring countries, including Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey, where preparations were being made to receive patients with life-threatening injuries. President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova visited burn victims at a hospital in Skopje and spoke to parents waiting outside. “It's terrible ... hard to believe how this happened,” she said, her voice halting with emotion.</p>

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — As Latin America's drug trade surges, the Trump administration's aid freeze has brought crucial anti-narcotics programs to a screeching halt. It also asked whether they are compliant with U.S. policy blocking any funding for abortion counseling, work with any entity “that espouses anti-American beliefs,” have received funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran and whether funded projects “reinforce U.S. sovereignty by limiting reliance on international organizations or global governance structures.” In addition, the UNODC publishes an annual World Drug Report, a key source of data on global narcotics flows that is used by U.S. agencies. In Guatemala, INL has supported a task force that identifies and destroys chemical precursors — including those used for fentanyl. Even as waivers emerge, officials said, damage has already been done — programs dismantled, bills unpaid and staff lost.</p>

Emmanuel Macron has said France, the UK, and other nations providing security guarantees for Ukraine after any eventual ceasefire would not be aiming to deploy a “mass” of soldiers, but instead could send contingents of several thousand troops to key locations in Ukraine without needing Russia's permission. He said this could involve “a few thousand troops” from each state, deployed at “key points” in Ukraine, to conduct training programmes and “show our long-term support”. He added: “Under no circumstances can the Ukrainians make territorial concessions without having any security guarantees.” Moscow has firmly opposed such a deployment, but Macron said Russia's permission was not needed. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in a statement to Agence France-Presse.</p>

Pair recently met to discuss Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other political matters, Sunday Times says Cummings and Farage were at odds for years in the run-up to the referendum and during Cummings's time at No 10, with Farage calling him a “horrible, nasty little man”. Cummings was said to be in advanced talks to launch his own new party – the Start-Up party – but in February he posted on X that he believed voters should now back Reform UK. Asked by one X user on Sunday who he would vote for at the next general election, Cummings wrote: “Dunno yet but obviously everyone should vote Reform this spring … No downsides, just upsides.” He wrote: “Shove out Kemi [Badenoch] ASAP, take over Tories, get Trump/Elon to facilitate a merger with Reform, tip in a third force of elite talent and mass energy so voters see an essentially new political force whose essence is a decisive break with 1992-2024 … break the coalition supporting [Keir] Starmer, take over No 10, do regime change.”</p>

Researchers use innovative cameras to identify fish species hindering coral reef restoration The footage showed that three corallivorous species – redband parrotfish, foureye butterflyfish and stoplight parrotfish – were responsible for eating more than 97% of coral laid as bait by the researchers at an offshore reef near Miami. “Intense fish predation on newly outplanted corals has emerged as a major restoration bottleneck. UM marine scientist and research master's graduate Erin Weisman presented the findings to the Reef Florida symposium of conservation leaders at Miami's Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in November. “By identifying, for the first time, the main fish predators as well as their preferred diet, reef restoration practitioners can select sites and species that would minimize predation impacts and maximize restoration success before large-scale, costly outplanting is implemented,” Lirman said.</p>

Russell T Davies has said gay society is in the “greatest danger I have ever seen”, since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November. Since his inauguration, Trump has ended policies giving LGBTQ+ Americans protection from discrimination. “The joyous thing about this is that we fought back,” he said. When he wrote the TV series Queer As Folk in the late 1990s, he said, it was part of a movement, with writers “fomenting ideas” and putting gay and lesbian characters on screen. What we've never had is a billionaire tech baron openly hating his trans daughter,” he added.</p>

Here's why</a></h2><b>Source:</b> The Associated Press&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 15:38:00 <p>
U.S. President Donald Trump says he has ordered airstrikes against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, and issued a warning to Tehran. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, until the current ceasefire in Gaza took effect in mid-January. Other missiles and drones were intercepted or failed to reach their targets, which included Western military ones. Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, has said he will not allow the program to become operational. Trump has also levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against the country and has suggested that military action remains a possibility, while emphasizing he still believes a new nuclear deal can be reached.</p>

And so your question is, how long will this go on? President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions. The attacks stopped when a Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office — but last week the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month. Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.</p>

They recounted with grim faces their shock when columns of Russian armored vehicles rumbled through the town one night three years ago, as rockets and missiles roared overhead. But despite this reliance on Moscow, Lukashenko, a wily former collective-farm boss, is quick to demonstrate his readiness for renewed outreach with the West. “People still feel it is dangerous to speak Belarusian today and they are scared,” said one of the museum's guides. If the campaign against Ukraine were to be frustrated, he warned, Russia might “incorporate Belarus as a consolation prize.” “Any shift in the current equilibrium spells danger for Minsk,” Shraibman said, adding that Lukashenko's “task ahead is monumental: keeping relations with his guarantor from going to either extreme.”</p>

Trump has always been an anachronistic presence in DC, where the Republican lost last year's presidential election to Democratic opponent Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points. Numerous artists and producers have cancelled shows, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical Hamilton, while ticket sales reportedly dropped roughly 50% week-over-week after Trump announced his takeover. All kinds of acts are cancelling and people I know say they won't ever set foot in that place.” The shift in Trump's second term has been more dramatic than anyone expected, added Galston, a resident of 43 years. An essay in the New York Times newspaper this week was headlined: “DC Is Becoming Another Hollowed-Out Company Town.”</p>

Numbers using satellite broadband system has been growing but users are having second thoughts due to Musk's role in Donald Trump's administration Viasat, which owns UK network Inmarsat, is also in talks with European governments about replacing Musk's Starlink. In the UK, Starlink is used mainly by people and businesses in rural areas who have poor broadband access, although there is also a minority of “preppers” and people who buy the tech as fans of Musk. Elon Musk is a very different figure and Tesla showrooms are being burned to the ground. Musk posted on X at the weekend: “Their entire frontline would collapse if I turned it off.”</p>

Some cells are still alive within the dung, and could be used to boost genetic diversity in certain species Now researchers are exploring whether they can use dung to capture – and harness – animals' genetic diversity. But if cells from poo can be cultured and grown it raises another possibility: the creation of entire animals using state-of-art assisted reproductive technologies. By contrast, taking cells from poo is non-invasive and does not involve capture, raising the possibility of collecting them from even the most elusive creatures – an approach that could enable scientists access to greater genetic diversity by sampling wild populations. “I just think because of the dire straits we are in, you need to try multiple different tools”.</p>

Donald Trump keeps saying he inherited a terrible economy from Joe Biden and many Americans believe him, even though that's not true. During his White House marketing event for Tesla on Tuesday, Trump said the US and its economy “went to hell” under Biden. Trump fails to note, however, that Biden had considerable success in bringing bring back manufacturing and factory jobs. A big reason for this was that as a result of Biden's green jobs legislation and the Chips Act to boost semiconductor production, manufacturing investment boomed, more than doubling during Biden's four years in office. The spike in prices was caused largely by two factors: the pandemic, which gave rise to worldwide supply chain problems, and Putin's war in Ukraine, which pushed up food and fuel prices.</p>

Whether in Asia, Africa, Europe, or North America, a deep and pervasive sense of anxiety about our collective future is unmistakably evident. Even if not always considered good by everyone, common directions still offer a sense of purpose to world politics. Examples of such global purpose include promoting liberal democracy, humanitarian intervention, nuclear non-proliferation, and economic globalisation via international institutions. Across Asia, Europe, and North America, international life today lacks purpose beyond managing chaos or exploiting it. Deglobalisation is not just an economic phenomenon; it also involves the erosion of institutions, regimes, norms, and values created over a long period.</p>

Trump administration accused of ‘quid pro quo' for fast-tracking controversial fossil fuel proposal in Michigan “Contracts oftentimes are awarded based on large campaign donations rather than merit, and it effectively rigs the bidding process against businesses who either cannot afford making large campaign contributions or who refuse to pay to play for government contracts,” Holman said. Some allege it was a payback to oil industry donors who helped Trump get elected. “These are donors who got the contract to build the border wall and it seems like there also is an ulterior motive here – a conflict of interest,” said Levi Teitel, a spokesperson for Progress Michigan, which opposes Line 5.

Columbia has come under immense pressure from the Trump administration in recent weeks, with the US government cancelling USD 400 million in federal grants and contracts to the school, much of it for medical research, as punishment for not cracking down harder on students and faculty who criticised Israel's military action in Gaza during large protests last spring.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his US counterpart Marco Rubio in a phone call Saturday that all sides should refrain from the "use of force" in Yemen and enter a "political dialogue", Moscow said on Sunday.Moscow said Rubio informed Lavrov about Washington's decision to launch strikes against Yemen's Huthis, in a call that came after the two countries have relaunched dialogue since Donald Trump took office.

"In response to argumentation put forward by American representatives, Sergei Lavrov stressed the need for an immediate cessation of the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed," Russia's foreign ministry said.

Russia last year condemned US and British strikes on Yemen and has held talks with the Huthis, who are backed by Moscow's ally Iran.

QUETTA - Separatist militants drove a vehicle laden with explosives into a paramilitary convoy, killing at least five in southwestern Pakistan, officials said on Sunday, just days after the same group hijacked a train and held hostages for 36 hours. Senior Superintendent of Police for Noskhi district Hashim Momand said more than 30 paramilitary force members were also wounded. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement condemned the attack, which came as Pakistan deals with a growing security crisis in its regions bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan's authorities have vowed to crack down on the growing insurgencies and said they are fuelled in part by militants finding safe haven in Afghanistan, a charge the ruling Afghan Taliban deny.

Srinivasan's troubles began when she became entangled in the government's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests. Despite no evidence being provided, she was accused of supporting violence and links to Hamas. She also shared her concerns about the government's crackdown on free speech, saying, "I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech... can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathiser and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety". Srinivasan's case has gained attention amid increased scrutiny of individuals and organisations allegedly supporting Hamas. Visa revocations for security reasons have become more frequent, reflecting the government's efforts to enforce visa regulations and prevent individuals it considers a security threat from remaining in the country.</p>

It allowed for incredibly vulnerable people to be exploited because there wasn't a sensible policy intervention in the first place,” Lyons said. Last year, an investigation found that companies granted licences to sponsor workers included suspected bogus firms with copy-and-paste websites, fake-looking reviews, PO boxes as addresses and no track record of providing care. “With 470 employers having their licences revoked, this is far more than ‘a few bad apples',” its chief executive, Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, said.</p>

Zinna went from being a returned shelter dog to an incredible companion that was always at Arakawa's side, said Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care facility that was involved in the surviving dogs' care. The pair led a private life after moving to Santa Fe decades ago. A representative for the couple's estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video.

There are growing concerns that the US president does not care how far the stock market may fall while he battles Washington's major trading partners – and, worse, that he is sanguine about a fall in output which, if it continues, could bring about a full-blown recession. Yet he insists it is time for to “lead and not lag”, because preventing a severe downturn should be the top priority. Robert Wood, chief UK ­economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) is right to be cautious. Like most economists, Wood expects the Bank to hold rates on Thursday and only cut again at its meeting in May. As Albert Edwards at Société Générale says: “If the equity market now plunges, we might find that it disproportionately hits retail sales more than usual.”</p>

Riibe was later detained by police under “irregular conditions,” his parents Albert and Tina said. Surveillance footage showed Konanki and Riibe walking arm-in-arm alongside friends while heading toward the beach. Riibe and Konanki reportedly went into waist-deep waters, but were soon swept out to sea by a big wave.

Confused and unsure, she reached out to Columbia's international student office for guidance. “I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech or just doing what we all do — like shout into the abyss that is social media — can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathizer and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety,” Srinivasan told The New York Times.

Ukrainian president maintains his troops are still fighting in Russia's Kursk region and warns that Moscow is ‘doing everything' to prevent a ceasefire. He said Kyiv's troops were not encircled in Kursk, as has been claimed by Russia, but that Moscow was accumulating forces nearby for a separate strike. “The buildup of Russian forces indicates that Moscow intends to keep ignoring diplomacy,” he said. Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Putin's first prime minister and now an opponent of the Russian president, said Moscow was interested only in a conditional ceasefire. Kyiv's air force said the Iranian-made Shahed drones were downed over 14 regions and that Moscow had also attacked with two ballistic missiles.</p>

Historically, terms like invasion and predatory incursion were understood literally -- referring to large-scale attacks or smaller military raids. Some politicians now argue for a broader reading, suggesting that unlawful migration or drug trafficking qualifies as an "invasion." Past courts and presidents have consistently treated it as a wartime authority, not an immigration enforcement law. On Saturday, Trump declared the gang an invading force, invoking wartime powers to justify mass deportations. But the political question doctrine - which prevents courts from interfering in executive decisions on war and foreign policy - could limit judicial challenges.</p>

In 2018 a former deputy governor of Sweden's central bank predicted that by 2025 the country would probably be cashless. Just one in 10 purchases are made with cash, and card is the most common form of payment, followed by the Swedish mobile payment system Swish, launched by six banks in 2012 and now ubiquitous. Sweden is not the only Nordic country backpedalling on plans for a cashless society. Last year Norway, which has a popular equivalent to Swish called Vipps MobilePay, brought in legislation that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they will not accept cash. Ultimately, when it comes to emergency planning, the world's two most cashless societies are still banking on cash.</p>

Images obtained by CDN show the clothing undisturbed, with no signs of tampering. A clip from the Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana shows Ms Konanki walking arm-in-arm with an unidentified man -- believed to be Mr Riibe -- along a resort pathway, accompanied by friends. While Dominican authorities initially suspected drowning, Ms Konanki's father has urged investigators to explore other possibilities, like abduction. Authorities have deployed drones and AI-assisted surveillance to scan the ocean, while Interpol has issued a 'yellow notice' for missing persons. Dominican President Luis Abinader revealed in a news conference that Joshua Riibe reported a wave hitting them while they were on the beach, but no blood or signs of violence have been found at the scene.</p>

The Al-Khair Foundation says staff were setting up a camp for displaced Gazans in Beit Lahia Saturday when back-to-back Israeli strikes hit their vehicles. At least nine people were killed Saturday in strikes on Gaza, authorities there said, as Israel continues to launch operations during its ceasefire with Hamas. The first phase, during which some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners were released, ended on March 1. “This isn't the first time they've targeted humanitarian workers and then leveled false accusations,” he said. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.</p>

Riibe has been kept under 24 hour surveillance, with sources claiming a high-ranking member of the Public Prosecutor's Office could intensify interrogations, according to the New York Post. Riibe has reportedly refused to answer several key questions about the case after getting a lawyer. While the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, the law enforcement agency in Konanki's hometown in Virginia, also said Riibe is a person of interest, they added that he was not a suspect. Missing posters describe Konanki as 5 foot 3 with black hair and brown eyes. Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia previously told Fox News Digital that police want to “make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques.” “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police,” Julia added.</p>

But in 2025 the hero that has caught everyone's attention – and broken international box office records – is an animated demon child. Ne Zha 2 has also broken records globally: it is the highest-grossing animated film worldwide, surpassing Pixar's Inside Out 2. Yu said her local hairdresser was offering discounts to customers who came in with a receipt from seeing Ne Zha 2. “When things go viral … every city government will try to claim their involvement or say that they were part of the success story,” Yu said.

That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave. The Agency for Global Media is considered to be an arm of US diplomacy, running media organisations like Voice of America that transmits the country's domestic news to other countries, often translated into local languages. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump. Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week canceled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from various independent news organisations.</p>

"Nine civilians were killed and nine others were injured, most of them seriously," the Huthis' health and environment ministry said in a statement on their Saba news agency, reporting the strikes on Sanaa. The US Central Command (CENTCOM), which posted images of fighters taking off from an aircraft carrier and a bomb demolishing a building compound, said "precision strikes" were launched to "defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation". Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to "use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective", citing the Huthis' threats against Red Sea shipping. The US has launched several rounds of strikes on Houthi targets, some with British support.

President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, citing an alleged Venezuelan gang invasion, to fast-track mass deportations and tighten his immigration crackdown. Trump's declaration targets Tren de Aragua, claiming it operates under Venezuela's government. Trump had discussed using the act during his campaign, prompting immigration groups to prepare for it. This led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before his declaration was even made public. It warned that this could extend to actions like drone strikes, intelligence operations, or terrorist captures and extraditions.</p>

"This isn't the Bush administration," Trump's FTC chair Andrew Ferguson told a group of American CEOs on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., referring to one of the weakest US antitrust enforcement periods in modern history. But Trump is also showing he may take a lighter approach to AI as the US competes with China for world supremacy in that ascendant technology. In a March 7 filing, Trump's Justice Department argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up. Salib said Trump's motivation for going after companies like Meta (which owns Facebook) and Google is to curb censorship of conservative content. The order directed federal advisers in technology and national security to "enhance America's global AI dominance."</p>

A law passed in 1977 does require him to file an annual disclosure listing his income, assets, and debt. Since taking office, Trump has, in fact, delivered on some of his promises to the industry via two executive orders. Last month, the SEC put on hold a civil lawsuit against Binance and Zhao filed in June 2023, alleging securities violations.

TON's bullish reversal, especially after falling to $2.35, its lowest level in a year, has traders eyeing key price levels, with crypto analyst Crypto Patel highlighting a "great entry zone" for long-term investors. As Crypto Patel notes, TON's price has “perfectly bounced” from its support level of around $2.50. Toncoin's Sharpe ratio, a financial metric used to measure an asset's risk-adjusted returns, further indicates oversold conditions in the TON market. In the derivatives market, Toncoin is witnessing a resurgence in its open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled TON contracts such as options and futures. When funding rates turn negative as OI rises, it often reflects bearish sentiment with aggressive shorting.</p>

Toncoin's open interest spiked after reports emerged that Telegram founder Pavel Durov left France. Toncoin Open Interest (OI) has jumped 67% over the past 24 hours amid reports of Telegram founder Pavel Durov's departure from France, where he had been required to stay since his arrest seven months ago. Trading resource account Crypto Billion said in a March 15 X post that Toncoin is “showing signs of a potential long-term accumulation phase as it stabilizes near key support levels.” However, if this rally is short-lived, around $18.8 million in long positions could be liquidated if TON's price falls back toward the $3 level it was trading at on March 14. He was accused of running a platform that enables illicit transactions.</p>

Bitcoiners worldwide strongly disagreed with prominent angel investor Jason Calacanis' “build a better Bitcoin” comment, arguing that layer-2s can fill any functionality gaps. Founders and executives of Bitcoin-related companies were quick to push back, arguing that Bitcoin will not be replaced, though there's still room for a dominant layer-2 protocol to emerge on top of the Bitcoin network. Swan Bitcoin co-founder Brady Swenson said, “Winning protocols don't get replaced; they are built upon.” Echoing a similar sentiment, Lightspark CEO David Markus said, “What it lacks in functionality can be built on L2s.” Most people will end up with less Bitcoin by going to that casino,” Cole said.</p>

Helping other animals that are injured or sick has been observed in a number of species, including dolphins, elephants, and non-human primates, Sun explained. "These behaviors often include touching, grooming, nudging, and, in some cases, more intense physical actions such as striking. While these findings indicate that mice have an instinct to help others like humans do, the researchers can't be certain why they act in this way. "We do not exclude the possibility that the animal is simply driven by instinctive impulses to perform these actions — an instinct that may have evolved over time during evolution — rather than acting with a conscious intent to revive its partner," Sun said.

4 Gators have national title aspirations, may be met with new scrutiny as the spotlight of March Madness begins to shine. Various stalking incidents also included Golden showing up to locations where he knew the women would be. Two women spoke with The Alligator about Golden's behavior while choosing to remain anonymous. Attorney Karen Truszkowski, who represents a 21-year-old college student who did not attend the University of Florida, said that although the reported behavior might not fall under the definition of Title IX, there was "certainly evidence that there was questionable activity that occurred" while Golden was participating in a university event.

Again, these "wins" are actually losses for the Wizards at this point. But Washington's "lead" over the Pelicans, who own the fourth-worst record, is now just three losses with 16 games to play. They can still blow this if they keep winning games, but don't tell that to Poole, who certainly isn't in the business of missing shots on purpose. He's been turned into a punchline since Golden State traded him to Washington before last season, but he's actually been pretty damn good this season.

With fellow running back Christian McCaffrey (Achilles tendonitis) sidelined due to injury, Mason carried a larger load in the San Francisco backfield.

That includes when he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown against them in Week 2 last season. Meanwhile, Minnesota secures this depth piece with a relatively low cost over his two-year extension.

In this episode, Victoria's husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine. However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder. Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. “Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”</p>

The answer might not match your chronological age - and a new analysis finds that an organ's biological age might predict a person's risk of diseases such as cancer, dementia and heart disease. The research, published in the Lancet Digital Health, analyzed data from Whitehall II, a long-running British study of aging that has followed over 10,000 British adults for more than 35 years. Between 1997 and 1999, the Whitehall study took blood plasma samples from participants when they were 45 to 69 years old. Some of the associations linked faster aging organs to diseases in that organ; for example, those with accelerated lung aging were likelier to develop respiratory diseases during the 20-year follow-up period.

The comedy icons took plenty of light-hearted jabs at one another throughout their careers, but it turned serious when Rivers publicly criticized Lewis' charity work with MDA. Lewis and Martin repeatedly called for Crosby to come back so they could continue their planned routine, but the cohost flatly refused. Throughout their decades of association, Lewis and MDA were criticised by some for using a “pity approach” to generate donations. Disability activists – including a group calling itself Jerry's Orphans – complained about MDA's fundraising tactic, saying it took away the agency of people living with Muscular Dystrophy to depict them as pitiable.
