As Avalanche (AVAX) trades near $45, remaining a dominant force in DeFi due to its rapid transaction speeds, low fees, and highly scalable smart contracts, many investors are on the lookout for the next blockchain disruptor. Some market analysts now point to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a rising contender. In Phase 3 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already gained backing from over 5,700 investors and raised $3.4 million. Early participants can still purchase tokens at $0.02, anticipating potential gains up to $0.06 when the token lists. Avalanche (AVAX) established itself as a top DeFi platform by combining near-instant finality, low transaction costs, and highly efficient smart contract support. Currently hovering around $45, AVAX continues to draw interest from both developers and market participants in need of scalable blockchain infrastructure.

After a perfect start to its IMSA WeatherTech Championship season, the sweepstakes pot keeps growing for Porsche Penske Motorsport and the regular drivers of its No. Having swept the “36 hours of Florida” with victories in the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, the team and its two drivers have a chance to win endurance racing’s classic slam with a victory at Le Mans in June. Porsche and Penske will try to match Ford’s record of three victories on the trot in the 1966 and 1968 seasons, but Nasr and Tandy will vie to become the first drivers to win the three major endurance races in a single season. Tandy, co-driving with Nasr and Laurens Vanthoor at Sebring, has already joined nine other drivers who have won the three majors, including Americans Al Holbert and Hurley Haywood. He won Le Mans on board Porsche’s 919 hybrid in 2015 before being paired with Nasr for this year’s IMSA campaign. The career of Englishman Tandy, who signed on early with Porsche as a factory driver, has been a mixed bag. He has been in the right car for major endurance wins, which includes being paired with Nasr for the 2025 campaign when Porsche decided not to retain Dane Cameron. Engaging, sharp and affable, Tandy has won a lot of fans over the years. Tandy co-drove to victory at the Petit Le Mans in 2015 on board a factory Porsche 911 RSR, an improbable win over the DP prototypes due to the rear-engine car’s better handling in a day-long deluge. Coupled with the overall win at Sebring, where he already had two class wins, he has scored victories in six major endurance races. “What a dream it would be to win Sebring if we can. I think there was just one time we cycled through the back very early on when I was in the car. After that, we made our way to the front. Matt Campbell, Mathieu Jaminet and Keven Estre co-drove the No. 6 Porsche 963 to second after passing the Action Express entry on a pit stop. At Le Mans, Nasr and Tandy will drive a third entry alongside Porsche Penske’s two regular World Endurance Championship cars. Pascal Wehrlein is touted to be the third driver, replacing Vanthoor, who will rejoin his regular WEC team. Porsche Penske Motorsport received an automatic third entry from the Automobile Club de l’Ouest for winning last year’s WeatherTech Championship with the No 7 Porsche 963 co-driven by Nasr and Cameron. The “triple crown” was famously attempted by Ken Miles in 1966, a year when his co-driver Lloyd Ruby was not available for Le Mans due to an injury. After winning at Daytona and Sebring in 1996, it was a last-minute decision to go to Le Mans and the team suffered various issues with its Aurora V8-powered R&S Mk.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The Ethereum price prediction for 2025 has drawn a lot of interest, particularly after a trader who shorted Ethereum at $4,500 stated ETH is now poised to reach new price highs in 2025 on the back of growing ecosystem and growing institutional demand. Ethereum has lost 44% in Q1, under historic selling pressure as its market capitalization drops to 8.5%, the lowest level since 2020. However, rising staking engagement shows that long-term holders still see potential as they face massive selling over the past three months. Institutional adoption remains a key driver, with companies increasingly incorporating Ethereum-based products into their systems. As ETH further evolves, it sets a very high standard for other cryptocurrencies trying to match the same levels of adoption and utility.

Hodierne put 10 minutes of his film up on the Decentralized Pictures website for review, where a community of producers, writers, investors, and film buffs got a look at his sizzle reel. Users can stake them on their favorite projects, use them to pay others to review their own submissions (as a rewards pool), or simply purchase entry vouchers to pay for application fees for various creative financing rewards.” Soderbergh invested in the film, and Decentralized Pictures followed on with a grant, giving "Cold Wallet" enough money to make Hodierne’s movie. “What excites me most is that you can rent and buy it on-chain with crypto—it’s highly appropriate.” Coppola and others pointed out that just as important as community participation is the decentralized funding model that can support filmmakers, particularly those with distinctive voices and meaningful stories to tell, by allowing them to bypass industry hierarchies. “The term we've been using—DeFiFi, decentralized film finance—represents a shift in film funding,” Stacy Spikes, co-founder of movie subscription platform MoviePass said during an interview with Decrypt at ETH Denver. “Distribution companies will still be needed to push films into the marketplace, but until now, back-end participation wasn’t possible. Spikes likened the potential of decentralized filmmaking to past independent and genre film movements. “If you go with the community—particularly black and brown communities or genre films—Web3 is a great place to tap into,” Spikes said. “I feel that people who were hesitant to invest will now be more likely to do so because they know they'll get their money back.” “As a filmmaker, I’ve seen how centralized and fickle the industry is. This shift is a big deal, especially as streaming platforms pay artists less while struggling themselves,” he said. “It’s an exciting convergence for films, and for 'Cold Wallet,' a crypto thriller, this feels like the perfect first step in opening that door.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, with investors often witnessing sharp rises and drops in value across various tokens. Unlike Cardano’s focus on general scalability and smart contracts, Coldware is making waves with its real-world asset (RWA) tokenization model. By tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and high-value investments, Coldware allows investors to diversify their portfolios in ways that traditional cryptocurrencies cannot offer. The cryptocurrency community is now watching Coldware with great interest, especially as it continues to attract institutional investors looking for secure, high-growth opportunities. The Cardano network, though known for its rigorous academic approach and scalability, is currently experiencing price volatility that has left many investors in doubt. These struggles have prompted some major players in the crypto space to reconsider their positions. Recently, large investors, who once held millions in ADA, have shifted their focus toward new projects with more promising growth potential. The latest in this wave of investments is Coldware (COLD), a cryptocurrency rapidly gaining traction for its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets. Second, Coldware’s emphasis on scalability and low transaction costs ensures that it remains a viable option for large-scale applications. Coldware has positioned itself as a practical solution to the real-world limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies. As Coldware continues its rapid ascent, the Cardano community finds itself at a crossroads. Investors who once held Cardano as a promising long-term investment are now reconsidering their positions, seeking out newer, more dynamic projects like Coldware. However, despite these challenges, Cardano remains one of the top blockchain projects by market capitalization, and its focus on sustainability and security means it will continue to play a role in the broader crypto ecosystem. The outcome of Cardano’s internal debates, particularly around budget cuts and governance issues, will be critical in determining whether the project can regain its momentum and attract back investors who have started to look elsewhere. With its focus on tokenizing real-world assets and its ability to attract institutional investors, Coldware (COLD) is proving itself as a serious contender for the top spot in the crypto market.

Find Out: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle You don’t want to drive home with a high-priced, high-powered bundle of buyer’s remorse. GOBankingRates spoke with auto industry insiders who cautioned against buying the following sports cars because they cost too much, are unreliable, lack features or have comparable rivals that offer more for less. “The Maserati GranTurismo is a car that consumers should think twice about before purchasing,” she said. When things do go wrong, the repairs are very costly, too. Cars like this aren’t meant to have a bunch of miles on them, so you can run into expensive problems if you use them for everyday driving.” “The Evora boasts a raw driving experience, but it’s been criticized for reliability issues over the years,” said Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing for CFR Classic, which specializes in international car shipping and relocation. Earned or not, that reputation has followed its lineage to the F-Type. “The Jaguar F-Type is a beautiful car with a potent engine lineup, but it has been criticized for its reliability,” said 30-year auto industry veteran Frank De Mulder, founder of Classic Car Maintenance. “Some owners have reported electronic and powertrain issues, which can be costly to repair out of warranty.” Alfa Romeo discontinued the 4C in 2020; and, while it’s still a popular sports car with plenty of loyalists, De Mulder thinks they could do better. “The Alfa Romeo 4C is a pure driver’s car but comes with significant sacrifices in terms of comfort and convenience,” he said. “However, its performance doesn’t quite live up to its supercar looks, and for the price, there are several other options that offer better performance and a more engaging driving experience, such as the Acura NSX.” However, at least one industry veteran thinks the lineup has gotten stale. Like nearly all auto enthusiasts, May appreciates the power, beauty and performance of the Porsche Carrera GT, but he thinks its safety features are insufficient enough to disqualify it from your shortlist. I believe that with such a tight margin for error, even skilled drivers would find this car challenging.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The JDM car market is small, but it could be affected by potential U.S. tariffs. Those importing expensive collectibles such as the R34 Nissan GT-R could face tens of thousands in extra costs. Already, there are warehouses full of GT-Rs, lined up and just waiting for their build date to hit that 25-year mark. The special-edition versions are now easily six-figure cars, and slapping an extra 25 percent tariff on top of them is going to hurt. Also an issue is a possible spike in shipping costs. Japanese manufacturers of new cars are looking to fill up their U.S. supply of foreign manufactured cars before the tariffs go into effect, and that means cargo ships are full. On the flip side of this, if tariffs end up reducing demand for Japanese-built new cars, JDM imports might become less expensive. Currently, the tiny kei trucks you might see running around are already hit with a 25 percent tariff under the well-known “chicken tax” legislation. Generally, these are inexpensive little trucks, so the added cost isn't a particular issue. Things are further helped by a supply glut, as Japan stopped exporting used cars to Russia—a major market for its used cars—sometime around the start of the war in Ukraine. If the U.S. market for JDM cars dries up, many of them will instead end up in Australia and New Zealand, both of which are already a paradise for JDM cars. In the meantime, if you were saving up for your favorite Japanese-only model that you'd raced so many times in Gran Turismo, it'd be a good idea to put a little extra aside.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Piastri, once he realized that he could not go forward, reversed his way to the service road and drove to the pits with minimal damage.

He joked about this gained experience once the clouds of defeat began to clear. "I tried to go forwards and couldn’t," Piastri said. "Good thing I spent some time in the off-season trying to learn how to reverse a tractor on Jeremy Clarkson’s farm. I think it came in handy today."

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/best-electric-cars-buy-now-170123763.html'>The best electric cars to buy now – before higher taxation is applied</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 17:01:23 <p>
That’s because from 1 April, new taxation rules will render electric cars liable for car tax. Until now, EVs have been taxed at a zero rate, effectively making vehicle excise duty (VED) non-existent for electric car owners. The new rules mean EV owners will have to pay tax at the alternative fuel rate, currently £180 a year – and all new electric cars registered from 1 April onwards that cost £40,000 or more will incur the premium car surcharge, aka luxury tax. In an unusual move, that component of the revised VED rules is being applied retrospectively, so even electric cars that are already on UK roads will be hit, even if you buy before 1 April. But the premium car surcharge will only apply to new vehicles. So if you buy and register a £40,000-plus EV before April, it won’t be liable – saving you £2,050 over the first six years of ownership. Over the next few years, many second-hand buyers are likely to seek out nearly-new examples registered before the 1 April deadline, rather than have to stump up for the premium car surcharge – which may result in these pre-rule-change examples being worth slightly more, relatively speaking. So if you’re toying with the idea of buying one of these models, it makes sense to do so sooner rather than later. The Skoda Enyaq 85’s impressive size makes it a great option for families It suffers from the similarly underwhelming touchscreen software, but the Enyaq is quiet, comfortable and immensely spacious, making it an easy-going way of going electric. What you get is one of the smartest interiors, as well as one of the slickest touchscreens, in any electric car, along with slick handling and beautifully weighted controls. Model 3s are everywhere these days and with good reason; as a result of Tesla’s impressive charging infrastructure, few EVs make charging quite so easy or intuitive. The Model 3’s roomy, airy interior and immense performance only make it more appealing. Odd name, but if you’re after an electric saloon, the Seal is worth a look. Its four-door coupe profile means it’s more svelte than many EVs, and while the i4 isn’t quite as agile as most BMWs, it’s still good to drive.

$4 Million Pagani Huayra Roadster Backs Into Parked Volkswagen in Minor Mishap

A rare Pagani Huayra Roadster, valued at approximately $4 million, sustained minor damage after reversing into a parked Volkswagen Golf, as captured in a viral social media video.

The incident, which took place in an undisclosed location, shows the high-performance Italian supercar slowly backing up before making contact with the stationary VW, followed by an audible crunch. While details about the extent of the damage remain unclear, reports suggest that the vehicle is protected by paint protection film (PPF), likely minimizing any harm to the ultra-expensive carbon fiber bodywork.

Social media users quickly took notice, with many commenting on the irony of a multi-million-dollar hypercar colliding with a much more common and affordable hatchback. Some enthusiasts also pointed out that this particular Huayra Roadster is believed to be one of the highest-mileage examples in existence, an unusual feat for an exotic car that many owners keep as collectibles.

Under the hood, the Pagani Huayra Roadster is powered by a Mercedes-AMG 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine, producing 754 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The powertrain is paired with a seven-speed automated manual transmission, sending power exclusively to the rear wheels. The Roadster variant of the Huayra is a lighter, open-top version of the coupe, featuring intricate aerodynamics and an opulent handcrafted interior.

While the incident is unlikely to have caused any significant mechanical issues, it serves as a reminder that even the world’s most exclusive hypercars are not immune to everyday driving mishaps.

He pursued a master’s degree and gained expertise in venture capital, concentrating on enterprise AI startups before transitioning to a decentralized identity startup, where he developed privacy-preserving solutions. At Oasis, he merges strategic insight with technical knowledge to advocate for decentralized AI and confidential computing, educating the market on Oasis’ unique capabilities and fostering partnerships that empower developers.

MYCIN used a knowledge base of about 600 rules to identify bacteria causing infections and recommend antibiotics. Though it outperformed human experts in trials, MYCIN was never used in clinical practice - partly due to ethical and legal concerns around machine-led diagnosis. Today, modern AI can teach itself to spot diseases in medical imaging just as well as a human clinician, and without lots of training data. A Harvard study on AI-assisted cancer diagnosis has shown an accuracy of 96%. In the UK, an AI system detected 11 signs of breast cancer that were missed by human clinicians. As an example, the National Health Service in the UK — Europe's largest employer—together has access to a body of over 65 million patients' worth of digitized data—valued at over £9.6 billion a year ($12.3 billion). These systems can analyze not just medical imaging, but also genomic data, electronic health records, clinical notes, and more — spotting correlations and risk factors that might escape experienced human clinicians. Some people might feel more comfortable with an AI agent handling their healthcare data than a human not directly involved in their care. AI models built outside of trusted healthcare institutions pose new risks. While hospitals may already protect patient data, trusting external AI systems requires more robust privacy protections to prevent misuse and to ensure data stays secure. It’s worth noting that potential comes with significant privacy and ethical concerns. Healthcare data is perhaps the most sensitive personal information that exists. There are valid fears that widespread adoption of AI in healthcare could lead to privacy violations, data breaches, or misuse of intimate personal information. Advanced AI models have shown an alarming ability to de-anonymize protected datasets by cross-referencing with other information. They represent real barriers to the adoption of AI in healthcare, potentially holding back life-saving innovations. Patients may be reluctant to share data if they don't trust the privacy safeguards. Fortunately, a new wave of privacy-preserving AI development is emerging to address these challenges. This means hospitals and research institutions can collaborate on AI development without directly sharing patient data. Privacy-preserving technologies are still in their early stages, but they all point towards a future where we can harness the full power of AI in healthcare without sacrificing patient privacy. We should be aiming for a world where AI can analyze your full medical history, genetic profile, and even real-time health data from wearable devices, while keeping this sensitive information encrypted and secure. This would allow for highly personalized health insights without any single entity having access to raw patient data. This vision of privacy-preserving AI in healthcare isn't just about protecting individual rights—though that's certainly important. It could also help address healthcare disparities by allowing for the development of AI models that are trained on diverse, representative datasets without compromising individual privacy. As AI models get more advanced, and AI-driven diagnoses get quicker and more accurate, the instinct to use them will become impossible to ignore. The important thing is that we teach them to keep their secrets.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/2007-subaru-wrx-sti-limited-150000507.html'>2007 Subaru WRX STI Limited, Understated Rally Hero on Bring a Trailer</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 15:00:00 <p>
Here's an STI from the era when it was a performance bargain. Modifications are minimal, which is rare for a WRX. As a Limited trim and finished in silver, it's more subtle than the typical STI. A little over 300 horsepower from a slightly laggy 2.5-liter boxer-four that returns 20 mpg was outdated by the dawn of the 2020s. This 2007 STI Limited, up for sale on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of Hearst Autos), is one of 800 sold in the U.S. in that year. Back then, this practical four-door Subaru sedan could go toe to toe with a V-8 Mustang in a straight line, then tear up a snowy day sideways, making its driver feel like Colin McRae. Unfortunately, many of these cars eventually passed to less careful hands and were modified by plenty of would-be Ken Blocks who gymkhana'd their cars into the nearest curb. With 40K miles on the odometer, it has only a couple of changes from showroom stock, and those are from Subaru's in-house Subaru Performance Team. This car's cat-back exhaust and air intake were dealer-installed accessories that wouldn't have violated the warranty when new. Getting that power to the ground in slippery conditions are limited slip front and rear differentials, with a driver-selectable central differential shunting things front to rear. This 2007 STI offers a much rawer driving experience. It's what you want your Subaru rally hero to be like. Being a Limited, there are some pleasant options such as heated leather seats and automatic climate control, but the appeal here is the originality more than luxury. The Limited is also perhaps the most reserved STI variant of its day, with a discreet rear lip spoiler and modest 17-inch wheels. Don't let the subtle looks fool you; it's still a rally hooligan at heart. Even if Subaru starts building the STI again, it's not going to be able to make them like this anymore.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Read the full story on Modern Car Collector Pagani Utopia Damaged by Bystander on Delivery Day A supercar owner’s dream delivery day took an unexpected turn when his brand-new Pagani Utopia suffered damage during a celebratory event. Known for generously sharing his supercar collection with enthusiasts, the owner had invited fans to witness the unveiling. The car’s striking teal green finish and silver wheels caught everyone’s attention, but the lack of a paint protection film (PPF) made the vehicle more susceptible to damage. Experts have noted that the scratches appear minor and should be repairable with a simple polish. The Pagani Utopia is a masterpiece of engineering and design. Beneath the hood, the hypercar boasts a 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 engine, delivering an astounding 864 horsepower at 6000 rpm and 811 lb-ft of torque between 2800 and 5900 rpm. Buyers have the choice of a 7-speed automated manual transmission or a traditional manual gearbox, complete with three pedals for purists. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting such rare and valuable vehicles, even during celebratory moments.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

What Should You Do if Your Child Pukes in the Car? Luckily, I had a roll of paper towels and bags in the backseat with us to clean up and catch anything left over. This allowed us to better assess the situation and clean a bit more until we got home, where we could do a more thorough cleaning. Read: How To Prevent Car Sickness So Everyone Enjoys The Trip If you find yourself in a similar situation while on the road, it’s important to act quickly. Read: How to Clean Your Car Like a Pro Keep disposable plastic bags, paper towels, baby wipes and hand sanitizer in the car. If your kids are prone to car sickness, you may want to keep ginger candy, bottled water and Dramamine in the car, too. When sickness occurs, use paper towels to clean up any chunks. Read: Spring Cleaning: Have You Cleaned Your Car Lately? How to Clean Puke Out of a Car’s Carpets When preparing to clean vomit out of your car, lay down newspaper or an old sheet beneath the area where you’ll be working. Use damp towels or rags soaked in soap mixed with warm water to clean off all surfaces thoroughly. And then allow the mats to air dry completely. Once everything is clean and dry, use an odor-eliminating spray throughout the car’s interior to get rid of any lingering smells. What Types of Cleaners are Best for Removing Puke Odors? Enzyme cleaners contain powerful, natural enzymes that seek out organic matter and break it down. Unlike bleach or strong chemical solutions, enzyme cleaners are safe to use around children and pets. Enzyme cleaners will even loosen long-set stains from hard-to-reach places like carpets, cracks in car upholstery, floor mats, etc. To get puke, or other substances, out of the headliner, use a foam cleaner for fabrics. Laundry detergent is good for removing liquid messes from car carpets, mats, and other fabrics. While diluted bleach (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) is highly effective, this should only be used as a last resort when other methods fail because it can stain fabrics and cause skin irritation. All it takes is a simple spray on the affected area. Biokleen Bac-Out – It is formulated with natural, live enzymes and essential oils to quickly break down organic compounds such as vomit and other stains. Nature’s Miracle – Nature’s Miracle produces a variety of enzymatic cleaners designed to safely and effectively remove pet messes from carpets, fabrics, and upholstery. Even if you don’t see any puke in your kid’s car seat, it’s a good idea to clean it out thoroughly after a puking incident. Last, this is a good opportunity to clean your car’s seat, too; chances are if there was any spray or spillage, it made its way into those tight crevices. Kids getting sick in the car can be unpleasant for everyone. It’s all the better if you can avoid having to clean puke out of your car. Be sure to keep an eye out for signs of nausea or discomfort such as dizziness and sweating. Moving items like plastic bags and wipes within the child’s reach can help them to react quickly. And giving them bland food before you get on the road will help ward off sickness, too. Having to clean puke out of a car and getting rid of the smell may seem impossible, but when done right, no one will ever be the wiser. And those puke-filled road trips will just be another amusing memory to chat about with your kids when they’re grown and dealing with their own little puke-machines in the car.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Check Out: 5 New SUVs the Middle Class Should Consider Buying in 2025 For You: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle According to Statista, the SUV market in the U.S. is projected to reach $333 billion this year, but with so many models available, there are some worth every penny and some that should be avoided at all costs. Regarding SUVs you shouldn’t buy, GOBankingRates asked auto expert Chris Pyle, who operates as a full-time virtual mechanic at JustAnswer, and Mike Winter, long-time owner of MDP Diesel & Auto Repair in Jackson, Michigan, and here’s what they had to say about several SUVs/groups of SUVs that aren’t worth buying. Land Rover’s luxury SUVs get a bad rep when it comes to value for money and reliability. Pyle picked on a Land Rover too, but for him, it’s the Discovery that should be avoided.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-milady-edgy-ethereum-nft-community'>What is Milady? The Edgy Ethereum NFT Community With Vitalik Buterin’s Support</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 14:00:03 <p>
Originating as an NFT community, Milady and its surrounding ecosystem has become one of the most culturally significant groups in Ethereum and crypto as a whole. Known for its edgy humor, layers of irony, and cult-like mentality, the Milady community has defied many attempts to decipher what on earth is going on in its self-referential world. At its most broad, the community spans multiple NFT collections, meme coins, global raves, a Minecraft server, and long philosophical texts. While at its core Milady is a profile picture NFT project, the Milady ethos rejects much of what is to be expected of this sector. For starters, to be a Milady you don’t have to buy an NFT—just change your profile picture on X (formerly known as Twitter), sparking the meme that simply changing your profile picture to a Milady will change your life. On top of this, there is a Milady Minecraft game server—called Miladycraft—which acts as a social hub for its community members as well as a thoughtful art piece on the state of modern gaming and society. This was done through spamming “Don’t worry about it” to anyone that asked what was happening, followed by a stream of deep-fried AI-generated memes. He argues that there will soon be a time where every person with a notable following will have been canceled in some way, leading to the canceled taking over culture. As such, Fang argues the case for "pre-canceling" yourself, for example, by intentionally saying slurs—he believes this is “punk.” This may explain some of the controversial things that Fang and Milady members have said online. 0xngmi alleges that under the Miya pseudonym, Fang was posting racist and homophobic content, as well as having inappropriate relationships with minors suffering from eating disorders. Essays from miya's old blog, discussing a voting ban for black people, homosexuality as a disease, killing jewish people and women as something to be "tamed" pic.twitter.com/iMGHGCW8iD — 0xngmi (@0xngmi) May 23, 2022 At first, Fang tried to distance himself from Miya, but eventually caved in and admitted his involvement. In an X post, he said that his real views “hold no room for hate” and that he detests abusers and groomers. With this, Fang and the other Miya contributors had a “taste for engaging in problematic content” exploring fringe ideologies until their “logical conclusions as a form of critical satire." Thought trying to distance myself would help but not gonna keep pussyfooting around it. Unequivocally, my real views hold no room for hate, and I detest abusers & groomers—trolling about it was juvenile, but in reality I’ve never harmed a fly. Miya has now become another pillar of the Milady lore, with cult members embracing the controversy and impact rather than ignoring its relevance. “Woke censorship had its run and made for dreadful culture through the late 2010s, but the undercurrent of revolutionary irreverence will always be cooler than normalizing counter-pressure,” Fang wrote in a blog post almost a year later. “Consider how the first thought anyone who hears about Miya being a LITERAL NAZI ANOREXIA CULT LEADER is: Cool.” In 2023, Tesla founder Elon Musk posted a Milady meme, causing its price to spike. Then in 2025, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin donned a Milady profile picture in what many believed was a vibe shift as he entered “wartime mode.” Milady is confusing, controversial, and bizarre—but it’s not something you can ignore.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/tested-2025-mercedes-amg-s63-140000786.html'>Tested: 2025 Mercedes-AMG S63 E Performance Is Always Fully Loaded</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 14:00:00 <p>
Spend some time in one of America's high-rent districts, and you'll see plenty of Mercedes vehicles sporting AMG badges. Their presence is symptomatic of well-heeled shoppers reflexively buying "loaded" vehicles even when the expensive performance features offer no benefit to their driving lives. In this full-size sedan's case, that starts with 791 total horsepower thanks to a 603-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 paired with a nine-speed automatic, plus a 188-hp electric motor coupled to the rear axle through its own two-speed gearbox. Total system torque is a massive 1055 pound-feet sent to all four wheels. This is enough thrust to hurl the 5877-pound, 210.1-inch-long sedan to 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and through the quarter-mile in 10.8 seconds at 129 mph. The only way to get a big sedan capable of greater thrust is with a high-end Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan, or Tesla Model S. While those EVs as well as the S63 must be in their highest performance modes to deliver maximum acceleration, the EVs are notably more responsive in their lesser modes. That's because when the S63 is in Comfort mode, its V-8 turns off at a stop. That works fine in gentle driving, but if you demand more acceleration, the gas engine has to fire up and build boost before the car surges vigorously. And there's plenty of electric assist from the 10.4-kWh battery, which is large enough to motivate the S63 by electrons alone, albeit only for an EPA-estimated 16 miles. The steering is nicely weighted and provides sharp directional responses. Brake feel is also decent, though pedal effort could be higher. It is an S-class, after all, although you feel and hear tar strips and pavement slabs more than in its less aggressive brethren. Befitting an S-class, the cabin is large and sumptuous. The front seats are supremely comfortable—once we disabled the active inflatable side bolsters that irritatingly pressed into our ribs at every hint of a corner. The cavernous rear compartment is elaborately tailored and in our S63 had options totaling $11,000. These included highly adjustable individual rear seats with separate video screens, climate controls, and foldout trays. The right one even has a power-folding leg rest. A private jet could do worse than these seats. And it's also slightly mismatched with only 11 cubic feet of cargo space. This S63 E Performance's $187,350 starting price inflated to $229,400 with options.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The big Benz doesn't look like it would be all that quick, especially wearing a gold paint job that prompted me to dub the car "Champagne Supernova" on the sign-in tech sheet. (Mercedes calls the hue Kalahari gold metallic, a $1750 option.) The S-class doesn't look like it has 791 horsepower and 1055 pound-feet of torque, but there's a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 at the front making 603 horsepower, and there's an electric motor out back contributing another 188 hp. It's like a mullet on both sides of your head: party in the front, party in the back. The electric motor is hooked to its own two-speed transmission and can generate its peak 188 horsepower for 10-second stints, after which it drops to 94. And 10 seconds, by my seat-of-the-pants reckoning, ought to be just about long enough to see the S63 down the quarter-mile. It feels like a 10-second car off the line. I've only run one official 10-second quarter-mile, in a Hennessey Hammer Wagon at Darlington. I almost certainly ran one there in the McLaren 765LT too, but the timing equipment malfunctioned on my first run and then traction went away after that. (It's close, really—Elana Scherr tells me the drag-race term for this is a "paper-slipper," because you could slide a piece of paper under the front end at launch.) On my first few runs, I can't seem to get launch control going, but the Benz still cracks off runs in the 11.3-second range at 126 mph. That is no joke, but not quite what I'm looking for. At that point, the V-8 chatters at just below 4000 rpm, and when you pop your foot off the brake, you're on your way to what is surely a sub-3.0-second sprint to 60 mph. After another run, a guy calls out, "Is that an AMG?" This is just how they build them now. And I sneak into the 11.1 range—11.19 seconds at 125 mph—but that's all it's got. Which, make no mistake, is crazy quick, especially for a car that can do that sort of thing while giving you a hot stone massage and wafting its own signature fragrance from the HVAC vents. It's stately and menacing all at once, like Nicole Kidman in The Perfect Couple. A guy in a Jeep Trackhawk challenged me to a run but later decided he wanted to line up against the F-150, so we don't know how that would have turned out, but I suspect my perfect record would've been shattered. The Jeep owner was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with a photo of the Trackhawk, and I asked him, "Am I about to learn not to run against someone who has a picture of their car on their sweatshirt?" This happened consistently, at the same place every run, making me wonder if the car thought there was a traction problem or some reason to moderate thrust and then suddenly restore it. As Benz's tech material says, "An electric actuator engages second gear by approximately 87 mph, which corresponds to the electric motor's maximum speed of around 13,500 rpm." If I may make a suggestion, perhaps we could tinker with the gear ratios to either extend that shift to, say, 130 mph, or do it sooner, before the electric motor runs out of revs. Because I want to break into the 10s again, and I’ve got a feeling that ol' Champagne Supernova here can do it.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-accused-gaming-canada-ev-140000306.html'>Tesla Accused of Gaming Canada’s EV Rebate Program</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 14:00:00 <p>
The program was so popular that it was set to shut down early, and many car dealerships are claiming Tesla pulled a possibly illegal stunt to take most of the program’s remaining funds, which shut the program down even earlier. If true, it means Tesla created an unfair advantage to take over half of the CAD 71 million left in the program, leaving many car dealerships unable to get rebates they otherwise would have. Since each EV sold earned a $5,000 rebate while the program was active, this resulted in over CAD 43.1 million headed Tesla’s way. Mathematically, this means Tesla would have been selling 120 cars per hour—yes, two Teslas sold every minute—across all four dealerships, including the hours those Tesla dealerships were closed. That’s two Teslas sold every minute, 24 hours a day, for three straight days. CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort Hotel And Convention Center on February 20, 2025 in Oxon Hill, Maryland. Rebate applications must be filled out before the car is delivered. Car dealers were selling EVs with the understanding that the program would come to a close early, but they were also under the belief that other dealerships were acting in good faith and selling cars normally—not two vehicles per minute, 24 hours a day. Essentially, car dealerships knew funds wouldn’t last as long as they’d expected, and with Tesla requesting so many rebates in such a short time, other dealerships could not successfully apply for rebates. It’s believed car dealerships across Canada are out CAD 10 million or more. The National Post claims Tesla sales plummeted 70 percent from December 2024 to January 2025. If Tesla is being honest, its sales hockey-sticked (pun intended, Canada) at precisely the right time.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/rivian-chase-throw-fisker-owners-130000385.html'>Rivian and Chase Throw Fisker Owners a Lifeline with Advantageous Buyback Plan</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 13:00:00 <p>
The appeal centers around Rivian’s ability to offer higher average buyback and trade-in values than the open market following electric vehicle (EV) maker Fisker’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in June 2024. Hagens Berman’s notice reads: “These offers will provide three different options: 1) you may sell your vehicle to Rivian for a fixed price; 2) you may trade in your vehicle to Rivian for the same price and receive incentives for the purchase or lease of a Rivian vehicle; or 3) if your vehicle is inoperable or “bricked,” and cannot be repaired, Chase will purchase your vehicle from you at a fixed price. Several Ocean owners are likely breathing a sigh of relief knowing they can use the offer to help pay off their balance for a vehicle that may not even work. Commonly reported issues with the Ocean include software bugs, inconsistent regenerative braking, and broken key fobs. The R1T and R1S are Rivian’s only two available models. Like Fisker, Rivian is an EV startup, but it has scored more prominent investments than Fisker, such as Amazon, Cox Automotive, and the Volkswagen Group. In essence, Rivian is working to position itself as a more reliable alternative to Fisker and is also releasing more affordable next-generation models relatively soon, including its R2 mid-size SUV and entry-level R3. Rivian and Chase’s lifeline helps Fisker owners mitigate some, but not all, of the pain associated with spending a lot on a highly problematic SUV made by a manufacturer that has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Even if a Fisker Finance customer places money from a sale toward their Ocean’s balance, the entire vehicle might still not be paid off despite receiving higher average amounts than the open market. However, Rivian will likely score new fans with their new buyback and trade-in scheme, and support from Fisker Ocean purchasers could prove valuable as Rivian aims to accomplish the nearly impossible task of succeeding as an EV startup.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Following Fortnite’s social media video about Big Dill's crypto shenanigans, the Solana meme coin skyrocketed 4,300% to a market cap of $4.72 million.

While Sega has said that it is willing to license its IPs to explore the crypto gaming industry, it also said that its bigger franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog are not up for grabs until this experimental phase is over.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/crypto-whales-accumulate-dogecoin-cardano-and-mutuum-finance-ahead-of-the-next-trump-market-rally/'>Crypto Whales Accumulate Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance Ahead of the Next ‘Trump Market Rally’</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 08:00:47 <p>
With anticipation building for a possible “Trump market rally,” major crypto holders—often called whales—are making strategic moves by accumulating Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While Dogecoin sits near $0.17 and Cardano hovers around $0.70, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction in DeFi. Since its initial offering, Mutuum Finance has gathered $3.4 million from more than 5,700 holders, and some analysts project an eventual climb to $3 post-launch—making MUTM a potentially game-changing DeFi asset. Here’s why whales are loading up on it before the rally hits. In the P2C model, stablecoins (such as USDT) are deposited into lending pools, facilitating ETH-backed loans managed by smart contracts. Meanwhile, the P2P component eliminates intermediaries, giving users complete autonomy over their loan agreements. This approach offers robust security, flexibility, and yields of up to 10% for liquidity providers. Staking rewards provide further incentives for users to lock in their tokens, increasing both liquidity and investor trust. Moreover, a referral incentive program rewards users who invite new participants, helping expand the community and increasing platform liquidity. As crypto whales prepare for a potential Trump market rally, they are stacking up on Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). So far, MUTM has drawn over 5,700 investors and $3.4 million in Phase 3 at $0.02, with a 25% price bump on the horizon. Backed by a dual-lending system, staking features, and an upcoming stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is making waves in the DeFi space.

With its institutional partnerships and focus on changing global payment systems, XRP has the fundamentals that could culminate in strong price appreciation. However, despite its potential, major investors are beginning to shift their focus elsewhere. While XRP may still deliver gains, a new opportunity in the crypto space is capturing the attention of those looking for bigger and faster returns. Why Big Investors Are Looking Beyond XRP: The Success of Rexas Finance’s Presale Even though this use case is compelling, XRP has struggled with price appreciation relative to other rapidly appreciating assets in the crypto market. The tokenization of assets coupled with DeFi is making more users look at projects like Rexas Finance, which claims to provide an easier and more scalable investment narrative. One primary factor that has most investors shifting their capital from XRP to Rexas Finance is its distinctive strategy when it comes to asset tokenization. While XRP’s focus is primarily on banking-related problem solving, RXS is leading the way in the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, art, and other commodities. Moreover, Rexas Finance claims to have a tokenomics model carefully crafted for protracted value capture. This effective distribution guarantees strong market stability after launch and motivates value capture from early participants. Due to the increasing migration of conventional assets onto blockchains, RXS is set to benefit from these changes, making RXS more appealing than ageing assets like XRP. A prominent factor influencing why investors are choosing to move away from XRP and towards RXS is time. Although XRP can still hit $10 in the long run, its near-term performance has been quite dull, largely due to continuous market hesitation and regulatory doubts. This is great for investors looking to get in early and ride the wave of value increase at launch. Tax regulations and XRP’s fluctuating rate of growth inevitably led many investors to seek profit elsewhere. Nonetheless, Rexas Finance and its groundbreaking asset tokenization have come through. On June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance will go public, and its final presale stage offers retail investors some beneficial price appreciation opportunities.

Investors who previously championed Ethereum (ETH)—currently trading near $1,881—and Chainlink (LINK)—around $13—are increasingly turning their attention to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Since the token is expected to list at $0.06, Phase 3 participants could see a 200% return on their initial stake. Further underscoring its credibility, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a CertiK smart contract audit, with results set to be published on the project’s official social channels upon completion. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding a wave of investor enthusiasm, thanks in part to its accessible DeFi lending framework. By buying tokens from the open market and distributing them to stakers at regular intervals, the protocol maintains consistent demand—no small feat in a crypto market often driven by speculation. At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s platform is mtToken technology, which accommodates ETH, DAI, and other assets. Depositors receive interest-bearing tokens, earning yields in real time while retaining full control of their capital. This approach maintains stability in the system by effectively managing loan-to-collateral ratios. Mutuum Finance commits to a vision of long-term operational stability—one that resonates with investors searching for enduring value. With the presale quickly moving toward its next price milestone, the chance to buy MUTM at $0.02 may soon pass, particularly as market observers anticipate ongoing price increases. With DeFi adoption on the rise, MUTM offers an appealing route away from traditional lending.

The crypto market is buzzing as Solana (SOL) records a notable 28% increase in trading volume within 24 hours. This surge is a sign of growing momentum, reflecting heightened activity around emerging blockchain projects and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. However, while Solana’s short-term gains are worth noting, the crypto ecosystem thrives on innovation and forward-thinking projects. Enter BinoFi (BINO), a rising star that could not only compete with but also reshape the market as we know it. Here’s why experts believe this platform could redefine crypto investing in 2025 and beyond. Yet, even with Solana’s impressive track record, the crypto market is evolving. Industry players are demanding solutions that not only support individual blockchains but unite the fragmented crypto ecosystem under a single, intuitive umbrella. It’s a platform designed to solve the crypto trading challenges that even high-performing ecosystems like Solana face. While many platforms operate either as CEXs or DEXs, BinoFi combines both under one roof. Users can seamlessly trade assets across chains like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more without intermediaries. The crypto market is volatile, and staying ahead requires cutting-edge tools. BinoFi introduces AI-powered trading bots that analyze risks, automate strategies, and provide advanced market insights. These tools democratize access to technology once reserved for institutional players. Security is a critical concern for crypto traders, but many shy away from non-custodial setups due to their complexity. BinoFi’s MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallets offer the best of both worlds. Traders maintain control of their assets without needing to manage sensitive keys, all while enjoying features like gasless transactions and simple recovery processes. Unlike traditional crypto platforms, BinoFi offers complete on-chain proof-of-reserves so users can trust the liquidity backing their trades. Solana’s rising trading volume reignites optimism about blockchain innovation, but the future belongs to platforms like BinoFi. By combining cutting-edge features with user-focused design, it takes crypto trading into uncharted territory. As the crypto market becomes increasingly interconnected and competitive, forward-looking investors are turning to projects with the potential to scale and redefine how assets are traded. Whether it’s cross-chain trading, AI-driven tools, or a transparent ecosystem, BinoFi is delivering what the market has been waiting for.
