 Analysts split opinions on Bitcoin's next price move, but technical charts look promising for BNB, TON, GT and ATOM. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to break above the 200-day simple moving average ($84,000), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin needs to achieve a weekly close above $81,000 to signal resilience. Selling could accelerate if the price plummets below $76,000.

Another cautious voice was that of Markus Thielen, head crypto researcher at 10x Research. Thielen told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin's chart structure “suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation.” Thielen remains doubtful of a strong price recovery in Bitcoin at the current juncture.

However, Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson has a different view. In an X post, Peterson said that April and October are the two months that generate a large portion of Bitcoin's annual performance. That suggests Bitcoin could rise to a “new all-time high before June.”

Could buyers drive Bitcoin above the short-term overhead resistance levels? If they do, what other top cryptocurrencies may rally in the near term?

The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($86,188) suggests that bears are in command, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates that the selling pressure is reducing.

If the price turns down from the current level, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $80,000 and then to $76,606. 

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the markets have rejected the breakdown below the 200-day SMA. The pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($93,033) and, after that, to $100,000. Buyers may find it difficult to surpass the psychological barrier at $100,000.

The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to drive the pair above the resistance line to gain the upper hand. The pair may climb to $92,810 and then to $95,000.

The downside support is at $80,000 and next at $78,000. If the supports crack, the possibility of a drop below $76,606 increases. 

BNB (BNB) started a recovery from $507 on March 11, which is facing selling at the 50-day SMA ($621).

The 20-day EMA ($595) is the critical near-term support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are buying on minor dips. That improves the prospects of a break above the 50-day SMA. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally toward $686.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bears are fiercely defending the 50-day SMA. The pair may tumble to $550.

The 20-EMA has turned up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating a bullish sentiment. There is resistance at $632, but if buyers overcome it, the pair could jump to $680.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. The pair may dip to the 50-SMA, which is again likely to attract buyers. A break below the 50-SMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

Toncoin (TON) rose sharply from $2.35 on March 11 and reached the 50-day SMA ($3.64) on March 16.

The correction from the 50-day SMA is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($3.15). If that happens, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the possibility of a rally above the 50-day SMA. The TON/USDT pair could climb to $4 and later to $5.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then drop toward $2.50.

The 4-hour chart shows the up move is facing selling at the $3.60 level, but buyers are expected to defend the 20-EMA on declines. If the price turns up sharply from the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the price above $4.15. If they manage to do that, the pair could jump toward $4.67.

Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may drop to the 50-SMA and subsequently to $2.50.

Gate Token (GT) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.

GT/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($21.06) is flattening out, and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers drive the price above the triangle, it will signal the resumption of the upmove. The GT/USDT pair could climb to $24 and eventually to $26.

If the price continues lower and closes below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the triangle for a while. The bears will be back in command on a break below the triangle.

GT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are finding it difficult to maintain the price below the 20-EMA. That suggests demand at lower levels. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they do that, the pair could rally toward $24.

Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will signal that the bullish momentum is weakening. The pair may descend to $19 and eventually to the support line.

Cosmos (ATOM) broke above the 20-day EMA ($4.31) on March 15, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The RSI has formed a positive divergence, suggesting that the bearish momentum is weakening. The 50-day SMA ($4.73) could act as resistance but is likely to be crossed. A close above $5.15 could open the doors for a rally to $6.50.

The 20-day EMA is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. If this support gives way, it will signal that the bears remain sellers on rallies. That could sink the ATOM/USDT pair to $3.50. 

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The pair started a pullback in the near term, which could reach the 20-EMA. If the price turns up from the 20-EMA, it will signal a positive sentiment where the bulls are buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a break above $5.15. If that happens, the pair may surge to $5.50 and then to $6.50.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-SMA and later to $3.80.

Key Takeaways:

On March 13th, the State Senate unanimously passed House Bill 701 (HB 701), positioning Kentucky to lead the nation on cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Dubbed the Bill of Rights for Bitcoiners, this landmark piece of legislation is formally titled An Act relating to blockchain digital assets and its focus is on (1) securing an individual's right to self-custody of Bitcoin and (2) implementing fair regulations for digital asset mining operations in the state. The stunning unanimous vote, 37-0, was a strong, bipartisan endorsement of the burgeoning crypto industry and its promise.



HB 701 originated in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where it also received unanimous approval and passed by a 91-0 vote on February 28, 2025. The bill's seamless passage through both legislative chambers reflects the recognition among Kentucky lawmakers that embracing digital asset technologies and the related innovation underpinning them is critical for the state.

Sponsored by Representatives Adam Bowling and T.J. Roberts, HB 701 addresses key concerns of both individual Bitcoin users and businesses operating in the digital asset space:

Self-Custody Guaranteed: The proposal guarantees the right of individuals to utilize and hold their digital assets in self-hosted wallets, giving them ultimate custody of their crypto. Adam said this measure is critical to protect people's financial freedom and prevent government overreach into Bitcoin. This is a victory for Bitcoin supporters who have faith in decentralization and independence.

Mining-Friendly Zoning Ordinances: The most important provision of HB 701 is its prohibition of discriminatory zoning laws targeting the digital asset mining industry. Specifically, the legislation will prohibit governments from imposing zoning changes intended to block or destroy Bitcoin mining activities. This ensures that miners in Kentucky will not face unfair regulatory targeting, Representative T.J. Roberts stated.

Exclusion From Money Transmitter Licensing: In Kentucky, home-based Bitcoin miners and digital asset mining companies are excluded from the requirements of Kentucky's money transmitter law. This eliminates regulatory obstacles and encourages innovation to be a destination in mining.

As HB 701 was up for debate in the Kentucky Senate, Bitcoin experienced a significant recovery from a recent slump to reach $85,301 after dipping to $77,000. This bounce paralleled a wider recovery across the cryptocurrency market as altcoins including Solana, Chainlink and XRP also enjoyed a price rise.

The passage of HB 701 through Kentucky's legislature—despite the volatility of the crypto market—underscores its commitment to fostering a long-term sustainable ecosystem for digital assets in the state. Lawmakers seem to be recognizing that Bitcoin's technology and broader implications go far beyond mere price speculation.

HB 701 in Kentucky could provide a model for enacting similar reconciliation measures in other states as they seek to applicability of rules in the often fuzzy world of crypto. Kentucky is building a more attractive ecosystem for innovation and investment through establishing clear legal frameworks for both Bitcoin self-custody and mining activities.

Most other states are still figuring out how to best regulate cryptocurrencies, and some have been more cautious or even restrictive. The recent assertiveness announced by Kentucky may motivate other states to implement similar progressive policies, creating a more cohesive and supportive regulatory environment for the digital asset industry as a whole.

CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange James Davies noted that the recent crypto recovery seemed connected to macro factors. This indicates that external factors also play a significant role in crypto adoption.

The last step in the journey for HB 701 is the Governor's signature. Once the bill is signed into law by the Governor, it will officially cement Kentucky as one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the country. This sends a strong signal to the cryptocurrency industry and could bring another influx of businesses and investors in the state.

Kentucky is poised to become a financial hub due to its proactive regulatory approach and commitment to innovation. The passage of HB 701 is a pivotal step toward that vision.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against other best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now.

Cryptocurrency stocks are on the move in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump announcing plans for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” The possibility of a cryptocurrency reserve is a significant step toward Trump's goal of making the United States the global center of cryptocurrency.

The United States already possesses several strategic stockpiles, such as medical and military assets. In times of need, the government draws from these unique reserves. To keep the Federal Reserve afloat, the government would probably be actively purchasing and disposing of cryptocurrencies as part of the strategic reserve push.

“This move signals a shift toward active participation in the crypto economy by the U.S. government,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, a digital assets investment management firm. “It has the potential to accelerate institutional adoption, provide greater regulatory clarity, and strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in digital asset innovation.”

Additionally, some Bitcoin holders think that a cryptocurrency reserve may act as an inflation hedge. They contend that at times of global economic crisis, the value of Bitcoin may surpass that of the dollar, citing the currency's declining worth over time. However, cryptocurrencies have shown to be highly volatile during recent geopolitical events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, some experts believe that the US government purchasing Bitcoin could endanger the dollar's standing internationally.

Critics contend that cryptocurrency is a speculative investment and has historically been volatile, while proponents claim that the proceeds may be used to pay down the country's massive debt. Approximately 200,000 Bitcoin tokens are thought to be held in the United States due to illegal seizures. The total value of that exceeds $17 billion. With a reserve, these holdings might be expanded to include three lesser-known cryptocurrencies, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, in addition to Ethereum.

Amid the “crypto strategic reserve” push, cryptocurrency stocks' popularity is growing as investors explore ways of diversifying their investment portfolio beyond traditional asset classes. The stocks stand out partly because they offer crypto exposure without requiring one to own the underlying volatile crypto asset. Additionally, the stocks provide both growth potential and innovation. Many experts regard them as being safer than direct cryptocurrency investments.

To determine the 13 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now, we analyzed the US market for companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Our in-depth analysis focused on firms with solid prospects due to their investments in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. We reviewed ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the hedge fund stakes in them during Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Average Upside Potential as of March 11: 129.41%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, holding 499,096 BTC as of February. Similarly, it was the best-performing cryptocurrency in 2024, rallying by more than 140%. The impressive run came on the company, delivering solid financial results that were helped by Bitcoin prices rallying to record highs.

On February 5th, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) revealed its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. While its revenue from subscription services rose 48% to $31.9 million, its reported revenue of $120.7 million was down 3% from the previous year. Revenue from product licenses increased 18.3% year over year to $47.2 million.

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) also announced plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years. A good chunk of the funds will bolster the company's Bitcoin holdings. It also announced the completion of $20 billion of its $42 billion capital plan, often known as the 21/21 plan. It also updated its annual Bitcoin yield target to 15% for 2025.

Overall, MSTR ranks 5th on our list of best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Kevin Segal, a self-proclaimed “Bitcoin billionaire” who allegedly failed to appear for a court hearing after a friend posted his $50,000 bond.

Prosecutors accuse Segal of swindling Wyoming businesses out of more than $212,000. The 30-year-old California resident faces up to 141 years in prison if convicted. 

According to a report by The Daily Mail, Segal posed as a wealthy businessman attempting to purchase millions in real estate in the Jackson Hole area while leaving a trail of unpaid bills at luxury resorts and businesses. 

Judge Bill Simpson issued a bench warrant across all 50 states after Segal skipped his Wednesday court appearance and allegedly failed to surrender his passport as ordered.

Jason Irvine, who posted Segal's bond, told Cowboy State Daily he maxed out three credit cards to help what he believed was a friend in need. Irvine claims Segal had promised him “a large Bitcoin payout that equated to half a million dollars” in exchange for posting the bond but disappeared after being released from jail on Feb. 14.

“He explained the situation and was basically denying all the charges written in the newspaper,” Irvine said. “[He] said it was libel and slander; and he didn't intend to defraud anybody. He was locked up in jail, and [said] that's why he couldn't pay anybody off.”

After feeling betrayed, Irvine sent Segal a text message: “You screwed me over, and now I really don't believe anything you say anymore. Irvine is now considering bankruptcy due to the financial damage.

Investigators discovered a pattern of fraudulent activities throughout Wyoming. Segal reportedly stayed at the luxurious Amangani resort with his mother and a friend, allegedly leaving a $2,725.76 bill unpaid.

At Spring Creek Ranch, three cards he used for bills totaling over $22,000 were reported to be fraudulent. It was also reported that he left the Mangy Moose Saloon with an unpaid $3,055.28 tab.

The alleged scams extended to individuals as well. Prosecutors say Segal hired a man to purchase a DJI drone in Colorado with a promise of reimbursement, then wrote a check for $3,281.46 that failed to clear.

In another instance, he sent a delivery man to drive a Dodge back to Los Angeles, promising to pay for return flights that were allegedly never purchased. The men were stranded and forced to buy their own tickets home, with Segal later sending a fake wire transfer screenshot to cover their $3,101 in expenses.

This isn't Segal's first legal trouble. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail show he previously faced a civil lawsuit claiming he falsely claimed to have stocks exceeding $340 million and a successful company to lease a Los Angeles property. 

If caught, Segal will face a substantially increased bond of $750,000 cash-only.

According to data provided by analytics platform Lookonchain, a Bitcoin whale recently opened a short position of $332 million in Bitcoin with an entry price of $84,040. 

The position was opened with 40X leverage, which means that the trader is borrowing 40 times the initial capital. 

Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $83,945, according to CoinGecko data. The cryptocurrency is down 2.3% over the past week. 

The massive position will get liquidated if the price of the leading cryptocurrency ends up spiking to the $85,000 level. 

The trader in question previously managed to rake in a whopping $16.39 million within a single month on popular decentralized perpetual trading platform Hyperliquid. Notably, all of his eight trades were profitable across two wallets. 

Some X commentators are now predicting that the trader will inevitably get liquidated given how precarious his position is.

"These types of guys will lose it all," one social media user said. 

The 40x leverage dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. It would take a mere 2.5% move to wipe out his entire position.

According to data provided by CoinGlass, a total of $94 million worth of crypto has been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with shorts making up the majority of the sum ($49 million). The largest single liquidation took place on Binance ($582,130 with the BTCUSDT pair). Overall, more than 65,000 traders have been liquidated over the aforementioned period of time. The Binance exchange accounts for 38.79% of the total liquidations.

Hi, 

Logout

The United States has created a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," an initiative that further highlights President Donald Trump's support for the cryptocurrency space. 
 

The reserve, which Trump described as "a digital Fort Knox," was established via an executive order earlier this month. 
 

"Fort Knox" is the US Army post in Kentucky that stores gold bullion and other valuables.

Funding details

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by some 200,000 bitcoins, worth about $17 billion. These bitcoins have been confiscated in the US as part of civil and criminal prosecutions. 
 

The reserve is meant to be secured indefinitely, with more Bitcoin allowed as long as it doesn't cost taxpayers anything.

Response

While the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initially caused a dip in Bitcoin's price, it has since stabilized. 
 

Analysts have attributed this lackluster response to the failure of the government to immediately purchase more Bitcoin. 
 

Dessislava Aubert from crypto data provider Kaiko stated that legally, "the US government must return Bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack."

Return

Aubert estimated that a large chunk of the seized Bitcoin, nearly 198,000 tokens, would have to be returned to victims of a hack at crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016. 
 

Observers are also closely watching if other digital tokens will be added to the reserve, as hinted in Trump's executive order.

Criticism

Critics have raised concerns about the US Bitcoin reserve, arguing that unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are risky assets with no intrinsic value. 
 

However, David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, believes that by storing Bitcoin over time, the government would protect itself from the cryptocurrency's massive short-term volatility. 
 

Some experts argue that like gold, Bitcoin can benefit from its rarity due to a limited supply of 21 million tokens.

Global trends

Brazil is also considering creating a cryptocurrency reserve, while Switzerland's central bank recently rejected the idea. 
 

Governments across the globe are actively participating in cryptocurrency, especially by selling court-seized digital assets. 
 

El Salvador made Bitcoin one of its official currencies but reversed the decision this year due to low citizen acceptance. 
 

Meanwhile, Bhutan holds nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin, nearly 30% of the kingdom's GDP.</p>

Bitcoin dropped below $83,000 on Sunday as the crypto market continues its downward trend, yet several altcoins like Ancient8 and Apu Apustaja have turned bullish.

A8 has surged 160% in the past day, trading at $0.259 from a low of $0.09628. This massive price movement follows Bithumb's listing of A8 several months ago. 

The South Korean exchange, one of the largest in Asia, appears to have created a delayed effect as attention turns toward the token.

Market analysts point to three key factors behind this surge: increasing global attention, growing adoption rates, and a combination of strong holders and new market entrants. Beyond these market factors, there have been no major project developments to explain the sudden price jump.

Second on CoinGecko's top gainers list, APU has climbed 85% over the last 24 hours, reaching $0.0002479 from $0.0001325. The meme coin has also been trending on X recently. However, like many meme coins experiencing sudden pumps, there are no fundamental updates or developments behind the price movement.

Third on the list, ROAM Token has seen a 41% increase in the past day, moving from $0.136 to $0.1917.

The DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project, which focuses on creating an open wireless network through OpenRoaming and eSIM technologies, recently received a shoutout from Solana's (SOL) official X account.

Adding to its surge, ROAM announced it has reached a milestone of 2 million nodes globally, showcasing the growing adoption of its decentralized network infrastructure.

Despite these isolated bright spots, the overall crypto market continues its correction phase. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to $82,471 shows ongoing selling pressure that has affected most major cryptocurrencies. 

At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has also dropped to the $1,900 level.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been embraced by world leaders in recent years, with U.S. president Donald Trump reportedly planning to buy up huge swathes of bitcoin.

The bitcoin price has surged to around $80,000 per bitcoin, up from around $50,000 this time last year, though one legendary trader's prescient bitcoin price prediction has forecast a huge shift has already begun.

Now, as traders scramble to get ahead of countries that could rush to follow the U.S. into bitcoin, a leak has revealed Russia is using crypto to trade with China and India and skirt international sanctions—as the Bank of Russia opens up bitcoin and crypto buying to a “limited circle of Russian investors.”

Oil companies in Russia are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including ethereum and the stablecoin tether to help convert rubles to China's yuan and India's rupee, it was reported by Reuters, citing anonymous sources.

Bitcoin and crypto are now favored as a means of trade among Russia's oil companies to the extent they would continue to be used even if sanctions were lifted and the U.S. dollar could be used again, according to the report.

Russian oligarchs and billionaires hit by severe financial restrictions following the country's invasion of Ukraine reportedly turned to bitcoin and crypto as far back as 2022.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has announced this week it intends to allow a “limited circle of Russian investors” to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

“In accordance with the instructions of the president of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,” a translated announcement read.

"This is a new status that ... citizens will receive if their investments in securities and deposits exceed 100 million rubles or if their income over the past year was more than 50 million rubles.”

Russia's central bank has gradually softened its opposition to bitcoin and crypto, last year backing a law that allowed businesses to use crypto for international trade.

Russia's growing support for bitcoin and crypto comes as Donald Trump's administration gears up to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset, freezing the planned sale of bitcoin and crypto the U.S. has seized.

This week, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump's top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible—helping the reverse a bitcoin price sell-off that was triggered by Trump's bitcoin reserve plans falling short of expectations.

In December, a leak revealed Russia lawmakers were pushing for the country to create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to that proposed by Trump.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin had earlier praised bitcoin as an alternative to foreign currency reserves following the seizure of its funds by Western governments in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

Cathie Wood is one of the most vocal bulls on Wall Street when it comes to the potential of the technology sector. She founded ARK Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on investing exclusively in innovative technologies like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and more.

In fact, ARK was one of the first firms to win approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF last year. Wood and her team are extremely bullish on the world's largest cryptocurrency, predicting it could soar 1,660% to $1.48 million per coin by the year 2030.

The crypto currently trades at around $84,000, which is 21% below its record high. If ARK's prediction is right, the recent dip could be a great buying opportunity.

Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, which accounts for more than half of the total value of every cryptocurrency in circulation across the industry. If it were a company, it would be the seventh largest in the entire world. 

It's a speculative asset because it doesn't generate any revenue or earnings, nor does it have a legitimate use case in the real world. Therefore, its value is very hard to pin down.

Nevertheless, it has a series of unique qualities that have led investors to believe it's a good store of value, like a digital version of gold.

It's completely decentralized, which means it can't be controlled by any person, company, or government. It also has a capped supply of 21 million coins, which won't be fully mined until around the year 2140, so it offers the perception of scarcity. Lastly, as I touched on earlier, it can be purchased through dozens of ETFs from different issuers, allowing financial advisors and institutional investors to own it in a safe, regulated manner.

Those attributes have paved the way for Bitcoin to march to new record highs recently, despite most other cryptocurrencies failing to break above their best-ever levels from 2021 (or in some cases, even earlier).

In fact, had you bought Bitcoin 10 years ago and held on, you would be sitting on a 29,100% return -- enough to have turned an investment of $10,000 into $2.9 million! It has obliterated every other asset class over the last decade, from stocks to real estate to gold:



Bitcoin price data by YCharts.

In a report issued in 2023, ARK highlighted eight potential factors that could drive Bitcoin higher over the long term, but not all of them make sense, in my opinion. For example, it thinks Bitcoin could become the currency of choice in emerging markets, but even after El Salvador became the first country to adopt it as legal tender in 2021, it appears most consumers still aren't willing to use it (partly because of its volatility). 

Moreover, ARK believes individuals with a high net worth will increasingly own Bitcoin because it's harder for governments to seize than cash and other traditional assets. However, we know the U.S. government alone has successfully confiscated over 200,000 bitcoins, which are worth $17 billion at the current price. So, this particular theory doesn't really hold water. 

With that said, three of ARK's eight catalysts are somewhat plausible:

Setting my opinions aside for a moment, ARK believes Bitcoin could soar as high as $1.48 million per coin by 2030 based on the eight catalysts it outlined. That would give investors a potential return of 1,660% from where it currently trades.

Wood even went a step further at the Bitcoin Investor Day in March 2024. She said it could surpass ARK's bullish forecast and reach $3.8 million instead, based on the idea that ETFs could lay the groundwork for institutional investors to allocate 5% of their assets to the cryptocurrency. If she's right, that implies a potential upside of 4,420%.

If Bitcoin rose to a price of $1.48 million, it would have a fully diluted market capitalization of $31 trillion. In other words, it would be almost 10 times more valuable than Apple, which is currently the world's most valuable company with a $3.2 trillion market cap. It would also be worth more than the output of the entire U.S. economy, which was around $29.7 trillion last year. 

Does that sound realistic for an asset that produces no revenue, no earnings, and has struggled to generate traction as a currency? For me, the answer is no.

Despite Wood's enthusiasm for the potential of ETFs, they have attracted less than $100 billion in inflows so far, which is a mere fraction of Bitcoin's current market cap. Granted, these securities have been available for only one year, but I don't see a catalyst on the horizon that would cause inflows to accelerate from here -- they seem to be slowing down instead.

A more realistic price target might be $942,800 per coin. At that level, Bitcoin's market cap would be $19.8 trillion, which matches the total value of all above-ground gold reserves right now.

I'm not suggesting this will happen, because I believe gold has more intrinsic value than a digital token thanks to its physical state and because it has been accepted as a store of value globally for thousands of years.

However, if Bitcoin does become universally accepted as the digital alternative to gold, that price target still presents investors with an incredible potential return of 1,020% from here.

Fox News host Lara Trump speaks with O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary and Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia about the future of cryptocurrency on ‘My View with Lara Trump.'

Mr. Wonderful is casting a glimmering light on the cryptocurrency industry, arguing it is entering a "new phase" under the Trump administration. 

"The reason they're not comfortable with it right now is they've watched the cowboy era of crypto, but all the crypto cowboys are in jail or out of business. So now we're in a new phase. There's a new tone with the government. Trump has put it forward," O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary said on "My View with Lara Trump" Saturday. 

"They're going to provide regulations to allow this to become integrated with the financial institutions of America. It's going to become a payment system, an investment vehicle. It's going to become part of all the sectors of our economy. We have 11 sectors. Eventually, I believe crypto will be the 12th."

TRUMP'S CRYPTO CZAR DECRIES GOVERNMENT'S LACK OF BITCOIN ‘LONG-TERM STRATEGY'

President Donald Trump made headlines on the campaign trail last year for embracing the crypto industry as a key issue for the 2024 election. 

During an address at the world's largest bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee in July, Trump vowed for the U.S. to become the "crypto capital of the planet" and a "bitcoin superpower of the world." 

The now-47th president has made good on many of his crypto promises since taking office in January. 

TRUMP CREATES STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE, OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BE USED IN STOCKPILE

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week, just a day before the first-of-its-kind crypto summit. 

"A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump wrote.

"I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" he added.

Crypto czar David Sacks celebrated the move via a post on X. 

"The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime," he wrote. "It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government's digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.'" 

"The big news is that this will be the first administration that's going to say this sector belongs in America. The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it. Other administrations didn't do that, and I think we should celebrate it because I think we shouldn't fall behind on this," O'Leary told Fox News host Lara Trump during his interview at Pubkey bitcoin bar in New York City. 

Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia also weighed in on the future of crypto under Trump, noting the leadership under President Biden was "atrocious."

"For four years, it was a very aggressive administration. I think the biggest win was just moving on from that and not getting stuck with another 4 or 8 years of that. It was very, very punitive. And there was no conversation. It wasn't something that you could go and talk about with the administration."

Trump's return to the Oval Office is a "massive seat change for the industry," Pacchia added.
