US Vice President J.D. Vance has dismissed allegations that his heated exchange with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky in the Oval Office was premeditated, rejecting claims that he and President Donald Trump staged a “good cop, bad cop” routine to humiliate and expel their guest.

Zelensky engaged in a shouting match with Trump and Vance during a tense meeting at the White House last month. Trump accused Zelensky of showing disrespect toward the United States, failing to appreciate past US aid, and refusing to pursue peace with Russia. Zelensky was ultimately asked to leave the White House before closed-door talks even began, leading many of his supporters to speculate that the confrontation had been orchestrated.

Asked in a recent Fox News interview whether the clash was a “good cop, bad cop” setup, Vance explained how events unfolded.

“No, it was certainly not planned,” Vance said, explaining that Trump was responding to the third consecutive question from the same reporter when he decided to interject.

“I just wanted to answer the question. And then, of course, something I said in my answer caused the blowup. Zelensky got frustrated with it, and then everything went from there,” Vance said.

“I'm the vice president, I try to be respectful. But I also recognize that sometimes the president wants me to say stuff. And of course, if I think there's something useful I can say and I think that it's going to be deferential to the president – I'll jump in and offer my thoughts,” he added.

The press conference took a turn when Trump explained his decision to remain neutral in an effort to mediate a settlement with Moscow rather than increasing support for Kiev. Vance commented: “The path to peace and the path to prosperity is maybe engaging in diplomacy”

Zelensky interjected with a rant about how Russia had “occupied parts of Ukraine since 2014” and that no US administration had stopped it. “What kind of diplomacy, J.D., you are speaking about?” he asked.

“I am talking about the kind of diplomacy that is going to end the destruction of your country…” Vance began to respond before Zelensky cut him off again, saying, “Yes, but what do you…”

“Mr. President, with respect, I think it is disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance stated.

Zelensky remarked that: “During the war everybody has problems, even you. But you have [a] nice ocean and do not feel [it] now, but you will feel it in the future…”

This prompted Trump to jump in, telling Zelensky: “Do not tell us what we are going to feel. We are trying to solve a problem. Because you are in no position to dictate.”

The increasingly heated exchange continued for several minutes before Trump eventually ended the press conference, concluding: “Alright, I think we have seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television.”

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to Paris and London on Monday to seek alliances as he deals with U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Canada's sovereignty and economy. 

Carney is purposely making his first foreign trip to the capital cities of the two countries that shaped Canada's early existence. 

At his swearing-in ceremony on Friday, Carney noted the country was built on the bedrock of three peoples, French, English and Indigenous, and said Canada is fundamentally different from America and will “never, ever, in any way shape or form, be part of the United States.”

“The Trump factor is the reason for the trip. The Trump factor towers over everything else Carney must deal with,” said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.

Carney, a former central banker who turned 60 on Sunday, will meet with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and later travel to London to sit down with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in an effort to diversify trade and perhaps coordinate a response to Trump's tariffs. 

He will also meet with King Charles III, the head of state in Canada. The trip to England is a bit a homecoming, as Carney is a former governor of the Bank of England, the first noncitizen to be named to the role in the bank's 300-plus-year history. 

Carney then travels to the edge of Canada's Arctic to “reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty” before returning to Ottawa where he's expected to call an election within days. 




Carney has said he's ready to meet with Trump if he shows respect for Canadian sovereignty. He said he doesn't plan to visit Washington at the moment but hopes to have a phone call with the president soon.

Sweeping tariffs of 25% and Trump's talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and many are avoiding buying American goods when they can.

Carney's government is reviewing the purchase of U.S.-made F-35 fighter jets in light of Trump's trade war. 

The governing Liberal Party had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared economic war and repeatedly has said Canada should become the 51st state. Now the party and its new leader could come out on top.

Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history and international relations at the University of Toronto, said Carney is wise not to visit Trump. 

“There's no point in going to Washington,” Bothwell said. “As (former Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau's treatment shows, all that results in is a crude attempt by Trump to humiliate his guests. Nor can you have a rational conversation with someone who simply sits there and repeats disproven lies.”

Bothwell said that Trump demands respect, “but it's often a one-way street, asking others to set aside their self-respect to bend to his will.”

Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said it is absolutely essential that Canada diversify trade amidst the ongoing trade war with the United States. More than 75% of Canada's exports go to the U.S. 

Béland said Arctic sovereignty is also a key issue for Canada. 

“President Trump's aggressive talk about both Canada and Greenland and the apparent rapprochement between Russia, a strong Arctic power, and the United States under Trump have increased anxieties about our control over this remote yet highly strategic region,” Béland said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

Yemeni TV showed smoke rising above the capital Sanaa on Saturday night after US President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday.

President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

A series of airstrikes hit the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Saturday, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered the strikes (Sun. 16 March).

CAIRO (AP) — The United States and Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen are both vowing escalation after the U.S. launched airstrikes to deter the rebels from attacking military and commercial vessels on one of the world's busiest shipping corridors.



“We're not going to have these people controlling which ships can go through and which ones cannot. And so your question is, how long will this go on? It will go on until they no longer have the capability to do that,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio told CBS on Sunday. He said these are not the one-off retaliation strikes the Biden administration carried out after Houthi attacks.



President Donald Trump on Saturday vowed to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Houthis cease their attacks, and warned that Tehran would be held “fully accountable” for their actions.



The Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels, in what they call acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas, another Iranian ally.



The attacks stopped when a Israel-Hamas ceasefire took hold in January — a day before Trump took office — but last week the Houthis said they would renew attacks against Israeli vessels after Israel cut off the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza this month.



There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the overnight U.S. strikes killed at least 31 people, including women and children, and wounded over 100 in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia.



The airstrikes were one of the most extensive attacks against the Houthis since the war in Gaza began in October 2023.



Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on Sunday told ABC that the strikes “actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.” He didn't identify them or give evidence. Rubio said some Houthi facilities had been destroyed.



The Houthis' political bureau has said the rebels will respond to the U.S. strikes and “meet escalation with escalation.” 



The rebels on Sunday claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group with missiles and a drone, but two U.S. officials told The Associated Press they were not tracking anything. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.



Rubio said that over the past 18 months the Houthis had attacked the U.S. Navy “directly” 174 times and targeted commercial shipping 145 times using “guided precision anti-ship weaponry.”



The attacks sparked the most serious combat the U.S. Navy had seen since World War II.



On Sunday, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami, denied his country was involved in the Houthis' attacks, saying it “plays no role in setting the national or operational policies” of the militant groups it is allied with across the region, according to state-run TV.



Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, writing on X, urged the U.S. to halt its airstrikes and said Washington cannot dictate Iran's foreign policy.



The U.S. and others have long accused Iran of providing military aid to the rebels. The U.S. Navy has seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry it said was bound for the Houthis.



The United States, Israel and Britain previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen, but the new operation was conducted solely by the U.S. It was the first strike on the Houthis under the second Trump administration.



The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, is in the Red Sea and was part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.

A massive fire that broke out early Sunday in a nightclub in North Macedonia's southern town of Kocani has killed 51 people and injured about 100 more, interior minister Panche Toshkovski said.

North Macedonian Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski stated on Sunday that “persons” had been detained relating to a massive nightclub fire, which killed 51 people early Sunday in the eastern town of Kocani.

A massive fire tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia's eastern town of Kocani early Sunday, killing 59 people and injuring 155, authorities said.

KOCANI, North Macedonia (AP) — A massive fire tore through an overcrowded nightclub in North Macedonia on Sunday, killing 59 people and injuring 155 in a chaotic escape during a live concert. The tragedy focused national attention on corruption in the small Balkan country as authorities detained 15 people. 



The death toll may rise further, with 20 of the injured remain in critical condition, according to Health Minister Arben Taravari. The government has declared seven days of national mourning.



The pre-dawn blaze in the eastern town of Kocani left mostly young people dead and injured due to burns, smoke inhalation and a stampede in the desperate effort to reach the building's single exit, officials said. People as young as 16 were among the casualties, they said. 



Videos showed sparkling pyrotechnics on the stage hitting the ceiling followed by scenes of chaos inside the club, with young people running through the smoke as the musicians urged them to escape as quickly as possible.



“We even tried to get out through the toilet, to find bars (on the windows),” Marija Taseva, 19, told The Associated Press, describing the fire that erupted after watching a local pop group at Club Pulse. “I somehow managed to get out. I fell down the stairs and they ran over me, trampled me. ... I barely stayed alive and could hardly breathe.” She suffered an injury to her face.

The fire was the worst tragedy in recent memory to befall the landlocked nation, whose population is less than 2 million, and the latest in a slew of deadly nightclub fires around the world. 



Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski said 15 people were detained for questioning after a preliminary inspection revealed the club was operating without a proper license. He said the number of people inside the club was at least double its official capacity of 250. 



“We have grounds for suspicion that there is bribery and corruption in this case,” he told reporters without elaborating.

Condolences poured in from leaders around Europe as well as from the office of Pope Francis, who has been hospitalized for a month for double pneumonia. 



European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also sent messages of support. “I wish those who were injured a speedy recovery. Ukraine mourns alongside our (North) Macedonian friends on this sad day,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X. 



Health Ministry officials said the government had accepted offers of assistance from several neighboring countries, including Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Turkey, where preparations were being made to receive patients with life-threatening injuries. 



In the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, three people with severe burns aged 25, 25 and 19 were being treated at a civilian hospital, with one undergoing surgery, health authorities said. Their conditions are critical.



Throughout Sunday, relatives gathered in front of hospitals and city offices in Kocani, some 115 kilometers (72 miles) east of the capital, Skopje, begging authorities for more information. Resident Dragi Stojanov was informed that his 21-year-old son Tomce had died in the fire.



“He was my only child. I don't need my life anymore. ... 150 families have been devastated,” he said. “Children burnt beyond recognition. There are corpses, just corpses inside (the club). ... And the bosses (of organized crime), just putting money into their pockets.”

In Skopje, officials said the injured were sent to hospitals around the country, many being treated for severe burns and smoke inhalation. The effort was being assisted by multiple volunteer organizations.



President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova visited burn victims at a hospital in Skopje and spoke to parents waiting outside. 



“It's terrible ... hard to believe how this happened,” she said, her voice halting with emotion. “We must give these young people courage to continue.” 



The fire caused the roof of the single-story building to partially collapse, revealing the charred remains of wooden beams and debris. Police cordoned off the site and sent in evidence gathering teams in an operation also involving state prosecutors. 



North Macedonia's government ordered a sweeping inspection to be carried out at all nightclubs and cabarets across the country over the next three days.



Pyrotechnics have often been the cause of deadly fires in nightclubs, including the one at the Colectiv club in Bucharest, Romania, in 2015 in which 64 people died.

KIMBIRILA-NORD, Ivory Coast (AP) — With its tomato patches and grazing cattle, the Ivory Coast village of Kimbirila-Nord hardly looks like a front line of the global fight against extremism. But after jihadis attacked a nearby community in Mali five years ago and set up a base in a forest straddling the border, the U.S. committed to spending $20 million to counter the spread of al-Qaida and the Islamic State group here and in dozens of other villages.



The Trump administration's sweeping foreign aid cuts mean that support is now gone, even as violence in Mali and other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara has reached record levels and sent tens of thousands refugees streaming into northern Ivory Coast.

Locals worry they have been abandoned. Diplomats and aid officials said the termination of aid jeopardizes counterterrorism efforts and weakens U.S. influence in a part of the world where some countries have turned to Russian mercenaries for help.



In Kimbirila-Nord, U.S. funding, among other things, helped young people get job training, built parks for cattle to graze so they are no longer stolen by jihadis on Malian territory, and helped establish an information-sharing system so residents can flag violent encounters to each other and state services.



“What attracts young people to extremists is poverty and hunger,” said Yacouba Doumbia, 78-year-old chief of Kimbirila-Nord. “There was a very dangerous moment in 2020. The project came at the right time, and allowed us to protect ourselves.”



Over the last decade, West Africa has been shaken by extremist uprisings and military coups. Groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have conquered large areas and killed thousands in the Sahel and have been spreading into wealthier West African coastal states, such as Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo.



In 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Global Fragility Act that led to the initiatives in northern Ivory Coast. The U.S. goal in this area was to “seize a narrowing prevention window,” according to this year's congressional report about the implementation of the bipartisan legislation.

Experts say local concerns help drive the popularity of extremist groups: competition for land and resources, exclusion, marginalization and lack of economic opportunities. Across the region, Islamic extremists have recruited among groups marginalized and neglected by central governments.



“Ivory Coast is one of the few countries that still resist the terrorist threat in the Sahel,” said a U.N. official working in the country who was not authorized to speak on the matter publicly. “If we do not continue to support border communities, a minor issue could send them into the arms of extremists.”



Trump issued an executive order in January directing a freeze on foreign assistance and a review of all U.S. aid and development work abroad. He charged that much of foreign aid was wasteful and advanced a liberal agenda.











In 2020, when the jihadis struck a Malian village 10 kilometers (6 miles) away, Kimbirila-Nord in many ways fit the description of a community susceptible to extremism.



The lives of Malians and Ivorians were intertwined. People crossed the border freely, making it easy for extremists, who like residents spoke Bambara, to access Kimbirila-Nord. Many residents did not have identity cards and few spoke French, leaving them with no access to states services or official information. Different ethnic groups lived next to each other but were divided by conflicts over scarce natural resources and suspicions toward the state. And young people did not have opportunities to make money.



“We were very scared” when the extremists attacked, said Aminata Doumbia, the head of the village's female farmers cooperative. “Everyone was just looking out for themselves.”

The Ivorian government runs a program that provides professional training, grants and microloans. But access is difficult in villages such as Kimbirila-Nord.



Kimbirila-Nord is home to refugees from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea. Sifata Berte, 23, fled there with his family two years ago from Mali. He is not eligible for the government-run program, but got training through the project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and now works as an apprentice in an iron workshop. 



Other things the USAID-funded project set up included a network of community radios in local languages, so people could get access to information. It also used mobile government trucks to help tens of thousands of people across the region get their identity documents. And it brought people together with microcredit cooperatives and with a special committee of ranchers and farmers that helps resolve tensions over land. 



“It's thanks to the project that we can sleep at night,” Doumbia, the village chief, said. “We learned how to be together.”



Equal Access International, an international nonprofit, designed and implemented the U.S.-funded project.



The USAID project also has been the only direct source of information on the ground in northern Ivory Coast on violent events for the U.S.-based Armed Conflict and Location & Event Data Project, the main provider of data on violence in the Sahel.







Ivory Coast became known as a target for extremists in 2016, when an attack on the seaside resort of Grand Bassam killed tourists. In 2021, a string of attacks occurred near the country's northern border, but the violence has been largely contained after Ivorian authorities, Western governments and aid groups rushed into this impoverished and isolated part of the country with military build up and development projects.



In 2024, the U.S. Africa Command provided over $65 million to projects in Ivory Coast, most of which “focused on counterterrorism and border security” in the northern part of the country, according to the group's website. The Pentagon said in a statement that it was “not aware of any budget cuts that have undermined counterterrorism training or partnership programs in Africa.”



Ivory Coast has the second-highest GDP per capita in West Africa, but according to the U.N. it remains one of the world's least developed countries. Many in remote villages like Kimbirila-Nord do not have access to running water.

“At first we thought that we only had to solve these problems with a military solution,” Famy Rene, the prefect of Korhogo, the region's capital, said. “But we saw that this was not enough. We had to put in place programs that strengthen the resilience of the population.”



Residents of Kimbirila-Nord had big plans before the U.S. froze aid. The U.S. was supposed to finance the first well in the village, help create a collective farm, and expand vocational training, 



Now they fear they have been left alone to deal with extremists.



“If you forget, they will come back,” said Doumbia, the village chief. “As long as there is war on the other side of the border, we must remain on a high alert.”

SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Farooq Ahmad Shaksaaz presses a button on his 1970 Sharp cassette player, and with a hefty clack the machine whirrs to life. As the Kashmiri tailor stitches, the machine crackles for a moment before Ghulam Ahmad Sofi's otherworldly voice fills his shop with verses about divine love and the pain of separation from the beloved creator of the universe.

Shaksaaz, a tailor in the Kashmiri city of Srinagar, inherited his passion for local Sufi music from his grandfather along with a meticulously preserved collection of audio cassette tapes from the 1970s, which he often listens to as he works.

He's part of a small, dedicated community that believes cassette tapes are the best way to listen to and archive the Sufi music of Indian-controlled Kashmir, where music inspired by local and central Asian Muslim saints has long been a deep expression of spirituality and emotion. Many people turn to the music for spiritual guidance, or seeking an escape from the region's long periods of street battles, shutdowns and security clampdowns. 

For decades, cassette players have carried the soul-stirring poetry of Sufi saints and the mystical melodies of Kashmiri instruments like the sarangi and santoor, and it's long been a local ritual for families to gather around the warm hum of a tape player. Even today, the region's traditional Sufi music gatherings are often recorded only on the disappearing audio format, which was widely used from the 1970s to the 1990s.

While the music is increasingly available on digital formats, many Kashmiris say that it's best heard on cassette tapes.




“There is something unique about this machine that for me plays recordings of spiritual guides,” said Abdul Ahad, a carpet weaver. “It is a sacred ritual in itself to press the play button of a cassette player to listen to a song on spiritual moorings.”

Many of the most beloved albums were released by local record labels during the heyday of the audio cassette, but dedicated devotees of the genre are still bringing tape recorders to gatherings. Digital recorders are often unwelcome at these nightly music sessions, as Sufi music lovers say they blur together the distinct sounds of the different instruments.

“It is a different experience to listen to music on a tape recorder,” said Abdul Hamid Khan. “Tapes are smooth and you can feel the sound of every instrument, you don't get that feel in these new players.”

Still, as tapes wear out and more music moves to digital streaming platforms and smartphones, the tactile and deeply personal listening experience of cassettes is becoming harder to keep going. 

Many families have been forced to part with their players due to mechanical failures, while others struggle to preserve their cherished cassette collections, some of which hold rare and irreplaceable recordings passed down through generations. Some collectors have turned to digitizing their old recordings to safeguard them for future generations.

Only a few shops in Srinagar, the region's main city, sell tape recorders or blank tapes, and the availability of spare parts and skilled repair technicians has drastically dwindled.

A handful of mechanics in the Kashmir Valley still cater to a dedicated population of Sufi music lovers, painstakingly restoring machines made by beloved Japanese brands like Sharp and Kenwood in the last century.

Mohammad Ashraf Matoo, a self-taught mechanic, has spent years keeping decades-old cassette players running even as spare parts become increasingly scarce. He purchases non-functional recorders to extract usable components, and manufactures some parts himself to keep his customers' devices going. Once repaired, a well-functioning tape recorder is sold for a price between $150 and $850, depending on its brand and condition.

Shaksaaz, a lifelong Sufi music devotee, called it a “personal mission” to preserve the legacy of cassette tapes. 

“It is a bridge to the past, a way to remain connected to our spiritual and cultural roots in this ever modernizing and digital world,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he has ordered airstrikes against Iran-backed rebels in Yemen, and issued a warning to Tehran. 

Here's why.

The Houthi rebels started attacking military and commercial ships on one of the world's busiest shipping corridors shortly after the war in Gaza began between Hamas and Israel in October 2023. 

The Houthis said they were targeting vessels on the Red Sea with links to Israel or its allies — the United States and the U.K. — in solidarity with Palestinians, but some vessels had little or no link to the war.

The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, until the current ceasefire in Gaza took effect in mid-January. Other missiles and drones were intercepted or failed to reach their targets, which included Western military ones.

The attacks paused during the ceasefire, but the Houthis on Wednesday said they would resume against “any Israeli vessel” after Israel cut off all aid supplies to Gaza to pressure Hamas during talks on extending their truce. The rebels said the warning also affects the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.

No Houthi attacks have been reported since then.

“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said Saturday while announcing the airstrikes in a social media post.




The earlier Houthi campaign saw U.S. and other Western warships repeatedly targeted, sparking the most serious combat the U.S. Navy had seen since World War II.

The United States under the Biden administration, as well as Israel and Britain, previously struck Houthi-held areas in Yemen. But a U.S. official said Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S.

The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.

Trump said the strikes were to “protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom.”

The focus on the Houthis and their attacks have raised their profile as they face economic and other pressures at home amid Yemen's decadelong stalemated war, which has torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

Saturday's strikes also were meant to pressure Iran, which has backed the Houthis just as it has supported Hamas and other proxies in the Middle East.

Trump vowed to hold Iran “fully accountable” for the Houthis' actions.

The State Department earlier this month reinstated the “foreign terrorist organization” designation for the Houthis, which carries sanctions and penalties for anyone providing “material support” for the group.

The Trump administration also has been pressing Iran to restart bilateral talks on Iran's advancing nuclear program, with Trump writing a letter to the country's supreme leader. Trump, who unilaterally withdrew America from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, has said he will not allow the program to become operational.

Trump has also levied new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign against the country and has suggested that military action remains a possibility, while emphasizing he still believes a new nuclear deal can be reached.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use “overwhelming lethal force” until the Iran-backed rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 31 people were killed, and Trump's national security adviser said Sunday that the strikes had successfully targeted “multiple” Houthi leaders.

“Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom,” Trump said in a social media post. “No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World.”

He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country “fully accountable” for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.

“This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out,” Trump national security adviser Michael Waltz said on ABC's “This Week.” that aired Sunday.

The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib. 




The Houthi-run Health Ministry said early Sunday that the death toll had climbed to 31, including women and children. Anees al-Asbahi, a spokesperson for the ministry, said Sunday that another 101 people were wounded.

Yemeni TV showed smoke rising above the capital Sanaa on Saturday night after US President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday.

A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press.

Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. “Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges,” he added on social media.

Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes “false and misleading.”

The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea.

There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of “additional consequences” for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase.

The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect.

The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation.

The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children.

“The explosions were very strong,” said Abdallah al-Alffi. “It was like an earthquake.”

The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area.

The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs.

The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment.

However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration.

Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. 

The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region.

Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.

“These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk,” Trump said.

HAVANA (AP) — Millions of people in Cuba remained without power Saturday after a failure of the nation's electric grid left the island in the dark the previous night.

The massive blackout is the fourth in the last six months as a severe economic crisis plagues the Caribbean country. The Ministry of Energy and Mines, in a statement on social media, attributed the latest outage to a failure at a substation in the suburbs of Havana, the capital.

Internet and telephone service were intermittent about Saturday evening after power went out around 8 p.m. local time Friday.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said on his X account that authorities are “working intensely to restore stability” to the power system. 

Lázaro Guerra, director of electricity at the ministry, said on national television that power was already being generated to support vital services such as hospitals.

A statement from the Cuban Electricity Union released Saturday said the strategy was to create “microsystems” that will connect to each other to gradually restore electricity across the country. Several of these were already operating in the provinces of Guantánamo, Santiago, Las Tunas and Pinar del Río.

In Sancti Spíritus, the provincial energy company reported on its Telegram channel that more than 200,000 customers in that area had electricity thanks to these microsystems.

Many Cuban families use electric equipment to prepare their meals. The outage could cause food to thaw in refrigerators and possibly spoil due to the island's tropical climate.




“When I was about to start cooking and making some spaghetti, the power went out. “And now what?” Cecilia Duquense, a 79-year-old housewife who lives in the working-class neighborhood of Central Havana, said Saturday.

In Havana, people were shopping for food Saturday. Businesses were open, although some were operating using batteries or small home generators. 

“We are very worried that the food will go bad” in the refrigerator if the blackout lasts much longer, said Frank García, a 26-year-old marker worker in Havana. 

Gas stations were also open, but the tunnel that runs under Havana Bay and connects the city to the outskirts was dark. 

Cuba suffered similar blackouts in October, November and December. The latest was the first of 2025 but in mid-February authorities suspended classes and work activities for two days due to a shortage of electricity generation that exceeded 50% in the country.

Experts have said the electricity disruptions are a result of fuel shortages at power plants and aging infrastructure. Most plants have been in operation for more than 30 years.

The outages come as Cubans are experiencing a severe economic crisis that analysts have blamed on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a program of domestic measures that triggered inflation and, above all, the tightening of sanctions by the United States.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine traded heavy aerial blows overnight, with both sides on Saturday reporting more than 100 enemy drones over their respective territories.

The attacks comes less than 24 hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss details of the American proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the war with Ukraine.

Putin told a press conference on Thursday that he supported a truce in principle but set out a host of details that need to be clarified before it is agreed. Kyiv has already endorsed the truce proposal, although Ukrainian officials have publicly raised doubts as to whether Moscow will commit to such a deal.

Speaking to reporters in Kyiv on Saturday, after virtual talks between Western allies hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Zelenskyy voiced Ukraine's support for the 30-day full ceasefire proposal to discuss a longer-term peace plan, but said Russia would attempt to derail talks with conditions and “buts”.

Starmer has told allies to “keep the pressure” on Putin to back a ceasefire in Ukraine, hailing Ukraine as the “party of peace.” Starmer said Putin will “sooner or later” have to “come to the table.

In a statement earlier on Saturday, Zelenskyy had accused Moscow of building up forces along the border.

“The build up of Russian forces indicates that Moscow intends to keep ignoring diplomacy. It is clear that Russia is prolonging the war,” he said.




However, Zelenskyy stressed that if Russia did not agree with the U.S. proposal there would be “specific, harsh and straightforward” response from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

He also said that Kyiv's troops were maintaining their presence in Russia's Kursk region after Trump said Friday that “thousands” of Ukrainian troops had been surrounded by the Russian military.

“The operation of our forces in the designated areas of the Kursk region continues,” Zelenskyy said. “Our troops continue to hold back Russian and North Korean groupings in the Kursk region. There is no encirclement of our troops.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. In the call, they discussed next steps to follow up on recent meetings in Saudi Arabia and agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. 

Ukraine's air force said Saturday that Russia had launched a barrage of 178 drones and two ballistic missiles over the country overnight. The attack was a mixture of Shahed-type drones and imitation drones designed to confuse air defenses. Some 130 drones were shot down, while 38 more failed to reach their targets.

Russia attacked energy facilities, causing significant damage, striking energy infrastructure in the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions, Ukraine's private energy company DTEK said in a statement on Saturday. Some residents were left without electricity.

“The damage is significant. Energy workers are already working on the ground. We are doing everything possible to restore power to homes as soon as possible,” the energy firm said.

Falling drone debris in Russia's Volgograd region sparked a fire in the Krasnoarmeysky district of the city, close to a Lukoil oil refinery, according to Gov. Andrei Bocharov, who provided no further details. Nearby airports temporarily halted flights, local media outlets reported. No casualties were reported.

The Volgograd refinery has been targeted by Kyiv's forces on several occasions since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, most recently in a drone attack on Feb. 15.

CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Saturday it will only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel implements their ceasefire agreement, calling it an “exceptional deal” aimed at getting the truce back on track.

Israeli airstrikes meanwhile killed nine people in the Gaza Strip who the military identified as militants, allegations denied by a U.K.-based aid group that said eight of its workers were killed.

A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire's second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Israel has said it won't pull out from the corridor, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling.

Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.

Edan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He is the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead.

Speaking at a protest camp set up last week outside Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages said Netanyahu was “violating the agreement he signed and abandoning the hostages in Gaza.”




“You want to sacrifice our children for the pleasures of power,” said Itzik Horn, father of hostage Eitan and freed hostage Iair.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday told negotiators to prepare for the continuation of talks regarding the release of hostages, his office said.

Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.

The Palestinian Journalists' Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone. 

The Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment, identifying all those targeted as militants. 

The army later released the names of six people it said were militants killed in the strikes, including one accused of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack and another who it said had been released as part of the ceasefire. The military said two others, including Islim, were militants posing as journalists.

The UK-based Al Khair Foundation said that eight of its workers were killed in the strikes. It denied the Israeli military's allegations that those killed were militants or had connections to Hamas.

Hamas in a statement called the attack a “serious escalation” showing Israel's attempts to “sabotage any opportunity” to implement the ceasefire agreement.

Also Saturday, Israel's military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers “will face disciplinary measures.”

No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce.

The United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.

Talks continued in Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel.

Israel and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce.

The first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza's border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid.

After the first phase ended early this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer.

Netanyahu's office said in a statement that he held in-depth discussions with the negotiating team and security officials on Saturday evening. Afterward, he told the negotiating team to prepare for continued talks as per the mediator's response to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff's proposal, the statement said. 

For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal.

The southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells.

Ahmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to “suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands.”

The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.

Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.

BERLIN (AP) — An assailant poured a liquid over a woman on a tram in eastern Germany on Sunday and set her on fire, police said. The woman was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries, while the attacker fled.

Police said no other people were hurt in the incident in the eastern city of Gera. Passengers stopped the tram by pressing an emergency button, and the assailant took the opportunity to flee as the doors opened. 

The tram driver immediately put out the flames with a fire extinguisher, and the 46-year-old woman was taken to a hospital by helicopter.

Police later said they were searching for the victim's husband, also aged 46. They called for anyone who sees him or knows where he is to inform them immediately, and said they couldn't currently rule out him posing a danger to the public.

There was no immediate word on a possible motive for the attack, or on what exactly the liquid used was.

Last month, Washington designated Tren de Aragua and other criminal groups across the region as global terrorist organizations, a move some analysts said could expose migrants who pay human smugglers to prosecution.Tren de Aragua has been blamed for a surge in crime in the Americas, and the US has accused it of activities, including human smuggling, gender-based violence, money laundering, and drug trafficking.

A delegation of more than 150 Druze dignitaries from Syria visited holy sites in Israel over the weekend. It was the first time since 1974 that such a delegation crossed the border.Videos circulating showing a visit of a Druze delegation to holy sites in Israel for first time in 50 years. pic.twitter.com/RGQTRLjiIC— Ohad ✡️ اوهاد ✡️ אהד (@MOhadIsrael) March 16, 2025  They came from the Druze villages in the Hader region, which is adjacent to the Golan Heights.Their two-day visit was coordinated with the highest security and diplomatic bodies in Israel. It included a visit to holy sites, such as the Tomb of Jethro (Nabi Shu'ayb), near Karnei Hittin in the Galilee, and warm reception ceremonies with their Israeli brethren.

Many of those who crossed the border have immediate families on the Israeli side. They were welcomed warmly and lovingly. The encounter was very moving.”Up until 1974, Druze delegations made a pilgrimage to the Tomb of Jethro, Amar said. But the visits came to a halt after the demilitarization agreement following the Yom Kippur War, separating families from both sides of the border and impeding religious figures from the Druze community in Syria from visiting their holy sites.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  “These were, first and foremost, religious, social, and communal visits,” Amar said. “They had nothing to do with politics or what is happening in the Middle East. We just renewed a measure that existed in the past, as the holiest place for the Druze is located near Tiberias.” AdvertisementThe latest visit was criticized sharply by many in the Arab world who saw it as a step toward normalization, which is still an obscene word for many, Amar said.“Many in the Arab world saw the visit in a negative way,” he said. “But 150,000 Palestinians work in Israel daily, and tens of thousands came from Gaza up until [the] October 7 [massacre]. We've never seen anyone make much noise about this, though. I really don't understand what the fuss was about.”An entirely different reality that is unfolding in Syria made the visit possible, Amar said. After years in which these visits were forbidden by the former regime, things were changing, he said.  Nevertheless, Amar was not optimistic about the current Syrian leadership.“No matter how much some in the West try to embellish it or ignore the genocide that was committed against the Alawite community, it is ISIS who seized power in Syria,” he said. “Whitewashing this is wrong and misleading. They are an extremist ISIS regime. I hope and believe that the Druze will know how to defend themselves from them. But, if necessary, Israel should lend a hand.”“Any clashes that start there will undoubtedly make it to our border,” he added. “We must not tolerate a similar event to October 7, nor allow ISIS to settle on our borders. This is an issue of national security for Israel, and it must not be allowed. We need to preserve ourselves as a state and as a community that is committed to each other. We should not and will not allow a similar massacre to take place.”More visits like this should be allowed, Amar said.“I think we will try to have more meetings,” he said. “It's been 51 years. It was like a holiday for us. We haven't seen our people on the other side of the border for so long, and some of us have never even met them at all.”The Druze delegates “were all excited and moved,” he added. “Videos show sheikhs in tears. It was such an emotional meeting. It's hard to explain. We, the Druze in Israel, were cut off from the Druze in Syria and Lebanon, and this is why this meeting was so touching.”“Just as Jews see themselves as being committed to all Jews around the globe, so are we Druze committed to our brethren,” Amar said. “We are a peace-loving people. We do not harm anyone, and we want to live in peace. I hope we remain in touch from now on.”

We, the Druze in Israel, were cut off from the Druze in Syria and Lebanon, and this is why this meeting was so touching.”“Just as Jews see themselves as being committed to all Jews around the globe, so are we Druze committed to our brethren,” Amar said. “We are a peace-loving people. We do not harm anyone, and we want to live in peace. I hope we remain in touch from now on.”
            



The latest visit was criticized sharply by many in the Arab world who saw it as a step toward normalization, which is still an obscene word for many, Amar said.“Many in the Arab world saw the visit in a negative way,” he said. “But 150,000 Palestinians work in Israel daily, and tens of thousands came from Gaza up until [the] October 7 [massacre]. We've never seen anyone make much noise about this, though. I really don't understand what the fuss was about.”An entirely different reality that is unfolding in Syria made the visit possible, Amar said. After years in which these visits were forbidden by the former regime, things were changing, he said.  Nevertheless, Amar was not optimistic about the current Syrian leadership.“No matter how much some in the West try to embellish it or ignore the genocide that was committed against the Alawite community, it is ISIS who seized power in Syria,” he said. “Whitewashing this is wrong and misleading. They are an extremist ISIS regime. I hope and believe that the Druze will know how to defend themselves from them. But, if necessary, Israel should lend a hand.”“Any clashes that start there will undoubtedly make it to our border,” he added. “We must not tolerate a similar event to October 7, nor allow ISIS to settle on our borders. This is an issue of national security for Israel, and it must not be allowed. We need to preserve ourselves as a state and as a community that is committed to each other. We should not and will not allow a similar massacre to take place.”More visits like this should be allowed, Amar said.“I think we will try to have more meetings,” he said. “It's been 51 years. It was like a holiday for us. We haven't seen our people on the other side of the border for so long, and some of us have never even met them at all.”The Druze delegates “were all excited and moved,” he added. “Videos show sheikhs in tears.

Thailand is known for being a vibrant tourist destination due to its diverse topography, which includes everything from turquoise waters, sandy beaches, forests with lush greenery, thrilling nightlife, and unique cultural experiences.With almost 1,000 islands and 2,400 km. of coastline, Israelis flock to the beaches in large numbers all year round, enjoying the ultimate relaxation together with amazing cheap food experiences. They are embraced by the Thai people with a smile, turning the visit into a rewarding vacation to cherish.  However, Thailand offers much more. Its northern parts are home to majestic Buddhist temples, heritage sites, ancient culture, karst cliffs, tropical jungles, animal sanctuaries, and awesome natural parks. Arriving in Bangkok, we did the unexpected. Instead of rushing to a majestic island, we aimed in the opposite direction for a four-day trip and found ourselves in the must-see Chiang Rai province. AdvertisementThe scenery here is dominated by pineapple plantation fields, and the delicious fruit can be found at every corner – even on the side the roads. Fresh, juicy, and tasty.Tea drinking is an ancient practice in the region, used for both celebration and ceremony. The Choui Fong Tea Plantation grows millions of tea plants, with the endless green hills leaving visitors speechless. The plantation covers an expansive area of over 1.6 sq.km. Here, tea bushes cascade along the hillside, creating a serene ambiance. A modern visitor center overlooks the marvelous hills,  where one can enjoy purchasing tea at the shop and admiring the Thai employees working in the hut. You can take your pick of a soft tea-leaf steamed bun, green tea, iced tea, or even a green tea cake.But Chiang Rai totally surprised us with its avant-garde temples, which were relatively new and quite unexpected. The unconventional “neo-traditional” style of Buddhist art is reflected in the Blue Temple, also known as Wat Rong Suea Ten, completed only nine years ago. What a striking modern artistic design.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The temple's construction was initiated by the local community in 1996 to replace an old abandoned temple that previously stood on the site. Its design by local artist Phuttha Kabkaew left us tongue-tied. AdvertisementHowever, when we came across the work of Kabkaew's teacher, our minds were completely blown. If there is a temple in Thailand that stands out from all others, it's the stunning Wat Rong Khun – the White Temple – designed, constructed, and opened to visitors in 1997.The genius behind this structural marvel is Chalermchai Kositpipat, and calling him a genius might be an understatement. Kositpipat, a Chiang Rai-born visual artist – primarily a painter – exhibits his works around the world. He is well-known for his use of Buddhist imagery in his art.His yet-unfinished White Temple complex is more than mere eye candy. It is a unique fusion of religious symbolism and contemporary art; traveling to this stunning destination was by itself worth the entire trip.  THE ATTRACTIONS here never cease to amaze. In front of a royal villa in a district of Chiang Rai, the admirable Mae Fah Luang Garden takes your breath away. This extraordinary botanical garden is bright and colorful, cultivated with rare plants and flowers that wrap around the grounds.But the highlight has yet to come. After an hour's drive north, we arrive at the Golden Triangle, a region where Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos meet on the Mekong River. Sailing on the mighty waterway is rewarding. The transboundary river is the world's 12th longest and the 3rd longest in East Asia. The Triangle has been famous as one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. After a four-hour drive southwest, we arrive in the Chiang Mai province. Soon, we discovered what a dream destination it was as well.Apparently, next year, Chiang Mai – Thailand's second largest city – will be celebrating its 730th anniversary. Ironically, its name literally means new city. King Mangrai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, which was, at the time, part of Greater India. The city became the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. The traditional temples we visited left us in awe. The magnificent Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is the most important temple, majestically looking from above at Chiang Mai city. Its exquisite golden pagoda is an architectural gem. Wat Sri Suphan, Chiang Mai's “Silver Temple,” is one of the most exciting and active temples, located outside its old walled city. The Wat Phra Singh golden temple is perhaps the largest Buddhist temple in town.  THE INTERCONTINENTAL Chiang Mai Mae Ping is an open museum of Lanna culture. (credit: MOTTI VERSES)Once in Chiang Mai, visitors are generally surprised by the fact that there is so much to discover other than its beautiful and historic temples. The province's breathtaking scenery makes Chiang Mai one of Asia's most attractive tourist destinations. The days there were just breathtaking.Thailand's jungle landscapeDoi Inthanon National Park is known as “the roof of Thailand” and is famous for its thick jungles and trails. The King and Queen Pagodas and adjacent beautiful gardens here are just marvelous. This project symbolizes deep respect for the Royal couple, serving as a unifying emblem for the Thai people.Hiking under a maze of bamboo, coffee, avocado, teak, sakura, wild banana, orchid, bird of paradise, and rubber trees and enjoying stormy waterfalls assures an unforgettable visit.THE JUNGLE landscape changes into cultivated rice fields, and we are at Longneck Karen Village, a refuge of Kayan tribespeople who migrated here from Myanmar.Women from this small minority are known worldwide for wearing rings around their necks to elongate them. In the past, it was meant to protect against tiger attacks. Today, it's considered a symbol of beauty and a modern-day accessory. The rings are heavy, but this doesn't deter the women from wearing them. What an experience it was.At the Baifern Valley elephant sanctuary, we fed a few friendly female animals. The elephants demonstrated some tricks and were enthusiastic when we stepped into the water to wash them. Rafting on the river was an adventure to cherish in Thailand's nature, away from the city.With Lanna – the ancient Thai state heritage – in mind, it was no wonder that our hotel in the city would significantly highlight the culture. The luxurious InterContinental Chiang Mai Mae Ping was home during the visit. The property by the Ping River was inaugurated in 1999. THE MAGNIFICENT Wat Phra, Doi Suthep's most important temple in Chiang Mai. (credit: MOTTI VERSES)For years, it was known as a legendary local Thai hotel chain under the name Imperial Mae Ping. Before COVID, the owners decided to invest in massive renovation works to modernize and position it among the top hotels in the city. Their final decision not to run it as a local hotel anymore was part of a vision that Chiang Mai would soon attract many international visitors. The InterContinental brand was their choice.“We officially rebranded and opened the hotel in November 2023 after the first phase of renovations was completed,” revealed Dutch general manager Peter Pottinga.“Our hotel, featuring 240 elegant rooms and suites, is an open museum of the Lanna culture. It is an inspired décor to showcase traditional crafts,” he said. The public areas in this InterContinental are amazingly designed with the ancient Thai spirit in mind. The outdoor swimming pool is attractive and relaxing.Hong's Chinese Restaurant was constructed here with travelers from Thailand's northern giant neighbor in mind.“Chiang Mai is attractive to the Chinese market as it is a five-hour drive from the border or a one-hour flight. However, we are constantly aiming to attract new markets, mainly Americans, Australians, British, and the Israelis as well,” Pottinga shared.“Chiang Mai might surprise the newcomers. The airport is a 10-minute drive [away], and in one day, you can enjoy nine temples. No other destination offers such a variety.“I am calling [for] travelers to learn more about Thai culture and discover what the north has to offer. It is not enough to associate Thailand with the islands alone. Allow yourself to combine both [the] islands' sandy beaches and the Chiang Mai province for a unique experience,” said Pottinga.Lonely Planet's Best In Travel 2025 recently named Chiang Mai a Top Global City. These respected guidebooks, and lately also a website, focus on unique destinations. Their experts are, without question and beyond doubt, in favor of the attractiveness of this region for this year. Past experience indicates that travelers will certainly follow. Sawadika – hello – North Thailand.The writer is the Travel Flash Tips publisher and was a guest of the hotel.

Arriving in Bangkok, we did the unexpected. Instead of rushing to a majestic island, we aimed in the opposite direction for a four-day trip and found ourselves in the must-see Chiang Rai province.

The Choui Fong Tea Plantation grows millions of tea plants, with the endless green hills leaving visitors speechless. The plantation covers an expansive area of over 1.6 sq.km. Here, tea bushes cascade along the hillside, creating a serene ambiance. A modern visitor center overlooks the marvelous hills,  where one can enjoy purchasing tea at the shop and admiring the Thai employees working in the hut. You can take your pick of a soft tea-leaf steamed bun, green tea, iced tea, or even a green tea cake.But Chiang Rai totally surprised us with its avant-garde temples, which were relatively new and quite unexpected.

But the highlight has yet to come. After an hour's drive north, we arrive at the Golden Triangle, a region where Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos meet on the Mekong River. Sailing on the mighty waterway is rewarding. The transboundary river is the world's 12th longest and the 3rd longest in East Asia. The Triangle has been famous as one of the largest opium-producing areas of the world since the 1950s. After a four-hour drive southwest, we arrive in the Chiang Mai province. Soon, we discovered what a dream destination it was as well.Apparently, next year, Chiang Mai – Thailand's second largest city – will be celebrating its 730th anniversary. Ironically, its name literally means new city. King Mangrai the Great founded the city as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom, which was, at the time, part of Greater India. The city became the center of Buddhism in northern Thailand. The traditional temples we visited left us in awe. The magnificent Wat Phra That Doi Suthep is the most important temple, majestically looking from above at Chiang Mai city. Its exquisite golden pagoda is an architectural gem. Wat Sri Suphan, Chiang Mai's “Silver Temple,” is one of the most exciting and active temples, located outside its old walled city. The Wat Phra Singh golden temple is perhaps the largest Buddhist temple in town.  THE INTERCONTINENTAL Chiang Mai Mae Ping is an open museum of Lanna culture.

President Donald Trump was seen stumbling up the steps of his Marine One chopper, sparking fears about his health. A video that surfaced on social media shows the president walking towards the helicopter with Elon Musk's son, Ã† A-Xii, and then tripping while trying to take the first step. However, he quickly regained balance and avoided any potential accident.

Trump and MAGA fans mocked Joe Biden in 2023 when the former president, who was 80 years old at the time, stumbled and fell at the Air Force Graduation ceremony in Colorado. Many questioned the then-president over his capability to lead the US and made speculations about his health. The same is now happening with Trump.

An X user shared the video, captioning it, “Would you look at that, Trump tripped on the stairs..Media completely silent about it.”

Many commented on the post, with one user saying, “If it had been Biden, it would've been headline news.” One user wrote, “Yep, it's that right leg again. They've got video of him having trouble getting out of the golf cart at Mar-a-Lago a few times. That's the same side of his body that has that black and blue mark on the back of his hand too.” Another said, “He's lacking stamina!”

“...and it looks like he's having difficulty lifting his child shield,” one user wrote, referring to Trump lifting Musk's son onto the stairs. “Old age and obesity are really catching up with him,” one user wrote, while another said, “He is unfit for office.” One said, “Of course, no one reports about it. Otherwise, his followers would see that he stumbles over his own legs and that he is no longer fit.”

Trump previously sparked concerns after he appeared to struggle to read a teleprompter. A clip that previously surfaced showed him incorrectly pronouncing the word ""patron saint"" by instead saying ""patriot saint,"" and then repeating it again.

The United States on Saturday launched airstrikes in Yemen, causing 31 fatalities in an attempt to target Iran-backed Houthi rebels and “defend American interests,” reported Reuters.

The US Central Command, in a post on social media, shared images of fighters taking off in an aircraft carrier and a bomb destroying a building compound in Yemen.

They said, “On March 15, US Central Command initiated a series of operations consisting of precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen to defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation.”

US President Donald Trump also took to Truth Social to announce the military operation against Houthi rebels in Yemen and warn Iran to cut ties with the group.

He said, ""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Addressing Iran, Trump said, “Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!”

Trump claimed the attacks were in response to the Houthi rebels hindering shipping in the Red Sea and harming American interests. He also took a dig at former President Joe Biden for his inaction in dealing with the Houthis.

The Houthis have vowed that that strikes “will not pass without response.” In a statement issued on the Al-Masirah TV station, they said, “Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation.”

The Yemen health ministry confirmed the death of 20 people, and injuries among at least nine others. On the Huthi Ansarollah website, they condemned the strikes calling them a ""US-British aggression"" and “criminal brutality” by the Trump administration.

The Houthis had announced on Tuesday, their intentions to resume their campaign to obstruct shipping in the Red Sea and control world shipping traffic, until Israel lifted its blockade of aid to Palestinians.

Earlier this month, the US, a staunch ally of Israel, reclassified the Houthis as a “foreign terrorist organisation”, stating that they had attacked the country's warships 174 times and its commercial vessels 145 times since 2023.

Joshua Riibe, the person of interest in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, had his passport seized by authorities in the Dominican Republic, the New York Post reported. Nearly 10 days after Konanki was seen with Riibe, his travel documents were confiscated by officials on the Caribbean island.

Riibe, an Iowa native, said he is cooperating with authorities. “I'm just trying to help them out,” he told NBC News. “The ocean is a dangerous place.”

Attorneys for Riibe acknowledged that his passport was seized. Riibe, a St. Cloud State University student, has been ordered to remain at the hotel during the investigation. He is reportedly “permanently” paired with police escorts.

Riibe is believed to be the last person to see Konkani alive before she disappeared. It is believed that the two went into the water during an overnight escapade, during which they kissed and cuddled. Riibe was later detained by police under “irregular conditions,” his parents Albert and Tina said.

The nation's attorney general's office questioned Riibe, during which he shared details about their overnight adventure on the beach on March 6 at around 4 am. Surveillance footage showed Konanki and Riibe walking arm-in-arm alongside friends while heading toward the beach. While Konanki's friends remained at the beach until around 5:50 am and then headed back to the hotel, Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach.

Riibe and Konanki reportedly went into waist-deep waters, but were soon swept out to sea by a big wave. Riibe claimed he grabbed Konanki to save her and brought her back closer to shore, during which he swallowed sea water.“I was a lifesaver. I grabbed her and pulled her out,” he told authorities, according to a transcript of the interview that Dominican Republic's Noticas Sin obtained.

Riibe claimed the salt water he ingested made him throw up. His last recollection of Konanki was the 20-year-old walking at an angle through the water over to where she had kept her belongings.

“The last time I saw her, I asked her if she was OK,” Riibe said. “I didn't hear her answer because I started vomiting all the sea water I had swallowed.”

Riibe said he passed out on the beach. He woke up hours later and went back to his room. Police have not filed any charges in the case yet. The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office asserted that Riibe is a person of interest, but not a suspect.

Meanwhile, clothing believed to belong to Konanki was found on a lounge chair at the beach where she vanished.The beachwear found reportedly bears a striking resemblance to the clothing Konanki was last seen wearing in surveillance footage captured the night she went missing.

Several violent tornadoes have been ripping through the US, leading to at least 32 fatalities after a storm system rapidly progressed across the country since Friday, reported the Associated Press.

Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and Oklahoma are some of the worst hit states. Missouri recorded the highest number of deaths out of all the states, with at least 12 people dead.

The death toll rose after eight people died on Friday, in Kansas, after more than 50 vehicles were involved in a collision on a highway.

“It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls,"" said coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, as quoted by AP, describing the experience of authorities attempting to rescue people amid the severe storm.

The governors of Arkansas and Georgia have both declared a state of emergency as weather is expected to grow more extreme from late Saturday onward. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee has also released $2,50,000 as a disaster recovery fund to help injured people.

Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt stated that 689 square kilometres of land had been burned in his state, along with 300 homes that were damaged or destroyed due to fires increasing due to the winds. Several communities have been ordered to evacuate.

The extreme weather conditions caused by the storm system moving across the country, are set to affect more than 100 million people, across the US. The deadly winds have caused tornadoes and dust storms and even fanned the flames of several wildfires.

The American Storm Prediction Centre claimed that the fast-moving storms posed a threat, especially if they exceeded hurricane force with a speed of 100 mph. They also said that tornadoes and hail “as large as baseballs” were expected on Saturday.

Eastern Louisiana, Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia, and the Florida panhandle, are at a high risk for tornadoes. Meanwhile, Texas, Kansas, Missouri, and New Mexico are likely to face wildfires.

Strong winds have also caused power outages for more than 2,00,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan, as per the site poweroutage.us.

The National Weather Service has issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota. Snow is expected to accumulate up to 6 inches in these regions, with gusty winds of up to 60 mph speed.

While such storms are not unusual in the country during this time of the year, an official from the Storm Prediction Centre in Oklahoma said that these storms were unique due to their large size and intensity, which created a substantial impact on large areas.

 By Saleem Ahmed and Saud Mehsud 

 QUETTA - Separatist militants drove a vehicle laden with explosives into a paramilitary convoy, killing at least five in southwestern Pakistan, officials said on Sunday, just days after the same group hijacked a train and held hostages for 36 hours. 

 The Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack in the district of Noshki in the restive province of Balochistan. 

 Senior Superintendent of Police for Noskhi district Hashim Momand said more than 30 paramilitary force members were also wounded. 

 Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement condemned the attack, which came as Pakistan deals with a growing security crisis in its regions bordering Afghanistan. 

 The BLA on Tuesday took over the Jaffar Express in a remote mountain pass in Balochistan province, blowing up train tracks in an attack that killed 31 soldiers and civilians, the military said. 

 In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which lies to the north of Balochistan and also shares a border with Afghanistan, the provincial chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned a series of attacks on police across the province. 

 He did not provide casualty numbers, but the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan Islamist militant group said there had been 16 attacks in the past 24 hours. 

 Pakistan's authorities have vowed to crack down on the growing insurgencies and said they are fuelled in part by militants finding safe haven in Afghanistan, a charge the ruling Afghan Taliban deny. Militant attacks often pick up in the warmer spring period as the cold winter months recede in mountainous border regions.

President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, citing an alleged Venezuelan gang invasion, to fast-track mass deportations and tighten his immigration crackdown.

Trump's declaration targets Tren de Aragua, claiming it operates under Venezuela's government. The move coincides with a federal judge in Washington blocking the deportation of five Venezuelans under the expected order, hinting at a legal battle ahead. The judge was set to consider expanding the ban just minutes after Trump's announcement.

“Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organisations, including TdA,” Trump's statement reads. 

“The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States,” he added. 

The act was last used during World War II to intern Japanese-American civilians and has only been invoked twice before, during World War I and the War of 1812. 

In his declaration, Trump argued that its use is justified, claiming the Tren de Aragua gang—often mentioned in his campaign speeches—has ties to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's regime.

Trump had discussed using the act during his campaign, prompting immigration groups to prepare for it. This led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before his declaration was even made public. 

The American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed the suit on behalf of five Venezuelans whose deportation cases had suddenly progressed in recent hours.

James E Boasberg, chief judge of the DC Circuit, issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deportation of five Venezuelans in immigration custody for 14 days under the act. 

The individuals believed they were about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was “to preserve the status quo.” He scheduled a hearing later in the afternoon to decide whether to extend the order to all Venezuelans in the United States.

Hours later, the Trump administration challenged the restraining order, arguing that blocking a presidential act before its announcement would undermine executive authority.

In its appeal, the Justice Department warned that allowing the order to stand would give district courts the power to halt urgent national security measures simply upon receiving a complaint. 

It warned that this could extend to actions like drone strikes, intelligence operations, or terrorist captures and extraditions. The court “should halt that path in its tracks,” the department said. 

The rapid legal battle underscores the controversial Act, which could grant Trump broad authority to deport people in the country illegally. It allows his administration to bypass some legal protections and quickly remove those it claims are gang members.

The White House has already labelled Tren de Aragua a terrorist organisation and is preparing to transfer about 300 suspected members to detention in El Salvador.

US President Donald Trump ordered on Saturday cuts in the staff of various government-funded media organisations, including Voice of America as his administration continues on the path of downsizing the federal workforce.

Voice Of America's director revealed that all of the organisation's employees have been put on leave.

Shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill to avert a government shutdown on Friday, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the US Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia, and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.

Kari Lake, Trump's senior adviser to the agency, posted on X on Saturday that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.

“For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced,” Associated Press quoted Agency for Global Media director Michael Abramowitz as saying in a statement.

Abramowitz added that “virtually” the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave.

“VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny,"" the statement added.

A video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America. Her video was made at a building leased by VOA that Lake described as a waste of money. She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building.

“We're doing everything we can to cancel contracts that can be cancelled, save more, downsize, and make sure there's no misuse of your dollars,” she said.

The press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it “condemns this decision as a departure from the US's historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the US government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move.”

The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. “The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies,"" said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement.

The Agency for Global Media is considered to be an arm of US diplomacy, running media organisations like Voice of America that transmits the country's domestic news to other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe, and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea, and Russia.

Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.

The reduction is a dramatic blow at a staple of post-Cold War order that has long had bipartisan support. Voice of America's directors have included Dick Carlson, the father of conservative commentator Tucker Carlson.

Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said.

“Without the international broadcasting, the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration's opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy,” AP quoted Kent, an international consultant on media ethics, as saying.

The order putting employees on administrative leave also states that the staff would continue to receive pay and benefits “until otherwise notified.” It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and to return equipment like phones and computers.

The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week canceled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from various independent news organisations.

Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.

A massive power outage has plunged Panama into darkness following an explosion and fire at the La Chorrera Thermoelectric Power Plant. The incident, which authorities believe was caused by a “technical fault” within one of the plant's generators, has disrupted electricity across the country.

Firefighters are currently working to extinguish the blaze, while officials assure the public that power will be gradually restored in the coming hours.

Panama's President, Jose Raul Mulino, addressed the nation via social media, saying, “The Director of ETESA informs me that the damage was caused by a private power generator that triggered the system's protection. Service will be restored little by little. Stay calm.”

The blackout has also severely impacted water services, as the operation of water treatment plants and wells nationwide depends on the electrical system. As a result, the supply of drinking water has been suspended until power is restored. Authorities have confirmed that staff remain on-site at each facility to resume operations as soon as possible.

Residents have been urged to remain patient as emergency crews work to address the crisis and restore essential services across the country.

A screenwriter has warned Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that their deal with Netflix is unlikely to be renewed, but if they get “divorced,” then the story could be different.

Marina Hyde, a journalist and screenwriter, per Daily Mail, that the streaming giant may “keep a vague hand in” if the Sussexes split.

“People are hanging around in case there's a divorce,” she said while sitting for The Rest is Entertainment podcast with Richard Osman.

“They [Netflix] are not going to renew. They might say we're continuing to develop projects with them,” she speculated.

“They [Netflix] are not going to renew. They might say we're continuing to develop projects with them. The reality is that a lot of people are hanging around in case there's a divorce. That might be why Netflix, or whoever it might be, who's got to deal with them, might keep a vague hand in.”

The Sussexes initially found success with their 2022 Netflix documentary, Harry & Meghan. However, Hyde called their Netflix projects “flopped.”

During the podcast, co-host Richard Osman proposed that Meghan should consider returning to acting. “Meghan is an actress. Cast her in something. This is what I advise Meghan, take a job in something. You could pretty much name your price and project for the first thing you go back into acting for. It's what she does,” he said.

Meanwhile, Prince Harry has publicly dismissed rumours about marital issues. During a media summit in New York last December, when journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin pressed the Duke, “They're fascinated Meghan is in California right now, and you're here. There are articles left and right about: 'Why are you making, doing independent events? Why aren't you doing them together?”

“Apparently we've bought or moved house 10, 12 times. We've apparently divorced maybe 10, 12 times as well. So it's just like, 'what?'” Harry responded by ridiculing the constant speculation.

“It's hard to keep up with, but that's why you just sort of ignore it. The people I feel most sorry about are the trolls. Their hopes are just built and built, and it's like, 'Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes', and then it doesn't happen. So I feel sorry for them. Genuinely, I do.”

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry ‘Butch' Wilmore, who have been stranded in space for nine months, are set to return to Earth soon, but significant bodily challenges await them after their long journey.

Williams and Wilmore are scheduled to return to Earth, no sooner than March 19. A joint mission by NASA and Elon Musk's SpaceX, Crew Dragon-10, has set out for the International Space Station, and is expected to dock on Sunday, March 16. 

The two astronauts had reached the ISS aboard a Boeing Starliner capsule, but were unable to return, due to concerns surrounding the technical safety of the spacecraft.

While they eagerly await their return to the planet, they are likely to face several physical complications due to their prolonged exposure to space and a lack of gravity. 

Astronaut Terry Virts had likened the experience of acclimating to Earth again, to the flu, saying that he had required weeks to recover from the dizziness.

Former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao told NewsNation Prime, that Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore might experience trouble walking once they return.

Also Read: Who are Crew-10 astronauts replacing Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore on ISS? What next?

He stated that astronauts experience “baby feet” after a long period of space travel. He said that the weightlessness experienced in space causes calluses on the feet to disappear.

“You basically lose the thick part of your skin,” Chiao said.

According to NASA, astronauts experience a loss of bone density and muscle atrophy, due to the lack of Earth's gravity bearing down on the body. This can lead to serious health complications if not countered through exercise and rehabilitation. 

In space, the tissues of bones reshape themselves and cells that build new bone tissue start to slow down, while those which break old bone tissue continue at the same pace.

For every month in space, an astronaut's weight-bearing bones lose one percent of density, making them weaker and more brittle. After 10 months in space, Williams and Wilmore will have to counter this loss after their return.

The human heart, brain and circulatory system are also affected due to a prolonged stay in space. The increase of fluid in the brain can lead to hearing loss, vision loss and a cerebral edema. The increase in pressure on the brain, according to NASA, causes a disorder known as Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS).

The heart in space changes from an oval shape to a round shape, and muscle atrophy constricts blood vessels, which causes damage to the circulatory system.

Upon return to the Earth, the loss of blood volume, can make it difficult to regulate blood pressure, and cause dizziness, nausea and fainting spells.

Exposure to space radiation, can cause significant long-term health issues for astronauts, putting them at risk for cancer, degenerative diseases and issues with the central nervous system.

Las Vegas Metro police investigated reports of a possible shooting at a hotel on the Strip Saturday evening.

Officers responded shortly before 5:40 p.m. to a hotel in the 2800 block of South Las Vegas Boulevard, near Circus Circus Drive, following reports of gunfire and fights.

While penning this article, LVMPD had not found “no victims or evidence” confirming a shooting. However, out of an “abundance of caution,” the hotel was evacuated.

“There are preliminary reports of shots fired in the 2900 block of Las Vegas Boulevard. No victims have been located. There is a heavy police presence in the area,” LVMPD stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post.

Metro detectives reported that a sudden fight erupted inside the Circus Circus hotel, prompting multiple individuals to flee the property. The chaos spread outside, leading to additional physical altercations among the crowd, according to Metro police.

“People started crying. People started yelling, and a lot of people started running,” said Shahiera Langendam, a guest at Circus Circus, told Las Vegas Review-Journal.

“This was actually the most scariest thing I have ever experienced.”

“A woman told me she heard gunshots,” Langendam further recalled. “We heard a lot of stories about people possibly stabbing or shooting. That's what I heard.”

However, by Saturday evening, LVMPD confirmed that no further evidence of a shooting had been found. Metro police later stated that “All reports of gunfire have been unfounded at this time.”

“Detectives learned that a fight broke out inside of the venue causing numerous individuals to run out of the property,” Metro police said in another press release later the day.

“This caused panic amongst the crowd and several other fights broke out outside of the property.”

Sunita Williams has revealed what she will miss the most about space. On being asked this question during a press conference from the space station, she replied, “Everything,” The Economic Times reported.

""This has been Butch and mine third flight to the ISS. We helped put it together, we have been up here watching it change. Just living here gives us a unique perspective -- not just outside the window, obviously -- but on how to solve problems. I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration and perspective when I leave so I am going to have to bottle it up, somehow,"" she said.

Williams also revealed what the hardest part of being stranded was. ""It has been a rollercoaster for them [family and supporters], probably more than it has been for us. We are here, we have a mission. We do what we have to do every day. The hardest thing has been not knowing when we'd come back. All of that uncertainty has been the most difficult part,"" she said.

SpaceX's Crew-10 mission finally docked at the International Space Station on Sunday morning, March 16, paving the way for NASA astronauts Williams and Butch Wilmore's successful return to Earth. After lifting off Friday from Florida, the Space-X space capsule docked at the ISS at 12:05 am EST.

The arriving crew reportedly entered the ISS just before 2:00 am EST, and were greeted by Wilmore. Williams snapped photographs of her crewmates, smiling. Both the crews embraced each other, according to the New York Post.

“Houston, thank you for tuning in this early morning,” Williams said. “It was a wonderful day. Great to see our friends arrive. Thank you so much.”

While the exact time when Williams will return to Earth has not been revealed, she will arrive back no earlier than Wednesday, March 19. Ahead of their departure, mission teams will be tasked with reviewing weather conditions at the splashdown sites off the coast of Florida.

There is an abiding sense of pessimism in world politics today. Whether in Asia, Africa, Europe, or North America, a deep and pervasive sense of anxiety about our collective future is unmistakably evident. And there aren't any compelling ideas that can help humanity navigate this moment of uncertainty and anxiety, nor are there any visionary leaders or global public intellectuals to offer us a common global vision. The world seems precariously adrift, like a ship without a rudder on a stormy night. 

To attribute this merely to Trump's return to the White House or Russia's invasion of Ukraine would be overly simplistic and a tad ahistorical. This geopolitical depression has been in the making for some time. A desire for exclusive spheres of influence, a belief in one's inherent superiority, the desire to moralise, the inability to rise above feel-good rhetoric, and a fundamental unwillingness to acknowledge diverse global viewpoints have all contributed to getting us where we are today — with broken promises, lost trust and growing suspicions. 

But why should we be concerned about world politics and global order at all if all that matters are the interests of States? For one, because world politics, or our international life, is not merely a sum of relations among individual States but is made up of common global goals, leadership, visions, and outcomes that go beyond the narrow frames of individual State interests. World orders allow individual States to pursue their legitimate interests with more ease, and pursue common goals beyond the confines of States. 

One of the striking features of the current age of pessimism in world politics is that the pursuit of global good is no longer what dominates the global discourse today. While it is true that in world politics, much of what goes on in the name of the pursuit of good is sheer hypocrisy, and yet hypocrisy allows us to have benchmarks. And benchmarks help us judge if we are on the right track. 

Without a teleological direction, contemporary world politics lacks a sense of direction. Even if not always considered good by everyone, common directions still offer a sense of purpose to world politics. Examples of such global purpose include promoting liberal democracy, humanitarian intervention, nuclear non-proliferation, and economic globalisation via international institutions. All of these were flawed both in concept or execution, some even blatantly violating international law. But they provided a sense of purpose in world politics. Sometimes a faulty political purpose with a mendable design flaw is better than no purpose at all. 

Amidst such collective pessimism, States are doing what they think they must. Some are scrambling to defend themselves, some are securing their spheres of influence, some are seeking to dominate others, some are finding ways to reduce dependencies, and some are learning lessons from the misfortunes of others. Across Asia, Europe, and North America, international life today lacks purpose beyond managing chaos or exploiting it. State interests have almost entirely eclipsed everything else. 

Beyond such pursuit of State interests, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes good in the global context. The rise of deglobalisation, in a sense, is due to a lack of consensus on what constitutes global good and the collective inability to realise it. Deglobalisation is not just an economic phenomenon; it also involves the erosion of institutions, regimes, norms, and values created over a long period. If the pursuit of global good was partly due to order-building motivations of great powers, there is little visionary global leadership today nor order-building motivations. There is no Gandhi, Wilson, or Mandela today. 

The pursuit of global good and the desire to organise the world through consensus, however flawed such attempts in the past may have been, have both vanished from global conversations today. The United States (US), leader of the status quo, is no longer keen to preserve it; reformists like India struggle to create consensus; and China, the true revisionist at heart, is watching the US becoming its own revisionist rival. 

The challenge today is not a material one, but one of ideas. The world today is more prosperous, more globalised and more technologically advanced than ever before in human history, and yet, paradoxically so, it is faced with one of the most pessimistic eras in recent history. The problem isn't wealth, it's the poverty of ideas. 

Humanity's current predicament is due to a lack of big ideas that can rally humanity, and the inability of global public intellectuals to provide those ideas. Ideas exist, but they are largely adversarial, parochial, and accusatory — incapable of bridging global divides. As Shakespeare wrote in Julius Caesar, “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings”. We are where we are today because we lack bold ideas to shape our common destiny. 

What can India do? “We are a bridge, we are a voice, we are a viewpoint, a channel,” foreign minister S Jaishankar told us a few years ago. If so, this is the time to be that bridge.

Clothing believed to belong to Sudiksha Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student who went missing while on a spring break holiday in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, was found on a lounge chair at the beach where she vanished. CDN obtained photos that showed a white netted sarong draped over the beach chair, as well as a pair of beige flip-flops covered with sand kept next to the leg of the sun lounger.

The beachwear reportedly bears a striking resemblance to the clothing Konanki was last seen wearing in surveillance footage captured the night she vanished. The clothing shows no signs of tampering. Law enforcement believe that the Indian-origin woman left her clothes on the lounge chair, and then jumped into the ocean in a brown bikini, eventually drowning.

However, foul play has not been ruled out. Iowa resident Joshua Riibe, a senior at Minnesota's St. Cloud State University, has been named a person of interest.

Riibe has been kept under 24 hour surveillance, with sources claiming a high-ranking member of the Public Prosecutor's Office could intensify interrogations, according to the New York Post. Riibe has reportedly refused to answer several key questions about the case after getting a lawyer.

Meanwhile, Riibe's parents said in a statement, according to WTAE, “Despite his full willingness to cooperate, Josh has been detained under irregular conditions and subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.”

While the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, the law enforcement agency in Konanki's hometown in Virginia, also said Riibe is a person of interest, they added that he was not a suspect. The search already entered its eighth day Saturday, March 15. Missing posters describe Konanki as 5 foot 3 with black hair and brown eyes.

Virginia Sheriff's Office spokesperson Thomas Julia previously told Fox News Digital that police want to “make sure the investigation is comprehensive and includes all possible assets and techniques.” “We are working closely with the FBI on all of this, and they are working with the Dominican National Police,” Julia added.

Ranjani Srinivasan, an international student from India at Columbia University who fled the United States after her student visa was revoked, expressed fear that even low-level political speech, such as posting on social media, could turn into a “dystopian nightmare.”

The Department of State revoked 37-year-old Srinivasan's visa on March 5, citing her alleged involvement in activities supporting Hamas, a designated terrorist organisation.

The department said that it had obtained footage of Srinivasan using the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Home App at New York's LaGuardia Airport to self-deport on March 11.

“I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech or just doing what we all do — like shout into the abyss that is social media — can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathizer and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety,” Srinivasan told The New York Times in an interview on Friday.

Srinivasan's legal troubles began last year when she was arrested outside Columbia University. On the same day pro-Palestinian protesters occupied Hamilton Hall, she was caught in a police crackdown while trying to pass through a crowd after a picnic with friends.

Although she wasn't involved in the protest, the police pushed her as she walked through the scene and arrested her, The New York Times report added.

She was briefly detained and issued two summonses, one for obstructing traffic and the other for refusing to disperse. Her case was dismissed shortly after, and she did not face any criminal charges, as confirmed by her lawyers and court documents, the report added. 

Srinivasan's departure from the US to Canada follows an escalating crackdown on foreign nationals linked to last year's pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Fearing for her safety after her student visa was revoked, she made a swift decision to leave the country.

The Trump administration has often linked participation in campus protests against Israel's actions in Gaza with support for Hamas. Columbia University, home to many international students, including from India, has become a central focus in the government's efforts to clamp down on campus activism.

A wave of storms reportedly swept into Alabama on Saturday, March 15. They brought with them a rarely-seen threat level for possible long-track tornadoes, accompanied by winds of up to 70 m.p.h., golf ball-sized hail and torrential rain.

According to a report by Forecast Frontier on X, a Walmart in Calera has been damaged by the tornado. The post reads, “Unfortunately now hearing multiple reports of some decently significant damage in Calera, Alabama from this likely tornado. A Walmart in Calera has also been hit, with “numerous” injuries being reported. Just comes to show how incredibly long, past 24+ hours here across the Southern/Mid South US.”

Another post confirming this says, “Ok a tornado touchdown in Calera near the wal mart. Well here I am!!! I peaked outside and it was crazy!!!”

Some posts on X also claim that a trailer park was hit by the tornado. “Tornado in Calera, AL is doing damage! It hit a trailer park & almost hit the NWS Birmingham Office. God I hope thats the worst we get for the rest of the night,” one reads.

Another post confirming the same says, “Reports of a trailer park in Calera, AL taking a direct hit”.

Another post says, “Calera, Alabama. Tornado. WalMart damaged. Multi calls to 911 reporting injuries. Trailer park also with damage.”

Some posts on X also say that the tornado is now moving towards Chelsea, Alabama from Calera. “8:15CT: Tornado producing storm moving away from Calera/I-65 and toward Chelsea, AL. Seek immediate shelter in the warned area,” one post reads.

People have been urged to call 911 for emergencies during the storm, especially when it poses an immediate threat to life or property. For instance, people can call 911 when a tree falls on a home, during a fire, a medical emergency or a crime in progress.

Ranjani Srinivasan, a Columbia University student from India who reportedly left the United States some days back, reportedly dodged federal immigration officials twice after her student visa was revoked.

The 37-year-old, who was pursuing a doctoral degree in urban planning recently found out that her student visa was revoked.

The Trump administration said on Friday it had revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student at Columbia, for ""advocating for violence and terrorism"".

Srinivasan opted to ""self-deport"" on Tuesday, the department said. Officials did not say what evidence they had that Srinivasan had advocated violence.

Her lawyers, however, have strongly denied that she engaged in any illegal activities or called for violence.

The first encounter occurred eight days ago on Friday when three federal immigration agents arrived at Srinivasan's Columbia University apartment, seeking the student who had recently discovered her visa was no longer valid.

Srinivasan did not open the door at the time, the New York Times reported.

The agents returned the next night, just hours after another Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil, was detained by immigration authorities. This time, Srinivasan was not at home.

After the arrest of another student, Srinivasan quickly packed a few of her belongings, left her cat with a friend, and boarded an immediate flight to Canada from LaGuardia Airport.

So, when the agents arrived for a third time last Thursday night, armed with a judicial warrant to search her apartment, she had already left the country.

“The atmosphere seemed so volatile and dangerous,” Ms. Srinivasan, 37, said on Friday in an interview with The New York Times, her first public remarks since leaving. “So I just made a quick decision.”

Columbia has come under immense pressure from the Trump administration in recent weeks, with the US government cancelling USD 400 million in federal grants and contracts to the school, much of it for medical research, as punishment for not cracking down harder on students and faculty who criticised Israel's military action in Gaza during large protests last spring.

President Donald Trump and other officials have accused the protesters of being ""pro-Hamas"", referring to the militant group that attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.

The administration threatened to permanently end federal funding to the Ivy League school unless it took a variety of steps, including changing its admissions process and ceding faculty control of its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department to a receiver for five years.

Columbia University's campus has been in crisis since the arrest on Saturday of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead last spring's protests.

Leaving her cat with a friend and booking a last-minute flight, Ranjani Srinivasan, an international student from India, fled the United States after her student visa was revoked and federal immigration agents arrived at her door.

The 37-year-old, who was pursuing a doctoral degree in urban planning at Columbia University, had recently discovered that her visa had been canceled.

She made a swift decision to leave, saying, “The atmosphere seemed so volatile and dangerous,” as quoted by The New York Times.

Srinivasan abandoned her apartment and belongings, flying to Canada in search of safety. Her flight from LaGuardia Airport followed a week of repeated visits from federal immigration agents, who had been searching for her since her visa was revoked.

The report further added that she had become entangled in the government's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests, with accusations of supporting violence and links to Hamas, though no evidence was provided.

Srinivasan first learned of her visa cancellation on March 5, when she received an email from the US Consulate in Chennai. Confused and unsure, she reached out to Columbia's international student office for guidance.

However, by March 7, when immigration agents arrived, she was already in the process of leaving the country. Her decision to flee came after a night of fear and uncertainty.

“I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech or just doing what we all do — like shout into the abyss that is social media — can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathizer and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety,” Srinivasan told The New York Times.

The situation became dramatic when agents arrived at her apartment. Srinivasan, who had already arranged her escape, was on the phone at the time.

She recalled that she was discussing her flight details with a friend in Canada when she heard the doorbell and panicked.

Her roommate had to handle the situation as the agents were persistent, explaining that Srinivasan had already left. The report added that the agents' relentless search left her roommate to manage the pressure. 

In her rush to Canada, Srinivasan left behind her academic life at Columbia and the life she had built since arriving in the US from India as a Fulbright scholar.

“I'm just surprised that I'm a person of interest,” she said. “I'm kind of a rando, like, absolute rando,” she said, using slang for random.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Srinavasan voluntarily self-deported. 

In a statement issued by the US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated about the deportation, “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country. I am glad to see one of the Columbia University terrorist sympathizers use the CBP Home App to self-deport.”

Musk's haircut went viral earlier this month as many found it similar to the looks kept by Adolf Hitler and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un which began a controversy online. However, it seems that he was unbothered by the buzz his haircut created online as Musk is bringing back the look.

In the latest post shared by him on X, the 53-year-old posed with his 4-year-old son X A-Xii. Along with the picture he wrote, “Going back to this haircut.” While he did not specify the exact haircut he was referring to, the haircut he does at the moment does look similar to his 2021 style which many netizens compared with Hitler's. The picture Musk posted showed side shaves with long waves at the top of the head.

Trump has reclassified the Houthi group as a ""foreign terrorist organisation""

At least 31 people were killed as the US launched large-scale strikes on Yemen, with President Donald Trump warning Iran-aligned Houthis that ""their time is up"". Trump also warned Iran that it needed to ""immediately"" halt support for the group.

The US strikes on Yemen's capital Sanaa, Saada, a Houthi stronghold, Al Bayda, and Radaa killed 31 people and injured 101, mostly women and children, the Houthi health ministry said.

""The explosions were violent and shook the neighborhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children,"" one of the residents told news agency Reuters.

Speaking on The Lex Fridman Podcast, PM Modi talked about the Russia-Ukraine war.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, speaking on the Lex Fridman podcast, reiterated his call for diplomacy to resolve the war in Ukraine, telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that ""this is not the time for war"" while advising Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that battlefield victories will not lead to a lasting resolution.

Mr Fridman, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since 2015, is the host of The Lex Fridman Podcast on YouTube. Mr Fridman's channel has over 4.5 million subscribers and close to 820 million views.

Speaking on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, PM Modi said he has close ties with both countries.

""I have a close relationship with Russia and Ukraine alike,"" he said. ""I can sit with President Putin and say that this is not the time for war. And I can also tell President Zelensky, in a friendly way, that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield.""

""Ukraine may hold countless discussions with their allies, but it will bear no fruit. Discussions must include both parties instead,"" he added.

The Kremlin confirmed today that Russia and the United States had discussed the ""next steps"" to end the war, following renewed diplomatic efforts. Hours earlier, Kyiv's European allies had urged Moscow to commit to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The United States had pushed for the ceasefire after talks in Saudi Arabia, which Ukraine accepted.

Speaking on the latest developments, PM Modi said: ""Initially, it was challenging to find peace, but now, the current situation presents an opportunity for meaningful and productive talks between Ukraine and Russia. There has been a lot of suffering. Even the Global South has suffered.""



President Putin has so far refrained from agreeing to the proposal, listing a series of conditions and raising what he called ""serious questions"" about the initiative.

Zelensky accused Moscow of delaying peace efforts, saying, ""The Kremlin does not want to end the war. They want to first improve their situation on the battlefield before agreeing to any ceasefire.""

The Russian foreign ministry confirmed that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. According to Moscow, the two discussed ""concrete aspects of the implementation of understandings"" reached at a US.-Russia summit in Saudi Arabia last month.

Fabian Schmidt, a 34-year-old German national with a valid US green card, was detained by immigration officers at Logan Airport in Massachusetts on March 7. According to Newsweek, Mr Schmidt, who has lived in the US since his teenage years and currently resides in New Hampshire, was returning from a trip to Luxembourg.

As per his family, Mr Schmidt was arrested, stripped naked, and subjected to violent interrogation before being transferred to the Donald W. Wyatt detention facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island. His family claims they are unaware of the reasons for his detention, stating that Schmidt's green card was recently renewed and he has no active court issues.

Notably, Mr Schmidt's partner had gone to pick him up at the airport but waited four hours before contacting authorities when he failed to appear. The family is seeking answers about his detention and is working to secure his release.

""It was just said that his green card was flagged,"" said Astrid Senior, his mother. She said her son was subjected to humiliating and abusive treatment by immigration officials. She alleged that he was ""violently interrogated"", forcibly stripped naked, and then subjected to a cold shower.

""He hardly got anything to drink. And then he wasn't feeling very well and he collapsed,"" she said. Ms Senior explained that her son's green card had been legally reissued in 2023 after he reported losing his previous one. Despite having a valid, newly issued green card, Mr Schmidt's travel document was flagged when he attempted to reenter the United States.

US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Assistant Commissioner of Public Affairs Hilton Beckham told Newsweek on Saturday: ""If statutes or visa terms are violated, travellers may be subject to detention and removal. Due to federal privacy regulations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot disclose details about specific cases.""

Mr Schmidt's detention has ignited widespread outrage and raised concerns about the stringent immigration policies under the Trump administration. This case is the latest in a series of incidents where lawful US residents have been detained at airports, sparking debates about the enforcement and potential misuse of immigration laws.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The first US strikes against Yemen's Huthis since President Donald Trump took office in January killed at least 21 people, the rebels said Sunday, as Washington warned Iran to stop backing the group.

The Huthis, who have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, said children were among those killed by the intense barrage of strikes.

An AFP photographer in the rebel-held capital Sanaa heard three explosions and saw plumes of smoke rising from a residential district, and strikes were also reported in Yemen's northern Saada region, a Huthi stronghold.

""Nine civilians were killed and nine others were injured, most of them seriously,"" the Huthis' health and environment ministry said in a statement on their Saba news agency, reporting the strikes on Sanaa.

A strike in the Saada region killed at least 10 people and wounded others, according to the Huthi Ansarollah website, condemning what it called ""US-British aggression"" and Washington's ""criminal brutality"".

A separate strike on a house in Saada's Alshaaf district killed two people, Ansarollah said.

The US Central Command (CENTCOM), which posted images of fighters taking off from an aircraft carrier and a bomb demolishing a building compound, said ""precision strikes"" were launched to ""defend American interests, deter enemies, and restore freedom of navigation"".

There was no immediate comment from British authorities.

Trump, in a post on social media, vowed to ""use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective"", citing the Huthis' threats against Red Sea shipping.

'Escalation with escalation'

The Houthis vowed that the strikes ""will not pass without response"".

""Our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation,"" the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on the rebel Al-Masirah TV station.

Trump also warned Iran that it must ""immediately"" cut support to the Houthis.

The rebels, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the ""axis of resistance"" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the United States.

They have launched scores of drone and missile attacks at ships passing Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians.

The campaign crippled the vital route, which normally carries about 12 percent of world shipping traffic, forcing many companies into a costly detour around southern Africa.

The Palestinian group Hamas, grateful for the Houthi support, hit out Saturday at the US strikes, branding them ""a stark violation of international law and an assault on the country's sovereignty and stability"".

'Hell will rain down'

The US has launched several rounds of strikes on Houthi targets, some with British support.

After halting their attacks when Gaza's ceasefire took effect in January, the Houthis announced on Tuesday that they would resume them until Israel lifts its blockade of aid to the shattered Palestinian territory.

Trump's statement did not reference the dispute over Israel, but focused on previous Houthi attacks on merchant shipping.

""To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" he said.

""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!""

Earlier this month, the United States reclassified the Houthi movement as a ""foreign terrorist organisation"", banning any US interaction with it.

Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the Houthis had ""attacked US warships 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023"".

The Houthis captured Sanaa in 2014 and were poised to overrun most of the rest of the country before a Saudi-led coalition intervened.

The war has largely been on hold since a 2022 ceasefire, but the promised peace process has stalled in the face of the Houthi attacks on Israel and Israel-linked shipping.

Crew-10 ISS Space Docking Highlights: Four crew members of NASA's SpaceX Crew-10 mission have reached the space station. The Crew-10 mission carries NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov to ISS.

NASA and SpaceX launched a crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS) to bring home NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been stranded in space since last June.

The Dragon spacecraft took off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Centre in Florida at 7.03 pm ET on Friday (4.33 am IST). The Dragon docked on to the ISS around 10 am.

Here are the highlights from the crew-10 ISS space docking:

Sunita Williams is classified under the GS-15 pay grade, which is the highest level for federal employees under the General Schedule (GS) system

A pair of astronauts stranded for more than nine months on the International Space Station were a step closer to returning home Sunday after a replacement crew docked with the orbital outpost.

The astronauts were shown on live TV embracing and hugging their counterparts in zero gravity on the space station shortly after their SpaceX Crew Dragon arrived at 0545 GMT.

NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore embarked on a 10-day mission aboard the Boeing Starliner on June 5, 2024, but the spacecraft experienced thruster malfunctions during its approach and docking maneuvers.This resulted in an extensive investigation by NASA and Boeing back on the ground, with the space agency finally declaring the Starliner too risky to carry astronauts back home. The Starliner instead returned empty, without experiencing further major issues.

The two astronauts are stranded in space for nearly 10 months now.

While walking on Earth, our feet face a lot of resistance in the form of gravity and friction, which makes the skin on the soles thicker. It protects us from feeling discomfort and pain while protecting us from general wear and tear.



However, after spending months in space, the harder skin comes off and the feet are left very soft and tender. Until the feet build up hard skin again, which can take from a few weeks to a couple of months, walking can be uncomfortable and even distressing.

A white netted sarong and beige flip-flops believed to belong to missing Indian student Sudiksha Konanki were found on a lounge chair at a Dominican Republic beach where she vanished over a week ago, according to local reports.

Images obtained by CDN show the clothing undisturbed, with no signs of tampering. Authorities believe the 20-year-old may have left her belongings on the chair before heading into the ocean in a brown bikini.

Ms Konanki, a University of Pittsburgh student, was reported missing around 4 pm on March 6 by her group of five friends with whom she travelled to the Caribbean nation. Surveillance footage shows her walking towards the beach with her friends. The others later returned to the hotel, leaving her behind with 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, a senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, according to authorities.

A clip from the Riu Republica Resort in Punta Cana shows Ms Konanki walking arm-in-arm with an unidentified man -- believed to be Mr Riibe -- along a resort pathway, accompanied by friends. She was seen wearing a white T-shirt, shorts, and her hair tied in a ponytail.

Dominican police have since named Mr Riibe a 'person of interest' in the case, confirming that he was the last person seen with the missing student.

His parents released a statement to CBS News saying they hope she is ""found as soon as possible.""

While Dominican authorities initially suspected drowning, Ms Konanki's father has urged investigators to explore other possibilities, like abduction. The family also finds it unusual that Ms Konanki's phone and wallet were left with her friends, as she always carried her phone with her.

Authorities have deployed drones and AI-assisted surveillance to scan the ocean, while Interpol has issued a 'yellow notice' for missing persons. The University of Pittsburgh said it is working with the FBI, DEA, and Homeland Security in the investigation.

Dominican President Luis Abinader revealed in a news conference that Joshua Riibe reported a wave hitting them while they were on the beach, but no blood or signs of violence have been found at the scene.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

US Vice President JD Vance, who had recently found himself at the center of a viral internet meme storm, is now facing backlash on social media after he made a joke about his wife, Usha Vance - once a high-powered lawyer and now the second lady of the US.

During an event in Michigan, Vance first praised his wife, saying she is doing a ""great job"" as a second lady of the US and that he is ""proud"" to have her by his side. However, what he said next did not sit well with social media users.

""Here's the thing - The cameras are all on; anything I say, no matter how crazy, my wife Usha has to smile, laugh, and celebrate it,"" the Vice President said.

Usha, standing behind Vance, smiled and laughed.

A 17-second video of the incident went viral on social media, with users claiming that the second lady is in an ""unhappy marriage"" and calling Vance a 'red flag'.

""She looks uncomfortable and miserable,"" one user said.

She looks uncomfortable and miserable.

Another wrote, ""Usha: blink twice if you're being held hostage.""

Usha: blink twice if you're being held hostage.

""Oh and wifey smiles, laughs nd celbrates because she acts on commnds!! She's embarrassed not amused,"" one user wrote.

Оh and wifey smiles, laughs nd celbrates because she acts on commnds!! She's embarrassed not amused

Slightly abusive

Run Usha, run!

However, some even came in support of Vance.

""Just another pathetic attempt at making him look bad,"" said one of the X users.

Just another pathetic attempt at making him look bad. It is not working 😂

Another said, ""Imagine having a wife who loves and supports you. The owners of this account have no idea what that's like.""

It must just eat you alive that the Trump administration have such an intelligent, literate , non woke VP. 🤣😂😝🤡

A JD Vance meme fest sparked earlier this month after his fiery confrontation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on February 28. During the tense Oval meeting with Vance and US President Donald Trump on one side and the Ukrainian leader on the other, the Vice President questioned the latter's request for additional US funding, challenged his credibility, and issued a stark warning - suggesting that Ukraine could lose American support if it didn't accept the terms on offer.

The exchange, witnessed by many US and international media, led to Zelensky walking out of the White House and leaving the diplomatic relations between Washington and Kyiv severely strained.

Social media users wasted no time in mocking Vance, turning him into a political meme star with grotesque caricatures of his face edited, ballooned, and mashed into everything and depicting him in exaggerated forms - ranging from an overweight monster to a child holding a lollipop. The Republican leader also joined the meme fest last week by posting his own meme on X with a classic pointing Rick Dalton way.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Faisal Nadeem was gunned down at Mangla bypass in Pakistan's Punjab district. (Representational)

Faisal Nadeem alias Abu Qatal, the nephew of 26/11 attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed and a handler in several terror strikes in India, has been gunned down in a targeted attack in Pakistan, according to multiple news reports.

According to the reports, unidentified gunmen opened fire at a vehicle in which Faisal Nadeem was traveling. The attack took place at Mangla bypass in the Jhelum district of Pakistan's Punjab.

Nadeem was one of the handlers behind the Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists who carried out attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri in 2023. The attacks, carried out over two days, claimed seven lives and injured many others.

The NIA last year filed a chargesheet, naming Abu Qatal, Sajid Jutt and Mohd Qasim as the Pakistan-based handlers who guided the terrorists in carrying out the attacks. Qatal was operating in Kashmir in 2000 and was involved in multiple attacks before he shifted back to Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir and had been handling Lashkar's terror launchpads and pushing terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Ranjani Srinivasan, a 37-year-old Indian student pursuing a doctoral degree in urban planning at Columbia University, was forced to flee the United States after her student visa was revoked. The US Department of State canceled her visa on March 5, citing security concerns related to her alleged involvement in activities supporting Hamas.

Srinivasan's troubles began when she became entangled in the government's crackdown on pro-Palestinian protests. Despite no evidence being provided, she was accused of supporting violence and links to Hamas. The situation escalated when federal immigration agents arrived at her apartment, prompting her to make a swift decision to leave the country.

In an interview with The New York Times, Srinivasan expressed her fear and uncertainty, stating, ""The atmosphere seemed so volatile and dangerous."" She also shared her concerns about the government's crackdown on free speech, saying, ""I'm fearful that even the most low-level political speech... can turn into this dystopian nightmare where somebody is calling you a terrorist sympathiser and making you, literally, fear for your life and your safety"".

Srinivasan's decision to flee came after a night of fear and uncertainty. She packed her belongings, left her cat and jumped on a flight to Canada in search of safety. Her roommate was left to manage the pressure as immigration agents continued to search for her.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that Srinivasan had voluntarily self-deported using the CBP Home App. US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated, ""It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country"".

Srinivasan's academic background is impressive, with an M.Phil in Urban Planning from Columbia University, a Master's in Design from Harvard University, and a Bachelor of Design from CEPT University in India. Her research focuses on land-labour relations in India's peri-urban areas, with academic interests in political economy, land politics, and labour sociology.

The incident highlights the US government's strict stance on national security and immigration policies. Srinivasan's case has gained attention amid increased scrutiny of individuals and organisations allegedly supporting Hamas. Visa revocations for security reasons have become more frequent, reflecting the government's efforts to enforce visa regulations and prevent individuals it considers a security threat from remaining in the country.

US President Donald Trump has launched the biggest military operation in the Middle East since taking office against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis after they resumed Red Sea shipping attacks.

The strikes, which have killed at least 24 people so far, could last for weeks according to one US official and come as Trump ramps up sanctions pressure on Tehran.

What Is The History Of The Houthis?

In the late 1990s, the Houthi family in the far north of Yemen set up a religious revival movement for the Zaydi sect of Shi'ite Islam, which had once ruled Yemen, but whose northern heartland had became impoverished and marginalized.

As friction with the government in the capital Sanaa grew, they fought a series of guerrilla wars with the national army and a brief border conflict with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia.

Who Is The Houthi Leader?

Abdul Malik al-Houthi created the defiant force challenging world powers from a group of ragtag mountain fighters in sandals. Al-Houthi established a reputation as a fierce battlefield commander before emerging as head of the Houthi movement.

Under the direction of al-Houthi, who is in his 40s, the group has grown into an army of tens of thousands of fighters and acquired a huge arsenal of armed drones and ballistic missiles. Saudi Arabia and the West say the arms come from Iran, though Tehran denies this.

Al-Houthi is known for rarely staying long in one place, for never meeting the media and for extreme reluctance to make scheduled public appearances.

How Did The Houthis Come To Control Much Of Yemen?

A civil war erupted in Yemen in late 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa. Worried by the growing influence of Shi'ite Iran along its border, Saudi Arabia led a Western-backed coalition in March 2015, which intervened in support of the Saudi-backed government.

The Houthis established control over much of the north and other large population centres, while the internationally recognised government based itself in the port city of Aden.

Yemen enjoyed a period of relative calm amid a U.N.-led peace push, but a sharp escalation in regional tensions since the start of the Gaza war has increased risks of a new conflict between the militia and Riyadh.

Why Attack Ships?

The Houthis have waded into the Gaza conflict with attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea as a show of support for the Palestinians and Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza.

They have also claimed attacks on ships they say are linked to Israel in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.

The Houthi attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa.

While the militia has said it attacked only vessels with links to Israel, the United States and Britain, shipping industry sources say all ships were at risk.

The US and Britain had retaliated with air strikes against the Houthis as part of international efforts to restore the free flow of trade along a key route between Europe and Asia that accounts for about 15% of the world's shipping traffic.

A period of relative calm started in January alongside the Gaza ceasefire but the group then warned in March it would resume its naval operations if Israel did not lift a blockage of aid into Gaza.

The Houthis then announced on March 12 a resumption of attacks with immediate effect.

What Are The Houthis' Links With Iran?

The Houthis are part of what has been called the ""Axis of Resistance"" - an anti-Israel and anti-Western alliance of regional militias including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, backed by Iran.

The Houthis' slogan is ""Death to America, Death to Israel, curse the Jews and victory to Islam"".

The Saudi-led coalition accuses Tehran of arming and training the Houthis, a charge both deny. The coalition also says Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah is helping the Houthis, an accusation it rejects.

While Iran champions the Houthis, the Houthis deny being puppets of Iran, and Yemen experts say they are motivated primarily by a domestic agenda.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act - a wartime law last used in World War II - to deport individuals linked to Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang. This was the first use of the act since World War II.

Now a federal judge has blocked the deportations. Trump's order designated the Venezuelan gang as an ""invading force"", but US District Judge James E Boasberg, an Obama appointee, froze deportations for two weeks and set a Friday hearing to review legal challenges.

What is the Alien Enemies Act?

The Alien Enemies Act is a United States federal law enacted in 1798 as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts. This legislation grants the President authority to detain or deport non-citizens from nations considered hostile during times of declared war or invasion.

Provisions

In times of declared war, the president can order the apprehension, restraint, and removal of citizens aged 14 and older from enemy nations residing in the US, based solely on their nationality.

The act allows these actions without the need for a court hearing, raising concerns about potential violations of constitutional rights such as due process and equal protection.

History

The act was introduced amid escalating tensions with France in the late 18th century, aiming to prevent espionage and sabotage by foreign nationals.

President James Madison applied the act for the first time during the War of 1812, to British nationals residing in the US.

During World War I, the act facilitated the detention and deportation of individuals from enemy nations.

During the second World war, the act was invoked to authorise the internment of Japanese, German, and Italian nationals, as well as Japanese-American citizens, a decision now widely criticised for violating civil liberties.

Can the President Use the Alien Enemies Act Without a Literal Invasion?

Historically, terms like invasion and predatory incursion were understood literally -- referring to large-scale attacks or smaller military raids. Some politicians now argue for a broader reading, suggesting that unlawful migration or drug trafficking qualifies as an ""invasion."" They see the law as a tool to enforce mass deportations. Past courts and presidents have consistently treated it as a wartime authority, not an immigration enforcement law.

Why Donald Trump Invoked The Act

Late Friday, the ACLU and Democracy Forward sued Trump's administration, arguing that five Venezuelan men were at ""imminent risk"" of being deported under the Alien Enemies Act. Federal judge, James Boasberg, blocked their deportation, leading to an immediate appeal from the Justice Department. 

Around the same time, the Trump administration struck a $6 million deal with El Salvador to imprison 300 suspected Tren de Aragua gang members. On Saturday, Trump declared the gang an invading force, invoking wartime powers to justify mass deportations.

Could A President Invoke It in Peacetime?

Legally, it would be an abuse of power. But the political question doctrine - which prevents courts from interfering in executive decisions on war and foreign policy - could limit judicial challenges.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Sudiksha Konanki, a 20-year-old Indian-American student, vanished while on a spring break trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The last person to see her, 22-year-old Joshua Riibe - now a person of interest - has provided conflicting accounts of the night's events.

Timeline of Events

Ms Konanki, a pre-med University of Pittsburgh student from South Riding, Virginia, travelled to the Dominican Republic with five friends on vacation. On March 5, Ms Konanki and her friends went out to party at a resort nightclub in Punta Cana. They were seen on surveillance footage at the club and later walking to the beach at around 4:15 am. By 5:50 am, most of her friends had left the beach, leaving Ms Konanki alone with Joshua Riibe, a college senior from Minnesota whom she had met that night.

CCTV footage from the Riu Republica Resort shows Ms Konanki walking arm-in-arm with an unidentified man, now believed to be Mr Riibe, along a resort pathway, accompanied by her friends. She was last seen wearing a white T-shirt, shorts, and her hair tied in a ponytail.

Who is Joshua Riibe?

Joshua Riibe is a college senior at St Cloud State University in Minnesota, pursuing a degree in land surveying. He is a pool lifeguard.

Described by his family as a ""kind, humorous, and community-driven young man,"" Mr Riibe has been involved in student activities, sports, and volunteer work, ABC News reported.

He was not originally part of Ms Konanki's travel group but met her on the night of her disappearance.

Joshua Riibe's Testimony

Joshua Riibe told investigators he was with Sudiksha Konanki on the night she disappeared.

According to a transcript obtained by NBC News, Mr Riibe said they were ""in waist-deep water, talking and kissing a little"" when a strong wave pulled them out to sea.

Mr Riibe, who is a trained pool lifeguard, claimed he tried to hold Ms Konanki under his arm while swimming back to shore, making sure she could breathe. He struggled to stay afloat, saying, ""I took in a lot of water.""

When they reached shallower waters, Mr Riibe set Ms Konanki in front of him and saw her ""walking at an angle in the water."" He last asked if she was okay but didn't hear her response as he began vomiting the seawater he had swallowed.

By the time he recovered, Ms Konanki was nowhere to be seen. Thinking she had left, Mr Riibe passed out on a beach chair. Surveillance footage later recorded him returning to his hotel alone, hours later.

Joshua Riibe's Conflicting Statements

Initially, Mr Riibe gave multiple versions of events.

Version 1: He vomited, saw her standing, and assumed she left.Version 2: He felt sick, left the water, and last saw her in knee-deep water.Version 3: He saw her walking along the shore before he passed out.

Joshua Riibe's Passport Seized

Authorities have named Mr Riibe a 'person of interest', not a suspect. His passport was confiscated, and he remains under police surveillance at his hotel.

Statement From Joshua Riibe's Parents

Albert and Tina Riibe, the parents of Joshua Riibe, released a statement now shared by various media outlets.

""We express our deep sorrow and solidarity with the family of Sudiksha Konanki during this painful time. Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through, and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible.""

Joshua Riibe ""is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.""

His parents claimed he was questioned under ""irregular conditions"" without official translators or legal counsel until March 12. They alleged he was confined to his hotel room under police watch since the investigation began and was repeatedly taken for long interrogations starting March 6, the day Ms Konanki disappeared.

Search Underway

Authorities, including the FBI, have launched a large-scale search using drones, helicopters, scuba divers, boats, and all-terrain vehicles to locate Ms Konanki. Dominican officials admit the chances of finding her alive are ""minimal.""While authorities suspect drowning, Ms Konanki's family fears she may have been kidnapped. Her father has urged officials to expand the investigation.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

At least 33 people were killed and dozens more injured Saturday when tornadoes and violent storms raked across the central United States, officials said.

Local news showed roofs torn off homes and large trucks overturned, as forecasters warned of more tornadoes to come this weekend.

Eight people died in Kansas in a crash involving more than 50 vehicles, caused by low visibility during a ""severe dust storm,"" local police said.

Missouri State Highway Patrol confirmed 12 storm-related fatalities and shared images of boats piled on top of one another at a marina destroyed by the weather.



The state police reported downed trees and power lines, as well as damage to buildings, with some areas severely impacted by ""tornadoes, thunderstorms and large hail.""

""It was the scariest thing I've ever been through, it was so fast, our ears were all about to burst,"" Alicia Wilson, who was evacuated from her home in Missouri, told TV station KSDK.

Further south in Mississippi, the state's governor said six deaths were reported and that three people were missing late Saturday.

Meanwhile in Texas, local authorities told AFP that four people had died in vehicle accidents linked to dust storms and fires that reduced visibility on the roads.

In the neighboring state of Arkansas, officials said three people had died and 29 had been injured in the storm.

Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders declared a state of emergency in response and said she had spoken with President Donald Trump.

""He said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes,"" Sanders wrote on X.

More tornadoes forecast

At least 2,00,000 homes and businesses across the central United States were without power by Saturday evening, according to tracking site poweroutage.us.

More tornadoes were forecast Saturday in the central Gulf Coast states including Mississippi and Tennessee.

""Numerous significant tornadoes, some of which may be long-track and potentially violent, should continue into this evening,"" the National Weather Service said.

Tornadoes are spinning columns of air that touch the ground from massive cumulonimbus thunderstorm clouds.

The central and southern American states of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas get the most violent ones due to unique geographical and meteorological conditions.

Dubbed ""Tornado Alley,"" this is where winds of widely varying temperatures meet in volatile, potent storm clouds, with most storms occurring from May to June.

In 2024, 54 people died in tornado-related incidents in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards on Sunday threatened a ""decisive"" response to any attack, after US President Donald Trump ordered a wave of air strikes against Yemen's Houthi rebels and warned Tehran to stop backing the group.

On Saturday, Trump said the United States had launched ""decisive and powerful military action"" to end the Houthi threat to Red Sea shipping, and warned Iran's support for the rebels ""must end immediately"". A Houthi health official said the strikes had killed 31 people.

Iranian Guards chief Hossein Salami denounced Trump's threats in a televised speech on Sunday, adding that ""Iran will not wage war, but if anyone threatens, it will give appropriate, decisive and conclusive responses"".

The commander called the Houthis ""the representative of the Yemenis"", adding the group made its ""strategic and operational decisions"" independently.

In January 2020, during Trump's first term, the US killed the commander of the Guards' foreign operations arms, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad.

Days later, Iran retaliated by firing missiles at bases in Iraq housing American and other coalition troops. No US personnel were killed but Washington said dozens suffered traumatic brain injuries.

Earlier Sunday Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei ""strongly condemned the brutal air strikes by the US"" in a statement, denouncing them a ""gross violation of the principles of the UN Charter"".

Iran's top diplomat Abbas Araghchi said afterwards that Washington had ""no authority"" to dictate the Islamic republic's foreign policy.

""The United States Government has no authority, or business, dictating Iranian foreign policy,"" the foreign minister said on X, while urging the United States to stop the ""killing of Yemeni people"".

Araghchi said the time when Washington could dictate Tehran's foreign policy ended in 1979, when the Islamic revolution ousted the Western-backed shah.

The Houthis, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, are part of the ""axis of resistance"" of pro-Iran groups staunchly opposed to Israel and the United States.

The Yemeni rebels have attacked Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians.

The US strikes on the Houthis are the first since Trump's return to the White House in January.

Rebels in southwest Pakistan killed at least five soldiers and wounded more than 30 on Sunday, police told AFP, days after an attack on a train in Balochistan province left dozens dead.

""There were seven buses in the convoy which was heading to Taftan (on the Iranian border). At Noshki, a car laden with explosives hit one of the buses,"" said Mohammed Zafar, a police official in Noshki, a town in Balochistan.

Five people were killed and 35 wounded, he said.

The attack was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the main separatist group in the province, which said the bombing was carried out by its suicide attack branch.

The BLA on Tuesday attacked a train with 450 passengers on board, sparking a two-day siege during which dozens of people were killed.

The railway attack drew attention to the spiral of violence in Balochistan, which also borders Afghanistan and where separatists accuse outsiders of plundering the province's natural resources.

Separately, three members of the security forces were killed Saturday evening in the neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province according to police sources.

The northwestern province has seen a rise in attacks by the Pakistani Taliban since the Afghan Taliban -- with which it shares a common ideology and lineage -- returned to power in Kabul in 2021.

According to an AFP count, since January 1 around 130 people, the majority members of the security forces, have been killed in violence carried out by armed groups fighting against the state -- mainly in the west bordering Afghanistan.

A report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture's veterinary lab details partial mummification and noted that while the severe decomposition could have obscured changes in the organs, there was no evidence of infectious disease, trauma or poisoning that could have resulted in death.

The report noted that the dog's stomach was mostly empty except for small amounts of hair and bile.

The kelpie mix named Zinna was one of the couple's three dogs. It was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Betsy Arakawa's body, while two other dogs survived.

Authorities confirmed last week that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease - hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - took the life of his wife. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead.



Hackman was found in the home's entryway, and Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Like the dog, their bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe's especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters).

While both deaths were ruled to be from natural causes, the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office is finishing up the investigation by tying up the timeline with any information gleaned from the cellphones collected at the home and last contacts that were made.

""The case is considered active until we have that information to tie up the timeline,"" said Denise Womack Avila, a spokesperson for the sheriff.

Zinna went from being a returned shelter dog to an incredible companion that was always at Arakawa's side, said Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care facility that was involved in the surviving dogs' care.

Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym.

Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including ""The French Connection,"" ""Hoosiers"" and ""Superman"" from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s.

The pair led a private life after moving to Santa Fe decades ago. A representative for the couple's estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video. It will be up to a state district judge to consider that request.

While most may have lost hope, 82-year-old Katherine Kiefer had other plans when her pet cat, a California Maine coon, named Aggie, went missing after the Los Angeles wildfires, two months ago. The feline was feared dead but Ms Kiefer continued to look for Aggie with her search efforts bearing fruit this week as she received a call from the West Los Angeles Animal Shelter.

Her daughter Carolyn Kiefer shared the video of the duo's reunion on social media which quickly went viral. The clip showed Ms Kiefer reaching out for Aggie as tears poured from her eyes.

""Hi sweetest girl. Hi Aggie. I'm so glad. Never thought I'd see you again,"" said Ms Kiefer.

""I am so happy to see you. Sweetest girl,"" she added while patting Aggie who remained curled up in her arms.

Since the rescue, Aggie has undergone several blood transfusions with a specialist monitoring her progress. As per Carolyn, Aggie was ""basically skin and bone, and in a state of absolute starvation"" when the shelter members found her.

Notably, Ms Kiefer was at a medical appointment the day the fire engulfed her neighbourhood. Despite the best efforts from Ms Kiefer and her children, Aggie could not be found. As per the family, Aggie was prone to hiding in threatening situations.

Reacting to the miraculous reunion, social media users said Aggie did have nine lives like other cats and that they were glad she was safe.

""What a heartwarming story. Glad she got her family member back,"" said one user while another added: ""Poor little sweetie. I'm glad that she's okay!""

A third commented: ""Cats do have nine lives. Praise be to God.""

The devastating Los Angeles wildfires started in the first week of January and caused damages in upwards of $135 billion -- making it one of the costliest natural disasters in US history. After burning for 24 days, the Palisades and Eaton blaze were fully contained on January 31, with over 37,000 acres burned and more than 16,000 structures destroyed.

The long-term effects of the wildfires remain significant, with potential damage to property values, strain on public finances, and impact on health and tourism yet to be accounted for properly.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday put journalists at Voice of America and other US-funded broadcasters on leave, abruptly freezing decades-old outlets long seen as critical to countering Russian and Chinese information offensives.

Hundreds of staffers at VOA, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe and other outlets received a weekend email saying they will be barred from their offices and should surrender press passes and office-issued equipment.

Trump, who has already eviscerated the US global aid agency and the Education Department, on Friday issued an executive order listing the US Agency for Global Media as among ""elements of the federal bureaucracy that the president has determined are unnecessary.""

Kari Lake, a firebrand Trump supporter put in charge of the media agency after she lost a US Senate bid, said in an email to the outlets that federal grant money ""no longer effectuates agency priorities.""

The White House said the cuts would ensure ""taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda,"" marking a dramatic tone shift towards the networks established to extend US influence overseas.

White House press official Harrison Fields wrote ""goodbye"" on X in 20 languages, a jab at the outlets' multilingual coverage.

VOA director Michael Abramowitz said he was among 1,300 staffers placed on leave Saturday.

""VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission,"" he said on Facebook, noting that its coverage -- in 48 languages -- reaches 360 million people each week.

The head of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which started broadcasting into the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, called the cancellation of funding ""a massive gift to America's enemies.""

""The Iranian ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years,"" its president, Stephen Capus, said in a statement.

Uncensored reporting

US-funded media have reoriented themselves since the end of the Cold War, dropping much of the programming geared toward newly democratic Central and Eastern European countries and focusing on Russia and China.

Chinese state-funded media have expanded their reach sharply over the past decade, including by offering free services to outlets in the developing world that would otherwise pay for Western news agencies.

Radio Free Asia, established in 1996, sees its mission as providing uncensored reporting into countries without free media including China, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam.

The outlets have an editorial firewall, with a stated guarantee of independence despite government funding.

The policy has angered some around Trump, who has long railed against media and suggested that government-funded outlets should promote his policies.

The move to end US-funded media is likely to meet challenges, much like Trump's other sweeping cuts. Congress, not the president, has the constitutional power of the purse and Radio Free Asia in particular has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.

'Chaos'

Advocacy group Reporters Without Borders condemned the decision, saying it ""threatens press freedom worldwide and negates 80 years of American history in supporting the free flow of information.""

Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and senior Democratic congresswoman Lois Frankel said in a joint statement that Trump's move would ""cause lasting damage to US efforts to counter propaganda around the world.""

One VOA employee, who requested anonymity, described Saturday's message as another ""perfect example of the chaos and unprepared nature of the process,"" with VOA staffers presuming that scheduled programming is off but not told so directly.

A Radio Free Asia employee said: ""It's not just about losing your income. We have staff and contractors who fear for their safety. We have reporters who work under the radar in authoritarian countries in Asia. We have staff in the US who fear deportation if their work visa is no longer valid.""

""Wiping us out with the strike of a pen is just terrible.""

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his US counterpart Marco Rubio in a phone call Saturday that all sides should refrain from the ""use of force"" in Yemen and enter a ""political dialogue"", Moscow said on Sunday.Moscow said Rubio informed Lavrov about Washington's decision to launch strikes against Yemen's Huthis, in a call that came after the two countries have relaunched dialogue since Donald Trump took office.

""In response to argumentation put forward by American representatives, Sergei Lavrov stressed the need for an immediate cessation of the use of force and the importance for all sides to engage in political dialogue so as to find a solution that would prevent further bloodshed,"" Russia's foreign ministry said.

Russia last year condemned US and British strikes on Yemen and has held talks with the Huthis, who are backed by Moscow's ally Iran.

A British traveller had a harrowing experience recently when he vomited 30 times during a six-hour Etihad Airlines flight. Cameron Callaghan, 27, was on a connecting flight from Manchester to Abu Dhabi, on his way to Bangkok, Thailand in January when he ate a ""tomato, cheesy, chicken pasta"" which reportedly gave him food poisoning, according to a report in New York Post.

Mr Callaghan had already eaten an egg sandwich prior to the start of the journey but after the flight was delayed by five hours, he decided to take up the airline on its offer of the pasta. Other passengers were also served the dish which had an offputting stench.

""It ruined the first few days of my holiday, ""Mr Callaghan told Kennedy News, adding: ""It did smell a bit weird but all plane food kind of does.""

“I believe the food had been sitting out since the original time the plane was supposed to take off and not been stored properly.”

A few minutes later, he started experiencing severe gastrointestinal turbulence causing him pain.

""I had diarrhea twice and 10 minutes after that I was just constantly throwing up for the duration of the flight,"" said Mr Callaghan. ""I threw up probably about 30 times.""

After the flight landed in Abu Dhabi, Mr Callaghan was so weak that he couldn't lift his head and had to be ushered out.

""They had to get a wheelchair and they wheeled me to the medical room in Abu Dhabi's airport,"" added Mr Callaghan, who was administered an IV with an anti-sickness drip.

In the wake of the incident, Etihad issued a statement claiming that its food could not have been responsible for Mr Callaghan's food poisoning.

""We take all such matters very seriously and investigate thoroughly. Our food on this flight, as with all our flights, was prepared and stored under strict temperature-controlled conditions to ensure safety and quality,"" an Etihad spokesperson said.

""We did not receive any reports of illness from other passengers on this flight who were served the same meal. Our first priority is always the safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew.""

However, Mr Callaghan was far from impressed and demanded a refund for the ""flight from hell"" along with an apology as reparations.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Musician A R Rahman was admitted to a hospital in Chennai on Saturday night due to 'dehydration', doctors said on Sunday. The Oscar-winning music director returned from London last night when he felt unwell and went for a check-up.

According to the doctors, the musician was feeling unwell due to dehydration as he had been fasting for Ramzan.

He is out of danger and fine now, they said.

A Rahman, also known by his initials ARR, is one of India's most celebrated music composers, record producers, and multi-instrumentalists. He is best known for his work in Tamil and Hindi cinema, with occasional projects in international films. 

Over his illustrious career, Mr Rahman has received numerous accolades, including six National Film Awards, two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe Award, six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, and 18 Filmfare Awards. In 2010, the Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan, the country's third-highest civilian award.

Mr Rahman's journey in film music began in the early 1990s with Mani Ratnam's 'Roja'. He quickly became a household name with iconic scores for films such as 'Bombay', 'Kadhalan', 'Thiruda Thiruda', and 'Gentleman'.

His first Hollywood project, 'Couples Retreat', won him the BMI Award for Best Music Score. However, his global breakthrough came with 'Slumdog Millionaire', which earned him two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Original Song.

Beyond his musical achievements, Mr Rahman is also known for his humanitarian efforts, supporting various charitable causes.

In 2006, Stanford University recognised his contributions to global music, and in 2008, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rotary Club. In 2009, he was featured in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Trump invoked 1798 law previously used to detain Japanese Americans in second world war to justify deportations

The US deported more than 250 mainly Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador despite a US judge's ruling to halt the flights on Saturday after Donald Trump controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law meant only to be used in wartime.

El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, said 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 had arrived and were in custody as part of a deal under which the US will pay the Central American country to hold them in its 40,000-person capacity “terrorism confinement centre”.

The confirmation came hours after a US federal judge expanded his ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration from invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority that allows the president broad leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations.

The US district judge James Boasberg had attempted to halt the deportations for all individuals deemed eligible for removal under Trump's proclamation, which was issued on Friday. Boasberg also ordered deportation flights already in the air to return to the US.

“Oopsie … Too late,” Bukele posted online, followed by a laughing emoji.

Soon after Bukele's statement, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, thanked El Salvador's leader.

“Thank you for your assistance and friendship, President Bukele,” he wrote on the social media site X, following up on an earlier post in which he said the US had sent “2 dangerous top MS-13 leaders plus 21 of its most wanted back to face justice in El Salvador”.

Rubio added that “over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars”.

On Friday, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to order the deportations of suspected members of the Venezuelan gang he has accused of “unlawfully infiltrating” the US. The US formally designated Tren de Aragua a “foreign terrorist organization” last month.

He claimed the gang members were “conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions” against the US.

The Alien Enemies Act has only ever been used three times before, most recently during the second world war, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians.

It was originally passed by Congress in preparation for what the US believed would be an impending war with France. It was also used during the war of 1812 and during the first world war. 
 The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, slammed Judge Boasberg's stay on deportations. “This order disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power, and it puts the public and law enforcement at risk,” Bondi said in a statement on Saturday night.

But lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union contend that the Trump does not have the authority to use the law against a criminal gang, rather than a recognized state.

On Sunday, the Republican senator Mike Rounds questioned whether the deportation flights had ignored Judge Boasberg's order to turn around. “We'll find out whether or not that actually occurred or not,” Rounds told CNN. “I don't know about the timing on it. I do know that we will follow the law.”

A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration

after newsletter promotion

El Salvador's multimillion-dollar “terrorism confinement centre” – which is known by its Spanish acronym Cecot – is the centerpiece of Bukele's highly controversial anti-gang crackdown which has seen tens of thousands of people jailed since it was launched in March 2022.

The 40,000-capacity “mega-prison” was opened at the start of 2023 and has since become an essential destination for rightwing Latin American populists keen to burnish their crime-fighting credentials with voters. “This is the way. Tough on crime,” Argentina's hardline security minister, Patricia Bullrich, enthused last year after posing outside Cecot's packed cells.

A succession of social media influencers and foreign journalists have also been invited to tour the prison to document its harsh conditions and help Bukele promote his clampdown, which has helped dramatically reduce El Salvador's once sky-high murder rate.

“The conditions in there are like something you've never seen … Depending on which side of the argument you fall on, it's either the ultimate deterrent or it's an abuse of human rights,” the Australian TV journalist Liam Bartlett reported after visiting El Salvador's “hellhole” prison recently.

“There's no sheets [and] no mattresses. [Prisoners] sleep on cold steel frames and they eat the same meal every single day. Utensils are banned so they use their hands [to eat]. There's just two open toilets in each of these massive cells and the lights stay on 24/7,” Bartlett added. “Imagine how long you would last in these conditions.”

Human rights activists have decried how the mass imprisonments have taken place largely without legal process. More than 100 prisoners have died behind bars since Bukele's clampdown began.

Neither the US nor El Salvador offered any immediate evidence that the scores of Venezuelan prisoners sent to Cecot this weekend were in fact gang members or had been convicted of any offense.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Trump administration accused of ‘quid pro quo' for fast-tracking controversial fossil fuel proposal in Michigan

Donald Trump's administration is being accused by activists of a quid pro quo as it attempts to fast-track a controversial fossil fuel pipeline proposal in Michigan that would in part be built by a donor with deep financial ties to the president.

While Canadian oil giant Enbridge owns the Line 5 oil and gas pipeline that it is attempting to replace in the Great Lakes region, the contractor is Tim Barnard, who, along with his wife, gave $1m to Trump's campaign last year, Federal Election Commission records show.

Barnard's company, Barnard Construction, received more than $1bn to build parts of the border wall, and he is also a prolific Republican donor to state and national candidates and organizations.

Enbridge wants to replace the ageing Line 5 that cuts across about 4.4 miles (7km) of seabed in the Great Lakes, which holds more than 90% of the nation's fresh water, and 21% of the world's fresh water.

The estimated $1.5bn replacement plan calls for building a tunnel underneath the Great Lakes, which opponents say puts the environment at high risk. They also questioned Barnard's ability to complete the highly complex project, citing a lack of experience and a history of wage violations.

“Such pay-to-play arrangements among the government and federal contractors are not unusual, but they are increasing in scope under a second Trump administration, and are highly unethical and corrupt the government contracting process,” said Craig Holman, a Capitol Hill lobbyist with Public Citizen, a non-profit that advocates for transparency.

“Contracts oftentimes are awarded based on large campaign donations rather than merit, and it effectively rigs the bidding process against businesses who either cannot afford making large campaign contributions or who refuse to pay to play for government contracts,” Holman said.

Barnard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration in late February moved to fast-track federal energy projects that include Line 5 by sidestepping the US Army Corps of Engineers' environmental review processes. The move was part of the “energy emergency” he declared on his first day in office, which is viewed as dubious because energy production was already near record highs. Some allege it was a payback to oil industry donors who helped Trump get elected.

In addition to the $1m June 2024 donations, Barnard has given millions to Trump administration officials, Republican congressional committees, and other Republican candidates and groups. Among the recipients are the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; Vice-President JD Vance; the former US House speaker Kevin McCarthy; and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott.

Barnard donated to Trump in 2016, and again in 2019 and 2020, just ahead and just after he received what some lawmakers and other contractors alleged was an illegal no-bid contract to build some of the border wall.

What began as an approximately $143m contract ballooned to more than $1bn in part through a loophole in the competitive bidding process, and critics questioned the spike – Barnard billed taxpayers for about $33m per mile of border wall built, while the government at the time was paying about $20m. Walls under previous administrations cost about $3m per mile, but were slightly smaller in scale.

Jack Reed, the Democratic senator of Rhode Island, at the time called for an investigation over the “no-bid contract to an apparently politically connected, private contractor”.

Meanwhile, Barnard Construction has been sued for failure to pay its workers, and settled with the Tampa Bay Water board over shoddy design work on a concrete reservoir that began to crack, raising concern in Michigan about its ability to build a concrete tunnel. It also appears the company has no experience building the type of tunnel required for the pipeline underneath the lake, the project's opponents say.

“These are donors who got the contract to build the border wall and it seems like there also is an ulterior motive here – a conflict of interest,” said Levi Teitel, a spokesperson for Progress Michigan, which opposes Line 5. “The fact that the state is even considering working with these contractors that have these shady track records is alarming.”

The pipeline currently transports about 540,000 barrels of oil and liquid natural gas daily across the Mackinac Straits, which connect Lake Michigan to Lake Huron between Michigan's upper and lower peninsulas. Environmental groups fear an anchor strike or powerful shifting currents that put enormous stress on the ageing pipes and could trigger a disaster.

Enbridge's plans for the replacement line call for a utility tunnel to be dug out 100ft below the Mackinac Straits floor – a design Enbridge claims would protect it from anchors and other threats. Opponents note the tunnel would still be high risk because of the complexity in building it, and because it would be the highest pressure tunnel in the world, if completed.

Stiff political and legal opposition has for seven years held up the new pipeline, and is attempting to shut down the existing line. The Army Corps of Engineers' environmental review is viewed as one of opponents' best hopes for derailing the project because of the plan's clear risks.

Though no legal mechanism for removing Barnard from the project exists, opponents have called on the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and her appointees on the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority that oversees the project to sound the alarm about the apparent quid pro quo, and pressure Enbridge.

Whitmer has not publicly said she opposes Line 5, to the frustration of those battling it, said Sean McBrearty, a campaign coordinator with Oil and Water Don't Mix.

“They have the power to throw some daylight on the project for the public and they're not doing that,” McBrearty said. “When it comes to this hare-brained scheme to build a tunnel through the most ecologically sensitive part of the Great Lakes, Whitmer is missing in action.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The Kennedy Center and BLM mural have been targeted, the newspaper is in freefall – and the Maga movement is gaining a foothold

It was an audience more accustomed to stifling a cough or resisting the temptation to unwrap a sweet. But when they spotted vice-president JD Vance taking his seat at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Thursday night, classical music-goers erupted in unrestrained boos, jeers and shouts of “You ruined this place!”

The noisy protest exemplified a culture clash taking place in the nation's capital. It came in the same week that work began to remove a giant “Black Lives Matter” mural near the White House, a top political columnist quit the Washington Post newspaper and a spending bill passed by the House of Representatives sought to impose drastic budget cuts of $1.1bn on the District of Columbia (DC).

Compounding it all, with Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) slashing the federal workforce, some residents fear that Washington could go the way of Detroit half a century ago: a city that loses its principal industry and goes into a downward spiral.

“Everybody feels the atmosphere is toxic here and you can't get away from it,” said Sally Quinn, an author, journalist and socialite. “People are so distraught and so down and in despair. The question is, what can we do? That's what people are asking in Washington. The biggest feeling of all is impotence: they can't stop it.”

Trump has always been an anachronistic presence in DC, where the Republican lost last year's presidential election to Democratic opponent Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points. During his first term, he only ventured out to one restaurant in the city – his own - and never attended the annual Kennedy Center Honors or White House Correspondents' Association dinner.

But as in other arenas, Trump's second term is more direct, determined and intentional, and includes the cultural equivalent of precision air strikes against the mostly liberal residents of Washington.

On Monday crews started work to remove a giant yellow “Black Lives Matter” slogan painted on a street one block from the White House. DC mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, had ordered the painting and renamed the intersection Black Lives Matter Plaza in June 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

Its erasure five years later amounts to a public acknowledgement of how vulnerable DC is now that Trump is back in the White House and Republicans control both houses of Congress. The work is expected to take about six weeks and the words will be replaced by an unspecified set of city-sponsored murals.

Among those who gathered to witness the work on Monday was Megan Bailiff, chief executive of Equus Striping, the pavement marking company that originally painted the letters. She told the Associated Press its presence was “more significant at this very moment than it ever has been in this country” and described its its removal as “historically obscene”.
  Trump has seized control of the Kennedy Center, the crown jewel of the city's performing arts scene, installing himself as chair and loyalist Ric Grenell as president. Numerous artists and producers have cancelled shows, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical Hamilton, while ticket sales reportedly dropped roughly 50% week-over-week after Trump announced his takeover.

The backlash against Vance at this week's National Symphony Orchestra concert was a palpable demonstration of the anger. Coming just weeks after the vice-president publicly berated Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, some could not help but note the irony that he was attending all-Russian programme that included Stravinsky's Petrushka, the story of three puppets brought to life by a charlatan.

The booing incident prompted a retort from Grenell, who wrote on the X social media platform: “It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views. Diversity is our strength.” Meanwhile this week Trump added Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo to the Kennedy Center's board.

Quinn observed: “They're being very imaginative in their atrocities. They trashed the Kennedy Center and threw everybody out and put Laura Ingraham on the board. The Kennedy Center has been so much a part of the city for so long and suddenly it's gone. They've lost in the first couple of weeks 50% of their ticket sales. They're not getting the donations they used to get. All kinds of acts are cancelling and people I know say they won't ever set foot in that place.”

The Trump International hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue is no more but the Maga (Make America great again) movement is gaining a foothold in other parts of the city. Butterworth's, a bistro on Capitol Hill, has drawn Trump allies including Musk and Kash Patel and has been dubbed “Steve Bannon's restaurant”.

Bannon, who lives nearby but has no formal connection to Butterworth's, said in a text message it reminds him of one of his favourite areas in London. “It's Mayfair come to Capitol Hill,” he explained.

Co-owner Raheem Kassam, a former editor-in-chief of Breitbart News UK and ex-aide to British rightwing populist Nigel Farage, insisted in an online message: “We are a Capitol Hill restaurant that welcomes everyone and refuses to discriminate based on politics. Our investors come from a range of backgrounds, and includes left-liberals, apolitical-types, LGBT+ people, and minorities.

“But frankly, we're not really interested in ticking boxes. We're interested in great food and good vibes. If you fancy that, we're the place for you, no matter who you are. Just please, no hats for dinner service.”

Washington has often had a tenuous peace with the federal government when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House. It is now facing its most urgent threat since it was given the power of home rule during the Richard Nixon administration.

This week the House passed a continuing resolution to fund the federal government that includes a provision treating DC as a federal agency for budget purposes. This would force DC to revert to its fiscal year 2024 spending levels, resulting in an estimated $1.1bn cut to its current 2025 budget over the remaining six months.

The funds are locally raised taxpayer dollars, not federal subsidies. City officials warned of “calamitous reduction in services ranging from schools to public safety”. Washington could face potential hiring freezes, layoffs across various agencies, renegotiation or termination of leases and decreased security and janitorial services.

Paul Strauss, shadow US senator for DC, said: “I'm shocked that it's now House Republicans that are taking steps to defund the police, which was normally a position staked out by extreme members of the far left. To have the House vote to cut the police budget so substantially seems difficult to understand.”

After final passage of the continuing resolution, the Senate unanimously passed a bill by voice vote to restore the $1.1bn in spending cuts to the DC government. The DC bill, which Trump supports, must still be approved by the House when it returns on 24 March.

Democrats and DC officials view the proposed budget cuts as politically motivated, potentially aimed at undermining the self-governance of the predominantly Democratic city. Trump has previously suggested that DC would be better off under total federal control.

Such is the concern that Jamie Raskin, a Democratic congressman from Maryland, even floated the idea that Washington could be temporarily incorporated into Maryland. Raskin said on the City Cast DC podcast: “If you guys want to think about coming back to Maryland for this period, you would definitely be safer in the free state than you'd be under the brutal thumb of Maga colonialism.”

Simultaneously, Washington is facing economic headwinds due to deep federal job cuts orchestrated by Doge under the Trump administration. Unemployment claims recently rose 25% in one week and are four times as high as one year earlier. Glen Lee, the district's chief financial officer, has forecast that DC could lose 40,000 federal jobs – down by a fifth – and projected a loss of revenue of $1bn over the next three years.

Bill Galston, a chair in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank, noted that the federal government is a vast establishment with 2.3 million workers spread across the country, of whom 80% are not in Washington. “So I don't think that life in Washington DC has been upended yet,” he said.

“What there has been and of course is is a pell-mell replacement of a sense of security with a pretty near total sense of insecurity. The sense of what might happen to an individual is a larger effect than the actual firings. People are hunkering down.”

The shift in Trump's second term has been more dramatic than anyone expected, added Galston, a resident of 43 years. “There's an element of incredulity. People who tried to imagine in the starkest possible detail what could happen almost universally concede that, while they have let their imaginations run riot, they feel they didn't go far enough.

“There is something slightly surreal about all of this, but I wake up in the morning and I walk down the driveway in a very old fashioned way for my three newspapers and I open up the package and it's very real.”

As Doge downsizes the government, the Trump administration has considered offloading numerous federal properties, raising concerns about vacant buildings and a decline similar to that of Detroit after the car manufacturing industry was gutted. An essay in the New York Times newspaper this week was headlined: “DC Is Becoming Another Hollowed-Out Company Town.”

Quinn said: “It is a one industry town, and basically what they're doing is destroying the government, which is what Trump said he would do. Even Trump supporters are stunned. I know from some of my friends on the Hill that Republican senators and congressmen are freaking out, too, because they're hearing from their constituents.”

Quinn was married to the late Ben Bradlee, who was editor of the Washington Post when it reported on the Watergate scandal, which forced Nixon's resignation. Long a vital part of the fabric of the city, the storied newspaper has been in freefall, financially and editorially, over the past year.

Billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, who donated to and attended Trump's inauguration, recently ordered that the paper narrow the topics covered by its opinion section to personal liberties and the free market. Opinions editor David Shipley resigned because of the shift. This week Ruth Marcus, who had worked at the Post since 1984, also quit. Several star reporters have left in recent months.

David Maraniss, a former associate editor of the Post who recently resigned after 48 years at the paper, said: “What's happening at the Post is connected to Trump and that's very disturbing to me. I don't think Bezos genuflecting to an autocrat is something I want to have any part of. I consider the Post a public trust almost. That sounds sort of idealistic and naive but it's larger than an owner; it's an identity.

“What it represents in terms of journalistic ethics and integrity has been damaged almost beyond repair and this is a time when newspapers of that sort are needed more than ever. For us to recede from that push for freedom of speech, the First Amendment, for the search for truth is depressing to me.”

For many of Trump's critics, Washington feels like a city under occupation. Maraniss added: “It's the second occupation but it seems more pronounced than the first. My feelings are complicated by a double whammy of what's happening in my newspaper and in the city, in the country and in the world. It all seems wrapped together. In terms of Washington there's anxiety, a feeling of a darkness coming over the city and enormous uncertainty about what people should do.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Researchers use innovative cameras to identify fish species hindering coral reef restoration

Marine scientists in Florida working to help reverse a calamitous decades-long decline in coral reefs caught fishy “porch pirates” in the act with an innovative underwater doorbell-style surveillance camera.

The footage showed that three corallivorous species – redband parrotfish, foureye butterflyfish and stoplight parrotfish – were responsible for eating more than 97% of coral laid as bait by the researchers at an offshore reef near Miami.

The findings, they say, can help inform coral reef repopulation efforts following a 90% decline in Florida's coral cover since the 1970s following unprecedented bleaching events caused by the climate emergency, particularly record ocean heat over the last two summers.

“Intense fish predation on newly outplanted corals has emerged as a major restoration bottleneck. The main goal was to address our lack of knowledge of the fish species that target corals after outplanting,” said Diego Lirman, a global leader in coral restoration research. He is a project leader and associate professor at the University of Miami's (UM) Rosenstiel school of marine, atmospheric and earth science.

“Identifying the fish species responsible for coral predation would allow practitioners to avoid reef sites or areas within sites with high abundances of those species and, similarly, select the right coral species for the right outplanting site,” Lirman said.

“The coral-baited underwater cameras provide insight into corallivore behavior and preferences and allow documentation of predation at various sites rapidly and without incurring the cost of outplanting.”

Lirman's team, funded by a grant from the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida, designed and built a number of recording devices using GoPro cameras in waterproof housing attached to a PVC frame, and with lead weights for stability. After shaky preliminary results, divers secured later models to the seabed at Paradise Reef, close to Key Biscayne in Miami-Dade county, using masonry nails and cable ties.

The so-called C-Bruvs (coral-baited remote underwater video system) were set to record time-lapse video, and footage was collected at 24- and 48-hour periods after deployment and weekly thereafter for the duration of the six-week project.

Lirman said the team overcame initial setbacks including overheating external batteries and leaks causing flooding in the camera housing, while the research was also not immune to petty porch pirate-style pilfery familiar to homeowners above ground who have recorded thefts on their doorstep.

“One of the C-Bruvs with a surface buoy attached was stolen from the reef,” he said.

Overall, however, the researchers considered their experiment a success. After analysis of the imagery, they determined redband parrotfish, which are prolific in the Caribbean and waters off Florida, were the most voracious predators, accounting for 56.3% of bites on the nine coral species put out in fragments as bait.

Next came foureye butterflyfish with 36.9%, and stoplight parrotfish with 4%. The three species, Lirman said: “showed clear preferences” for two or three particular types of coral, which received more than 65% of all bites recorded.

UM marine scientist and research master's graduate Erin Weisman presented the findings to the Reef Florida symposium of conservation leaders at Miami's Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science in November.

“By identifying, for the first time, the main fish predators as well as their preferred diet, reef restoration practitioners can select sites and species that would minimize predation impacts and maximize restoration success before large-scale, costly outplanting is implemented,” Lirman said.

Future similar research, he added, could introduce elements of artificial intelligence.

“Analyses of the videos were extremely time-consuming, requiring a constant rewinding and stopping of the footage to record and annotate coral/fish interactions,” he said.

“It will be beneficial to explore AI software that can be trained to identify fish and their behaviors to automate the analysis process.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Former talkshow host takes public her battle to remove her guardian, ordered by a court due to dementia and aphasia

The note dropped from the upper floor window of an assisted living facility in New York on the morning of 10 March contained a simple message: “Help! Wendy!!” it read.

For any patient inside, it would have been tragic. But, astonishingly, the writer of this note was Wendy Williams, a trailblazing television talkshow host and once one of the most recognisble daytime TV faces in America.

While half the nation pays attention to Donald Trump, the other half, it seems, is fixated on Williams, who has been under a court-ordered conservatorship since 2022 and whose clear struggles with her illness are captivating – and shocking – the US.

Williams, 60, wants to be released from her conservatorship, which she claims is similar to one that Britney Spears was place under, and has maintained in several interviews that she is “not cognitively impaired” as she was diagnosed to be two years ago.

Known as “the shock jock diva” and “the biggest mouth in New York”, Williams was taken to a hospital by police after dropping the notes, and later told the media that she passed a mental-capacity test, with questions including naming the current president, “with flying colors”.

“I am not incapacitated as I've been accused, and this floor that I live on is the memory unit,” Williams recalled telling officers upon their arrival. “The people who live there don't remember anything, unlike me. Why am I here? What is going on?”

The talkshow host later “evaded staff” to get out of her facility and went to dinner with her niece at a NoHo restaurant, allegedly triggering a police report, but was spotted at her table writing in a journal and having a “super time”.

Her caretaker, Ginalisa Monterroso, now wants her to get an independent medical evaluation. But her court-ordered guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, didn't want her to undergo a police mental-capacity test and told Vanity Fair she sees “issues” with Williams's speech when it isn't scripted.

Tracking Williams, and her ups and downs, is a full-time job as an army of “Wendy Watchers” will attest.

Williams was diagnosed with dementia and aphasia in 2023, one year after she exited The Wendy Williams Show. But for more than a decade Williams, who grew up in a white New Jersey suburb, delivered hot takes on pop culture-dominated daytime talk TV. Before that she'd been on Hot 97 talk radio with a format similar to Howard Stern.

She was famous for high-profile clashes with celebrities. She feuded with Beyoncé in 2012, saying she was “fortunate” that her TV in the kitchen has closed-captioning “so I'll be able to understand what she says. You know Beyoncé can't talk. Beyoncé sounds like she has a fifth-grade education. She can't talk.”

She got into a beef with Whitney Houston over Houston's lesbian relationship with her friend Robyn Crawford, and her drug use. Houston threatened to stop by William's studio and beat her up. She called out Sean Combs, AKA Puff Daddy, long before he was charged with sex trafficking.

When Williams was eventually fired from Hot 97 in 1998, it was after she had shared a doctored image of Combs in a compromising position with another man on her website.

But Williams's feuds came against a backdrop of personal turbulence. Six years ago, she filed for divorce from her husband and former producer Kevin Hunter. She later appeared to confirm he had fathered a child with a younger woman.

“He inconvenienced my life with his attitude, a baby and a lot of affairs,” she told USA Today about Hunter in 2021. “And now I'm going to inconvenience his by letting him know that I've got the best apartment, I've got the best view, I've got the best concierge, I live the best life, I eat the best food. I have the best of the best.”

In her autobiography, Wendy's Got the Heat, she described how her dealer would bring cocaine to the studio and keep it in a green container on the kitchen counter. “I'd be on the couch at three o'clock, wide awake,” she wrote.

How far the public is willing to go in following the unfolding chapters of the Wendy Williams story is subject to the continued returns of attention capital investment.

“Even if you've never watched her show, she's been around,” said the Syracuse University media professor Bob Thompson. “Eventually it might become something everybody cares about, but it's not there yet. In the grand scheme of things – like will the constitution survive? – it's not much, but it's got the typical dramatic things: is it rehab, does she need rehab? Is she broke? She's pretty much got it all.”

Never one to shy away from the limelight, on Friday, Williams kept her struggles in the public eye and phoned in to the ladies of The View television show to complain about her guardian and the judge overseeing her conservatorship.

“These two people don't look like me, they don't dress like me, they don't talk like me, they don't act like me,” Williams said. “I need them to … get off my neck.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Leaders on left bet on Musk's bravado to pull party out of political weeds as CEO eyes social security and health cuts

For most of the 17-minute interview, Elon Musk stuck to a script. He was just a tech guy on a mission to “eliminate waste and fraud” from government.

His slash-and-burn cost-cutting crusade was making “good progress actually”, he told the Fox Business commentator Larry Kudlow on Monday, despite sparking a backlash that has reverberated far beyond Washington.

“Really I just don't want America to go bankrupt,” he said.

But then Kudlow asked Musk to look forward. Would the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) still be in place in a year? He thought so – his assignment wasn't quite complete. Musk, the world's richest man, then pointed to social security, a widely popular federal program that provides monthly benefits to retirees and people with disabilities, and other social safety net programs: “Most of the federal spending is entitlements. That's the big one to eliminate.”

For weeks, Donald Trump and Republicans have insisted that social security, Medicaid or Medicare would not “be touched”. Now Musk was suggesting the programs would be a primary target. Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, Democrats pounced.

“The average social security recipient in this country receives $65 a day. They have to survive on $65 a day. But you want to take a chainsaw to social security, when Elon Musk and his tens of billions of dollars of government contracts essentially makes at least $8m a day from the taxpayers,” Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a floor speech the following day. “If you want to uncover waste, fraud or abuse, start there.”

As the second Trump era comes into focus, Democrats have found a new villain: an “unelected billionaire” whose bravado – and sinking popularity – they believe may offer their party a path out of the political wilderness.

“There's nowhere in America where it is popular to cut disease research, to gut Medicaid and to turn off social security,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist. “So it's hard to see a place where what Musk is doing for Trump doesn't become an albatross for Republicans.”

The White House has championed Doge's work while reiterating that Trump would “protect” social security and other entitlement programs. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite mounting criticism of Musk, the president has embraced his beleaguered ally, who spent close to $300m helping elect him to the White House. This week, Trump hailed Musk as a “patriot” as he showcased Teslas from the south lawn of the White House. The president selected a red sedan, hoping to boost the electric car company, which has suffered a sharp decline in sales and stock prices since its chief executive launched his Doge operation. The White House has said that if conflicts of interest arise, “Elon will excuse himself from those contracts”.

But Musk and his chainsaw-wielding approach to downsizing government is playing a starring role in early Democratic ads and fundraising appeals. Progressive activists have staged “nobody elected Elon” protests across the country while other groups are targeting Tesla showrooms and dealerships. On a “fighting oligarchy” tour across the country, Senator Bernie Sanders pointed to Musk's growing political influence as a central threat to American democracy.

“Most American people, they can't name us. They don't know who Chuck Schumer is, but they do know what this administration and Elon Musk and the GOP are planning for them,” Katherine Clark, the House minority whip, said on Friday. “It's why you're seeing this uproar in town halls.”

While Democrats have much to say about Musk, they are less sure of how to stop him.

Many of Doge's actions have been halted or stopped in the courts. This week two federal judges ordered government agencies to rehire tens of thousands of probationary employees who were fired as part of Doge's purge of the federal workforce.

Locked out of power in Washington, Democrats are under enormous pressure to use any leverage they have to block Trump and Musk. A Republican-authored bill to fund federal agencies through September and avert a shutdown fiercely divided Democrats this week. House Democrats and progressive activists erupted in anger at Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, who ultimately relented and helped pass the measure rather than risk a funding lapse and, in his words, give Musk and Doge an opportunity to “exploit the crisis for maximum destruction”.

Public polling underlines Democrats' interest in Musk. A new CNN survey found that just 35% of Americans held a positive view of the billionaire Trump adviser, a full 10 percentage points lower than the president. The poll also found that he is notably better known and more unpopular than the vice-president, JD Vance.

More than six in 10 Americans said Musk had neither the right experience nor the judgement to carry out a unilateral overhaul of the federal government, though views broke sharply along partisan lines. Roughly the same share said they were worried the reductions would go “too far”, resulting in the loss of critical government programs.

A survey conducted by the left-leaning Navigator Research late last month found that views of Doge as a standalone cost-cutting initiative were marginally favorable, in line with other polls that have found Americans are broadly supportive of its stated mission to root out waste and improve efficiency. But there are signs Americans don't like the approach or implementation so far.

When the effort was framed as “Elon Musk's Doge”, views turned sharply more negative. The poll also captured the far-reaching impact of the cuts: 20% say they or someone they know has lost access to a federal service; 19% say they or someone they know have lost access to a federal grant and 17% say they or someone they know has quit or been laid off from a federal government job.

“Musk is the face of everything that people are worried about in the Trump administration,” Ferguson said, adding: “To a lot of people, putting Elon Musk in charge of protecting the middle class is like putting Jeffrey Dahmer in charge of protecting a morgue.”

Democrats believe Musk's comments on entitlement programs are particularly potent – the world's wealthiest man advocating for steep cuts to programs designed to help retirees and vulnerable Americans.

In the Fox Business interview, Musk claimed the programs were rife with waste and fraud, suggesting as much as $600bn to $700bn – or nearly a quarter of their budget – could to be cut. Federal watchdogs have long identified improper spending as a problem, but Musk's figure exceeds their estimates.

Musk has derided social security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”. As evidence of widespread fraud, Musk repeated a debunked theory, favored by Trump, that social security benefits are being paid to dead centenarians. The head of the agency has rejected the premise. Democrats have warned that Trump and Musk were using false or exaggerated claims of fraud as a “prelude” to slash the program or privatize it, as many conservatives have long desired.

After Musk's comments aired, the White House swiftly issued a “fact check” insisting that Musk had only advocated for eliminating waste and highlighted several occasions in which Trump has vowed to protect Americans' benefits.

Republicans also rushed to clarify Musk's comments. “Look, Elon Musk is a brainiac with an IQ that I cannot even fathom. He is not a master of artful language,” Mark Alford, a Republican representative of Missouri, said on CNN. “We are not going to eliminate social security, Medicare and Medicaid. That's sheer nonsense.”

It was a rare break with Musk, whom Republicans have been loath to cross, well aware that he not only has the president's full support and ear but a fortune to squash any dissent within the ranks. During Trump's address to Congress earlier this month, Republicans gave Musk a standing ovation as the president heaped praise on his work. They publicly warn that Democrats oppose Musk's fraud-and-waste removal efforts at their own political peril.

Yet there are signs that Republicans are beginning to worry. House Republicans have reportedly been advised not to hold in-person town halls after several widely publicized confrontations with constituents furious over loss of government jobs and services. And despite Trump's close alliance with Musk, even he seemed to indicate it was time to reign him in. “We say the ‘scalpel' rather than the ‘hatchet',” the president wrote in a social media post.

Republicans are weighing deep cuts to entitlement programs as a way to offset the cost of extending Trump's sweeping tax cuts aimed largely at the wealthy. Trump has praised the House plan.

“The Republican party at this point has wrapped both arms around the third rail and is holding on as the electricity flows,” said Ben Wikler, the chair of the Democratic party in Wisconsin, where a contest next month will provide an early test of the party's anti-Musk strategy.

On Thursday night, Wikler hosted a People v Musk grassroots event to discuss the billionaire's impact on the 1 April state supreme court race, which will determine the balance of power between conservative and liberal justices on Wisconsin's highest bench. Musk has spent millions of dollars through his America Pac, in an effort to tip the scales in favor of Brad Schimel, a county judge and former Republican attorney general. Democrats are supporting Susan Crawford, a county judge and former attorney for Planned Parenthood.

Wikler said Musk's ascendancy in Washington – and his influence in the race – has turned liberal voters in the state from “concerned to panicked to outraged with the heat of that 1,000 suns”.

“If Susan Crawford wins this race, and Musk and Schimel lose,” he said, “then that will be a big bat signal in the sky to Democrats everywhere that fighting back is not only the right thing to do, it's good politics.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

By standard measures such as job and GDP growth and the stock market, the US economy was in excellent shape

Donald Trump keeps saying he inherited a terrible economy from Joe Biden and many Americans believe him, even though that's not true. During his White House marketing event for Tesla on Tuesday, Trump said the US and its economy “went to hell” under Biden. Last week, in his national address to Congress, Trump said: “We inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare.”

But the truth is that by standard economic measures, the US economy was in excellent shape when Biden turned over the White House keys to Trump, even though most Americans, upset about inflation, told pollsters the economy was in poor shape.

When Biden left office, the unemployment rate was a low 4.1%, and during Biden's four years in office, the average jobless rate was lower than for any president since the 1960s. Trump has repeatedly railed against the high inflation under Biden, but the fact is that by the time Biden left office, the inflation rate had fallen to just 2.9% – down more than two-thirds from its peak and near the Federal Reserve's inflation goal.

Not only that, the nation's GDP growth has been impressive, rising at a solid 3.1% rate at the end of Biden's term. Ever since the pandemic ended, economic growth in the US has been considerably stronger than in the UK, France, Germany and other G7 nations. Shortly before election day, the Economist magazine ran a story saying the US economy was “the envy of the world” and had “left other rich countries in the dust”.

Trump often says job growth under Biden was terrible, but the fact is that the US added 16.6m jobs during Biden's presidency, more than during any four-year term of any previous US president. Under Trump, job growth was far worse – during his first four-year term, the nation lost 2.7m jobs overall, making Trump's presidency the first since Herbert Hoover's during which the nation suffered a net loss in jobs. The pandemic was largely responsible for this, but even during Trump's first three years in office, before the pandemic hit, job growth was only half as fast as it was under Biden.

Recently, Trump has repeatedly boasted how his tariffs will bring back manufacturing. Trump fails to note, however, that Biden had considerable success in bringing bring back manufacturing and factory jobs. Under most recent presidents, the US lost manufacturing jobs, but under Biden, the nation gained an impressive 750,000 factory jobs, the most under any president since the 1970s. A big reason for this was that as a result of Biden's green jobs legislation and the Chips Act to boost semiconductor production, manufacturing investment boomed, more than doubling during Biden's four years in office.

Biden took considerable pride about how the economy performed under him, even though he failed to persuade most Americans that the it was doing well. In December, Biden wrote: “Incomes are up by nearly $4,000 adjusted for inflation [since he took office], and unions have won wage increases from 25% to 60% in industries like autos, ports, aerospace, and trucking. We've seen 20 million applications to start small businesses. Our economy has grown 3% per year on average the last four years – faster than any other advanced economy. Domestic energy production is at a record high.”

Many economists vigorously disagree with Trump's claim that he inherited a poor economy. Paul Krugman wrote that in January, when Biden left office, the US had what was “very close to a Goldilocks economy, in which everything is more or less just right”. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, had even more glowing words. “President Trump is inheriting an economy that is about as good as it ever gets,” he said. “The US economy is the envy of the rest of the world, as it is the only significant economy that is growing more quickly post-pandemic than pre-pandemic.”

Trump pays attention to one measure of the economy above all others: how the stock market is doing. During Biden's four years, Wall Street did very well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 39% and the S&P 500 soared by 55.7%, including a 28% jump during 2024. In contrast, the stock market is down overall since Trump took office as investors have grown alarmed about the president's tariff war against the US's trading partners.

To be sure, there were some serious economic problems under Biden. Housing affordability was a major problem, and inflation rose to uncomfortable levels. The spike in prices was caused largely by two factors: the pandemic, which gave rise to worldwide supply chain problems, and Putin's war in Ukraine, which pushed up food and fuel prices. But Trump, in denouncing Biden on inflation, ignores all that.

As Trump's trade war spooks the markets and makes nervous CEOs rethink their investment plans, many economists are saying it's more and more likely the US will stumble into recession this year.

Trump has a long history of refusing to accept blame for mistakes and problems, and by repeatedly claiming he inherited a horrible economy, he seems to be laying the groundwork to blame Biden if the country slides into a painful recession.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

French president says France, UK and others could each deploy ‘a few thousand troops' to key locations to show Ukraine ‘long-term support'

Emmanuel Macron has said France, the UK, and other nations providing security guarantees for Ukraine after any eventual ceasefire would not be aiming to deploy a “mass” of soldiers, but instead could send contingents of several thousand troops to key locations in Ukraine without needing Russia's permission.

The French president told regional French newspapers, including Le Parisien and La Dépêche de Midi, that “several European countries, and indeed non-European ones” had “expressed their willingness” to join a possible deployment to Ukraine to secure a future peace agreement with Russia.

He said this could involve “a few thousand troops” from each state, deployed at “key points” in Ukraine, to conduct training programmes and “show our long-term support”.

Macron added in the interview on Saturday that the proposed contingents from countries that were members of the Nato alliance would serve as “a guarantee of security” for Ukraine and that “several European nations, and also non-European, have expressed their willingness to join such an effort when it is confirmed”.

He added: “Under no circumstances can the Ukrainians make territorial concessions without having any security guarantees.”

Moscow has firmly opposed such a deployment, but Macron said Russia's permission was not needed. He said Ukraine was sovereign. “If Ukraine requests allied forces to be on its territory, it is not up to Russia to accept or reject them.”

Macron will meet the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, on Monday and then travel to Berlin on Tuesday to meet the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for talks on Ukraine before an EU summit.

The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, led a virtual meeting of 30 international leaders on Saturday including Macron and Italy's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, as well as leaders from Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Afterwards, Starmer challenged the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to sign up to a ceasefire if he was serious about peace. He said allies would keep increasing the pressure on the Kremlin, including by moving planning for a peacekeeping force to an “operational phase”.

Macron said after the meeting on Saturday that Europe and the US had to put pressure on Russia to accept a proposed ceasefire. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in a statement to Agence France-Presse. On the contrary, the Russian president was “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”, he said.

“Russia must respond clearly and the pressure must be clear, in conjunction with the US, to obtain this ceasefire,” Macron said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Exclusive: Doctor Who writer says he feels ‘a wave of anger heading towards us' and hostility in UK as well as US

Russell T Davies has said gay society is in the “greatest danger I have ever seen”, since the election of Donald Trump as US president in November.

Speaking to the Guardian at the Gaydio Pride awards in Manchester on Friday, the Doctor Who screenwriter said the rise in hostility was not limited to the US but “is here [in the UK] now”.

“As a gay man, I feel like a wave of anger, and violence, and resentment is heading towards us on a vast scale,” he said.

“I've literally seen a difference in the way I'm spoken to as a gay man since that November election, and that's a few months of weaponising hate speech, and the hate speech creeps into the real world.”

“I'm not being alarmist,” he added. “I'm 61 years old. I know gay society very, very well, and I think we're in the greatest danger I have ever seen.”

Since his inauguration, Trump has ended policies giving LGBTQ+ Americans protection from discrimination. He has also restricted access to gender-affirming healthcare, said the US would only recognise two sexes, and barred transgender people from enlisting in the military.

Davies also used his keynote speech at the awards ceremony, which rewards the efforts made to improve the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the UK, to criticise Trump, and the president's ally Elon Musk.

“I think times are darkening beyond all measure and beyond anything I have seen in my lifetime,” he told the audience, which included the singers Louise Redknapp and Katy B, and the Traitors contestants Leanne Quigley and Minah Shannon.

Davies said he had turned 18 and left home in 1981, adding: “And that is exactly the year that rumours and whispers of a strange new virus came along, which came to haunt our community and to test us in so many ways.”

“The joyous thing about this is that we fought back,” he said. The community “militarised, campaigned, marched and demanded the medicine”.

He added: “We demanded the science. We demanded the access.”

When he wrote the TV series Queer As Folk in the late 1990s, he said, it was part of a movement, with writers “fomenting ideas” and putting gay and lesbian characters on screen.

Had he been asked to imagine then what life for LGBTQ+ people would be like in 2025, “I want to say it's going to be all rainbows,” he said, “skipping down the street hand-in-hand, equality, equality, equality.”

But the peril the gay community now faced, he said, was even greater than that in the 1980s.

“The threat from America, it's like something at The Lord of the Rings. It's like an evil rising in the west, and it is evil,” Davies said.

“We've had bad prime ministers and we've had bad presidents before. What we've never had is a billionaire tech baron openly hating his trans daughter,” he added.

Musk, the de facto head of the “department of government efficiency”, bought the social networking site Twitter, which he renamed X. A study by the University of California, Berkeley found hate speech on the platform rose by 50% in the months after it was bought by the billionaire.

“We have never had this in the history of the world,” Davies said. “It is terrifying because he and the people like him are in control of the facts, they're in control of information, they're in control of what people think, and that is what we're now facing.”

But Davies said the gay community would do “what we always do in times of peril, we gather at night”, and would once again come together, and fight against this latest wave of hostility and oppression.

“What we will do in Elon Musk's world, that we're heading towards, is what artists have always done,” he told the Guardian, “which is to meet in cellars, and plot, and sing, and compose, and paint, and make speeches, and march.”

“If we have to be those rebels in basements yet again,” he added, “which is when art thrives, then that's what we'll become.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Some cells are still alive within the dung, and could be used to boost genetic diversity in certain species

Turning animal poo into offspring sounds like a zoo keeper's conjuring trick, but it might become a reality if researchers succeed in a new project to help save endangered animals from extinction.

From snow leopards to sea turtles, animals the world over are under threat, with some scientists calling the massive loss of wildlife in recent decades a “biological annihilation”.

Now researchers are exploring whether they can use dung to capture – and harness – animals' genetic diversity.

Hailed “the poo zoo”, the project is based on a simple premise: besides being rich in undigested food, bacteria and bile, poo also contains cells from the creature that deposited it, shed from the lining of their intestines.

Crucially, research has suggested some of these cells within the poo are still alive – at least when the deposit is fresh.

“It's very, very early stages,” said Prof Suzannah Williams of Oxford University, who is leading the team. “But so far it's feeling very positive,” she added, noting they have not only isolated live cells from mouse poo, but also from elephant dung.

The hope is these cells could be used to help boost genetic diversity within populations, thereby increasing the chance of species surviving.

The approach, known as “genetic rescue”, can take several forms. In the first place, DNA from the cells could be analysed to help scientists understand the genetic variation of different populations, informing various conservation efforts. That DNA is of higher quality if extracted from cells that are alive.

But if cells from poo can be cultured and grown it raises another possibility: the creation of entire animals using state-of-art assisted reproductive technologies.

These include cloning – in which the nucleus of a cell is inserted into a donor egg, an electric impulse is applied, and the resulting embryo is implanted into a surrogate to produce a genetic “twin” of the original animal.

Perhaps more exciting still is the possibility of reprogramming the cells so that they have the capacity to become any cell type. Crucially, research in mice has suggested such cells can be turned into sperm and eggs – meaning they could be used in IVF-type techniques to produce offspring.

“If you use eggs and sperm, you get to leverage sexual reproduction and all of the recombination that happens during those events, and you get to really start to build the potential for adaptation to environmental stress,” said Dr Ashlee Hutchinson, who came up with the idea of the poo zoo and is a programme manager of Revive & Restore, a US-based conservation organisation that is funding the work.

Put simply, by creating sex cells in a laboratory, it is possible to harness the genetic diversity of a species without having to bring together individual animals – who might be in different parts of the world, or otherwise inaccessible – or needing to collect their sperm and eggs.

Reprogrammed cells could also allow scientists to use gene-editing techniques to understand, for example, the genes involved in wildlife diseases or environmental adaptations – information that could subsequently be used to engineer greater resilience into a species, for example by screening sex cells or embryos for certain genes, or even through gene editing.

Gene editing is already being explored by Revive and Restore to bring back the extinct Passenger Pigeon, and by the bioscience company Colossal in an attempt to revive the woolly mammoth.

Freezing cultured cells in liquid nitrogen at -196C means they can be preserved indefinitely, allowing the DNA they contain to potentially be used in applications not yet dreamed of.

The biobanking of cells and tissues of endangered species, from semen and ovarian tissue to skin cells, for genetic rescue has already been embraced by charities and organisations, from the UK-based Nature's Safe to San Diego's Frozen Zoo.

But this typically involves taking cells or tissues from the animal itself, whether alive or after it has died. By contrast, taking cells from poo is non-invasive and does not involve capture, raising the possibility of collecting them from even the most elusive creatures – an approach that could enable scientists access to greater genetic diversity by sampling wild populations.

“It's a case of how can we, en masse, collect living cells in as many species as we can to maintain diversity that we're losing at a terrifying rate,” said Dr Rhiannon Bolton, a researcher on the project from Chester zoo, a charity that is collaborating on the project.

But the approach is not without challenges. The sheer volume of dung that must be processed is considerable – “think about buckets and sieves at the beginning,” said Bolton.

What's more, poo contains more than just animal cells and organic waste.

“This is the most bacteria-heavy environment you could possibly collect cells out of,” said Williams. The team are already working on a solution – using dilution to remove the bacteria.

“Then we culture [the animal cells] in antibiotics and antifungals,” Williams said.

But even if living cells can be isolated from poo and cultured, there are hurdles to clear before offspring can be produced. Among them is the lack of understanding of the reproductive physiology of many animals, meaning the focus, at least initially, is likely to be on well-studied species.

Yet while the poo zoo is in its infancy, the team have form: Williams also leads an endeavour to save the northern white rhino by using lab-based methods to produce a large number of eggs from rhino ovarian tissue while, among other projects, Revive and Restore has been involved in the successful cloning of the black-footed ferret – a species twice thought to have gone extinct – from cells frozen decades before.

Some conservationists, however, maintain prevention is better than cure.

“The best way to protect species is to stop them declining to the point that such approaches as cloning are required. While these new technologies might provide some exciting opportunities for conservation they are unlikely to provide the transformation we need to see,” said Paul De Ornellas, the chief adviser on wildlife science at WWF UK.

“Addressing the primary drivers of biodiversity decline like habitat loss and overexploitation while supporting conservation efforts at scale that enable the protection and recovery of nature must be our primary focus if we're to address the biodiversity crisis.”

Dr David Jachowski, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at Clemson University and an expert on the black-footed ferret, added that while persevering genetic diversity is important, it is not enough on its own.

“Producing more animals doesn't necessarily mean you've removed the threat in the wild to release the animal and have it survive,” he said.

But the poo zoo team say modern and traditional methods can work in parallel.

“I'm not saying we should stop protecting habitats and stop doing in situ conservation efforts,” said Bolton. “I just think because of the dire straits we are in, you need to try multiple different tools”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

More than 150 people injured after blaze broke out in the early hours at Pulse club in town 60 miles from Skopje

At least 59 killed in North Macedonia nightclub fire

Arrest warrants have been issued for four people in connection with the nightclub fire in North Macedonia that killed at least 59 people and injured about 155 others.

The interior minister said police had arrested one man, but did not provide details about his involvement.

The blaze began at around 02.35am (01.35 GMT) on Sunday morning during a concert at the Pulse nightclub in Kočani, a town around 100 km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje.

Initial reports suggest as many as 1,500 people – mostly young - attended the concert by DNK, a hip-hop duo popular in the country.

The interior minister said some of the young clubgoers used pyrotechnics that caused the roof to catch fire.

North Macedonia's MRT public broadcaster reported that 27 people were hospitalized at the Skopje city hospital with severe burns, and another 23 were being treated at the clinical centre. Children were also reported to be among the injured.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickosk expressed “deep sadness” about the “tragedy” of the nightclub fire, saying the loss of so many young lives is “irreparable”.

Arrest warrants have been issued for four people in connection with the nightclub fire in North Macedonia that killed at least 59 people and injured about 155 others.

Officials estimate that 18 of the injured people are in critical condition. Some of the more serious cases are to be taken to hospitals in other European countries.

The interior minister said some of the young clubgoers used pyrotechnics devices that caused the roof to catch fire. As they were set off, “the sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke,” Pance Toskovski said.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickosk expressed “deep sadness” about the “tragedy” of the nightclub fire, saying the loss of so many young lives is “irreparable”.

The North Macedonian government is reportedly set to declare seven days of national mourning. It has also said it will step up inspections of nightclubs and other similar venues to ensure that they comply with internationally regulated safety standards.

You can read more about the nightclub fire in this report by my colleague Helena Smith. We are now closing this blog. Thanks for following along.

North Macedonian President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova visited victims at a hospital in the capital Skopje and spoke to parents waiting outside.

“It's terrible … hard to believe how this happened,” she was quoted as saying. “We must give these young people courage to continue.”

Officials said earlier that 155 injured people had been taken to hospitals across the country, 18 of them in critical condition. Some of the more serious cases were to be taken to hospitals in other European countries.

As a reminder, more than 1,500 people, mostly young, were attending the hip hop concert in Kočani when the fire broke out this morning.

Relatives of the victims of the fire have been gathering in front of hospitals and city offices in Kočani throughout the day, desperately asking authorities for more information.

Local resident Dragi Stojanov was informed that his 21-year-old son Tomce was among the 59 people who had died in the fire.

“He was my only child. I don't need my life anymore... 150 families have been devastated,” he said. “Children burnt beyond recognition. There are corpses, just corpses inside (the club).”

A woman who was in the nightclub when the fire started in the early hours of the morning has told of her escape from the chaos.

“The fire broke out suddenly and everyone started running for the exit,” the unnamed survivor said.

“There were charred bodies. I don't know… everyone is stressed. My sister is missing, we were unable to find her in the hospitals, so now we're waiting here, to find out if she's here.”

Kočani's hospital director said earlier that staff had found it difficult to identify some patients because of a lack of ID cards.

“The fire started around 2:30 am (0130 GMT), the sparklers that were on stage ignited the styrofoam on the ceiling. I heard an explosion and the roof collapsed,” one young person who was inside for the concert told local media.

“We all rushed to get out, we all ran towards one door that was for both entry and exit,” they were quoted as saying.

Pyrotechnics have often been the cause of deadly fires in nightclubs, including the one at the Colectiv club in Bucharest, Romania, in 2015 in which 64 people died.

Officials said the fire in the Pulse nightclub in Kočani this morning had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material.

Here is a look at some other nightclub and music venue fires that have led to significant death tolls:

January 2022: A blaze at Liv's Nightclub Yaouba in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, set off explosions that killed 17 people. The government suggested that fireworks set the roof alight and the fire then spread to areas where cooking gas was stored.

October 2015: A blaze that broke out during a rock brand's pyrotechnics display at the Colectiv nightclub in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, killed 64 people and left about 190 injured.

December 2009: An estimated 152 people died when a blaze broke out at the Lame Horse nightclub in Perm, Russia. It started when an indoor fireworks display ignited a plastic ceiling decorated with branches.

January 2009: An indoor fireworks display after a New Year's countdown ignited a blaze in the Santika club in Bangkok, Thailand, killing 67 people and injuring many more. Victims died from burns, smoke inhalation and from being crushed.

September 2008: A fire killed 44 people at the jammed King of Dancers nightclub in Shenzhen, China when a stamped broke out after a fireworks show ignited the ceiling.

The North Macedonian government has said it will step up inspections of nightclubs and other similar venues to ensure that they comply with internationally regulated safety standards.

The Guardian has learned that one of the owners of the Pulse discotheque is among those who have been detained.

Police have put out a ‘watch-list' for others who are suspected of involvement but have not come forward.

North Macedonia's government is due to shortly announce a seven-day mourning period for the victims of the Kočani nightclub fire and will order urgent inspections of all nightclubs and restaurants that host parties, according to reports.

Serbia's embattled leader president Aleksandar Vučić said 18 March would be a day of mourning in honour of the victims of the fire.

As with Greece, Bulgaria and Albania, he said Serbia was willing to assist its neighbour and offered to send helicopters, ambulances, and medical teams to North Macedonia.

In a phone call with the state's president, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, Vučić who this weekend faced mass protest rallies against his increasingly autocratic rule, said hospitals in Serbia would be ready to admit those injured in the accident.

“I expressed my heartfelt condolences to President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova following the tragic event in North Macedonia, which has deeply affected not only the people of that country but also all of us in Serbia,” Vučić posted on his Instagram account.

Our video team have produced this report about the Kočani tragedy.

Eighteen of those wounded are in a critical condition, reports Agence France-Presse, with casualties being taken to hospitals across North Macedonia and preparations to take some of the most seriously injured to other countries.

“Initially we didn't believe there was a fire. Then there was huge panic in the crowd and a stampede to get out,” one young woman who was at the concert told local media outside a hospital in the capital Skopje.

Fire crews and paramedics responded quickly and “tried to resuscitate people... but it wasn't enough”, said the woman, who was waiting outside for one of her friends, who was being treated for burns to his hand.

The interior minister, Pance Tokovski, said earlier there were 155 people in hospital after the fire.

“Preparations are being made to transport people seriously injured in the fire in Kočani to top hospitals in several European countries,” the head of North Macedonia's crisis centre, Stojanche Angelov, said.

The head of the Kočani hospital, Kristina Serafimovska, told media that the patients being treated there were aged between 14 and 25.

“Seventy of the patients have burns and carbon monoxide poisoning,” she said.

Pope Francis sent prayers Sunday to victims and survivors of the fire, in a message sent by the Vatican's secretary of state. The pope is in hospital in Rome after being diagnosed with double pneumonia.

The Holy Father wished “to convey to the families of the dead, mostly young people, the expression of his deep condolence, signifying spiritual closeness to the wounded,” wrote Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin in a telegram addressed to the bishop of Skopje, Kiro Stojanov.

Markos Trosanovski, a political commentator in Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, said the entire nation had been plunged “into profound shock over this tragedy”.

While it was clear that the nightclub was well over capacity at the time of the concert, the government had responded immediately to the disaster, he said.

Trosanovski told the Guardian:

The response on the part of the authorities has been instant.

But there were institutional failures, the nightclub was well over capacity and it appears there were not enough fire extinguishers which would have been necessary for it to have been granted a license.

Arrest warrants have been issued for four people in connection with the nightclub fire in North Macedonia that killed at least 59 people and injured about 155 others.

The interior minister said police had arrested one man, but did not provide details about his involvement.

The blaze began at around 02.35am (01.35 GMT) on Sunday morning during a concert at the Pulse nightclub in Kočani, a town around 100 km (60 miles) east of the capital, Skopje.

Initial reports suggest as many as 1,500 people – mostly young - attended the concert by DNK, a hip-hop duo popular in the country.

The interior minister said some of the young clubgoers used pyrotechnics that caused the roof to catch fire.

North Macedonia's MRT public broadcaster reported that 27 people were hospitalized at the Skopje city hospital with severe burns, and another 23 were being treated at the clinical centre. Children were also reported to be among the injured.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickosk expressed “deep sadness” about the “tragedy” of the nightclub fire, saying the loss of so many young lives is “irreparable”.

The interior minister has also said that authorities in North Macedonia have issued four arrest warrants over the deadly nightclub fire.

Panche Toshkivski says police are thoroughly investigating the cause of the fire and will hold those responsible to account.

The death toll from the fire at the Pulse nightclub in Kočani, North Macedonia, has risen from 51 to at least 59 people, the country's interior minister, Pance Toskovski, has said in an updated casualty count.

“According to the information that we have there are 59 persons deceased of which 35 are identified,” Toskovski said. “The number of wounded according to latest information up to noon (1100 GMT) is 155 people,” he added.

31 of the identified people who were killed in the fire were residents of Kočani, the eastern town where the concert took place, while another four were from the town of Stip nearby, the minister said.

Greece, Bulgaria and Albania have been quick to offer assistance to authorities in North Macedonia.

In a post on X, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, wrote:

Heartfelt condolences to the people of North Macedonia for the lives lost in the tragic fire in Kočani.

My thoughts are with the victims and their families, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured. Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time.

In a further show of support from the EU, Antonio Costa, president of the European Council, announced that the 27-member bloc “stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this moment of grief”.

“Heartbroken by the loss of so many young people in the terrible fire in Kočani. My thoughts go out to all the families of the victims of this tragedy,” he said in a statement posted on X.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Numbers using satellite broadband system has been growing but users are having second thoughts due to Musk's role in Donald Trump's administration

Tesla sales have tumbled, X has had an exodus of users, and now it seems cracks are appearing among those who have turned to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system as a means of staying connected in remote areas.

While the number of Starlink users has been growing, some subscribers have been venting their frustrations over Musk's political machinations, saying they will no longer use the high-speed satellite internet system.

Barry Nisbet, a Scottish fiddler whose Shetland business combines music with seafaring, cited Musk's controversial salute at a Donald Trump inauguration event as one of the final straws for why he was leaving Starlink, even if it put him at a disadvantage.

Nisbet said: “I've been deeply uncomfortable for some time and the role he played in the US election, as well as the monopoly he has, deeply bothers me.”

While Starlink dominates its sector, signs of users' unease come as excitement grows among European tech enthusiasts about the prospect of a homegrown alternative finally emerging. The value of shares in Eutelsat, the French owner of London-based Starlink rival OneWeb, have shot up by 500% since Trump's Oval Office row with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Eutelsat's chief executive told Bloomberg the company could replace Starlink in a couple of months in places like Ukraine.

Viasat, which owns UK network Inmarsat, is also in talks with European governments about replacing Musk's Starlink.

In the UK, Starlink is used mainly by people and businesses in rural areas who have poor broadband access, although there is also a minority of “preppers” and people who buy the tech as fans of Musk.

An installer of Starlink for businesses and homes in southern England said that, for now, there was no better alternative to Starlink for those who needed fast access to the internet.

He said: “In the industry we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it's a necessary tool and a solution that exists in a lot of rural areas, especially with the poor investment in infrastructure. But on the other hand, we have now got to deal with Elon – to put it politely – being a twat.

“The majority of people who use it are those in need of it due to being a remote area, but there is also a small minority ‘tinfoil hat' brigade element.”

Richard Opie, a consultant living in a semi-rural part of Northumberland, said he had got Starlink during the pandemic because there was not enough capacity on BT, but was now considering whether to stay with the company.

He said: “It's a godsend, especially in remote areas, but things have developed politically since then. Elon Musk is a very different figure and Tesla showrooms are being burned to the ground. I'm uncomfortable with him getting into bed with Trump and the way he has thrown his weight around.

“It's something we have wrestled with and looked for alternatives but we're sort of stuck for the moment.”

Nisbet's comments on a Facebook “Starlink UK Users' Group” – that he could no longer justify supporting Starlink – sparked a spirited debate among users.

Mel Sayer, another Starlink user, wrote: “I refuse to go to Trump's hotels as I won't give a penny to Trump. I now don't want to fund ‘President Musk' on his endeavours after that salute.”

Mike Brown wrote: “I share your thoughts but am stuck with Starlink for now. Amazon are due to launch a rival service but probably not until next year. I'll be jumping ship as quickly as possible.”

Others are sticking with Starlink. Paul Feakins, a consultant in West Sussex, said: “People use Starlink because they can't get an internet connection any other way, yet these idiots think they're making a statement by cancelling it because they happen to disagree with Elon on something.”

Starlink has been approached for comment.

Starlink has grown rapidly in the UK, from 13,000 subscribers three years ago to 87,000 last year.

Such has been the popularity of Starlink in some areas of the UK that the company has been levying an extra “congestion charge” for those areas where there is high demand.

The company provides ultrafast broadband speeds via a constellation of satellites. British customers typically pay from £75 a month for a 30-day term, plus £299 for hardware.

For non-customers, Starlink may be better known for its use in Ukraine, which has been vital for Kyiv's battlefield communications, after Starlink terminals were rushed there after Russia's invasion in February 2022.

Lately, however, the prospect of Ukraine being cut out of Starlink has grown, with Reuters reporting that US negotiators have threatened Ukraine with losing the system. Musk posted on X at the weekend: “Their entire frontline would collapse if I turned it off.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Interior minister says blaze at pop concert in eastern town of Kočani probably caused by pyrotechnics

Fifty-nine people have been killed and more than 100 injured in a fire that broke out in a nightclub in North Macedonia early on Sunday.

The blaze in the small eastern town of Kočani is thought to have erupted when special-effect pyrotechnics caused the roof of the Pulse nightclub to go up in flames.

North Macedonia's interior minister, Panche Toshkovski, informed reporters of the number of deaths after visiting the scene.

Toshkovski said the fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices “used for light effect” at the concert taking place in the club. As they were set off, “the sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke”, he said.

Social media footage showed the blaze breaking out at about 3am when the venue was packed with concertgoers attending a performance by hip-hop act DNK, one of the tiny Balkan state's most famous pop groups. Chaotic scenes ensued as people ran through the smoke while the musicians urged everyone to escape as quickly as possible.

More than 1,500 were attending the concert in Kočani, 60 miles east of the North Macedonian capital, Skopje.

In a written statement, the prime minister, Hristijan Mickoski, called the loss of so many young lives “irreparable”. As the scale of the tragedy became clear, Mickoski told the country that all forces had been “fully mobilised”.

“I call on all competent institutions – health services, police, local authorities – to take urgent measures to assist the injured and support the affected families,” he said in a statement posted to Facebook.

“In these times of deep sadness, when our hearts are broken with pain due to this terrible tragedy, I call for unity, solidarity, humanity and responsibility.”

The prime minister said he would make a public address on Sunday.

Police had arrested several people, the interior minister told the hastily convened press conference, although he refused to be drawn on the nature of their involvement in the disaster. “The most important thing is to find out all the facts and evidence necessary for the follow-up measures,” he said. “We must remain calm while taking all these steps so that something like this doesn't happen again.”

By mid-morning relatives were gathering at hospitals in Kočani and Skopje, to where victims had been rushed.

The state's health minister, Arben Taravari, said 118 people had been admitted to hospital. At least 27 people with severe burns had been admitted to the capital's main hospital while another 23 were being treated at Skopje's clinical centre, according to North Macedonia's public broadcaster MRT. Children were also reported to be among the injured.

“All our capabilities have been put to use in a maximum effort to save as many lives as possible of the young people involved in this tragedy,” Taravari told reporters, at times looking visibly shaken. Neighbouring countries including Greece, Bulgaria and Albania had been quick to offer assistance, he said.

Markos Trosanovski, a political commentator in Skopje, said the entire nation had been plunged “into profound shock over this tragedy”.

While it was clear that the nightclub was well over capacity at the time of the concert, the government had responded immediately to the disaster, he said. “The response on the part of the authorities has been instant,” he said.

My thoughts are with the victims and their families, and I wish a speedy recovery to the injured. Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time.”

The European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos, also expressed her condolences on the platform, writing: “Deeply saddened by the tragic fire in Kočani North Macedonia, which claimed the lives of too many young people.”

In a further show of support from the EU, António Costa, president of the European Council, announced that the 27-member bloc “stands in solidarity with the people of North Macedonia in this moment of grief”.

Treatment of Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan, who has been suspended from senate, shines light on women's rights 

Last July, Nigeria's third-most powerful man gave a rare apology on the floor of the senate which he heads.

Godswill Akpabio had chastised his colleague Natasha Akpoti-Uduaghan for speaking out of turn, saying: “We are not in a nightclub”. But after receiving what he said was a deluge of insulting text messages from Nigerians, he apologised publicly a few days later.

In recent weeks, the two have been at the centre of a political row that has gripped the country, after an interview that Akpoti-Uduaghan gave to the broadcaster Arise TV in late February in which she accused Akpabio of sexual harassment.

She alleged that in one incident Akpabio had told her that a motion she was trying to advance could be put to the senate if she “took care” of him. In another, she said that on a tour of his house he had told her – while holding her hand – “I'm going to create time for us to come spend quality moments here. You will enjoy it.”

Akpabio has denied the allegations.

Akpoti-Uduaghan submitted a petition to the senate alleging sexual harassment, but on 6 March the ethics committee struck it out on procedural grounds. It also handed her a six-month suspension without pay, citing her “unruly and disruptive” behaviour during an unrelated argument in the senate about seating arrangements.

The accusations have dominated conversations and highlighted longstanding women's rights issues in the socially conservative country, where no woman has ever been elected governor, vice-president or president.

Only four women serve in the 109-member senate, a drop from the seven female senators elected in 2015. The number of women in the 360-member House of Representatives has also declined, from 22 in 2015 to 17.

In a phone interview from New York on Monday last week, hours before speaking on the matter at a joint session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UN Women, Akpoti-Uduaghan railed against her suspension. “This was orchestrated to silence my voice,” she said. “That action is an assault on democracy … I am not apologising for speaking my truth.”

Women's rights groups have condemned her suspension, and hundreds of women and girls marched in the states of Lagos, Enugu, Edo and Kaduna on Wednesday during a “We are all Natasha” protest convened by the civil society coalition Womanifesto.

“Her suspension and the process that led to it was a shambolic show of shame,” said Ireti Bakare-Yusuf, a radio broadcaster and founder of the non-profit Purple Women Foundation, which is part of Womanifesto.

Ahmed Tijani Ibn Mustapha, a spokesperson for Akpabio, said Akpoti-Uduaghan's petition alleging sexual harassment had not followed guidelines because she had authored and signed it herself rather than asking another senator to do so.

He also said that after she had refiled the petition correctly, the senate began a four-week investigation into the claims.

Akpoti-Uduaghan, an opposition People's Democratic party (PDP) senator from the central state of Kogi, first tried to enter politics in 2019 with a run for Kogi governor. Thugs reportedly loyal to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) jeered her during the campaign, calling her a sex worker, and on one occasion attacking her and her driver. “This is definitely not an election,” she told reporters at the time. “This is almost like a war zone.”

Four years later, on the eve of the senate election she was contesting, portions of the main roads leading to her district were excavated overnight. She accused the APC of attempting to prevent her from campaigning. Authorities said they were protecting residents against terrorist attacks, citing a December 2022 bomb blast by an Islamic State affiliate.

She lost the election, but in November 2023 a tribunal overturned the results, paving the way for her to become one of Nigeria's youngest senators.

Akpabio, a political veteran, was the subject of another sexual harassment allegation from a former public official in 2020. He denied the allegation at the time and recently said he would sue his accuser. He had previously made headlines in 2018 when he predicted an election victory for his APC party by drawing comparisons with Hitler's invasion of Poland. Last year, shortly after becoming senate president, he was involved in another controversy when a senator was suspended for saying there were inconsistencies in the budget.

After Akpoti-Uduaghan's suspension, other senators coalesced around Akpabio, a powerful ally of the country's president, Bola Tinubu.

One male senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan had fabricated the claims because she was angered by her removal as chair of a coveted senate committee in February. Current female senators dismissed her claims on national TV, while one former senator said Akpoti-Uduaghan's claims were “a sign of weakness” and that sexual harassment happened only in schools.

“Male senators do not surprise me,” said Bakare-Yusuf of the reaction. “They mansplain even the basic of black and white to justify their selfishness. As for the female senators, disappointed is an understatement [but] like all hegemonic structures, patriarchy also has gatekeepers.”

In the aftermath of her accusation, a false claim that Akpoti-Uduaghan had borne six children by six different men surfaced on social media. The senate spokesperson said a kiss she shared with her husband on the senate premises before submitting her petition was “unspeakable” and an act of “content creation”. Over the last two weeks, crowds of pro-Akpabio protesters have turned up in public to abuse her in Abuja.

“Politicians sided with the senate president whom they believe has the power to grant them favours … and the poor were paid by those who have the most money to protest,” said Glory Ehiremen, senior analyst at Lagos-based geopolitical risk advisory, SBM Intelligence.

Some opposition senators have visited Akpoti-Uduaghan to show support. She also said she had received supportive emails from women across Nigeria, including some who were afraid to speak up about their own experiences. “In Nigeria, most women who are sexually harassed in workplaces don't even tell their husbands because they are afraid of being judged,” she said.

As the episode unfolds, more women are praising her bravery, but few think Nigeria's #MeToo moment has arrived.

Ehiremen said an entrenched culture of impunity was a barrier to justice. “The elite Nigerian cannot get justice unless they have alliances with the ‘powerful',” she said. “Never mind the ordinary Nigerian.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A trade war could push up inflation when both the UK and US economies really need cheaper borrowing. So what's a central bank to do?

Monetary policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic will be considering how seriously to take Donald Trump's threats of an all-out trade war as they give their verdict on the path of interest rates this week.

The Federal Reserve, the US ­central bank, will examine the prospect of a “Trumpcession” brought on by tariffs that send import costs rocketing and convince consumers, already shellshocked from the cost of living crisis, to stop spending.

Consumers are the engine of the US economy and confidence ­levels plummeted last month, according to the Conference Board's index of buying intentions, a leading survey. The index covering February registered the biggest monthly decline in nearly four years.

There are growing concerns that the US president does not care how far the stock market may fall while he battles Washington's major trading partners – and, worse, that he is sanguine about a fall in output which, if it continues, could bring about a full-blown recession.

Nigel Green, an analyst at investment firm deVere, says: “A dangerous mix of inflationary pressures alongside an economic slowdown puts the Fed in a precarious position.”

Yet he insists it is time for to “lead and not lag”, because preventing a severe downturn should be the top priority. “Rate cuts must come sooner rather than later to prevent deeper damage.”

The Fed will announce its ­latest ­decision on interest rates on Wednesday, swiftly followed by the Bank of England on Thursday. Policymakers at the Bank face the same dilemma: whether to continue cutting rates or to pause and wait while the tariff drama plays out.

Tariffs are high on the list of worries in Threadneedle Street. In November, the Bank believed ­inflation was beaten and interest rates were on course to fall well below 4% in 2025. Today, the Bank, like the Fed, is more cautious. The UK rate stands at 4.5%, slightly above the Federal Reserve target rate of between 4.25% and 4.5%.

On the domestic front, the Bank's situation is also similar to the Fed's – inflation is rising and remains above a 2% target level while the labour market, especially in the manufacturing and construction sectors, is characterised by rising unemployment, falling vacancies and warnings from employers of layoffs.

Robert Wood, chief UK ­economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) is right to be cautious. “The MPC is finding there is a very difficult trade-off between the figures showing an employment rate that is slowing and an inflation rate that is rising,” he says. “It faces a judgment call that most of the nine members will want to take longer to consider. And it's ­reasonable for them to wait until the fog lifts and they can see more clearly what direction the economy is going in.”

Official figures released on Friday showing that the UK economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in January did little to alter the view in financial markets that the Bank will keep rates on hold.

Like most economists, Wood expects the Bank to hold rates on Thursday and only cut again at its meeting in May. A further ­quarter-point reduction, to 4%, is then expected before the end of the year.

Events are likely to be more dramatic in the US, where consumer spending is more heavily aligned with a downturn in stock market values.

A Fed report last year showed that the strength in retail sales over the last decade has been driven by richer households that have, since the start of 2018, raised spending more than twice as much as the low-income groups, mostly underpinned by gains from the stock market. As Albert Edwards at Société Générale says: “If the equity market now plunges, we might find that it disproportionately hits retail sales more than usual.”

Garry White, an analyst at the stockbroker Charles Stanley, says: “Fears of a ‘Trumpcession' due to [the president's] aggressive trade policies mean that markets now expect the Fed will continue to cut interest rates, despite high inflation.”

However, the uncertainty about when tariffs will take effect, and whether that translates into prices, means Wall Street is generally expecting the Fed to delay this week.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Anti-slavery commissioner says scheme to plug staffing gaps post-Brexit was a ‘blunt instrument' that enabled exploitation of the vulnerable

A post-Brexit visa scheme to fill vacancies in social care was badly designed and enabled “horrific” abuse of migrant workers, the UK's anti-slavery watchdog has said.

Commissioner Eleanor Lyons said the care worker visa route introduced by the Conservatives in February 2022 had caused avoidable harm and “some really severe” exploitation.

“In an already high-risk sector where there were large-scale shortages and we needed lots of workers to be able to come in and fill that gap, there was a blunt instrument applied. It allowed for incredibly vulnerable people to be exploited because there wasn't a sensible policy intervention in the first place,” Lyons said.

The independent antislavery commissioner, a former special adviser to Boris Johnson, was speaking after the Home Office revealed more than 470 care companies have had their licences to sponsor migrant workers revoked amid concerns about fraud, abuse and exploitation.

About 39,000 workers were linked to the firms. The Work Rights Centre said the figures pointed to a “national scandal”. Lyons called the number of licence revocations “alarming”.

More than a quarter of the approximately 155,000 care workers who came to the UK from February 2022 to December 2024 were hired by employers who later lost their licence.

Lyons said that while it was “obviously good” that this government was “cracking down on rogue agencies”, she was concerned about unintended consequences for workers, pointing to strict rules that give them 60 days to find a new sponsor if theirs loses its licence – or face deportation.

She urged ministers to consider reforms such as changes to the tied visa system to make it easier for exploited workers to move to other care jobs, a licensing scheme for hiring from abroad, and tougher penalties for rule-breakers.

Changes announced last week including a requirement for employers to show they have tried to recruit from the pool of international workers already in England before hiring from abroad were welcome but not enough, she said. “The scale of the issue we're seeing means we need to have a fresh fundamental approach.”

The Observer previously revealed how care workers recruited from countries including India, Zimbabwe and the Philippines were tricked into paying illegal recruitment fees and in some cases trapped in conditions akin to debt bondage, with wages and passports withheld. Last year, an investigation found that companies granted licences to sponsor workers included suspected bogus firms with copy-and-paste websites, fake-looking reviews, PO boxes as addresses and no track record of providing care. In another case, 275 certificates of sponsorship were issued to a nonexistent care home. At least 177 companies were granted licences to sponsor workers despite a public track record of labour law violations.

Employment experts say lax oversight of companies granted sponsor licences combined with the structure of the scheme – which means workers' visas are tied to a single employer, rather than sector-wide – have been key drivers of fraud and abuses, enabling loosely vetted sponsors to profit from exploitative practices and leaving workers afraid of reporting bad employers due to the threat their visa could be cancelled.

Lyons said she had seen a “real range” of abuses, from “poor working practices where people have unreasonable demands put on them” to the “extreme end of the spectrum”, including “horrific” exploitation and instances of modern slavery. In some cases, workers had sold property and quit jobs at home to afford “extortionate recruitment agency fees” after being “promised a life here”, only to find the job did not exist.

She said ministers had made some positive changes since the scheme was launched, such as requiring care agencies that sponsor workers from abroad to be registered with the Care Quality Commission. But she questioned why it had not been better designed to begin with. “All the changes that have been made are sensible steps. I think the question remains: why were they never thought of in the first place? If the modern slavery charity sector was included from the start with the creation of this visa, I think we would have seen less exploitation over the years.”

The care worker visa route was introduced to plug critical staffing shortages in social care exacerbated by the end of free movement after Brexit. It relaxed immigration rules by expanding the existing health and care worker visa to include entry-level workers in low-paid jobs for the first time. It helped reduce the social care vacancy rate, although this still remains high. But by late 2023, the CQC was warning that modern slavery had become “a feature” of the UK's social care market.
  Unseen, which runs the Modern Slavery Helpline, identified a record 918 potential victims of modern slavery in the care sector in 2023, up from 63 in 2021. The number of migrant care workers coming to the UK fell drastically in 2024, partly due to changes to rules on family members.

Before the election, Labour said that if it got into power, it would launch an investigation into the treatment of migrant care workers. Yvette Cooper, now the home secretary, said the Conservatives had “turned a blind eye to widespread exploitation … putting vulnerable people at risk and undermining our immigration system”.

The Work Rights Centre urged the government to uphold its ­promise and said its actions so far had amounted to “tinkering” around the edges of a “national scandal”.

It said it had heard from 23 people in the past three months who were seeking help after their employer lost its sponsor licence, including one man, from North India, who was charged £16,000 to work in a UK care home. He now faces returning home in debt after the Home Office took action against his employer, leading to him losing his visa sponsorship.

The centre is calling for “urgent reform” including an end to tied visas and the introduction of new criminal offences and a civil penalties regime to hold sham sponsors to account. “With 470 employers having their licences revoked, this is far more than ‘a few bad apples',” its chief executive, Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, said.

The Home Office and Department of Health were contacted for comment. Last week, care minister Stephen Kinnock said the ­government was working to “crack down on shameful rogue operators” and to get victims back into careers in adult social care, including barring repeat offenders from recruiting ­internationally and requiring care providers to hire from the existing pool of migrant workers before looking overseas.

A Fair Work Agency is also planned to tackle mistreatment of workers, expected for 2026 or 2027, which Lyons said could be effective provided it was independent and had the “powers and funding to do its job properly”.

Pair recently met to discuss Donald Trump, Elon Musk and other political matters, Sunday Times says

Nigel Farage has reportedly met Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's adviser turned nemesis, after the Vote Leave founder suggested voters should back Reform UK at the local elections.

Cummings, who was once a sworn enemy of Farage during the EU referendum as he battled to keep control of the leave campaign, is reported to have met the Reform leader to discuss Whitehall changes, which allies said was the strongest sign yet that Farage was taking seriously the idea of becoming prime minister.

Cummings and Farage were at odds for years in the run-up to the referendum and during Cummings's time at No 10, with Farage calling him a “horrible, nasty little man”. Cummings's Vote Leave won the official campaign designation during the referendum.

According to the Sunday Times, the pair met recently for a “friendly chat about the general scene” including subjects such as US politics, Donald Trump and Elon Musk, as well as “how No 10 and the Cabinet Office really work, about the catastrophe of the Tory party and about what Reform has to do to replace the Tories”. A Reform spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Cummings was said to be in advanced talks to launch his own new party – the Start-Up party – but in February he posted on X that he believed voters should now back Reform UK.

Asked by one X user on Sunday who he would vote for at the next general election, Cummings wrote: “Dunno yet but obviously everyone should vote Reform this spring … No downsides, just upsides.”

In a post on his Substack, Cummings claimed Britain needed a significant political realignment including a merger of the Conservatives with Reform. He wrote: “Shove out Kemi [Badenoch] ASAP, take over Tories, get Trump/Elon to facilitate a merger with Reform, tip in a third force of elite talent and mass energy so voters see an essentially new political force whose essence is a decisive break with 1992-2024 … break the coalition supporting [Keir] Starmer, take over No 10, do regime change.”

Farage's party is on course for a number of gains at the local elections in May, including potentially winning control of eight local councils, according to Electoral Calculus.

Nevertheless, Reform has been in turmoil for the past fortnight due to a significant rift between Farage and Rupert Lowe, one of his former MPs who has been thrown out of the party in a battle over bullying allegations and referred to the police. Lowe had criticised Farage in a Daily Mail interview and since claimed he had been censored by the party on immigration issues.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Virtually unknown in the west, Ne Zha 2 is the world's highest-grossing animation at £1.6bn – outdoing Inside Out 2 –  just weeks after its release

Just a few years ago, the biggest star of the Chinese box office was a brave army commander. Last year it was a woman who rediscovers herself through boxing. But in 2025 the hero that has caught everyone's attention – and broken international box office records – is an animated demon child.

Ne Zha 2, a Chinese animation written and directed by Yang Yu, is a whirlwind of a film. The plot, inspired by Chinese mythology, follows the story of Ne Zha, a demon child raised by humans. He is on a quest to obtain a precious elixir to restore the physical state of his friend, the dragon prince Ao Bing, whose body has been destroyed by a lightning strike.

Epic battle scenes and spellbinding graphics – and a dose of symbolism – have enticed Chinese audiences to the cinema in their millions. Since its release over the lunar new year holiday between the end of January and the middle of February, Ne Zha 2 has taken 14.7bn yuan (£1.6bn) at the box office, making it the best-performing film in Chinese cinema ­history. Ne Zha 2 has also broken records globally: it is the highest-grossing animated film worldwide, surpassing Pixar's Inside Out 2.

Ne Zha 2 marks a shift from the patriotic epics that have dominated Chinese cinemas for the past few years. The Battle at Lake Changjin, which Ne Zha 2 pushed into second place, is a 2021 Communist party-sponsored film that depicts Chinese soldiers battling Americans in the Korean war.

Wolf Warrior 2, now third in the Chinese box-office rankings, is a 2017 film about a Chinese soldier who ­protects aid workers in Africa.

That doesn't mean that Chinese audiences are turning away from patriotism, said Yu Yaqin, an independent film critic in Beijing. But it reflects the fact “everybody can find something that resonates” in Ne Zha 2.

With the economy at a difficult ebb, and young people facing high unemployment rates, dissatisfaction with Chinese society is higher than it was a few years ago. The storyline about battling injustice and powerful authorities may feel particularly apt, Yu said. In one scene, Ne Zha proclaims: “My fate is controlled by myself, not by God.” “That really fits into the current situation where a lot of people might be struggling,” Yu said. “If a country isn't doing well, people want to put more focus on themselves.”

But patriotic viewers may also find their feelings reflected in the film. Some commentators have ­suggested there is anti-American symbolism in the film, such as when Ne Zha ­visits the jade palace belonging to the evil Shen Gongbao. Ne Zha gawps at how white the jade is – nationalists have suggested it represents the White House.

There is also a good dose of luck. The film was released over the lunar new year holiday, a time when many families make their only annual trip to the cinema. While the film was originally a word-of-mouth hit, local authorities and businesses soon jumped on the bandwagon to promote China's latest national hero, snowballing the film's success into a moment that netizens have described as China's guoyun, or national destiny.

The writer Afra Wang explained in a recent essay for the ChinaTalk newsletter: “Having weathered the pandemic's disruption, many ordinary Chinese seek reassurance about the future through familiar cultural frameworks. ‘National destiny' provides exactly that – it's a narrative that contextualises current struggles within a larger, ultimately triumphant story. It's therapeutic.”

Like another of the guoyun darlings – the AI company DeepSeek – Ne Zha 2 is everywhere in China. At a press conference about the economy on the sidelines of China's Two Sessions, the annual political meetings that concluded on Tuesday, the commerce minister, Wang Wentao, praised the film's success in attracting moviegoers to the cinema at a time when China is desperate to boost ­consumer spending.

One company in Shandong province spent 40,000 yuan buying tickets for its 1,000 employees to go and see it. A bar in Beijing offers a “Ne Zha reborn” cocktail (gin, raspberry, blueberry, roselle and lemon – 95 yuan). Yu said her local hairdresser was offering discounts to customers who came in with a receipt from seeing Ne Zha 2. “When things go viral … every city government will try to claim their involvement or say that they were part of the success story,” Yu said.

Despite Ne Zha 2's success in China, it is unclear if the film will perform as well overseas. The plot relies to a large degree on familiarity with Chinese mythology and with the original Ne Zha film, which was released in 2019.

The one market where it might have a better-than-average chance because of its shared Chinese cultural history is Taiwan, but the country limits the number of films from China that can be released each year. Ne Zha 2 is not on the list for 2025.

The film, with previews starting this weekend, is set for full release in the UK on 21 March. But even if British audiences swerve, many in China feel that their point has been made: China is reaching its national destiny, without needing the west.

Peter Reynolds, who runs a business in Afghanistan, was held along with his wife last month and needs heart pills, says his daughter

The life of a 79-year-old British man imprisoned along with his wife by the Taliban is in serious danger, his family have warned.

Peter Reynolds and his wife, Barbie, 75, who run a training business in Afghanistan, were detained last month when they travelled to their home in Bamiyan province.

Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, said her father's health had “significantly deteriorated” after the couple were separated and moved to a high-security prison.

“We hear he now has a chest infection, a double eye infection and serious digestive issues due to poor nutrition,” she said.

Speaking to the Sunday Times, Entwistle said: “Without immediate access to necessary medication, his life is in serious danger.” He requires pills for his heart after he had a mini-stroke before he was detained.

Entwistle said the family had been told that Reynolds was in immense pain after being “beaten and shackled”.

In a direct plea to her parents' captors, she added: “Our desperate appeal to the Taliban is that they release them to their home, where they have the medication he needs to survive.

“We believe this request should be viewed not merely as a plea, but as a unique opportunity to demonstrate an unforgettable act of kindness that will resonate around the world.”

The couple's business, Rebuild, has run projects in schools in Afghanistan for 18 years and continued after the Taliban regained power in 2021. Barbie previously became the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban.

The pair were arrested on 1 February with an American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them, and a translator from Rebuild.

The reason for their detention remains unclear. Entwistle suspects it was because they were teaching mothers with children.

The previous Taliban regime, before it was toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001, had accused the couple of teaching against Islam, but this case was dropped. The family said their parents respected Taliban rule and had adapted to the imposition of strict Islamic laws.

A Rebuild employee said last month the detained group was told their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”, adding that the three foreign nationals had been imprisoned in Kabul.

Hopes were raised in late February that the couple would be released.

In a statement reported by the BBC, the Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: “A series of considerations is being taken into account and, after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible.”

He added that the three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards.

Qani's statement drew a cautious welcome from Entwistle, who told the Times: “It's the first thing we've heard from the Taliban, so it's really positive, but he's really not saying very much. We know they were investigating to see if they were teaching anything against Islam, so that was a relief to us as we knew they wouldn't be.”

She added: “Next thing we heard, the investigation was because they're teaching parenting skills to mothers over the age of 30, with their children. Apparently, that was now against the law, but none of the influential people in that village [Bamiyan] thought it was a problem.”

The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970 after travelling there as part of an academic placement scheme. They became Afghan citizens after returning to the country 30 years later to set up Rebuild.

The couple's family initially did not want the UK government to get involved with the case.

A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of two British nationals who are detained in Afghanistan.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Nordic countries were early adopters of digital payments. Now, electronic banking is seen as a potential threat to national security

In 2018 a former deputy governor of Sweden's central bank predicted that by 2025 the country would probably be cashless.

Seven years on, that prediction has turned out to be pretty much true. Just one in 10 purchases are made with cash, and card is the most common form of payment, followed by the Swedish mobile payment system Swish, launched by six banks in 2012 and now ubiquitous. Other mobile phone payment services are also growing quickly.

In fact, according to the central bank's annual payments report, published this month, Sweden and Norway have the lowest amount of cash in circulation, as a percentage of GDP, in the world.

But in the context of today, with war in Europe, unpredictability in the US and the fear of Russian hybrid attacks almost a part of daily life in Sweden, life without cash is not proving the utopia that perhaps it once promised to be.

Such is the perceived severity of the situation that the authorities are trying to encourage citizens to keep and use cash in the name of civil defence. In November, the defence ministry sent every home a brochure entitled If Crisis or War Comes, advising people to use cash regularly and keep a minimum of a week's supply in various denominations to “strengthen preparedness”.

In its report, the central bank says: “Measures need to be taken to strengthen preparedness and reduce exclusion so that everyone can pay, even in the event of crisis or war.” For years, it says, efficiency has been the priority for payments, but now safety and accessibility “are at least as important”.

In December the government published the findings of an inquiry that proposed that some public and private agents should be required to accept cash – a recommendation that the central bank says the authorities should implement.

In recent years the central bank has been working on its own digital currency, the “e-krona”, as cash declines. But the project ended a couple of years ago, and the bank is now focused on monitoring the global development of digital currencies.

Sweden is not the only Nordic country backpedalling on plans for a cashless society. Last year Norway, which has a popular equivalent to Swish called Vipps MobilePay, brought in legislation that means retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they will not accept cash. The government has also recommended that citizens “keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”.

Norway's former justice and emergencies minister Emilie Mehl put it in clear terms: “If no one pays with cash and no one accepts cash, cash will no longer be a real emergency solution once the crisis is upon us.”

Ultimately, when it comes to emergency planning, the world's two most cashless societies are still banking on cash.

Whistleblower says over 1,000 inmates in England and Wales considered for the scheme which bypasses Parole Board

Criminals who have reoffended or broken probation restrictions are being re-released from prisons early on the government's direction under new measures to ease overcrowding.

Justice sources say jails are hurtling towards another capacity crisis despite Labour's ongoing early release scheme and attempts to shift more offenders into open prisons.

Last month, officials were instructed to trigger a new policy that aims to shorten the time prisoners spend in jail after being recalled following previous release. The Observer understands that more than 1,000 inmates are under consideration for the new scheme, and once it is fully implemented about 400 more offenders could be at large at any given time.

A probation officer has sounded the alarm over the process, which bypasses Parole Board evaluations of whether prisoners can be safely re-released and instead sees them freed by the justice secretary's representatives.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it would cause the release of offenders who “cannot be safely managed in the community”.

“It's putting pressure on probation staff to change their judgment and recommend the re-release of people who shouldn't be freed,” he added.

“There are no exceptions for terror offenders, sexual offenders, domestic abuse, stalking … you could have people under investigation for new offences being re-released.” ”

Internal guidance seen by the Observer says that offenders are eligible if they are assessed as posing a “low risk of serious recidivism”, are not known to present a “high risk of serious harm” and are not under investigation for a “serious further offence”.

“Being charged and/or being investigated for a further offence does not exclude the prisoner [from the scheme],” the document says.

Prisoners serving life terms and extended or indeterminate sentences that are given to particularly dangerous offenders, are excluded from the scheme. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said a previous version of the policy had been used for between 1,000 and 1,600 re-releases a year until there was a steep drop from 2020 onwards.

It said the decline had contributed to an increasing number of people held in prison on recall, which stood at a record of almost 13,000 by the end of last year in England and Wales.

But a political source said the number of inmates re-released by the Conservative government became “anaemic” because the HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) unit responsible for making decisions on behalf of the justice secretary was “risk averse”.

The probation officer accused the government of drawing up the new scheme because it was “screwed” on prison capacity. “Early release isn't making as much difference as they expected it to, and even if the sentencing review reports in the next few weeks, new legislation will take months,” he added. “They're going to be screwed by about June, so we don't know what they're going to do next.”

The MoJ has announced that a new 1,500-capacity prison in Yorkshire, HMP Millsike, will be opened within weeks and that other jails were being expanded through construction of new houseblocks. Mark Fairhurst, chair of the Prison Officers' Association, said the building programme would ease overcrowding if it runs to schedule but that an emergency contingency to hold prisoners in police cells was triggered as recently as last month in the north-east and north-west of England.

He warned that HMP Millsike in Full Sutton, near York, could only be populated at a rate of about 50 inmates a week to allow new staff and processes to safely “bed in”. “HMPPS has restarted its capacity gold [command group] because it's getting dodgy again. If it keeps going the way it is, we'll be full again by summer,” Fairhurst added.

A report released by the Public Accounts Committee on Friday said male prisons were “alarmingly full” and that the MoJ's internal forecast predicts that they will run out of space again by early 2026 despite early release measures. The watchdog said that “completely unrealistic” prison expansion plans were running five years late and £4.2bn over budget, leaving the government “entirely reliant on uncertain future demand reduction measures” in the Gauke sentencing review.

The MoJ said the new policy was necessary because prisoners who could be safely managed outside of jail were spending too long waiting for Parole Board decisions. It said only inmates considered a low risk of serious offending were eligible and that probation officers would perform full checks and put management plans in place before approving re-releases.

An MoJ spokesperson added: “This change will return the recall system to operating as it did in the 2010s, with proper safeguards in place to keep the public safe. It will help ensure we have cells for the dangerous offenders that need to be in prison.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The pandemic forced many people in England and Wales to reflect how they might die with dignity, and the numbers of those wanting to die at home is on the rise

When Marlene Viggers was told her newly diagnosed cancer was untreatable, she said she wanted to go home to die. “She was the matriarch of the family, she held everything together, and she wanted to have her family all around her,” said Neil Andrews, her son-in-law.

For the next few weeks, until Marlene died in January 2022 at the age of 73, she was given round-the-clock care by her closest relatives supported by Marie Curie, the end of life charity.

“She was in a lot of pain, but she had all the love and care she could hope for. Having us there, holding her hand, in her own home surrounded by the people and things she loved, brought her comfort,” said Andrews.

Marlene was one of a growing number of people dying at home rather than in hospital. The proportion of people in England and Wales who died at home rose by 5.3 percentage points between 2015 and 2024, while the proportion who died in hospital dropped by 4.6 points, according to data given to the Guardian by the Office for National Statistics.

The upward trend spiked during the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019, 24.4% of deaths were at home. By 2022, it had risen to 28.7%. The proportion has remained above 28% ever since.

“There was a big bump during the pandemic, and the figures haven't returned to pre-pandemic levels,” said Sam Royston, executive director of research and policy at Marie Curie. “Covid expedited a change that was already happening.”

The pandemic brought many people face to face with death. Between March 2020 and 5 May 2023, when the World Health Organization declared an end to the global health emergency, almost 227,000 people died in the UK with Covid-19 listed as one of the causes on their death certificate. The worst single day was 19 January 2021, when 1,490 people died.

But it was not just the scale of death. Covid restrictions meant large numbers of people died without loved ones by their side. People said agonising goodbyes to mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and others via video calls on devices operated by nursing staff encased in PPE.

People were barred from viewing the bodies of their loved ones, or carrying out rituals important in some faiths such as washing or dressing a body.

Gathering to mourn and share memories at funerals and wakes was suspended. The few relatives permitted to attend a funeral were forbidden from hugging, or even sitting next to one another. Even the monarch was not exempt. Queen Elizabeth, wearing a black face mask, sat alone at the funeral of her husband of 73 years in April 2021.

The pandemic forced many people to confront death. “It made us face the fact that there are some things in the world we can't control,” said Kate Woodthorpe of the Centre for Death and Society at the University of Bath.

“In western countries, we've come to assume we'll reach our 70s, 80s, 90s. We almost believe that death can be controlled, but it can't. We can't cure everything, disease kills people,” she said.

Many people thought more deeply about mortality, and what a “good” or “bad” death might be. A 2021 YouGov survey found that one in four adults said the pandemic had affected how they view death, with most of those saying they were more worried about losing loved ones, and almost half saying they thought about death more.

There was a “striking shift” in people making or updating wills, according to the Law Society. Post-pandemic, funeral directors reported increased interest in non-traditional ceremonies as a celebration of a person's life. The proportion of no-frills “direct cremations” has shot up from 3% of all funerals in 2019 to 20% in 2023.

Yet, said Laura Davies, who runs A Good Death project at the University of Cambridge, “people still lack the confidence and vocabulary to talk to their families about their end-of-life wishes and to understand what their options are”.

According to Marie Curie's Royston, surveys have shown that if you ask people where they would prefer to die, about 56% opt for home and only about 6% express a preference for hospital. But in 2024, ONS figures showed that almost 43% of deaths occurred in hospitals.

“A lot more people want to die at home than get to die at home. And a lot more people die in hospitals than would choose to do so,” he said.

People generally do not want to spend their last days in an overcrowded, busy and impersonal ward. “They want to be able to maintain dignity and self-respect, surrounded by loved ones in a familiar place. These are things more easily found at home.”

Research published last month from the Nuffield Trust and the Health Economics Unit showed, however, that 81% of the £11.7bn spent in the UK on health needs for people in the last year of their life went on hospital care. Less than a fifth of the total is spent on primary, community and hospice care.

Royston said: “People are taken into hospital at the end of their life when this could be avoided with better resourcing of health care in the community. Some people absolutely have to be in hospitals, but we're not providing community care to keep people at home where we can.

“There is a particular issue with out-of-hours care. If someone is in unbearable pain in the middle of the night with no specialist support, what their families do in reality is call 999 and the person ends up in hospital. With better out-of-hours provision, an awful lot of hospital admissions could be avoided.”

The overall amount of funding was not the issue, he said. “We don't need more money, we need to be better at spending it.”

Gillian Holtom certainly could have used better specialist help when her partner, Terry Leader, found he had terminal stomach cancer after being unable to see his GP during the pandemic. Terry wanted to die at home, but Holtom had little support in a distressing and stressful situation.

“You find yourself Googling ‘how to care for someone dying of stomach cancer'. It was a miserable few weeks and Terry was in a lot of pain. I remember desperately trying to get help but not getting anywhere, which made me feel very helpless a lot of the time,” said Holtom.

In the end, Terry was admitted to hospital. Holtom refused to leave him for nine days until he died on 22 June 2021, aged 67. “I feel like I let him down,” said Holtom.

Terry's final weeks between a very late diagnosis and death were “brutally handled” by their local hospital, said Holtom. According to Davies from The Good Death Project, a growing lack of confidence in the NHS may be a contributory factor in more people wanting to die at home.

“The impact of the experience of the pandemic combined with images of people being treated in hospital corridors just a few years later may make people more keen on a home death,” she said.

Woodthorpe said: “People are still very supportive of the NHS, but confidence in it has taken a battering.”

The challenges are likely to accelerate as demographic changes mean the need for palliative care will increase by 25% by 2048, according to Marie Curie. The vast majority – an estimated 75%-90% – of home-based end-of-life care is provided by unpaid carers, usually family members.

After helping to care at home for his mother-in-law in the last weeks of her life, Neil Andrews did the same for his mother, Anne, 11 months later.

“Regardless of our values or beliefs or religion, we all want to pass with our dignity intact, with minimum pain, and with someone you love holding your hand,” he said. “There was a beautiful moment just before my mother died, when the night nurse opened the window to let her spirit out. Would that happen in a hospital?”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ukrainian president maintains his troops are still fighting in Russia's Kursk region and warns that Moscow is ‘doing everything' to prevent a ceasefire. What we know on day 1,117

The Ukrainian president has accused Vladimir Putin of “lying to everyone” about the situation in the Russian province of Kursk and seeking to prolong the war. In an X post on Saturday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia's president was lying “about the situation on the ground, especially about what's happening in the Kursk region”. He said Ukrainian troops were still fending off Russian and North Korean forces in the area but face a potential new attack on Sumy in Ukraine's north-east. He said Kyiv's troops were not encircled in Kursk, as has been claimed by Russia, but that Moscow was accumulating forces nearby for a separate strike. “The buildup of Russian forces indicates that Moscow intends to keep ignoring diplomacy,” he said. “It is clear that Russia is prolonging the war.”

Russian troops recaptured the villages of Rubanshchina and Zaoleshenka in the Kursk region, the Moscow's defence ministry said on Saturday. On Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of the town of Sudzha as Ukraine's forces have been forced to retreat.

In the X post, Zelenskyy also accused Putin of lying “about how a ceasefire is supposedly too complicated” and warned Russia's leader will keep “dragging” out the war. “We talked about who would delay peace and slow everything down – and now we see it clearly,” Zelenskyy said. “A ceasefire could have already happened, but Russia is doing everything to prevent it.”

The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, said military powers will meet next week as plans to secure a peace deal move to an “operational phase”. Starmer held a virtual call with other European leaders and allies, including Zelenskyy, on Saturday, where he said a “coalition of the willing” would help secure Ukraine “on the land, at sea and in the sky” in the event of a peace deal with Russia.

Zelenskyy said Ukraine had successfully used a new domestically produced long-range missile in combat. The new “long Neptune” missile has a range of 1,000km (621 miles), he said in the X post. “A new Ukrainian missile, precise strike,” he said.

Zelenskyy said Russia wanted to achieve a “stronger position” militarily before committing to any ceasefire in the war in Ukraine. At a press conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said the question of territory in Ukraine's war with Russia was “complicated” and should be discussed in detail at a later date.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, echoed Zelenskyy, saying Putin is “escalating the fighting” and “wants to get everything, then negotiate”. Russia “does not give the impression it sincerely wants peace”, Macron said in the statement provided to AFP on Saturday and urged Europe and the United States to put pressure on Russia to accept a proposed ceasefire.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending the war. According to the state department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats “agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia”. The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.

Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Putin's first prime minister and now an opponent of the Russian president, said Moscow was interested only in a conditional ceasefire. Kasyanov told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: “He rejected this proposal for an unconditional ceasefire, he wants conditional, he wants a ceasefire on his terms.”

Ukraine said on Saturday it had downed 130 Russian-launched drones across the country at night. Kyiv's air force said the Iranian-made Shahed drones were downed over 14 regions and that Moscow had also attacked with two ballistic missiles.

Kyiv also said that the number injured in a Russian strike a day earlier on Zelenskyy's home town, Kryvyi Rih, rose to 14. On Friday, officials said Russia attacked a residential area of the central Ukrainian city. “Fourteen people were wounded, among them two children,” the head of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Sergiy Lysak, said on Telegram.

Russia deployed almost 200 firefighters to help put out a fire at an oil depot caused by a Ukraine drone strike in the southern Krasnodar region, authorities said. The governor of the Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev, said in the early hours of Saturday that a petrol reserve station in the Black Sea city of Tuapse was “attacked by the Kyiv regime”. The government of the Krasnodar region said 188 people were involved in putting out the fire.

Ukraine's largest private energy provider said on Saturday that overnight Russian airstrikes had damaged its energy facilities in the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions. In a statement, DTEK said “damages are significant” and that some consumers in both regions were left without power.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Sprint sensation Gout Gout, Australia's fastest man over 200m, has lit up the track with a world-leading run during the Queensland Athletics championships on Sunday.

Gout first blitzed the field in the under-20 heats to cross the line in 20.05s for the fastest 200m recorded across the globe in all ages in 2025. The 17-year-old smashed the previous best 20.13s clocked by Zimbabwe's Makanakaishe Charamba in Texas last month but better was still to come in the final in Brisbane.

The sprint prodigy went on to break the 20-second barrier for the first time in the U20 200m final with a wind-assisted 19.98s. Gout brushed off a false start to set the blistering time that was deemed illegal for a +3.6m/s tailwind but is now the fastest 200m by an Australian in all conditions and the sixth-quickest by an U20 athlete.

“At the bend I thought I can really send it,” Gout said. “I was happy and surprised but I feel a weight off my shoulders.”

Gout demolished the field in the 200m heat with a legal wind of +1.2m/s at his back to finish just 0.01s short of the national record he set at the same venue last December. While Gout was just outside his personal best of 20.04s (+1.5m/s), he again beat the previous Australian record that Peter Norman held for 56 years after running 20.06s at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968.

The Queenslander is moving to within touching distance of Usain Bolt's fastest 200m time at the same age of 19.93s. Gout, who turned 17 in December, bettered the Jamaican's personal best 16-year-old time of 20.13s when breaking the national record last year.

“It feels great because I've been at that stage watching people like Usain Bolt, getting goosebumps,” Gout said. “For me to give people goosebumps feels great.”

The year 12 student had already clinched the U20 100m crown after running 10.38s in the state championships final on Saturday. Gout had earlier eased to the line to finish his heat in 10.39s against a slight headwind and ran into a -1.4m/s wind in the final.

Gout has revealed that he is now in the middle of a heavy training block while targeting the Maurie Plant meet on 29 March, as well as the national championships in Western Australia in April. He is among a group of promising Australian sprinters – including Lachie Kennedy, Josh Azzopardi, Jacob Despard, Calab Law and Jack Hale – also eyeing off the $40,000 on offer in the 120m Stawell Gift on Easter Sunday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Farmers and bikers join students in climax to movement that  Aleksandar Vučić labels an ‘imported revolution'

A vast demonstration has been gathering in Belgrade, marking the climax of more than four months of student-led protests and the biggest challenge to President Aleksandar Vučić in the 11 years of his increasingly autocratic rule.

Vučić stoked tensions in the run-up to yesterday's mass protest, suggesting there would be an attempt to overthrow him by force and calling it an “imported revolution” with the involvement of western intelligence agencies, but he provided no evidence for the claims. The demonstrations against government corruption and incompetence have so far been overwhelmingly peaceful.

Hundreds of government supporters, mostly black-clad young men wearing baseball caps, many with matching black backpacks, gathered in Belgrade's Pionirski Park, opposite the Serbian parliament, one of the focal points of the demonstration. Local reports suggested there were members of organised football hooligan groups among them, as well as veterans of the Red Berets special forces unit implicated in the 2003 assassination of Serbia's liberal prime minister Zoran Djindjić.

A thick cordon of police ringed the assembly building and separated the Vučić supporters from the protesters, who also gathered in front of a stage set up in nearby Slavija Square.

In the mid-afternoon, protesters close to the state broadcasting headquarters in central Belgrade were told by police to move as there was a threat of an attack by a pro-government mob.

Intercity trains had been cancelled for the day in what the state railway company said was a security measure for passenger safety but which was widely seen as an attempt by Vučić to limit the size of the protests. Some city transport services were also suspended in the capital. But long convoys of cars converged on Belgrade from across the country, flying national flags and banners in support of the student cause.

In the roads leading into the city, scores of tractors joined the procession, signalling farmers' support for the protest movement, as well as hundreds of bikers, riding into town in a phalanx.

The European Union and the United Nations both appealed to the government ahead of the rally to respect the right to demonstrate. Western governments have been hesitant in their approach to the protests over the past four months, partly out of a desire to cultivate good relations with Vučić in the hope of luring him away from Moscow's orbit.

Vučić has cultivated Donald Trump, approving the construction of a Trump hotel in Belgrade, and on Thursday gave an interview to the US president's son Don Jr, who echoed the Serbian government's unsubstantiated claims that the protest movement was fuelled by foreign funding.

The younger Trump suggested the protests had been “weaponised … to incite, potentially, a revolution”, airing conspiracy theories about how the protests were organised and paid for.

The near-daily protests were triggered by the collapse of a concrete canopy over the forecourt of a newly renovated railway station in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people on 1 November. Public outrage was fuelled by an apparent attempt by government officials to cover up unsafe construction methods and potential corruption in the Chinese-led refurbishment.

The demonstrations have been led by students who have focused on demands for better governance and for state institutions to provide the services they are supposed to, without the need for bribes or personal connections.

The students, who make collective decisions rather than elect a leadership, have kept their distance from opposition parties, which they blame for being complicit in the atrophy and cynicism of the public sector.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Al-Khair Foundation says staff were setting up a camp for displaced Gazans in Beit Lahia Saturday when back-to-back Israeli strikes hit their vehicles.

At least nine people were killed Saturday in strikes on Gaza, authorities there said, as Israel continues to launch operations during its ceasefire with Hamas.

Eight of the dead were killed in back-to-back strikes on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. They included seven humanitarian workers and a person from the camp, according to the Al-Khair Foundation, a charity based in Britain and Turkey.

At least 150 Palestinians have been killed in such strikes since the fragile truce took effect in mid-January, Hamas said Saturday, including 19 on Friday and Saturday.

Israel has said it will continue to target individuals and actions that threaten it. Local news media and civil defense authorities in Gaza have reported the deaths of civilians, including women and children.

The ceasefire was envisioned as a three-phase deal, but talks to extend it have stalled.

The first phase, during which some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners were released, ended on March 1. The second is supposed to include the release of all living hostages still held by Hamas, Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and the end of the war, but the sides have yet to start negotiations.

Nine people were killed in attacks by the Israel Defense Forces in northern Gaza, the Health Ministry said. Their bodies were taken to the Indonesian Hospital.

Mohammed Abu Hasna, director of the Al-Khair Foundation's international offices, said humanitarian workers were opening camps for displaced Gazans when one of their vehicles was bombed. Two photographers, who were documenting the work, were killed.

The organization sent another car to evacuate the survivors, Abu Hasna said, but “as soon as they got into the vehicle, they were targeted and all killed.” The dead included seven foundation workers and someone from the camp, he said.

The IDF told The Post that it carried out the airstrike after it observed the group of men “operating a drone intended to carry out terrorist attacks against IDF troops.” The Israeli military named six of the people killed as members of the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups and accused two of them, Bilal Mahmoud Fouad Abu Matar and Mahmoud Imad Hassan Aslim, as being Hamas militants who “operated under the cover” of journalists.

Abu Hasna said “the claim that they pose a threat to the army” was “nonsense and unrealistic.”

There were no restrictions on setting up camps in the area, he said, the foundation typically documents its work, and the IDF was at least four kilometers away.

“This isn't the first time they've targeted humanitarian workers and then leveled false accusations,” he said.

Hamas called the attack a “dangerous escalation” that reflected Israel's “insistence of continuing aggression” and “intention to renounce the ceasefire agreement.”

Four boys were killed Friday in an Israeli strike in Gaza City, NBC News reported. Brothers Mahmoud Alerfan, 15, and Yusuf Alerfan, 13, and their friends Malik Althatha, 13, and Salim Hasnin, 15, had stepped outside to procure firewood for the evening meal to break the daily Ramadan fast.

Umm Mahmoud Alerfan clutched her sons' bodies and wailed: “I did not allow them outside, but today I did. Why did they come out today?”

Israel's energy minister said Sunday that he would immediately cut off electricity to the Gaza Strip, in an apparent effort to pressure Hamas on negotiations after the first phase of a ceasefire deal expired on March 1. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

U.S. involvement: Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians, including former President Joe Biden, the United States supports Israel with weapons, funds aid packages, and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations' ceasefire resolutions.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The blaze in Kocani appeared to have been ignited by pyrotechnics used as part of a local pop band's performance, the interior minister said.

At least 59 people were killed and more than 150 others injured in a fire that erupted during a concert at a nightclub in Kocani, North Macedonia, the country's interior minister in a news conference Sunday.

The fire broke out during a performance by a local pop group around 2:35 a.m. Sunday, Panche Toshkovski said during an earlier news conference. The blaze appeared to have been ignited by pyrotechnics that were used as part of the performance, he said, causing the roof to catch fire while concertgoers were still inside.

Video on social media verified by Reuters appeared to show sparklers onstage causing the low ceiling to ignite while the musicians performed.

At least 152 people were receiving medical treatment at hospitals throughout the country, including 18 in critical condition, the Health Ministry said on Facebook.

It was not immediately clear how many people were in the venue when the fire erupted or how many of the victims were concertgoers.

Local outlets identified the venue as Club Pulse, which was hosting a performance by the pop duo DNK on Saturday night, according to its Instagram page. Photographs of the nightclub on Sunday morning showed the building's charred exterior surrounded by emergency responders.

Officials issued arrest warrants for four people in connection with the blaze, Toshkovski said Sunday.

North Macedonia's public prosecutors have also opened an investigation into the fire, with initial findings indicating that the blaze was caused by the use of pyrotechnic materials, state-owned news outlet MIA reported, citing the country's state prosecutor, Ljupco Kocevski.

In a statement on Facebook, Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said it was a sad day for North Macedonia. “The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the pain of families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable,” he wrote.

The tragedy is among the deadliest in recent memory to unfold in North Macedonia, a small, landlocked country of 2.1 million people in southeastern Europe that gained its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. The town of Kocani is about 60 miles east of North Macedonia's capital, Skopje.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The aid freeze has upended anti-narcotics efforts in Latin America, with programs in Colombia, Mexico, and Ecuador affected.

BOGOTÁ, Colombia — As Latin America's drug trade surges, the Trump administration's aid freeze has brought crucial anti-narcotics programs to a screeching halt.

The administration paused virtually all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department, including its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. INL has supported governments and security forces worldwide to combat organized crime, human trafficking and drug trafficking.

Last year outside Bogotá, Colombian law enforcement officials captured “El Hombre” — the alleged ringleader of one of the largest drug trafficking networks in the Caribbean. The officers used skills taught to them months earlier by U.S. law enforcement under the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, according to an internal program report.

Colombia's army commander described the capture of Erick Mosquea, the alleged leader of the “Falcon Network,” as “an important blow to international drug smuggling.” U.S. authorities had been on the Dominican drug kingpin's tail since 2016.

In a statement to The Washington Post on Friday, Colombia's Defense Ministry confirmed that the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, known as ICITAP, has been suspended, and that other training programs have been affected across the security forces and government.

“Given the status of the United States as Colombia's main strategic ally in defense and security, most of the cooperation programs transcend to all levels, which is reflected in the operational development in the fight against drugs and transnational threats in general,” the statement said.

The State Department's aid freeze curtailed a fentanyl screening program in Mexico's largest port. In Colombia, the world's largest cocaine producer and a U.S. ally in combating the drug trade, 18 Black Hawk helicopters were grounded after funding for fuel and maintenance was paused.

Washington has begun to issue waivers for these initiatives and some other frozen programs. According to the State Department, waivers for $7.8 million in INL funding have been granted for programs in Mexico to counter production and trafficking in fentanyl, and to dismantle terrorist criminal organizations. But other programs and investments remain paused.

In Ecuador, one of the biggest cocaine-trafficking hubs, the country's navy planned to begin construction this year on a $7 million dock for anti-narcotics operations along a coastline that has gone largely unprotected in recent years; the project is now on hold. In Mexico, about 60 INL contractors were terminated — roughly half of the contract force, one official said. Offices that train police and prosecutors, which relied on INL funds, have been hit by the freeze.

The Trump administration is “undertaking a whole-of-government review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,” a State Department official said in a statement.

Aid “implementing agencies” this month were sent a lengthy questionnaire asking, as part of the review, for a self-declaration that they have not “collaborated with” or been accused of working with terrorist entities, “cartels, narco/human traffickers,” as well as “groups that promote mass migration in the last ten years.”

It also asked whether they are compliant with U.S. policy blocking any funding for abortion counseling, work with any entity “that espouses anti-American beliefs,” have received funding from China, Russia, Cuba or Iran and whether funded projects “reinforce U.S. sovereignty by limiting reliance on international organizations or global governance structures.”

“The high irony is that just about every dime of U.S. counter-human smuggling training and capacity building comes out of INL,” said John Feeley, who served as an ambassador to Panama under the first Trump administration. “What is the Trump administration's top priority? Stopping illegal and undocumented migration. They shot the golden goose right in the leg.”

The freeze has revealed the region's deep dependence on U.S. counternarcotics programs — and upended it.

For decades, INL has funded programs helping governments around the world strengthen their criminal justice systems and combat international drug trafficking and organized crime.

In Colombia, INL programs have been crucial to boosting the capacity of its police since 1985. Alberto Lara, a former vice minister of defense in the government of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, said the partnership between Colombian security forces and INL has been essential to combating the growth of transnational criminal organizations.

“The police intelligence would not be what it is today without INL,” said Elizabeth Dickinson, a senior analyst in Colombia for the International Crisis Group.

Dickinson said she worries the freezes will pull Colombia — the  most important, stable and trusted U.S. partner in South America — further away from the United States.

“It's really the moment that Colombia starts asking, is this the right decision geopolitically?” Dickinson said. “If the U.S. is not a dependable partner, Colombia is going to have to look elsewhere.”

A former Petro government security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues, estimated that the government depends on the United States and U.S. allies for 70 percent of its security resources.

Over the past month, the official said, it has forced the government to begin looking into new partnerships — on technology and security — with other countries, including India, Turkey and countries in the Middle East.

Much of the U.S. funding to address drug trafficking and other criminal activity goes to international organizations with which the United States closely coordinates. Among them, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime receives about a quarter of its annual budget of about $420 million from the United States — all of which was frozen last month.

While UNODC has been notified of some waivers, much of the money still has not been released and it remains unclear which programs will be permanently cut after Secretary of State Marco Rubio's review is completed.

Unlike some other U.N. and international agencies, most of UNODC spending is program-specific, with INL as well as the Justice and Homeland Security departments requesting and funding specific programs based on U.S. priorities.

In Central America, UNODC has set up cybercrime units and trained local law enforcement to intercept communications used by smugglers to recruit migrants and by sex traffickers. In Southeast Asia, a program counters online scammers, who often target Americans.

In addition, the UNODC publishes an annual World Drug Report, a key source of data on global narcotics flows that is used by U.S. agencies. It operates a lab to detect new synthetic drugs and runs a container screening program in at least 80 ports, including Mexico, training officials and supplying advanced equipment to combat smuggling.

Last week, following complaints from U.S. lawmakers, the UNODC received notification of a waiver for the port container control program in Mexico, although the long-term continuation of that program and others are still subject to the 90-day review to determine what should be permanently stopped. (The pause in aid to the container program was first reported by Reuters).

A number of international aid organization officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid attracting unwanted administration attention, said both the waiver and review processes have been rife with conflicting instructions from different U.S. funding agencies.

In Guatemala, INL has supported a task force that identifies and destroys chemical precursors — including those used for fentanyl. U.S. officials have hailed the program as a success, with five seizures of fentanyl precursors in three months. INL said in a statement to The Post on Friday that “the unit continues to receive INL funded support through DEA.” But while the program was granted a waiver, the full funding hasn't resumed, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment on the record.

Even as waivers emerge, officials said, damage has already been done — programs dismantled, bills unpaid and staff lost.

And it's not just about the halt of the programs, but the way they were publicized, said the former Colombian security official.  The news of the Black Hawk helicopter aid freeze gave armed groups information allowing them to find gaps in the armed forces' resources, the former official said, a dangerous development as the country faces some of its worst waves of violence in years.

ICITAP, the law enforcement training program, had recently launched a project to train about 600 Colombian police officials in investigating and tracking money laundering — crucial specialized skills to dismantle powerful criminal organizations, according to a former official involved in international security cooperation in Colombia.

The program, which had been in the works for years, is now suspended.

Belarus's Lukashenko calls Putin his “elder brother,” but over 30 years in office, he's had to balance close ties to Moscow with keeping his country from being swallowed.

NOVAYA GUTA, Belarus — Three years after Russia used Belarus as a launching pad for its brutal invasion of Ukraine, the border here between Belarus and Ukraine is eerily quiet.

Gone are the days when the highway at this crossing was a bustling conduit between the port of St. Petersburg on the Baltic Sea and the port of Odessa on the Black Sea. Now the crossing is used only for exchanges of prisoners of war and dead soldiers. Rows of dragon teeth puncture the surrounding fields and roads, and the way to Ukraine is barricaded and desolate.

Belarus lost a lot in severing its relationship with Ukraine — the West doubled down on sanctions after Minsk allowed Russian troops to use its territory as a staging ground. And Belarus is more than ever seen as a proxy for Moscow, with President Alexander Lukashenko even acquiescing to hosting Russian tactical nuclear weapons, including Moscow's latest, the Oreshnik hypersonic ballistic missile.

While Lukashenko has expressed “no regrets” about Belarus's role in the conflict, his public statements belie a more complex picture of a country walking a delicate tightrope between its Soviet past — and an aggressive eastern neighbor — and its aspirations for renewed engagement with the European Union.

After Russia helped Lukashenko weather protests against his rule, he leaned even more into his country's pre-independence Soviet identity for everything from language to education. At the same time, however, he made overtures to the West to present himself as a mediator. As Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed for full integration of the two countries and a common currency, Lukashenko has managed to thread the needle, serving as a key ally to Moscow and a backer of the invasion — he appeared with Putin on Thursday as they pledged to deepen defense cooperation — while maintaining a degree of strategic sovereignty.

A rare trip to Belarus by a Washington Post reporting team has shown how Russia's shadow continues to lengthen over the country, and how it has been caught between two neighbors in a high-stakes conflict that could upend the global security order. With its strategic location between the NATO states and Russia, Belarus is key to any discussion about the future of European security. The question for Western governments is what role Belarus could play — will it just be a proxy for Russia or could Lukashenko become a go-between?

Unlike Lukashenko, residents in the border town of Novaya Guta deeply regret the war.

They recounted with grim faces their shock when columns of Russian armored vehicles rumbled through the town one night three years ago, as rockets and missiles roared overhead. Some even fear that a new “special military operation,” Putin's euphemism for the war, could absorb Belarus.

Sofia — who like many in this article is not identified by full name because of potential backlash from authorities for speaking to the international press — said people in the village are afraid that what was done to Ukraine could happen to Belarus, too.

“People who don't pay attention to this do not care. And those who do are afraid that Belarus may become a little Russia,” she said.

Sofia said her sister in Ukraine had cut contact since the war started — a story similar to those of several others in the village with relatives across the border. “We are guilty. This war was our fault, too,” Sofia said sadly.

On peak days, about 15,000 people and 7,000 vehicles used to flow along this highway. Border guards remember the “great” relations they used to have with their neighbors to the south, while residents recall a time when there was no border at all — one could just walk into Ukraine. Many here speak a blend of Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian.

“We haven't been lucky with our history here,” said one border guard, Andrei.

“So many people have died in this war,” he said. “The blood that's been spilled will only be forgotten after several generations.”

Still, Ukrainians should understand that resistance to Russia is futile, Andrei added — they should never have expected to win this war. In a time of such global instability, he said, small nations must choose bigger partners.

Anton Bykovsky, press secretary for Belarus's State Border Committee, had a similar message.

“When the middle brother fights with his older brother, as younger brothers, we naturally do everything possible to ensure that the family is in order and that there is no discord,” he said.

The hulking Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 30 years, frequently refers to the slighter Putin as his “older brother,” and the Belarusian's time in office has seen the development of a close, symbiotic relationship with Russia that began with their formation of a new union in 1995, four years after the fall of the Soviet Union  during a brief moment of liberalization for Belarus.

Putin has often suggested he would like to fully integrate the two countries. Lukashenko, who once called talks of unification “exceedingly stupid,” has so far managed to stave this off, but Putin has been taking advantage of Lukashenko's increasing vulnerability to push the countries even closer together.

“What we see now in Belarus is a creeping occupation, and this is done with consent of Lukashenko. Lukashenko does not serve the interests of Belarus, but the interests of Putin and Russia,” exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said in an interview. She added: “This could lead us to the situation where Belarus becomes completely swallowed by Russia.”

Tikhanovskaya is recognized in the West as the true victor in Belarus's 2020 presidential election, an event that ignited massive anti-government protests and, after a violent crackdown, deepened Belarus's international isolation.

In the nearly five years since those protests swept Belarus, Lukashenko has brutalized, jailed and exiled his critics. Today, a repost on social media is enough to get you jailed for criticism of the government.

The bond between Russia and Belarus has also deepened, culminating in Minsk's role in the invasion.

Western sanctions have made the economy of this country of just 9 million even more dependent on Russia, the focus of two-thirds of its trade.

“Within the Union State, we have many common, interconnected ties. … It's as if we are a single, joint space,” explained Sergey Avramenko, director of Minsk Tractor Works, using the formal term for the Russia-Belarus relationship. His sprawling operation, built on the order of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, exports 30 to 50 percent of its production to Russia.

But despite this reliance on Moscow, Lukashenko, a wily former collective-farm boss, is quick to demonstrate his readiness for renewed outreach with the West.

A fresh release of political prisoners was welcomed by the White House, and there has been speculation it could be a ploy to persuade the Trump administration to ease sanctions, as the United States recalibrates its relationship with Russia.

Lukashenko may be “looking to turn the page,” said Belarusian activist Dmitry Bolkunets. But the West should not be fooled, he warned. “He will exploit this tactic, continuing to imprison new individuals and trading their release.”

On an unusually bright January afternoon at the Brest Fortress, dozens of glum-looking schoolchildren were training in self-defense, first aid and rappelling at a building still riddled with World War II-era bullet holes.

The fortress, at the border with Poland, lies at the heart of one of modern Belarus's founding legends — it is where 1,000 Soviet soldiers died defending the city from invading Nazi forces at the start of a war that would go on to kill almost a third of the Belarusian population.

Viktor Ivanov, director of the Brest Regional Center for Youth Creativity, and his instructors are passionate that young Belarusians should be encouraged to connect with their history, which in the instructors' eyes reached its peak with Belarus's contribution to the Soviet victory over fascism.

But the message and historical narrative taught at the youth center is selective, critics argue, saying it ignores Belarus's medieval past, its history under Polish rule and its periods of independence. The program focuses largely on World War II — and is strikingly similar to government youth outreach in Russia.

Since the 2020 protests, Belarus has poured money into youth clubs like these and created new positions at schools to supervise military and patriotic upbringing. Last year, authorities announced a unified history textbook for Belarusian and Russian students.

“Lukashenko has mixed together the Second World War, obedience to his regime and support for the war in Ukraine into a single narrative, and he uses this narrative to confront Western liberal values, democracy and human rights,” said Franak Viacorka, Tikhanovskaya's chief adviser.

Meanwhile, people are warned away from places that tell a different story about Soviet times. At Kurapaty, a pine forest on the outskirts of the capital where Soviet-era secret police killed tens of thousands of people before World War II, surveillance cameras ring the woods and signs warn visitors they are being recorded.

There is no official memorial here. Authorities instead built a busy road that cuts through the forest, dismantling dozens of wood crosses that reminded Belarusians of the scale of the state's slaughter.

Language is another identity battleground in Belarus. As Valzhyna Mort, a Belarusian poet and professor at Cornell University, puts it: Once you open your mouth in today's Belarus, your political stance is determined.

After 2020, speaking Belarusian — closer to Ukrainian and Polish than Russian — became a sign of resistance to the regime, even though it is one of two official languages. Its teaching and use have come under increased scrutiny in recent years as the country has  experienced a new wave of Russification, drawing it closer to its neighbor.

Lukashenko has long regarded Belarusian as a “poor” dialect and, over his three decades in power, has weakened its use in preference of Russian. Belarusian still appears on street signs, government buildings, electoral ballots and public transportation — but it is very rare to hear it spoken.

“Belarusian has been reduced to a costume and a kitsch,” Mort said. “The government is not about to eliminate it completely, but our predominant culture is Russian, and Russian power is transmitted to us through the Russian language.”

There are islands of Belarusian still out there. At the Yakub Kolas museum in Minsk — dedicated to the life of the famous Belarusian writer of the early 20th century — guided tours are given almost exclusively in Belarusian.

Kolas's life was shaped by the state's repression of the Belarusian language. He was jailed for speaking Belarusian, and he smuggled early drafts of his first book out of prison by hiding scraps of paper in his long black beard.

“People still feel it is dangerous to speak Belarusian today and they are scared,” said one of the museum's guides. “It is linked to this Soviet period of repression.”

Belarusian publishers and writers have been jailed or pressured into exile. Teachers have been fired for conducting lessons in the language. Belarusian news sites have been shuttered. Conversely, the language has experienced something of an online renaissance, with a growing number of Belarusian-language content creators on TikTok, as young Belarusians seek to engage with their roots.

The Belarusian language is dying, said Sergei, 34, who works in digital sales in Minsk. “We are like a base for Russia and we can't do much about it,” he said, adding that Ukraine was right to fight for its national identity.

Not everyone is against Lukashenko's policies or a closer union with Russia.

Public sentiment has improved toward the authorities since 2020. Amid fears that Russia could try to draft Belarusians to fight alongside Russian troops, people credit Lukashenko with keeping the country out of direct involvement in the war.

Stronger economic ties with Russia, which have stabilized an isolated Belarusian economy and increased wages, have also tempered ripples of discontent.

Sergei Azhanilok, an economist, told The Post that it would be a “good thing” if Belarus and Russia were a single powerful state. “If we unite the territories, we wouldn't see much difference — we are one people, the Slavs,” he said.

Lukashenko is maintaining a “comfortable status quo” with Russia, according to Artyom Shraibman, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. But, in a recent analysis, he said that could be threatened by the momentous changes afoot with the war in Ukraine and talk of peace negotiations.

If the campaign against Ukraine were to be frustrated, he warned, Russia might “incorporate Belarus as a consolation prize.”

“Any shift in the current equilibrium spells danger for Minsk,” Shraibman said, adding that Lukashenko's “task ahead is monumental: keeping relations with his guarantor from going to either extreme.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Ownership of electric vehicles continues to rise in the U.S., with nearly six million battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids currently on the road. Even though that's still a fraction of the overall market and the growth rate of EV sales has slowed, automakers remain invested in the eventual transition away from gasoline, as 2024 sales of traditional internal combustion engine cars fell below 80% for the first time in modern automotive history.

Continued EV sales growth shows that at least for a significant portion of auto consumers, range anxiety is no longer an issue. But it is a persistent fear in the EV market that is getting a new test with the Trump administration looking to slash EV incentives from the federal government.

The majority of EV owners charge up at home, but from city streets and interstate highways to parking garages and airports, the EV industry is concentrated on installing enough chargers in public places to help end range anxiety, while building pure-play charging business models that can stand on their own and turn a profit.

According to the latest figures compiled by Paren AFDC+ Charger Database, there are 68,000 public and private Level 3 (fastest) and Level 2 EV charging stations across the country, each with one or more individual ports, for a total of around 266,000 ports. Installing, operating and servicing the chargers, it's an industry that is a fundamental driver of widescale EV adoption — and right now, it's an industry that is struggling to maintain traction in what has lately become an uncertain and politicized marketplace.

Despite a recent surprise Tesla's sales event at the White House, Trump and his top administration officials — from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Energy Secretary and former fossil fuels industry CEO Chris Wright — have made it clear that stripping away federal support for EVs is among changes being sought as they prioritize oil and gas in energy policy. Already impacted by the slowdown in EV sales, charging companies are battling a recent freeze on an important federal funding program, while also waiting to see how OEMs are affected by the Trump administration's tariffs and resulting trade wars, particularly involving essential steel and aluminum.

Former President Joe Biden, as part of his signature agenda to combat climate change, set a goal that half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 would be electric, which also meant having an adequate, reliable nationwide charging infrastructure by then. To address the build out, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program was authorized by Congress under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

NEVI earmarked $5 billion in grants, apportioned annually over five years, to states' departments of transportation to deploy a network of 500,000 high-speed EV chargers by 2030, primarily along interstate highways, but also rural roadways and low-income communities. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs. State DOTs are responsible for developing projects and coordinating with site owners and charging companies, which can be an arduous process, markedly different from planning routine infrastructure projects.

A national issue that the funding seeks to address is that while public chargers are relatively plentiful in big cities and suburbs where EV adoption is high — think San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Chicago, Miami and New York — they're lacking in rural and remote communities in places like Montana, Wyoming and upstate New York, where EVs sales are low. That geographic disparity contributes to charging anxiety. Drivers are worried that there aren't enough charging stations outside of metro regions, which accentuates their fears of running out of juice, especially on long trips. And harrowing tales of broken, vandalized or otherwise non-working chargers feed into the trepidations.

According to Paren, four of the five years of NEVI funding, or $3.2 billion, has been approved for all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Yet only $616 million has been awarded by 33 states to 104 applicants for 1,000 charging stations. To date, 60 charging stations with a combined 268 ports have been built, using $33 million of NEVI funds. While the federal government has not released figures, Paren estimates that perhaps less than $25 million has actually been transferred to states to reimburse charging companies for incurred expenses.

Stark evidence of the Trump administration's plans to target EV charging came on Feb. 6, when the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration issued a memo to state DOTs informing them that it was suspending NEVI. The memo stated that FHWA will publish revised NEVI guidelines this spring and solicit public comment before final rules are determined. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy subsequently told Fox Business News that any existing contracts that have been signed ""are still going to be funded, but there will be no new funding priorities or projects as we go through a review process.""

The NEVI freeze created immediate confusion among state DOTs, especially as to whether the approved funds will indeed be allocated. ""We need that to happen, because this program works on a reimbursable basis,"" said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Many states, he said, ""have essentially issued stop work orders, even for existing contracts, because they don't want to be left holding the bag if the feds decide not to reimburse for any work.""

Historically, new administrations have set their transportation priorities and shifted them accordingly. Yet amending programs and funding that are authorized in law — including NEVI, for which funding has been delayed — would require an act of Congress. The Trump administration, nonetheless, sidestepped Congress and unilaterally suspended NEVI and its funding formula while it considers new guidelines.

In the interim, if those approved funds are not allocated to states, the courts may end up determining whether the freeze is legal. In a ruling on March 6, a federal judge blocked the president's hold on congressionally approved funds obligated to state agencies and governments, which could conceivably apply to any attempts to renege on NEVI funding.

Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, has a jaundiced view of the motivation behind the NEVI pause. ""The administration's plan is not to actually impact the deployment of charging infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's to drive the narrative that we're killing those evil EVs and EV chargers.""

For the small sector of EV charging companies, headlined by a trio of publicly owned pure-plays — ChargePoint Holdings, Blink Charging and EVgo — all of the EV uncertainty has been enough to keep shares under considerable pressure, with year-to-date declines of 35% to 50% and two of the three stocks currently trading below $1.

ChargePoint provides infrastructure hardware, software and services to businesses and fleets that operate EV charging networks. Competitors Blink and EVgo own and operate their own chargers and networks, while also supporting third-party operators. All three experienced substantial stock falloffs starting in 2024, and investors are keeping a wary eye on their performance over the coming months.

The rest of the EV charging industry encompasses a diverse array of players, among them privately held startups, a joint venture between eight automotive OEMs known as IONNA, highway truck stop and travel centers like Love's, Kwik Trip and Pilot Flying J, convenience store chains including Wawa, Sheetz and 7-Eleven, and big-box retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco.  

Nearly half of the NEVI awardees are members of the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, the trade association for more than 250 highway truck stops and travel centers, and SIGMA, which represents fuel marketers. David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for both groups, is critical of NEVI's ""incoherent patchwork, not only of grant requirements, but of regulatory and market backdrops in different states that are wholly untethered to one another."" So if the program's pause ""is a bona fide effort to turn it into something more market-oriented and consumer-oriented,"" Fialkov said, ""we think that's ultimately better for the market.""

McDonald says a look at the industry numbers shows that the reality is, ""whatever they attempt to do is probably going to have little to no actual impact on deployment.""

In 2025, for example, about 10% of fast-charging ports may be funded through NEVI. McDonald estimated that a total of about 16,000 new fast-charging ports will be added this year. ""From a macro perspective, the industry is not dependent on federal funding,"" he said. At most, he added, ""only about 1,500 of those will be NEVI-funded, and maybe even fewer,"" depending on the breadth of changes to the program.

During an earnings call on March 4, Rick Wilmer, president and CEO of ChargePoint, told analysts that NEVI-related deals represented an ""insignificant portion"" of its revenue in 2024 and the company did not anticipate NEVI changes would have a material effect on its business.

According to Paren data, ChargePoint has received three NEVI awards totaling $1.75 million.

Separately, Wilmer told CNBC that in the context of NEVI, ChargePoint supports its customers that operate charging stations and sell electricity. ""We're very intentional about not doing that, because it would put us in direct competition with them,"" he said. ""We provide the technology and the solutions and help our customers apply for and win NEVI funding. So in the grand scheme of things, NEVI is a very small portion of our business.""

ChargePoint reported positive results for the fourth quarter of its FY2025, ended in January, though full-year revenue declined more than 17%, and its stock has fallen roughly 60% over the past year.

The EV charging industry is going through an evolution right now, according to Craig Irwin, an industry analyst at Roth Capital Partners, and companies not dependent on subsidies have better prospects. ""The focus on putting credible products out there without subsidy dollars is a winning strategy,"" he said. ""People want chargers in front of their libraries, real estate developments and other public places. The demand is still there.""

A spokesperson for EVgo, which sites its public chargers in just such high-use urban and metro areas, said that it has received minimal funding through NEVI. The company generates revenue from the utilization of its charging network and taps into other incentive programs offered by state governments and utility companies, whose programs do not include the same geographic constraints as NEVI.  

In December, EVgo announced the closing of a $1.25 billion guaranteed loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, a financing commitment it has pointed to as a sign of certainty. ""This loan ensures we are fully funded to add at least 7,500 [ports at roughly 1,100 charging stations], more than tripling our installed base over the next five years,"" CEO Badar Khan told analysts during its earnings call earlier this month.

Yet the Trump administration has threatened to find ways to retroactively pull DOE loan funding approved in the last days of the Biden administration, which sprinted to get deals finalized before Trump's inauguration.

EVgo has been growing, reporting fourth-quarter 2024 revenue up 35% year-over-year, and up 60% for the full year. But despite those gains, the company continues to operate at a loss.

Blink says it does not depend much on NEVI to fund its charging infrastructure, relying instead on hardware sales, software subscriptions, charging revenue and corporate partnerships. ""The majority of our other funding is within the largest utility companies,"" said CEO Mike Battaglia. ""There are some [state] grants out there, as well, that we take advantage of.""

Blink achieved record charging revenue last year, and significantly grew the Blink-owned network, according to its recent Q4 and full year report on March 13. Yet, revenue declined in the fourth quarter and for the full year in comparison to ""exceptionally strong equipment sales in 2023,"" Battaglia said. The company said it expects revenue will pick up in the second half of 2025 and to have a better idea as to when it will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability later in the year.

Then there's the elephant in the room — Tesla, whose sales and stock price have plunged lately following a post-election surge. Tesla is in a unique position, as a manufacturer of both branded EVs and charging stations — and whose CEO Elon Musk has emerged as a central character not just in the sector, but across the entire economic and political landscape.

It has heavily invested in building out its network of superchargers, which are compatible with a growing number of other OEMs' EV models, including GM, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Rivian. And its proprietary NACS charging connector and port is being adopted by other charging companies. Ironically, considering that Musk favors getting rid of EV subsidies, Tesla is the second-largest recipient of NEVI funds, granted more than $41 million for 99 sites. Elon Musk said in the lead-up to the election that any Trump policies that hurt EVs would hurt his competitors more than Tesla, but recently, Tesla and other Musk firms have been lobbying the government, at least on the issue of tariffs.

With so much uncertainty looming over the EV charging industry — plus the shakeout that typically occurs among nascent tech industries — there's bound to be consolidation this year. Several companies have already declared bankruptcy or gone out of business, including the North American affiliates of European utility-owned charging companies, Enel X and EVBox, and Tritium, which runs an EV charging equipment plant in Tennessee and was acquired by an Indian conglomerate after declaring insolvency in 2024.

Depending on the outcome of the NEVI situation, companies that heavily rely on its funds and can't access alternative capital sources may go belly up or partner with other entities. The fate of the public companies remains to be seen, while Tesla spins in its own topsy-turvy orbit. In the meantime, EV adoption does continue to increase, and more chargers will be installed in a growing number of places. It's the pace, and the winners and losers, that are yet to be determined.

Oops, something went wrong

Girls just want to have funds, to paraphrase the Cyndi Lauper tune.

Cary Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and the author of the new book ""Women and Wealth,"" knows all about that.

Her decades of being a sherpa for women in the male-dominated financial services field serves as the backdrop for this book, which is aimed at teaching her colleagues about the psychology behind women's financial mojo and the best ways to attract and retain female clients.

It's also flush with insights and strategies for individual women working to take control of their money lives.

I know firsthand what it's like to sit in front of a male financial adviser who only directed his attention to my husband, leaving me feeling dismissed and unheard. We fired him.

Carbonaro's mission is to help women and their financial advisers align so that doesn't happen to others. I asked her to share some of her strategic insights. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Read more: 5 barriers women face to saving money and how to overcome them

Kerry Hannon: Women and financial advisers have had a long history of not getting each other. Is that why you wrote this book?

Cary Carbonaro: The next wave of growth in wealth management is women. That was the basis for writing this book. The industry hasn't done anything for the upcoming wealth shift. Thanks to their longer life expectancies, women will inherit wealth, both from baby boomer parents and spouses. In five years, women are expected to control a significant portion of the trillions in financial wealth that will be transferred. The timing is now.

What are the challenges that women face?

The wage gap with their male counterparts. Longevity — women live longer than men. We spend more money in retirement on healthcare than men. We've got a confidence gap related to managing money. We have time out of the workforce for caregiving. Finally, in general, women are more conservative than men when it comes to investing.

You write that women set themselves up for failure when managing money. In what way?

In my experience, women are emotionally tied to money. Feelings and emotions get wrapped around money with women more than men. They get attached to all kinds of things, houses, and stocks. There's an emotional tie to it where they sometimes can't make a clear decision because their feelings are involved. Guys don't have that issue as much.

How can financial advisers better serve women?

They can work on better communication. Women want to be spoken to in a language that's comfortable to them. The industry is all about male terms. Male advisers talk about beating the S&P 500 and use sports analogies.

That doesn't resonate with many women. Women don't care about beating the S&P 500. Women care about, am I going to be okay? Am I going to run out of money? Are my children going to be okay? Am I going to be a bag lady? Can I go on this vacation? Can I buy a second house? Women want to tie money to life events.

I'm not dumbing it down at all for women. I'm just telling them I'm putting it in life goals rather than dollars and cents and jargon. Totally different.

You also see a role for financial advisers to help women with career building. How so?

I help my female clients in negotiating for themselves as they ask for raises and salaries when they're going for jobs. I coach all of them on that because it's part of wealth-building.

Why aren't there more women advisers?

Women make up only about a quarter of all certified professional advisers, CFPs, or 24,546 out of a total of 103,093.

It is so hard to get women involved. Younger women don't think of it as a career path. Once we do bring them in, it's hard for them to stay. They get burned out. Out of those 23%, very few of those women are rainmakers. There is still cultural bias about women not being as sophisticated about money even as advisers.

Read more: What is a financial adviser, and what do they do?

More women are the breadwinners in their homes these days. How does this impact their financial outlook?

What's super exciting about this is that the numbers of women breadwinners have been moving up. By 2030, women are finally going to be majority breadwinners in the United States for the first time in history. Mind-blowing, right?

The challenge is having a spouse supporting them. You really need to have a very strong spouse who is OK with you making more money, and who is going to take a secondary role to help with the children and the caregiving and the household.

Another challenge for women breadwinners is how they relate with their friends. Are their friends supportive? Is their family supportive? Or are they taking shots at them because they don't spend more time with the kids, go to PTA meetings, and get involved with fundraisers?

As an adviser, I work with them to learn to be a strong financial person not just making the money but knowing what to do with it once they have it, and balancing that piece with the rest of their life.

What makes you crazy about how women view their financial future?

Many younger women still think someone else will be in charge of their financial future and take care of it for them. I recently gave a presentation at a very elite high school. It was a mixed group of girls and guys. I asked the group of girls how many thought that they were going to be responsible for their own financial future. And maybe 5% of the hands went up.

About 90% of women are going to be responsible at some point in their lives for their finances. They will either be divorced, single, or widowed. I don't want women to get in those situations where they're vulnerable, and they don't know anything, and then they trust the wrong person.

What role does fear play?

Fear has made me a huge saver and investor and better adviser. I have always saved up to 50% of my pay, which is a crazy number. I don't spend what I make. I never have. I never will. I'm now 57, and I'm finally spending, because there's no reason not to spend at this point in my life. I have to turn the spending spigot on, which is really, really hard for me because fear has kept me from spending all these years. I work with many women in the same situation.

If they have turned off the spending spigot for all these years, when I tell them they can turn it on, they're like, what? I don't even know how to do that. It's such a different shift in mindset.

You write about the designer bag lady syndrome? Explain.

Loads of women who make over $200,000 a year still have the bag lady fear. I am one of them. This is really personal to me. We still feel there's a chance that we could be penniless, homeless, and a bag lady. It's a fear — even if it's irrational in some cases, but it's what drove them and me all these years to feather my nest.

What keeps you up at night these days?

What keeps me up at night is that my profession is not changing and is not helping women enough. I want to make a dent in this profession, and I want to change the way women are treated in meetings with their advisers.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's antitrust enforcers are not backing down from legal fights with Big Tech, even as the administration signals a willingness to take a lighter touch with artificial intelligence.

The administration is pressing ahead with two antitrust lawsuits already taken to trial against Google (GGOG, GOOGL) and prepping for new antitrust trials against Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (APPL).

Trump officials at the Federal Trade Commission are also broadening a probe into Microsoft (MSFT) and its relationship with AI upstart OpenAI while challenging Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard.

""This isn't the Bush administration,"" Trump's FTC chair Andrew Ferguson told a group of American CEOs on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., referring to one of the weakest US antitrust enforcement periods in modern history.

But Trump is also showing he may take a lighter approach to AI as the US competes with China for world supremacy in that ascendant technology.

In a March 7 filing, Trump's Justice Department argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up.

""The DOJ action is not just a signal on how the President will treat AI, it is a reaction to, and clear response to, the policy of the president and vice-president,"" said JD Harriman, former outside patent counsel for Steve Jobs at Apple and a partner with Foundation Law Group.

Boston College Law professor David Olson agreed that the DOJ's decision not to interfere with Google's AI ambitions is evidence of a shift from the Biden era.

""Just from a policy standpoint, I think that it's telling that they might be walking back [AI remedies], specifically,"" Olson said. ""Of all of the things they could have walked back, that was the one they decided.""

The tech world is trying to determine how aggressive Trump's antitrust enforcers will be following four years of a Biden administration marked by legal fights with many of Silicon Valley's biggest names.

Trump FTC boss Ferguson made it clear in his speech that his agency wouldn't be backing down. The FTC, he said, would challenge mergers it suspects would harm Americans economically but leave the rest alone.

To that end, the FTC told a judge this week that it was ready to start a trial against Amazon in September.

The FTC also plans to widen its investigation into Microsoft, according to Bloomberg. The probe was first launched by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, a key architect of a new movement seeking to expand the legal theories that can give rise to antitrust claims.

By sustaining many of these cases and probes against Big Tech, Trump has parted ways with traditional Republican-style enforcement, said Peter Salib, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

""It's very hard to say what's going on,"" Salib added.

Antitrust attorney Mark Wagoner noted following Trump's win in November, ""I am not necessarily convinced that we're going to go back to what people would call sort of the regular order of Republicans.""

""The new Republican Party is very much a populist party,"" he added. ""It's no longer the party of big business.""

Salib said Trump's motivation for going after companies like Meta (which owns Facebook) and Google is to curb censorship of conservative content.

""The reason they're treating [tech] this way is so different,"" Salib said. Under Biden, ""big was bad for all kinds of reasons.""

But it's clear the administration shares some of the same competition concerns that bothered the Biden administration.

That may come to the fore again next month when FTC is set to face off against social media giant Meta (META) in an antitrust lawsuit brought during Trump's first term in office.

Starting April 14, the parties are scheduled to appear for trial in the federal district court for the District of Columbia. The government seeks to unwind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

The government alleges the company leveraged its acquisitions to block rivals from the market for personal social networking services.

This spring, the Justice Department will also be involved in a trial that will determine what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire. That decision is in the hands of federal Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for ""general search"" and ""general search text.”

The DOJ has stuck to a Biden-era request for a federal judge to break up Alphabet's Google, calling for divestment of its Chrome browser.

But in the same request, the DOJ also stood down on the prior administration's push for Google to sell off its AI investments.

This lighter touch with AI has support from Congress too, according to Harriman, a partner with Foundation Law Group.

In December, he said, a congressional bipartisan task force on AI made it clear in a report that lawmakers would take a ""wait and see"" attitude on AI regulation.

They expressed concern over China's AI advancements and the industry's potential impact on military strength, noting that the country had secured more AI patent applications, journal publications, and journal citations.

""This gives the President a clear path to drop the pressure on Google to divest, without fear of congressional override or even complaint,"" Harriman said.

There have been other signs of AI restraint as well. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order issued by President Biden that directed AI developers to apply AI ""responsibly,” including by disclosing their safety test results to the government.

Trump instead issued an executive order titled ""Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence,"" which emphasized deregulation in the interest of encouraging American dominance.

The order directed federal advisers in technology and national security to ""enhance America's global AI dominance.""

At the Paris AI Summit on Feb. 11, Vice President JD Vance then emphasized AI opportunity over safety concerns.

""I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago,"" Vance said. ""I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.""

""[T]o restrict its development now would not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations.""

Oops, something went wrong

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has entered correction, falling 10% from its February all-time highs as political uncertainty has driven fears over the market outlook. 

""There's been a sentiment shift,"" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. ""The sentiment and the client and investor focus has completely swung upside down versus where we started the year.""

Entering 2025, the consensus on Wall Street called for the US economy to grow at a healthy pace and lead continued outperformance of the US equity market against the rest of the world. Now, the prevailing market fear is that President Trump's current economic policies — namely tariffs, federal job cuts, and strict immigration — could further slow economic growth. This has prompted several economic research teams to lower their GDP forecasts, some strategists to cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, and stocks around the rest of the world to outperform the US market.

Still, few are calling for an overall lackluster year in US stocks. In a note to clients this week, Yardeni Research cut its 2025 year-end S&P 500 target from 7,000 to 6,400, which represents a roughly 14% increase from current levels. Notably, the forecast didn't come with a projection for lower earnings growth this year. Instead, the Yardeni team is now just assuming the S&P 500 won't return its record-high valuation seen entering the year.

""We still think earnings growth is going to be good,"" Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. ""There hasn't been a lot that's actually fundamentally changed about the economy. It's more so just uncertainty is weighing on [valuation] multiples.""

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

To Wallerstein's point, while views on the economic outlook have soured, most economists and equity strategists aren't actually calling for a recession. And some have even argued that since the S&P 500 has sold off so far on the growth concerns, the market's rerating may be overdone. BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri told Yahoo Finance her team remains ""overweight US equities.""

""We're not really worried about a recession yet,"" Gargi Chaudhuri said. ""So if there was a concern around recession, the conversation that we would be having would be a little bit different right now. This is just a pullback from some of the price to perfection that we had in the beginning of the year coming into this year, and this is a healthy pullback.""

Research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high.

Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. But only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market.

""We do not see a bear market coming,"" Detrick told Yahoo Finance. ""Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening.""

The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market.

""These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more,"" Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added that this makes him ""very comfortable"" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500.

""In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red,"" Belski said.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The end of the first quarter is nearing, and President Trump just passed the 50-day mark in his second tour at the White House.

It's safe to say this will be a face-ripping year for investors.

More volatility in markets. More earnings misses and warnings. More negative economic surprises. More stock rating downgrades. And trades that have worked amazingly well in the past few years (looking at you, Nvidia (NVDA)) not working so amazingly anymore.

Watch: Why Lego's CEO is worried about tariffs

And when it seems like these things are over and the coast is clear, all the negativity is rinsed and repeated — causing more face-ripping moments at your trading screen or in chats with a financial adviser.

""We've had a couple of pretty sanguine years and years where we didn't see the usual two or three pullbacks of 5% to 15%,"" Edward Jones CEO Penny Pennington told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). ""That's a very typical thing to happen. And so, in a moment where we've got uncertainty from policy and tariffs and things like that, the markets are reacting. It was to be expected. And so investors are reacting.""

Boy are they reacting!

As it stands, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has pulled back 10% from its Feb. 19 high.

Nvidia is down 14% year to date, and Tesla (TSLA) is down 40%. So much for money-minting momentum names!

The S&P 500 fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1%, according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. At this point last year, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was ""abnormally"" low.

""The market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.

Listen: Rubbermaid CEO says tariffs are bad for business

Yet despite a lot of the bad news being known by investors, what is there to be excited about in the markets at this precise time?

Sure, if you want to buy and hold a dividend-paying company (or even an Nvidia) for the next 25 years you will probably be wealthier than you are today. But from a near-term perspective, the tape stinks and there looks to be a wave of bad economic and corporate news coming (see the first quarter earnings season start, if the latest warnings from Delta (DAL), Southwest (LUV), and American Airlines (AAL) are any sign as to what's ahead).

So here are 13 basic things I just do not like about the market right now. Don't agree with me on any of these? That's cool. I don't have all the answers. I do want to know your thoughts though. Drop me a line on X @BrianSozzi.

The defensive trade — see healthcare and staples — continues to outperform.

The crypto sell-off continues, and the asset class is no longer viewed as a relatively safe haven.

Markets continue to sell off on tariff headlines — suggesting the issue is not priced in yet.

The dips are not being bought with any degree of confidence.

Financial warnings have surfaced because of growth concerns (see airlines).

Investors are hammering companies that warn, suggesting they have been too sanguine.

Dysfunctional government is a risk, which Sen. Ted Cruz reminded me of in a chat.

CEOs are beginning to articulate worse scenarios to investors due to government policy changes after not doing so late in 2024.

Investors still aren't fearful enough (the conversations I had with the CEOs of Edward Jones and Charles Schwab (SCHW) reminded me of that this week).

Recession calls are startling markets.

There are increasing signs of economic weakness in less mainstream economic reports.

There are no table-pounding sell-side calls on the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks in the face of major sell-offs.

Price target cuts have been trickling in on widely held names (see Morgan Stanley this week on Apple (AAPL)).

Donald Trump's ties to the crypto world might get even deeper if reported talks with Binance somehow lead to a working relationship with the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.

The talks — as described this past week in separate stories from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg — would have the potential to bring closer together one of the biggest players in the world of digital assets and a US president who has pledged to make America ""the crypto capital of the planet.""

Trump has already signed executive orders that benefit the industry and has pledged to help push through legislation that the industry favors. At the same time, he has existing interests in other crypto ventures that benefit if the value of digital assets rise.

The discussions thus far with Binance have included a Trump family stake in Binance's US arm, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported that former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao is also seeking a pardon from the administration. In 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty to violating US anti-money-laundering requirements.

Bloomberg reported that the conversations included the possibility of a stablecoin from Binance and World Liberty Financial, a crypto business with ties to the Trump family and the family of Steve Witkoff, the president's envoy to the Middle East. Stablecoins are pegged to other assets, such as the dollar.

A Trump administration official denied Witkoff's involvement to the Wall Street Journal and said he is in the process of divesting from his business ties.

Binance's Zhao, on the social media platform X, denied discussions of a business deal with World Liberty Financial or a pardon deal for himself with anyone tied to the Trump administration. He also denied that Binance has purchased World Liberty's crypto token.

In a post on X, World Liberty called the reports from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg ""unsubstantiated,"" without going into further details.

A closer relationship with Binance, if it were to happen, would give the president even more exposure to the crypto world as he delivers on promises he made to the industry during his first 100 days in office.

Just before Trump's inauguration, his team launched an official meme coin for the 47th president (TRUMP) and one for first lady Melania Trump (MELANIA) on the solana blockchain.

Fight Fight Fight LLC and CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of the Trump Organization, own 80% of the meme coin's total supply, subject to a three-year unlocking schedule, according to a disclosure on the meme coin's website.

His namesake Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) also wants to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and has said it will allocate up to $250 million of cash tied up in a venture called Truth.Fi into cryptocurrencies and other investments.

As for World Liberty, Trump and his sons are backers of that crypto project, launched in 2024, and they have promoted it on social media. The president is listed on World Liberty's website as ""chief crypto advocate"" while his sons — Eric, Donald Jr., and Barron — hold the title of ""Web3 ambassador.""

In exchange for that promotion, a Trump family-owned limited liability corporation receives 22.5% of the project's crypto token, along with 75% of any net revenues after World Liberty earns $30 million.

Witkoff, the president's envoy to the Middle East, and his sons Zach and Alex are all listed as co-founders of World Liberty. Zach Witkoff was part of an exclusive group of crypto executives invited to the White House's first-ever crypto summit on March 7.

The president isn't required under law to divest any of his holdings while in office, even if any potential conflicts of interest surface. A law passed in 1977 does require him to file an annual disclosure listing his income, assets, and debt.

Since taking office, Trump has, in fact, delivered on some of his promises to the industry via two executive orders.

The first banned the US from creating a central bank digital currency and established a cross-government presidential working group on digital assets that got the ball rolling on his more sizable vows to the industry.

His second order called for the government to establish a bitcoin reserve and separate crypto stockpile, seeding them with seized and forfeited digital assets not already sold by the federal government.

The president has also promised to enable the development of a federal regulatory framework for crypto markets, which the industry hopes will make it easier to do business in the US and become more closely tied to Wall Street.

On Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee took one step in that direction by advancing stablecoin legislation that would set rules for how bank regulators would oversee firms issuing such coins.

Binance, which had several clashes with the US government during the Biden administration, has already caught one break during Trump's second term. Last month, the SEC put on hold a civil lawsuit against Binance and Zhao filed in June 2023, alleging securities violations.

In November 2023, Binance pleaded guilty in a US federal court to money laundering, unlicensed money transmitting, and sanctions violations, including facilitating transactions by Palestinian militant organization and US-designated terrorist group Hamas.

It was fined $4.3 billion. Then-CEO Zhao agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO of the company but was allowed to maintain his majority ownership as part of the deal.

In April 2024, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison after pleading guilty to violating US anti-money laundering laws. Binance currently gives no official jurisdiction for its headquarters.

On Wednesday, the company said it was taking in its first institutional investment ever from Abu Dhabi-based AI and advanced technology investor MGX. The $2 billion stake is to be paid in a stablecoin.

Oops, something went wrong

In recent days, the Trump administration has announced two high-profile and controversial policy changes it says are meant to combat waste and fraud in Social Security.

First, the agency said it would resume garnishing entire benefit checks from Americans who receive overpayments, undoing a reform that had capped clawbacks at a smaller amount. Social Security officials claim the change will help the government recover an additional $7 billion over 10 years.

Later, the agency announced that enrollees would no longer be allowed to change their direct deposit information over the phone but would instead be required to use an online process with two-factor authentication or visit a Social Security office in person. The measure is meant to prevent some types of fraud.

Both decisions have been met with criticism. Former officials and outside experts worry the new clawback policy will punish poorer beneficiaries who can't afford to have their full checks taken away, while the additional security measures around bank account information will unnecessarily burden many seniors who lack computer skills.

Here's what you need to know.

Each year, the Social Security Administration sends out several billion dollars worth of accidental overpayments to people with disabilities and the elderly. Sometimes errors occur because enrollees fail to report a life event that can affect their benefits, such as getting married or finding a new job. In other cases, enrollees report the information, but the government keeps overpaying them while processing the change.

When the government notices a mistake, it tries to recoup the cash by subtracting it from an enrollee's future benefits.

Late last week, the Trump administration said it would resume the practice of withholding 100% of a person's benefits if they owe money due to an overpayment. That was Social Security's policy until March of 2024 when Biden officials lowered the maximum amount the government could withhold to just 10% of an enrollee's monthly check.

“It is our duty to revise the overpayment repayment policy back to full withholding, as it was during the Obama administration and first Trump administration, to properly safeguard taxpayer funds,” Lee Dudek, acting commissioner of Social Security, said in a press release. The restored rules will only apply going forward to individuals who receive overpayments after March 27. The 10% cap also still applies to Supplemental Security Income, which supports the poorest elderly and disabled Americans.

Still, the decision has received some immediate blowback. The Biden administration changed its withholding rules after think tanks and news outlets such as CBS's ""60 Minutes"" highlighted how some Social Security recipients were unexpectedly finding themselves on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars in overpayments due to the government's own errors, or because they had gotten tripped up in a program's complicated income and eligibility rules. In many cases, people who relied on Social Security for most or all of their income suddenly found their benefits entirely yanked away.

The stories led to a bipartisan outcry on Capitol Hill, including from Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who called the problem “unacceptable” in a letter to Social Security leaders. In a hearing before Congress last year, former Social Security commissioner Martin O'Malley said the agency was adopting the new 10% cap to avoid “clawback cruelty.”

                            Privacy Policy
                        
 

Returning to the 100% withholding rule is “cruel-hearted and appears designed to inflict a lot of hardship and anguish on beneficiaries through no fault of their own,” O'Malley told Yahoo Finance.

The move could have an outsized impact on people enrolled in Social Security Disability Insurance, which accounts for a large share of overpayments because the program limits how much people can earn from work before losing benefits. Research has found that, for Americans with a disability, work-related overpayments average over $8,000.

As part of the rules it introduced last year, the Social Security Administration made it easier to waive overpayment debts for enrollees who weren't at fault — for instance, if they reported an increase in their income but received extra money while the government processed the change. Those reforms are staying in place, KFF News reports. The administration also says beneficiaries can apply for a lower withholding rate if they can't afford having their entire check taken.

But some worry that the Trump administration's plans to cut Social Security's personnel will make it hard to apply for a waiver.

“The staff is being downsized dramatically,” said Jack Smalligan, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who wrote an influential paper on clawbacks. “How easily can someone navigate all this when the agency was already at historically low levels of staffing?”

The new direct deposit rules have also stirred controversy, though some of it revolved around early reporting by the Washington Post that the administration was considering vastly broader limits on Social Security's phone services. Instead, the administration said late Wednesday that individuals already enrolled in benefits would have to change their bank information online or in person.

The change is ostensibly aimed at preventing frauds where a scammer calls claiming to be a beneficiary or their relative, and has their benefits redirected to their own bank account.

“Approximately 40 percent of Social Security direct deposit fraud is associated with someone calling SSA to change direct deposit bank information,” the agency said. “SSA's current protocol of simply asking identifying questions by telephone is no longer enough to prevent fraud.”

The concern among some advocates is that seniors who lack computer skills or can't easily get to an office will find themselves having trouble changing their bank information, especially since Social Security offices have moved to an appointment-only system and could soon have significantly reduced staffing. These changes can be time-sensitive for seniors since they are often changing their direct deposit information for reasons out of their control, like a bank merger that leaves them with a new account number.

“It's a hassle for elderly or disabled who can't drive,” said O'Malley. He then added, somewhat sarcastically: “My question is, are you going to shut down the online portals where the other 60% happen?”

Exactly how commonly direct deposit fraud really occurs over the phone is unclear. A 2019 report by Social Security's inspector general found there were 20,658 cases of direct deposit fraud committed through the agency's online portal between 2013 and 2017, but there doesn't appear to be public numbers on phone fraud. (The Social Security Administration did not return a request for additional data or comment on this story.)

Still former officials say that identity fraud over the phone has been a genuine concern in recent years, especially as scammers have gotten more sophisticated.

Traditionally, frontline Social Security employees who answer the phones are trained to question callers to screen for potential fraud and direct them to visit a field office and complete any account changes in person if they have suspicions. But the agency has added some new protections as well.

For instance, after discovering that the vast majority of fraudsters were sending money to accounts at just a handful financial institutions, it instituted a policy of automatically requiring anyone trying to move benefits to one of those banks to visit a field office. The agency also was planning to adopt new tools that would allow it to filter out phone calls that used robocalls, voice synthesizers, and known problem numbers.

It's unclear whether the Trump administration looked into deploying those tools before announcing its policy change.

Oops, something went wrong

Overwhelmed by out-of-pocket medical costs, Valerie Towe and her husband, Paul, saw their debt load begin to swell last year.

Facing a steady stream of bills for 77-year-old Paul's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and neuropathy, Valerie began to tap credit cards to keep up.

“I wasn't able to make ends meet,” Valerie, 65, told Yahoo Finance.

The cost of weekly groceries added to the strain — nearly doubling last year, she said. And to top it off, as her caregiving duties ramped up, Valerie shifted to a part-time job.

“When you're a caregiver, you can't work a full-time job,” she said.

The worst of it, as anyone who has rolled over credit card balances month to month knows, is the ballooning debt that accrues when you can only pay the minimum amount of the balance on credit cards that are ladened with interest rates topping 20%.

That's all Valerie has been able to do, and the result is a gut-punching credit card debt nearing $30,000, she said.

Nearly half of adults 50 and older who carry credit card debt use credit cards to pay for basic living expenses, according to a new AARP report. And roughly 3 in 10 older adults with credit card debt have more of it than a year ago.

More sobering: Nearly half of them owe $5,000 or more, and 28% carry a balance of $10,000 or more.

That has serious repercussions for retirement savings.

“Many older Americans with credit card debt who hope to retire soon will have to make the difficult decision of whether to pay down debt or save for retirement,” Indira Venkat, senior vice president of research at AARP, told Yahoo Finance. “For those who have already retired and are living on a fixed income, it can be a challenge to both pay down a credit card and make ends meet.”

Read more: Best ways to pay off credit card debt

She's right on that one. When people say what they regret the most after they retire, a biggie is retiring with too much debt.

In 2024, almost 7 in 10 retirees with debt reported having credit card debt outstanding, per a survey from the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI). That's up from 4 in 10 four years ago.

And while the rising cost of groceries, housing, and vehicles are the byproducts of sticky inflation, one of the biggest culprits of credit card debt is out-of-pocket medical costs such as prescription drugs, which the Towes are grappling with. Dental and vision care add up too, Venkat said.

If they could turn the clock back, nearly a quarter of retirees say they would have made paying down credit card and other debts a priority before they exited the workforce, according to a new Fidelity Investments report.

The emergence of credit card debt for older Americans is not fading away anytime soon. Roughly 1 in 5 expect to take more than five years to pay it off, per the AARP report.

The decision to pay down debt or save for retirement is a reality for many older Americans as they near retirement. More than half of those currently working say that their debt is interfering with their ability to save, a recent report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies found.

Troubling, too, is that the debt has pushed them to tap into existing retirement savings. One in 3 workers has taken a loan, early withdrawal, or hardship withdrawal from their 401(k) or similar plan or IRA, per Transamerica.

Among those who have taken out a loan or withdrawn from their 401(k) or similar plan, the most frequently cited reasons are medical bills and paying off credit card debt.

More evidence: Last year, hardship withdrawals increased over 2023, with 4.8% of participants tapping their retirement savings, up from 3.6%, according to Vanguard Group, which administers 401(k)-type accounts for nearly 5 million people.

When you withdraw from a traditional 401(k) account, you get slapped with paying income tax, and typically a 10% penalty if you're younger than 59 1⁄2.

Read more: What is the retirement age for Social Security, 401(k), and IRA withdrawals?

Here's an easy first step: Call your credit card issuer and ask for a lower interest rate, pointing out — if true — your history of on-time payments.

If your provider won't budge, shop for a 0% balance transfer card. You can shift your current high-cost credit card debt over to a new card with a 0% promotional rate lasting as long as 21 months. There is, however, a 3%-5% transfer fee of the total amount you transfer, but that long interest-free period will give you some space to begin to pay the balance down.

Automating your monthly payments and paying more than the minimum is the ticket to whittling away at your debts.

There are a few strategies to consider for reducing your overall debt. The avalanche method involves paying off debt with the highest interest rate first. Other people opt for the snowball method, which focuses on smaller debts first. I'm in the avalanche school, but whatever works best for you matters.

Alternatives also include consolidating all of your credit card debt with a personal loan. It's possible to land an interest rate as low as about 7% over seven years if you have strong credit, which regrettably is not often the case if you've accumulated too much debt.

If you have multiple balances across several cards and a balance transfer card or personal loan won't cover the total debt, I recommend tackling the highest annual interest rate first, while still making payments on the rest to steadily lower the interest charges.

A nonprofit credit counselor may also be able to negotiate with your credit card issuers to give you a break on rates, but you will pay a fee for the service. The Justice Department website provides a list of approved credit counseling agencies.

 Bitcoiners worldwide strongly disagreed with prominent angel investor Jason Calacanis' “build a better Bitcoin” comment, arguing that layer-2s can fill any functionality gaps. 

A technology investor who backed ridesharing app Uber in its early days has sparked backlash from the Bitcoin community after claiming Bitcoin will inevitably be replaced by something better.

“Bitcoin has been a wonderful game, but with a couple of giant players cornering the market, the timing is right to “build a better Bitcoin” — restarting the game,” prominent angel investor and internet entrepreneur Jason Calacanis told his 981,600 X followers on March 14.

Calacanis, an early investor in Bitcoin-related companies like online trading platform Robinhood and Bitcoin startup Keza, said, “All technology gets replaced over time… and Bitcoin will be no different.”

Founders and executives of Bitcoin-related companies were quick to push back, arguing that Bitcoin will not be replaced, though there's still room for a dominant layer-2 protocol to emerge on top of the Bitcoin network.

Swan Bitcoin co-founder Brady Swenson said, “Winning protocols don't get replaced; they are built upon.” 

“Bitcoin will never be replaced as a protocol for value transfer. The race is still on for the winning second layer protocol,” Swenson said.

The other co-founder of Swan Bitcoin, Cory Klippsten, said, “Bitcoin is a technological revolution changing all industries, not following the adoption curve of a single technology like an iPad.”

Echoing a similar sentiment, Lightspark CEO David Markus said, “What it lacks in functionality can be built on L2s.” 

Meanwhile, ShapeShift CEO Eric Voorhees said Bitcoin's limitations can be solved “on other chains.”

Many in the industry have emphasized the importance of layer-2s for Bitcoin, as they provide use cases that the Bitcoin network cannot support, such as deploying smart contracts.

However, Muneeb Ali, co-founder of Stacks, recently told Cointelegraph that more than two-thirds of existing Bitcoin layer-2 projects will not exist within three years as their initial excitement will fade.

Bitcoin advocate Wayne Vaughan said people wrongly assume Bitcoin is easily replaceable because they see it as just an asset, application, or platform.

“I think of Bitcoin as a network. The larger the network gets, the less likely it is for something else to replace it,” Vaughan said in a March 15 X post.

Strive Funds CEO Matt Cole said, “There will not be a “better” Bitcoin.” 

“I do think we will get occasional alt seasons of ever-diminishing strength that will continue to make insiders money. Most people will end up with less Bitcoin by going to that casino,” Cole said.

This is not the first time that Calacanis' comments have caused debate in the crypto industry.

In June 2020, Calacanis said that nearly all of the crypto projects around the world are under the control of “unqualified idiots” or “grifters” with below-average skills.

 TON price may rise toward the $5-6 range next as it bounces sharply from its lowest levels in a year following Pavel Durov's exit from France, technicals suggest. 

Toncoin (TON) has surged by over 50% in the past week, fueled by news that Telegram founder Pavel Durov has been granted permission to leave France for Dubai.

TON's bullish reversal, especially after falling to $2.35, its lowest level in a year, has traders eyeing key price levels, with crypto analyst Crypto Patel highlighting a ""great entry zone"" for long-term investors.

As Crypto Patel notes, TON's price has “perfectly bounced” from its support level of around $2.50. 

Furthermore, the support falls inside the $2.40-3.00 area that served as resistance in December 2022-April 2023 and September 2023-April 2024 periods. The analyst argues that the area now served as a “great entry zone,” citing TON's ongoing rebound from the same range.

A decisive rebound from the $2.40-3.00 zone could have TON target its prevailing descending trendline resistance in the coming weeks, which may push its price toward $5 by June or July.

The upside outlook aligns with analyst Profit Mind's falling wedge setup, which anticipates the Toncoin price to grow toward the $6 upside target if it breaks above the wedge's upper trendline.

Falling wedges typically resolve when the price breaks above the upper trendline and rises by as much as the pattern's maximum height.

Analyst Crypto Billion further anticipates a bullish reversal in TON markets, citing its oversold relative strength index (RSI) as a primary catalyst for potential long-term accumulation.

Toncoin's Sharpe ratio, a financial metric used to measure an asset's risk-adjusted returns, further indicates oversold conditions in the TON market.

As of March 16, the 180-day average ratio had dropped below -25, as denoted in blue. In the past, TON has undergone bullish reversals largely when its Sharpe ratio turned blue, as seen in late 2022 and mid-2023.

In the derivatives market, Toncoin is witnessing a resurgence in its open interest (OI) — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled TON contracts such as options and futures.

As of March 16, TON's OI was around $169.12 million, compared to $80.75 million just five days prior.

On the flip side, TON's weekly funding rates are treading around negative territory — they marginally rose into positive territory after plunging to -0.678% earlier on March 16.

When funding rates turn negative as OI rises, it often reflects bearish sentiment with aggressive shorting. The 30-day liquidation map tracking TON/USDT on Bybit risks nearly $10 million in long liquidations if the Toncoin price falls toward $2.54.

Conversely, the same liquidation map reveals that approximately $12 million worth of short positions could be at risk if TON surpasses the $4 mark. 

If this scenario plays out, the cascading effect of forced buybacks could accelerate Toncoin's upward momentum, sending the price to the aforementioned levels.

 Bitcoin is around the corner from what is normally one of its two best months, and one prediction tool sees a return to BTC price discovery as a result. 

Bitcoin (BTC) can hit new all-time highs by June this year if historical patterns repeat, network economist Timothy Peterson said.

Data uploaded to X on March 15 gives BTC/USD around two-and-a-half months to beat its $109,000 record.

Bitcoin has declined 30% after topping out in mid-January. The extent of the drop is characteristic of bull market corrections, and Peterson keenly senses the potential for a comeback.

“Bitcoin is trading near the low end of its historical seasonal range,” he determined alongside a chart comparing BTC price cycles.

Peterson has created various Bitcoin price metrics over the years. One of them, Lowest Price Forward, has successfully defined levels below which BTC/USD never falls after a crossing above them at a certain point. 

After its recovery from multi-year lows in March 2020, Lowest Price Forward predicted that BTC price would never trade under $10,000 again from September onward.

Meanwhile, a new likely floor level has appeared this year: $69,000, as Cointelegraph reported, which has a “95% chance” of holding.

Continuing, Peterson stipulated a median target of $126,000 with a deadline of June 1. 

Alongside a chart showing the performance of $100 in BTC, he also revealed that limp bull market performance has always been temporary.

“Bitcoin average time below trend = 4 months,” he explained.

Other popular market commentators continue to emphasize that Bitcoin's recent trip to $76,000 is standard corrective behavior.

“You don't have to look at the previous BTC bull runs to understand that corrections are a part of the cycle,” popular trader and analyst Rekt Capital wrote in part of X analysis of the phenomenon at the start of March.

Rekt Capital counted five of what he called “major pullbacks” in the current cycle alone, going back to the start of 2023.

Analysts at crypto exchange Bitfinex told Cointelegraph this weekend that the current lows mark a “shakeout,” rather than the end of the current cycle.

 AI bots are self-learning software that automates and continuously refines crypto cyberattacks, making them more dangerous than traditional hacking methods.At the heart of today's AI-driven cybercrime are AI bots — self-learning software programs designed to process vast amounts of data, make independent decisions, and execute complex tasks without human intervention. While these bots have been a game-changer in industries like finance, healthcare and customer service, they have also become a weapon for cybercriminals, particularly in the world of cryptocurrency.Unlike traditional hacking methods, which require manual effort and technical expertise, AI bots can fully automate attacks, adapt to new cryptocurrency security measures, and even refine their tactics over time. This makes them far more effective than human hackers, who are limited by time, resources and error-prone processes.Why are AI bots so dangerous?The biggest threat posed by AI-driven cybercrime is scale. A single hacker attempting to breach a crypto exchange or trick users into handing over their private keys can only do so much. AI bots, however, can launch thousands of attacks simultaneously, refining their techniques as they go.Speed: AI bots can scan millions of blockchain transactions, smart contracts and websites within minutes, identifying weaknesses in wallets (leading to crypto wallet hacks), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and exchanges.Scalability: A human scammer may send phishing emails to a few hundred people. An AI bot can send personalized, perfectly crafted phishing emails to millions in the same time frame.Adaptability: Machine learning allows these bots to improve with every failed attack, making them harder to detect and block.This ability to automate, adapt and attack at scale has led to a surge in AI-driven crypto fraud, making crypto fraud prevention more critical than ever.​In October 2024, the X account of Andy Ayrey, developer of the AI bot Truth Terminal, was compromised by hackers. The attackers used Ayrey's account to promote a fraudulent memecoin named Infinite Backrooms (IB). The malicious campaign led to a rapid surge in IB's market capitalization, reaching $25 million. Within 45 minutes, the perpetrators liquidated their holdings, securing over $600,000.

 AI-powered bots aren't just automating crypto scams — they're becoming smarter, more targeted and increasingly hard to spot.Here are some of the most dangerous types of AI-driven scams currently being used to steal cryptocurrency assets:1. AI-powered phishing botsPhishing attacks are nothing new in crypto, but AI has turned them into a far bigger threat. Instead of sloppy emails full of mistakes, today's AI bots create personalized messages that look exactly like real communications from platforms such as Coinbase or MetaMask. They gather personal information from leaked databases, social media and even blockchain records, making their scams extremely convincing. For instance, in early 2024, an AI-driven phishing attack targeted Coinbase users by sending emails about fake cryptocurrency security alerts, ultimately tricking users out of nearly $65 million.Also, after OpenAI launched GPT-4, scammers created a fake OpenAI token airdrop site to exploit the hype. They sent emails and X posts luring users to “claim” a bogus token — the phishing page closely mirrored OpenAI's real site​. Victims who took the bait and connected their wallets had all their crypto assets drained automatically.Unlike old-school phishing, these AI-enhanced scams are polished and targeted, often free of the typos or clumsy wording that is used to give away a phishing scam. Some even deploy AI chatbots posing as customer support representatives for exchanges or wallets, tricking users into divulging private keys or two-factor authentication (2FA) codes under the guise of “verification.”In 2022, some malware specifically targeted browser-based wallets like MetaMask: a strain called Mars Stealer could sniff out private keys for over 40 different wallet browser extensions and 2FA apps, draining any funds it found. Such malware often spreads via phishing links, fake software downloads or pirated crypto tools.Once inside your system, it might monitor your clipboard (to swap in the attacker's address when you copy-paste a wallet address), log your keystrokes, or export your seed phrase files — all without obvious signs.2. AI-powered exploit-scanning botsSmart contract vulnerabilities are a hacker's goldmine, and AI bots are taking advantage faster than ever. These bots continuously scan platforms like Ethereum or BNB Smart Chain, hunting for flaws in newly deployed DeFi projects. As soon as they detect an issue, they exploit it automatically, often within minutes. Researchers have demonstrated that AI chatbots, such as those powered by GPT-3, can analyze smart contract code to identify exploitable weaknesses. For instance, Stephen Tong, co-founder of Zellic, showcased an AI chatbot detecting a vulnerability in a smart contract's “withdraw” function, similar to the flaw exploited in the Fei Protocol attack, which resulted in an $80-million loss. 3. AI-enhanced brute-force attacksBrute-force attacks used to take forever, but AI bots have made them dangerously efficient. By analyzing previous password breaches, these bots quickly identify patterns to crack passwords and seed phrases in record time. A 2024 study on desktop cryptocurrency wallets, including Sparrow, Etherwall and Bither, found that weak passwords drastically lower resistance to brute-force attacks, emphasizing that strong, complex passwords are crucial to safeguarding digital assets.4. Deepfake impersonation botsImagine watching a video of a trusted crypto influencer or CEO asking you to invest — but it's entirely fake. That's the reality of deepfake scams powered by AI. These bots create ultra-realistic videos and voice recordings, tricking even savvy crypto holders into transferring funds. 5. Social media botnetsOn platforms like X and Telegram, swarms of AI bots push crypto scams at scale. Botnets such as “Fox8” used ChatGPT to generate hundreds of persuasive posts hyping scam tokens and replying to users in real-time.In one case, scammers abused the names of Elon Musk and ChatGPT to promote a fake crypto giveaway — complete with a deepfaked video of Musk — duping people into sending funds to scammers. In 2023, Sophos researchers found crypto romance scammers using ChatGPT to chat with multiple victims at once, making their affectionate messages more convincing and scalable.​Similarly, Meta reported a sharp uptick in malware and phishing links disguised as ChatGPT or AI tools, often tied to crypto fraud schemes. And in the realm of romance scams, AI is boosting so-called pig butchering operations — long-con scams where fraudsters cultivate relationships and then lure victims into fake crypto investments. A striking case occurred in Hong Kong in 2024: Police busted a criminal ring that defrauded men across Asia of $46 million via an AI-assisted romance scam​.

 AI is being invoked in the arena of cryptocurrency trading bots — often as a buzzword to con investors and occasionally as a tool for technical exploits.A notable example is YieldTrust.ai, which in 2023 marketed an AI bot supposedly yielding 2.2% returns per day — an astronomical, implausible profit. Regulators from several states investigated and found no evidence the “AI bot” even existed; it appeared to be a classic Ponzi, using AI as a tech buzzword to suck in victims​. YieldTrust.ai was ultimately shut down by authorities, but not before investors were duped by the slick marketing. Even when an automated trading bot is real, it's often not the money-printing machine scammers claim. For instance, blockchain analysis firm Arkham Intelligence highlighted a case where a so-called arbitrage trading bot (likely touted as AI-driven) executed an incredibly complex series of trades, including a $200-million flash loan — and ended up netting a measly $3.24 in profit​.In fact, many “AI trading” scams will take your deposit and, at best, run it through some random trades (or not trade at all), then make excuses when you try to withdraw. Some shady operators also use social media AI bots to fabricate a track record (e.g., fake testimonials or X bots that constantly post “winning trades”) to create an illusion of success. It's all part of the ruse.On the more technical side, criminals do use automated bots (not necessarily AI, but sometimes labeled as such) to exploit the crypto markets and infrastructure. Front-running bots in DeFi, for example, automatically insert themselves into pending transactions to steal a bit of value (a sandwich attack), and flash loan bots execute lightning-fast trades to exploit price discrepancies or vulnerable smart contracts.

However, as mentioned, even highly sophisticated bots don't guarantee big gains — the markets are competitive and unpredictable, something even the fanciest AI can't reliably foresee​.Meanwhile, the risk to victims is real: If a trading algorithm malfunctions or is maliciously coded, it can wipe out your funds in seconds. There have been cases of rogue bots on exchanges triggering flash crashes or draining liquidity pools, causing users to incur huge slippage losses.

 AI is teaching cybercriminals how to hack crypto platforms, enabling a wave of less-skilled attackers to launch credible attacks. This helps explain why crypto phishing and malware campaigns have scaled up so dramatically — AI tools let bad actors automate their scams and continuously refine them based on what works​.AI is also supercharging malware threats and hacking tactics aimed at crypto users. One concern is AI-generated malware, malicious programs that use AI to adapt and evade detection. In 2023, researchers demonstrated a proof-of-concept called BlackMamba, a polymorphic keylogger that uses an AI language model (like the tech behind ChatGPT) to rewrite its code with every execution. This means each time BlackMamba runs, it produces a new variant of itself in memory, helping it slip past antivirus and endpoint security tools​.​In tests, this AI-crafted malware went undetected by an industry-leading endpoint detection and response system​. Once active, it could stealthily capture everything the user types — including crypto exchange passwords or wallet seed phrases — and send that data to attackers​.While BlackMamba was just a lab demo, it highlights a real threat: Criminals can harness AI to create shape-shifting malware that targets cryptocurrency accounts and is much harder to catch than traditional viruses​.Even without exotic AI malware, threat actors abuse the popularity of AI to spread classic trojans. Scammers commonly set up fake “ChatGPT” or AI-related apps that contain malware, knowing users might drop their guard due to the AI branding. For instance, security analysts observed fraudulent websites impersonating the ChatGPT site with a “Download for Windows” button; if clicked, it silently installs a crypto-stealing Trojan on the victim's machine​.Beyond the malware itself, AI is lowering the skill barrier for would-be hackers. Previously, a criminal needed some coding know-how to craft phishing pages or viruses. Now, underground “AI-as-a-service” tools do much of the work. Illicit AI chatbots like WormGPT and FraudGPT have appeared on dark web forums, offering to generate phishing emails, malware code and hacking tips on demand​. For a fee, even non-technical criminals can use these AI bots to churn out convincing scam sites, create new malware variants, and scan for software vulnerabilities​.

​In tests, this AI-crafted malware went undetected by an industry-leading endpoint detection and response system​. Once active, it could stealthily capture everything the user types — including crypto exchange passwords or wallet seed phrases — and send that data to attackers​.

While BlackMamba was just a lab demo, it highlights a real threat: Criminals can harness AI to create shape-shifting malware that targets cryptocurrency accounts and is much harder to catch than traditional viruses​.

Even without exotic AI malware, threat actors abuse the popularity of AI to spread classic trojans. Scammers commonly set up fake “ChatGPT” or AI-related apps that contain malware, knowing users might drop their guard due to the AI branding. For instance, security analysts observed fraudulent websites impersonating the ChatGPT site with a “Download for Windows” button; if clicked, it silently installs a crypto-stealing Trojan on the victim's machine​.

Beyond the malware itself, AI is lowering the skill barrier for would-be hackers. Previously, a criminal needed some coding know-how to craft phishing pages or viruses. Now, underground “AI-as-a-service” tools do much of the work. 

Illicit AI chatbots like WormGPT and FraudGPT have appeared on dark web forums, offering to generate phishing emails, malware code and hacking tips on demand​. For a fee, even non-technical criminals can use these AI bots to churn out convincing scam sites, create new malware variants, and scan for software vulnerabilities​.

 AI-driven threats are becoming more advanced, making strong security measures essential to protect digital assets from automated scams and hacks.Below are the most effective ways on how to protect crypto from hackers and defend against AI-powered phishing, deepfake scams and exploit bots:Use a hardware wallet: AI-driven malware and phishing attacks primarily target online (hot) wallets. By using hardware wallets — like Ledger or Trezor — you keep private keys completely offline, making them virtually impossible for hackers or malicious AI bots to access remotely. For instance, during the 2022 FTX collapse, those using hardware wallets avoided the massive losses suffered by users with funds stored on exchanges.Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) and strong passwords: AI bots can crack weak passwords using deep learning in cybercrime, leveraging machine learning algorithms trained on leaked data breaches to predict and exploit vulnerable credentials. To counter this, always enable MFA via authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy rather than SMS-based codes — hackers have been known to exploit SIM swap vulnerabilities, making SMS verification less secure.Beware of AI-powered phishing scams: AI-generated phishing emails, messages and fake support requests have become nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Avoid clicking on links in emails or direct messages, always verify website URLs manually, and never share private keys or seed phrases, regardless of how convincing the request may seem.Verify identities carefully to avoid deepfake scams: AI-powered deepfake videos and voice recordings can convincingly impersonate crypto influencers, executives or even people you personally know. If someone is asking for funds or promoting an urgent investment opportunity via video or audio, verify their identity through multiple channels before taking action.Stay informed about the latest blockchain security threats: Regularly following trusted blockchain security sources such as CertiK, Chainalysis or SlowMist will keep you informed about the latest AI-powered threats and the tools available to protect yourself.  

AI-driven threats are becoming more advanced, making strong security measures essential to protect digital assets from automated scams and hacks.

 Toncoin's open interest spiked after reports emerged that Telegram founder Pavel Durov left France. 

Toncoin Open Interest (OI) has jumped 67% over the past 24 hours amid reports of Telegram founder Pavel Durov's departure from France, where he had been required to stay since his arrest seven months ago.

On March 15, Toncoin (TON) OI  — a metric tracking the total number of unsettled Toncoin derivative contracts such as options and futures —  reached $169 million, representing a 67% increase from the previous day when the reports of Durov's departure first surfaced, according to CoinGlass data.

It is the highest level of OI in Toncoin since Feb. 1, when it was sitting at $171.49 million. 

TON is The Open Network's native cryptocurrency and is the exclusive blockchain infrastructure for Telegram's Mini App ecosystem.

TON's price jumped 17% over the same 24-hour period, trading at $3.45 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

Trading resource account Crypto Billion said in a March 15 X post that Toncoin is “showing signs of a potential long-term accumulation phase as it stabilizes near key support levels.”

However, if this rally is short-lived, around $18.8 million in long positions could be liquidated if TON's price falls back toward the $3 level it was trading at on March 14.

The court reportedly allowed Durov to travel to Dubai, a city with no extradition agreements with many countries.

The market's reaction hints at the potential significance of this case for the crypto industry. Many are worried that Durov's arrest in August 2024 in France could set a precedent for cracking down on other privacy-focused services. He was accused of running a platform that enables illicit transactions.

Similarly, when Durov was arrested in August 2024, TON's OI also surged. 

Following the news of Durov's arrest on Aug. 24, 2024, TON's OI spiked 32% over the following 24 hours, alongside its price falling almost 12%.

On Jan. 21, Telegram announced it would cease support for all blockchains other than The Open Network for its messenger services.

 Hayden Davies continues launching memecoins plagued with insider trading activity despite being wanted by Interpol for previous crypto scams. 

The creator of the Libra (LIBRA) token has launched another memecoin with some of the same concerning onchain patterns that pointed to significant insider trading activity ahead of the coin's 99% collapse.

Hayden Davis, the co-creator of the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) and the Libra token, has launched a new Solana-based memecoin with an over 80% insider supply.

Davis launched the Wolf (WOLF) memecoin on March 8, banking on rumors of Jordan Belfort, known as the Wolf of Wall Street, launching his own token.

The token reached a peak $42 million market cap. However, 82% of the WOLF token's supply was bundled under the same entity, according to a March 15 X post by Bubblemaps, which wrote:

The blockchain analytics platform revealed transfers across 17 different addresses stemming back to address “OxcEAe” owned by Davis.

“He funded these wallets months before $LIBRA and $WOLF launched, moving money through 17 addresses and 2 chains,” Bubblemaps added.

The Wolf memecoin lost over 99% of its value within two days, from the peak $42.9 million market capitalization on March 8 at 4:00 am UTC to just $570,000 by publication time, Dexscreener data shows.

Davies' latest token launch comes weeks after the Libra token's collapse, where eight insider wallets cashed out $107 million in liquidity, leading to a $4 billion market cap wipeout within hours.

The Libra token turned into a political issue, with Argentine President Javier Milei risking impeachment after his endorsement of the Libra coin.

Argentine lawyer Gregorio Dalbon has asked for an Interpol Red Notice to be issued for Davis, citing a “procedural risk” if Davis remained free as he could have access to vast amounts of money that would allow him to either flee the US or go into hiding.

Memecoins are turning against crypto's fundamental ethos of decentralization, becoming increasingly used to exploit retail investors amid the growing number of rug pulls, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of blockchain regulatory firm Fideum.

“Memecoins have evolved from community-driven social experiments into a chaotic landscape dominated by value extraction from retail investors,” Plotnikova told Cointelegraph, adding:

Investors will also need to distinguish between memecoins that can be seen as genuine “collectibles” and “outright fraudulent activities” like rug pulls which are “not only unethical but also clearly illegal, with case law to support enforcement.”

“In my view, these activities should fall firmly within the jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies,” she added.

United States regulators are becoming increasingly aware of the growing memecoin scams.

A New York lawmaker introduced a bill that would establish criminal penalties specifically aimed at preventing cryptocurrency fraud and protecting investors from rug pulls, Cointelegraph reported on March 6.

Under the proposal, new criminal charges would be created for offenses involving “virtual token fraud,” explicitly targeting deceptive practices associated with cryptocurrencies.

Mice will lick the faces and pull at the tongues of other mice if they're found unconscious, with more vigorous grooming resulting in faster recovery.

Mice appear to administer first-aid if they find a fellow mouse unconscious, scientists have discovered.

They attempt to revive companions by licking at their faces, or even by pulling at their mouths or tongues, according to a study published Feb. 21 in the journal Science.

More aggressive mouth-pulling, biting and licking behaviors were seen in mice that had spent more time with the mouse in need of help, resulting in a faster recovery, the researchers report.

""The most striking discovery in this study is the existence of instinctive emergency responses in animals to revive unconscious — and even freshly deceased — partners. This study provides the first documented evidence of resuscitation-like behavior in naïve, untrained mice,"" study lead author Wenjian Sun, a researcher at the University of Southern California, told Live Science in an email.

Helping other animals that are injured or sick has been observed in a number of species, including dolphins, elephants, and non-human primates, Sun explained.

""These behaviors often include touching, grooming, nudging, and, in some cases, more intense physical actions such as striking. However, specific behaviors like tongue biting and tongue pulling, as observed in this study, have not been previously reported,"" Sun said.

In the paper, the researchers describe how dozens of mice reacted after being introduced to another mouse in a state of need. These states included the other mouse being stressed and unconscious.

Mice spent more time in physical contact with the other mouse if it was unconscious rather than awake, with the intensity of the grooming increasing over time if the other was unconscious. Mice spent an average of 47% of the 13-minute test interacting with an unconscious partner.

Grooming increased in vigor over the test period from sniffing and licking to biting at the other mouse's mouth and tongue, with more aggressive actions being seen in pairs of mice that were more familiar with one another. Over 50% of the mice ended up pulling at the tongues of their unconscious companion.

The mice were also able to detect that their companion was unconscious without relying on visual cues, initiating the grooming behaviors even in the dark.

The more intense grooming behaviors were correlated with better recovery in the unconscious mice, with a more rapid return to consciousness afterwards. When their companion awoke, the first-aider mouse stopped performing the grooming behaviors.

""The animal appears to be able to recognize the unconscious state of its partner, with the unresponsiveness triggering the behavior and regaining of responsiveness terminating the behavior,"" Sun said.

While these findings indicate that mice have an instinct to help others like humans do, the researchers can't be certain why they act in this way.

""We do not exclude the possibility that the animal is simply driven by instinctive impulses to perform these actions — an instinct that may have evolved over time during evolution — rather than acting with a conscious intent to revive its partner,"" Sun said.

In another paper, also published on Feb. 21 in Science, other researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles describe the neuronal mechanisms behind this behavior. They found that the grooming is likely driven by the release of oxytocin — a hormone that plays a crucial role in social bonding, sex, and childbirth — in areas of the brain called the amygdala and hypothalamus.

""Inactivation of oxytocin neurons or blocking oxytocin receptors impaired the behavior, confirming that oxytocin is essential for this emergency response. This aligns with the oxytocin's well-known role as the 'love hormone' which is associated with trust and affection in humans and promotes social bonding,"" Sun explained.

""Since oxytocin receptors are expressed in many brain regions, future research will focus on identifying the specific neural circuits involved in this behavior.""

It's commonly thought that sperm ""race"" to the egg, with the winner fertilizing it. But is this really the case? 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Egg fertilization is often described as an epic swim meet: Millions of sperm swim as fast as they can toward the egg until one — the fastest, strongest, healthiest sperm of them all — wins the race and wriggles into the egg, with the prize of passing its genes to future offspring.

But is this really how it happens? Do sperm really race to the egg?

Yes and no, David J. Miller, a professor in the animal sciences department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told Live Science. ""The important player in all of this is actually the female reproductive tract.""

Sperm do swim during this process, but ""the major movement is actually provided by contractions of the female tract,"" Miller explained. ""There are contractions of the uterus, for example, that are much like contractions of the GI tract that can move fluid through the uterus.""

A 1996 study illustrated just how efficient these contractions are, Miller noted. Scientists deposited sperm-size beads into the uteruses of 64 women, and some of the beads traveled all the way to the fallopian tubes — where fertilization usually takes place — within minutes.

It makes sense that sperm would need some extra help, because while the sperm swim in one direction, the egg needs to travel in the opposite direction to meet them, Sabine Koelle, a full professor of anatomy and developmental biology at the University College Dublin School of Medicine and Medical Sciences, told Live Science. The egg can't swim, so instead tiny hairs called cilia help it along .

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

""Cilia beat to transport the oocyte,"" or egg, Koelle said. ""Because the sperm are coming from the opposite direction, they have to struggle"" against the current created by the cilia.

In fact, an individual sperm's movement is less of an effort to move forward and more of an effort to move inward, toward the middle of the tract, Koelle said. If the sperm get too close to the sides, they stick and lose their forward momentum.

However, just because a sperm is the first to arrive doesn't mean it gets to do the fertilizing. ""Sperm require some final maturation that occurs in the female tract, and it's time dependent,"" Miller said. ""So the sperm that 'win the race,' so to speak, need more time before they can actually fertilize the egg.""

""They may not be there when they've completed that maturation,"" Miller added. ""They might be replaced by some of the other more slowly transported sperm that have had time to complete that maturation.""

But even those less-mature sperm are more successful than the vast majority of sperm that get deposited. As the female reproductive tract pushes the sperm along, it also cuts unlucky individuals from the swim team.

""Less than 1% — maybe up to 2 or 3% of the sperm that are actually deposited — make it all the way to where the egg is,"" Miller said. ""A lot of them are flushed back out from the tract. Some are eaten up by immune cells in the uterus, because sperm are foreign.""

Up to 70% of sperm don't even make it past the cervix, Koelle noted. ""The sperm are stuck there and can't free themselves,"" she said.

For those few sperm that make it into the fallopian tube, the goal is to get as far as possible and then stick to the wall as they wait for the egg to arrive. This is another place where the female reproductive organs are choosing winners: Scientists have noticed that normal-looking sperm are more likely to bind to the wall, Miller said, and binding to the wall provides some metabolic benefits that increase their lifespan.

Then, once the egg arrives, the fallopian tube — also known as the oviduct — allows only healthy-looking sperm to unstick from the wall. ""As soon as a sperm is not OK, the oviduct doesn't release it,"" Koelle said. ""It's the main selector of good sperm.""

—How does DNA know which job to do in each cell?

—What's the youngest age that a person can get pregnant and give birth?

This isn't a perfect system, of course. "" Obviously, we have genetic diseases that come through sperm. So it's not always true that the fittest are the best ones genetically,"" Miller said.

Every step of the way, the female reproductive tract is doing its best to weed out the less-fit sperm so that only healthy sperm reach the egg. In that way, fertilization is less like a race and more like a job interview.

""There's certain qualifications that you need to be able to apply for the job,"" Miller said. ""But also, the sperm that have those qualifications would have to have them at the time the job is open — the time when the egg is ovulated."" But in the end, it's the female reproductive tract that chooses the best candidate.

Trained on the spectacular Flame Nebula, the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes went hunting for the smallest stars in the universe.

What it is: The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) star-forming region

Where it is: 1,400 light-years away, in the constellation Orion

When it was shared: March 10, 2025

Why it's so special: What are the smallest stars? A deep dive into the star-forming Flame Nebula by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed free-floating, Jupiter-size objects that could help answer that key question in astronomy.

The free-floating objects are brown dwarfs, which straddle the line between stars and planets. Brown dwarfs are often called ""failed stars"" because they don't get dense and hot enough to become stars and, instead, eventually cool to become dim, hard-to-see objects.

However, exactly how small a brown dwarf can be is a mystery, largely because these objects are impossible to study using standard telescopes. But JWST is sensitive to infrared light, which it sees as heat. The telescope went looking for relatively warm and bright young brown dwarfs in the Flame Nebula, whose dense dust and gas proved no match for its infrared detectors.

It found free-floating objects two to three times the mass of Jupiter, though the telescope is capable of finding objects half the mass of the gas giant. That's smaller than scientists expected.

NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has been hunting for brown dwarfs for decades. Previously, Hubble identified possible candidates in a region of the Flame Nebula called the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. Now, JWST has picked up the baton and completed what scientists called ""a quantum leap"" in understanding brown dwarfs.

""It's really difficult to do this work, looking at brown dwarfs down to even ten Jupiter masses, from the ground, especially in regions like this,"" Matthew De Furio, an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin and lead author of a study published this week in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said in a statement. ""Having existing Hubble data over the last 30 years or so allowed us to know that this is a really useful star-forming region to target. We needed to have Webb to be able to study this particular science topic.""

The researchers hope JWST's ability to split the light from an object into its constituent wavelengths will help them clarify the boundaries between a planet, a brown dwarf and a full-fledged star.

An AI model trained on dozens of hours of real-world conversation accurately predicts human brain activity and shows that features of language structure emerge without being coded in.

Using artificial intelligence (AI), scientists have unraveled the intricate brain activity that unfolds during everyday conversations.

The tool could offer new insights into the neuroscience of language, and someday, it could help improve technologies designed to recognize speech or help people communicate, the researchers say.

Based on how an AI model transcribes audio into text, the researchers behind the study could map brain activity that takes place during conversation more accurately than traditional models that encode specific features of language structure — such as phonemes (the simple sounds that make up words) and parts of speech (such as nouns, verbs and adjectives).

The model used in the study, called Whisper, instead takes audio files and their text transcripts, which are used as training data to map the audio to the text. It then uses the statistics of that mapping to ""learn"" to predict text from new audio files that it hasn't previously heard.

As such, Whisper works purely through these statistics without any features of language structure encoded in its original settings. But nonetheless, in the study, the scientists showed that those structures still emerged in the model once it was trained.

The study sheds light on how these types of AI models — called large language models (LLMs) — work. But the research team is more interested in the insight it provides into human language and cognition. Identifying similarities between how the model develops language processing abilities and how people develop these skills may be useful for engineering devices that help people communicate.

""It's really about how we think about cognition,"" said lead study author Ariel Goldstein, an assistant professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The study's results suggest that ""we should think about cognition through the lens of this [statistical] type of model,"" Goldstein told Live Science.

The study, published March 7 in the journal Nature Human Behaviour, featured four participants with epilepsy who were already undergoing surgery to have brain-monitoring electrodes implanted for clinical reasons.

With consent, the researchers recorded all of the patients' conversations throughout their hospital stays, which ranged from several days to a week. They captured over 100 hours of audio, in total.

Each of the participants had 104 to 255 electrodes installed to monitor their brain activity.

Most studies that use recordings of conversations take place in a lab under very controlled circumstances over about an hour, Goldstein said. Although this controlled environment can be useful for teasing out the roles of different variables, Goldstein and his collaborators wanted to ""to explore the brain activity and human behavior in real life.""

Their study revealed how different parts of the brain engage during the tasks required to produce and comprehend speech.

Goldstein explained that there is ongoing debate as to whether distinct parts of the brain kick into gear during these tasks or if the whole organ responds more collectively. The former idea might suggest that one part of the brain processes the actual sounds that make up words while another interprets those words' meanings, and still another handles the movements needed to speak.

In the alternate theory, it's more that these different regions of the brain work in concert, taking a ""distributed"" approach, Goldstein said.

The researchers found that certain brain regions did tend to correlate with some tasks.

For example, areas known to be involved in processing sound, such as the superior temporal gyrus, showed more activity when handling auditory information, and areas involved in higher-level thinking, such as the inferior frontal gyrus, were more active for understanding the meaning of language.

They could also see that the areas became active sequentially.

For example, the region most responsible for hearing the words was activated before the region most responsible for interpreting them. However, the researchers also clearly saw areas activate during activities they were not known to be specialized for.

""I think it's the most comprehensive and thorough, real-life evidence for this distributed approach,"" Goldstein said.

The researchers used 80% of the recorded audio and accompanying transcriptions to train Whisper so that it could then predict the transcriptions for the remaining 20% of the audio.

The team then looked at how the audio and transcriptions were captured by Whisper and mapped those representations to the brain activity captured with the electrodes.

After this analysis, they could use the model to predict what brain activity would go with conversations that had not been included in the training data. The model's accuracy surpassed that of a model based on features of language structure.

Although the researchers didn't program what a phoneme or word is into their model from the outset, they found those language structures were still reflected in how the model worked out its transcripts. So it had extracted those features without being directed to do so.

The research is a ""groundbreaking study because it demonstrates a link between the workings of a computational acoustic-to-speech-to language model and brain function,"" Leonhard Schilbach, a research group leader at the Munich Centre for Neurosciences in Germany who was not involved in the work, told Live Science in an email.

—Can you forget your native language?

—'Universal language network' identified in the brain

—Can we think without using language?

However, he added that, ""Much more research is needed to investigate whether this relationship really implies similarities in the mechanisms by which language models and the brain process language.""

""Comparing the brain with artificial neural networks is an important line of work,"" said Gašper Beguš, an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the study.

“If we understand the inner workings of artificial and biological neurons and their similarities, we might be able to conduct experiments and simulations that would be impossible to conduct in our biological brain,"" he told Live Science by email.

The head coach of one of the hottest teams in college basketball entering the postseason, Florida's Todd Golden, was earlier this season the subject of a Title IX investigation into his behavior after accusations of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and stalking. 

Florida's Title IX office adjudicated the case in January after a months-long investigation into the allegations, saying it found ""no evidence"" he violated Title IX. However, while the probe did not turn up a chargeable offense, it also did not completely exonerate the 39-year-old coach.

Its findings instead eliminated a narrow scope of the allegations related to Title IX -- behavior perpetrated within a university program or activity -- which raises the possibility that the coach of Florida, whose No. 4 Gators have national title aspirations, may be met with new scrutiny as the spotlight of March Madness begins to shine.

Here is what we know about the case and the accusations levied against Florida's coach.

A formal complaint with the Title IX office at the University of Florida against Golden, potentially putting Golden in violation of the school's Gender Equity Policy, was filed on Sept. 27, 2024. In the complaint, made public on Nov. 8, 2024 after the school's student newspaper reported on the findings, Golden is alleged to have committed sexual harassment, sexual exploitation and stalking. 

Golden remained the coach as Florida's Title IX office, an office independent of the athletics department, conducted an investigation into the allegations over the course of several months.

On Jan. 27, 2025, Florida announced that after dozens of interviews across several months it ""found no evidence that Todd Golden violated Title IX"" and closed the investigation.

Multiple women lodged accusations against Golden of sexual harassment and stalking, per documents obtained by The Independent Florida Alligator, the school's student newspaper. The complaint against Golden alleges that over the course of a year, he made unwanted sexual advances on Instagram, requested sexual favors, and sent photos and videos of his genitalia while traveling with Florida, as well as multiple occasions of stalking.

The number of women who accused Golden of this behavior remains unknown. From The Alligator:

There was allegedly more than one occasion in which Golden was taking photos of women walking or driving and sending those pictures to the subjects involved. Various stalking incidents also included Golden showing up to locations where he knew the women would be.

On allegedly more than one occasion, Golden was engaging women on Instagram by liking photos then waiting until they read the DM before un-liking the photos to avoid suspicion.

Two women spoke with The Alligator about Golden's behavior while choosing to remain anonymous. The first woman — a former Florida student — claims Golden stalked her in person both in his car and on foot ""more than 10 times."" She also accused him of sending unsolicited photos of his genitalia, including one instance when the team was traveling on the road.

From The Alligator's reporting:

""At first, it starts off slow, like, 'Oh, wow. That's odd. This guy is showing us attention,'"" the first woman said. ""And then it becomes, 'Wow, he's kind of crossing a line. No, he didn't mean it that way.' Then it's, 'Wait, he's fully stepping over that line.' And then it's, 'Wow, there's a picture of his d*ck.' It was a full grooming process with all of us.""

The second woman, who was also a former Florida student, claims Golden liked Instagram posts in an apparent attempt to get their attention before unliking them to avoid detection. She also claims he told her she was ""his drug"" or ""good luck charm.""

ESPN reported on Jan. 27 that a copy of a letter from the university sent to a female complainant in the case determined there was no evidence to indicate Golden committed sexual harassment ""within a university program or activity,"" which is why the school had to dismiss the complaint. 

The letter also said the university received an anonymous report naming ""multiple potentially impacted persons.""

From ESPN:

Attorney Karen Truszkowski, who represents a 21-year-old college student who did not attend the University of Florida, said that although the reported behavior might not fall under the definition of Title IX, there was ""certainly evidence that there was questionable activity that occurred"" while Golden was participating in a university event.

Throughout the process — spanning from accusations to an investigation to a closing of the probe — Golden has maintained his innocence. 

In November, he released a statement saying he was participating in the investigation and considering defamation claims but did not comment further, citing confidentiality laws. 

Those defamation claims never materialized. 

When the investigation was closed in late January, he released a statement thanking the UAA, Florida fans and the university for being supportive throughout the process.

Golden's attorney, William Shepherd, also released a statement in January after the investigation was closed: 

This investigation has found no evidence to support the allegations against Coach Golden. The University's conclusion proves that the complaint was meritless. Coach Golden and I have respected the process throughout while actively engaging with the University. However, there were many who did not respect the investigative process. Instead, they sought to target Coach Golden and drive their agenda and this investigation for their own self-interest. Some leaked confidential material to the media; falsely posed as a UF lawyer in an effort to intimidate; harassed UF students and parents to try to generate a false narrative; and harassed my client, his family, and his friends. Coach Golden appreciates the support he and his program have received from so many at the University and from around the country. Now that this is concluded, Coach can continue to focus on the basketball season and consider his legal options in the off season – but now it's time to move forward.

The investigation into Golden's alleged sexual misconduct this season bubbled while Florida — which began the season ranked No. 21 in the AP poll — has enjoyed historic success on the hardwood.

The team, which plays Sunday vs. Tennessee in the SEC Tournament championship, has amassed 29 wins — fourth-most (and counting) in school history in a single-season behind 2013-14 (36), 2006-07 (35) and 2005-06 (33). 

It enters Selection Sunday with the No. 3 offense and No. 7 defense in adjusted efficiency ratings at KenPom, which rates the team No. 2 overall in college basketball behind only Duke.

The Gators are also projected to land a No. 1 seed Sunday for the first time since 2013-14 in what was Billy Donovan's penultimate season with the Gators.

While Golden's Title IX investigation was still open this season, a separate Title IX inquiry was opened into Florida assistant and former Gators star Taurean Green in mid-January. In that case, a Florida athletics department employee filed a sexual assault complaint against Green, accusing him of making unwanted advances toward her.

Those advances were made during a meeting set up by Green in which he is accused of trying to kiss her and put his hands down her pants. She rejected the advances before Green tried again before she eventually got away.

Green is still with the team. The investigation remains ongoing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22sports%20news%22%20site%3Acbssports.com","Villanova basketball coaching candidates: Chris Collins, Richard Pitino among options to replace Kyle Neptune","https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/villanova-basketball-coaching-candidates-chris-collins-richard-pitino-among-options-to-replace-kyle-neptune/","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:41:00 GMT","

Kyle Neptune is out at Villanova after three turbulent seasons, and a highly coveted gig is now up for grabs. Villanova is expected to be well-situated in the arms race that is college basketball. With the revenue-sharing era looming, Villanova conveniently does not have a FBS football program with which to share the sugar.

That makes this job look different than the rest of the current batch of high-major openings that includes Iowa, Minnesota, NC State, Indiana and Virginia

Let's dive into six top names who should be at the top of the list for Villanova's brass.

Collins has done a remarkable job dragging Northwestern out of the Big Ten cellar and into a new zip code of competence. Collins snapped Northwestern's NCAA Tournament drought in 2017, and he's led the Wildcats to three Big Dance bids, which felt inconceivable after Northwestern was the last high-major team to hear its name called on Selection Sunday. 

Northwestern has been playing basketball since 1904, and it has won 20 games in back-to-back seasons just three times. Two of those have come under Collins' watch. Northwestern has mostly used defense to stay afloat in the Big Ten despite not having the stocked NIL budgets of its league rivals. Collins has built top-40 defenses six times in his 12-year tenure, and he's both recruited and developed terrific All-Big Ten hoopers like Boo Buie, Brooks Barnhizer, Nick Martinelli (who had no other high-major offers) and countless more.

Winning just seems to follow Ryan Odom around. He led UMBC to a historic upset over No. 1 seed Virginia in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. He steered Utah State to the Big Dance in 2023. He has VCU on the verge of another appearance in the field of 68 this year. 

Most importantly, Odom has done it in a variety of ways. Odom constructed a top-20 offense at Utah State, but the nation's best halfcourt defense fueled VCU to an A-10 crown. 

The longtime Loyola-Chicago coach gained fame for leading the Ramblers to the Final Four in 2018 and the Sweet 16 in 2016. Oklahoma does not have one of the top NIL coffers in the SEC, but the Sooners are in good shape to make the NCAA Tournament. Reclassified guards have a long history of struggling in their first season of college basketball, but Moser has helped Jeremiah Fears develop into a potential lottery pick. 

Pitino has turned New Mexico into one of the top programs in the Mountain West. His evaluations lately have been unbelievable. JT Toppin turned into the Mountain West Freshman of the Year in 2024. Donovan Dent turned into the Mountain West Player of the Year in 2025. Pitino is on the verge of taking New Mexico to the NCAA Tournament in back-to-back seasons for the first time in a decade. His teams play vicious defense and have major bite. 

Pitino has become a highly coveted name in the coaching carousel. Virginia has shown a ton of interest and could be the top challenger if Villanova's brass hones in on him.

McCollum is one of the hottest names on the carousel. Iowa is interested. Minnesota is interested. Indiana is interested. And for good reason. McCollum won four Division II championships at Northwest Missouri State, and he's immediately turned Drake into the best team in the Missouri Valley Conference. 

McCollum has been dubbed ""your favorite coach's favorite coach"" because numerous high-major head men were seeking his advice on offensive tactics when he was at the Division II ranks.

Henderson is one of the best offensive masterminds in the country. Princeton has routinely been one of the best isolation-led offenses in the country year after year. Xaivian Lee has turned into a legitimate NBA Draft prospect at Princeton.

Oh, and Henderson has the deep NCAA Tournament run on his resume, too. He led Princeton to the Sweet 16 in 2023.

The ""semi"" final bracket is up to start Selection Sunday. There are still five conference championship games before the NCAA releases the real bracket and four of those games could cause a change in the final bracket this afternoon.

The most potentially impactful of those is the American Athletic Conference title game between top-seed Memphis and No. 3 seed UAB. The Blazers' only path to the NCAA Tournament is to win the AAC automatic bid. Memphis is in the field win or lose, so a UAB win steals a bid. In my bracket, it will be Boise State getting bounced with a victory by the Blazers.

There was one bid stolen on Saturday. Colorado State won the Mountain West Tournament, beating Boise State 69-56. That knocked Xavier out of my bracket, but it could end up being that the bid that was stolen came from the Rams' own league. The Broncos and San Diego State are my last two teams in.

March Madness® is better with friends, especially when you beat them! Get your bracket pools ready now and invite your friends, family and co-workers to play.

The SEC Tournament title game between Tennessee and Florida has something at stake as well. I believe that game is a battle for the fourth No. 1 spot in the bracket. The winner will be on the top line and in the West Region and the loser is fifth overall seed and the No. 2 seed in the Midwest.

  

Check out Palm's bracket and full field of 68 at the Bracketology hub.   

The Big Ten Tournament championship game between Michigan and Wisconsin features two No. 3 seeds facing off, so nothing changes in the bracket as a result of that game.

The other two tournament championship games are in one-bid leagues. George Mason faces VCU in the Atlantic 10 and Yale takes on Cornell in the Ivy League. VCU and Yale are the top seeds and currently in the bracket, but need to win the title games.

The first four teams out are Xavier, Texas, North Carolina and Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons have not been on the bubble for a while. The Longhorns and Tar Heels each have something in their résumé that would be historically bad if they were selected. 

Texas is 19-15 overall, but just 12-15 against teams in the top three quadrants. No team has ever received an at-large bid with that poor of a record in that group. 

North Carolina is 1-12 in Quad 1 games. That is a lot of chances to prove themselves and in a way, the Tar Heels did. That would be a record for futility for NCAA Tournament teams that played that many Quad 1 games.

This season ended up being a pretty good example of why expansion isn't necessary. It makes a better case for contraction. Let's go back to 64!

There are a record 13 teams from the SEC in the bracket and nine from the Big Ten. There are only three from the ACC, while the Mountain West has five. However, the Mountain West also has the last two teams in the bracket, so they are going to be pretty nervous on Selection Sunday.

No matter what the committee gives us, enjoy the NCAA Tournament!

The exodus out of San Francisco continues. The 49ers have agreed to trade running back Jordan Mason to the Minnesota Vikings, his agency told ESPN. In exchange, the Niners receive a 2026 sixth-round pick. On top of that, the two clubs are also swapping Day 3 selections in the 2025 NFL Draft. The 49ers now own No. 160 overall, while the Vikings receive No. 187. 

Along with the trade, the Vikings have agreed to a two-year deal with Mason that includes over $7 million fully guaranteed and has a maximum value of $12 million. Earlier this offseason, the 49ers placed a second-round tender on Mason, who was a restricted free agent. That had him slated to earn $5.3 million next season, but that has since been cast aside with him dealt to Minnesota.  

The 25-year-old entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent out of Georgia Tech in 2022. Up until this trade, he'd spent his entire career with the 49ers and had piled up 1,375 yards from scrimmage and seven total touchdowns over his tenure. The 2024 campaign proved to be the most productive of his career. 

With fellow running back Christian McCaffrey (Achilles tendonitis) sidelined due to injury, Mason carried a larger load in the San Francisco backfield. While Mason -- who had three 100-plus yard rushing games within the first month of the season -- started strong, his production did tail off in conjunction with McCaffrey's return. Then, in Week 13, Mason suffered a high-ankle sprain that would lead to him landing on season-ending injured reserve. In 12 games (six starts), he totaled 789 yards rushing and three touchdowns. He also added 11 receptions for 91 yards receiving. 

As Mason now turns the page to the next chapter of his NFL career with the Vikings, he joins a backfield that is headlined by Aaron Jones, who re-signed with Minnesota this offseason on a two-year, $20 million extension. With Jones' presence, Mason should be looked at as a high-end depth piece. 

With the particulars laid out, let's now grade the trade. 

Minnesota gets a quality backup to Jones, who is entering his age-30 season. As the Vikings saw last season, Mason is capable of taking on the bulk of the carries in a pinch, and doing so at a high level, notching three games with over 100 yards rushing. That includes when he rushed for 100 yards and a touchdown against them in Week 2 last season.  As the roster is currently constituted, Mason should slot in as the No. 2 option in the backfield behind Jones and ahead of Ty Chandler. Meanwhile, Minnesota secures this depth piece with a relatively low cost over his two-year extension. Shipping out a Day 3 pick and moving down the board some also shouldn't have Kwesi Adofo-Mensah staying awake a night. 

The 49ers do have a pretty deep stable of backs headlined by McCaffrey. They also have Isaac Guerendo, who flashed as a rookie, so that made Mason expendable. What they lose in depth, they gain in added draft capital during a year where it is said to be flush with running back talent. Along with the sixth-rounder next year, they move into the middle of the fifth round this year from the top of the sixth, which isn't too shabby. Of course, they need to hit on the picks to make it worthwhile, making it a touch riskier on their end.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Tyrese Proctor entered Saturday night's ACC championship 0 for 10 from beyond the 3-point arc in his previous two tournament games.

That didn't keep him from letting it fly.

Proctor made six 3-pointers and scored 19 points, tournament MVP Kon Knueppel added 18 points and No. 1 Duke defeated 13th-ranked Louisville 73-62 to clinch its second Atlantic Coast Conference championship in three seasons under Jon Scheyer.

“He's been playing great defense,” Scheyer said. “The shots haven't been falling for him lately but we knew it was only a matter of time because he's a killer.”

It was Duke's 23rd ACC title overall - the most of any team in conference history - and five more than rival North Carolina, who the Blue Devils knocked off 74-71 in a semifinal thriller. The Blue Devils also won the ACC regular-season title.

“Two down and one to go,” Knueppel said, referring to the upcoming NCAA Tournament in which the Blue Devils are a lock to be the No. 1 overall seed.

Sion James added 15 points for Duke (31-3), which played its final two tournament games without ACC player of the year Cooper Flagg and Maliq Brown due to injuries.

“Every game this season, everyone standing behind me stepped and tonight was no different,” Scheyer said. ""So many guys made winning plays and that has been the story of this team.”

Terrence Edwards Jr. scored 29 points on five 3s for Louisville (27-7), which was playing in its first ACC final since joining the league in 2014. The Cardinals went 18-2 in the conference play during the regular season under first-year head coach Pat Kelsey after going 5-37 vs. ACC foes in the previous two seasons.

Kelsey praised his team for “leaving everything on the floor” over the past three days.

“In the last three months this team has lost twice,” Kelsey said. “So I feel strongly in my heart that the best is yet to come. ... We are excited to find out (during selection Sunday) where we are going and who are playing.""

Added Edwards: “We are far from done.”

There were nine lead changes and neither team led by more than five before Duke broke the game open with a 12-0 run midway through the second half behind a 3 from Proctor in transition to build a 57-47 lead.

“We have a special group,"" Scheyer said. ""They are connected. They show incredible fight and incredible heart and that is what they did tonight.”

Louisville: Hepburn has been the team's offensive catalyst this season, but Edwards' recent play gives the Cardinals the needed scoring punch that could takes them deep into the NCAA Tournament. Edwards has averaged 24.8 points over the last six games. “He's been on a tear, for sure,” Kelsey said.

Duke: The Blue Devils defense in the tournament was outstanding. They held Louisville to 9-of-35 shooting in the second half to pull away.

Patrick Ngongba II's spinning drive along the baseline and two free throws on the ensuing drive gave Duke a 13-point lead with less than five minutes to play.

Proctor entered the game 6 of 29 from beyond the arc over his last seven games.

Both teams await their seed in the NCAA Tournament.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP)  Houston had crowded onto the podium inside T-Mobile Center on Saturday night, and the second-ranked Cougars were beginning to celebrate their Big 12 Tournament title, when Emanuel Sharp was handed a championship belt as the tourney MVP.

He raised it high above his head - upside down.

It was just about the only obvious misstep that anyone from Houston made all week.

Milos Uzan poured in 25 points against Arizona in the finale, Sharp added 17 in another brilliant effort, and the Cougars turned up their trademark defense in the final minute to hold on for a 72-64 victory over the Big 12 newcomer.

Playing without injured big man J'Wan Roberts, the Cougars (30-4) took a 64-62 lead on Uzan's 3-pointer with 5 minutes to go, then suffocated the Wildcats (22-12) down the stretch to avenge a loss to Iowa State in last year's title game.

“We did a great job of staying together,” said Sharp, who was joined by Uzan and Big 12 player of the year LJ Cryer on the All-Tournament team. “That's what coach has been preaching. And that's why I love this team.”

Houston romped to the regular-season Big 12 title, winning 19 of 20 games in the expanded league. And it was just as dominant in three games in Kansas City, easily beating Colorado and No. 17 BYU before turning back red-hot Arizona for the trophy.

“We never panic,” Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. “A lot of people around us do, but thank God they're not coaches and players. We've been in these bunkers. We've been there when it's tough. We've learned to internalize and almost get independent of everything around us. We get in a bunker and believe in each other and get to work.”

Caleb Love scored 19 points, Jaden Bradley added 14 and KJ Lewis finished with 11 for the Wildcats, who were trying to replicate what Arizona State did in football this past season: win a Big 12 title in its first year in its new league.

“It was a tough year. A tough conference. And for us to compete with the best of the best, you know, as far as conferences, I'm proud of my guys,” Love said. “I'm just proud we made it this far, and we'll be ready for March Madness.”

Wildcats coach Tommy Lloyd had bristled after their quarterfinal win over No. 9 Texas Tech when it was suggested that the title tilt amounted to a showdown of styles: Arizona's high-scoring offense against Houston's dominant defense.

“We're not that bad on defense,” Lloyd countered succinctly.

Turns out the Wildcats are quite good.

They harried and harrassed Houston's guards wherever they went on the floor, twice holding the Cougars without a point for 5-minute stretches in the first half. The result was a 33-28 lead in the locker room that felt just a little bit bigger.

Yet there is a reason that Houston is No. 1 nationally in defensive efficiency.

The Cougars were still trailing 40-37 when they clamped down on the Wildcats, turning defense into offense and outscoring them 19-6 over the next five minutes. By the time Uzan curled in a bucket with 11:40 to go, Houston had taken a 56-46 lead - the largest of the entire game for either team.

Arizona gamely fought back to take a 62-61 lead, only for the relentless Cougars to regain the lead seconds later, when Uzan dropped his 3-pointer. He scored again on their ensuing possession, and Houston maintained its lead from there.

The result was its third conference tourney title in five years after the pair it won in the American Athletic Conference.

“Obviously they've had a great season, and a great couple of seasons, and Coach Sampson deserves a ton of credit. They got us twice this year,"" Lloyd said. “They won the conference by four or five. They won the conference tournament. At this moment they are the kings of the Big 12. I have nothing but respect for them.”

Roberts, who sprained his right ankle in the quarterfinals, went through pregame warmups without the walking boot he wore a day earlier. But he had the boot back on as he watched from the bench in the hopes of playing in the NCAA Tournament.

Houston almost certainly locked up a No. 1 seed on Selection Sunday and will probably begin its NCAA Tournament in Wichita, Kansas. Most expect the Wildcats to land a No. 4 seed after their run to the conference championship game.

NEW YORK (AP)  Regular-season champs. A tournament title. Pride in the program fully restored.

The pied piper of college basketball rebuilds, Rick Pitino has St. John's back atop the Big East.

And this time, the nets were coming down.

RJ Luis Jr. scored all but two of his 29 points after halftime and No. 6 St. John's made 14 straight shots from the field in the second half to beat Creighton 82-66 on Saturday night for its first Big East Tournament title in 25 years.

“Wow, this is incredible just to come from last year to this year and to see the transformation,” Luis said. “Coach P is the mastermind behind all of this. I mean, it's truly special.”

Zuby Ejiofor added 20 points and Kadary Richmond had 12 points and 12 rebounds for the top-seeded Red Storm (30-4), who reached 30 wins for the third time in program history before a roaring hometown crowd at sold-out Madison Square Garden.

They earned the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for their first trip since 2019, making the 72-year-old Pitino the first coach to take six schools to the Big Dance.

The others were Boston University, Providence, Kentucky, Louisville and Iona.

“Great win for the city. Great win for our university. You hear it all along that it's New York's team, and it truly is,” the Hall of Fame coach said. “As a New Yorker myself, I'm very, very proud that St. John's has gotten to this level.”

Pitino, in his second season with the Johnnies, also became the first coach to win the Big East Tournament at two schools. He's won three times in his last four seasons in the league, after guiding Louisville to championships in 2009, 2012 and 2013.

“I saved the best for last,” Pitino announced to loud cheers from the crowd of 19,812, pausing to remove falling confetti from his lips during a postgame interview on the court.

Luis, the Big East Player of the Year, also grabbed 10 rebounds and was selected the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. He was draped in a Dominican Republic flag as fans chanted “MVP! MVP!” after the game.

“Just still trying to soak it in, and it's just crazy how much you can speak things into existence and just watch it all come together,” Luis said. “This has by far been the most emotional, happiest week of my 22 years of existence.”

Ejiofor and Richmond made the All-Tournament team.

“The three of them have been unstoppable,” Pitino said.

Ryan Kalkbrenner scored 15 points for second-seeded Creighton (24-10), which fell to 0-5 in Big East championship games since joining the conference for the 2013-14 season.

“It's hard to get to this game, let's be honest,” coach Greg McDermott said. “We've been fortunate to be here quite a few times. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to finish the job.”

When the resurgent Johnnies clinched their first outright regular-season conference championship in 40 years with a victory over Seton Hall at The Garden on March 1, they had already decided not to cut down the nets to celebrate.

More work to do.

But on this night, players and staff climbed the ladder and snipped their souvenirs.

It was the fourth Big East Tournament title for the Johnnies, who made the championship game for the first time since winning the 2000 trophy under Mike Jarvis. The previous two came in the 1980s under Hall of Fame coach Lou Carnesecca, who died Nov. 30 about five weeks shy of his 100th birthday.

“To finally get over the hump, it's really an unbelievable feeling,” Ejiofor said. “I'm so happy to be a part of history.”

And after the Red Storm cut down the nets, a message appeared on the giant video screen above center court: “For Looie.""

“I'm thinking he would be so proud of this team,” said Pitino, who has quickly revived St. John's into a national power again late in his illustrious but checkered career.

“Humility is a big part of my life right now. It wasn't always that way,” he added. “I don't believe in redemption. I believe in humility.”

The drought between Big East Tournament titles for the Johnnies was the longest for any team in league history.

“St. John's didn't get built by the NIL. St. John's got built with character of the players,"" Pitino said.

Luis was whistled for his second foul with 7:19 left before halftime and sat out the rest of the half.

After falling behind by eight early, St. John's finally took its first lead at 43-41 with 11:55 remaining when backup big man Vince Iwuchukwu scored left-handed in the post over the 7-foot-1 Kalkbrenner, the four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year.

That came 33 seconds after Ejiofor converted a tying three-point play that began a streak of 14 consecutive made field goals in 7:12 for the Red Storm, giving them a 70-55 lead. They connected on 17 of their final 19 field goal attempts to finish at 72% in the second period (23 for 32).

Quite an offensive display for a team that entered the game shooting 45% from floor.

“We definitely fed off the crowd, the energy, the atmosphere,"" Luis said. “It was ridiculous. It was very loud.”

St. John's has won nine straight games, and 19 of 20 since the new year. The team finished 21-0 on its home courts, including 12-0 at MSG - the program's most wins at The Garden since compiling 13 in 1958-59. The last time the Johnnies finished unbeaten at home was the 1931-32 season.

Bluejays reserve Fedor Zugic injured his right ankle with 11:23 left in the first half and had to be helped off the court to the locker room. He didn't return.

Creighton, which entered shooting 74% on free throws, missed six of its first eight from the line and finished 8 for 16.

Creighton: Headed to its fifth straight NCAA Tournament when the brackets are revealed Sunday.

St. John's: Hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game in 25 years. Pitino and the streaking Red Storm seem likely to receive a No. 2 seed Sunday.

“We still have a lot to prove. We're not done,” Ejiofor said.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Losses by Auburn and Michigan State on Saturday likely assured that the SEC will have multiple No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in the modern era when the field of 68 is revealed Sunday on CBS.

Entering the day, Auburn was the top overall seed, followed by Duke, Houston and Florida on the top line, with the Tigers, Blue Devils and Cougars virtually assured of finishing in those spots, according to CBS Sports Bracketology Expert Jerry Palm. 

The fourth No. 1 seed is not locked in, but after Tennessee beat Auburn 70-65 in the semifinals of the SEC Tournament and Wisconsin defeated Michigan State 77-74 in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals, the race has some clarity.  

""I believe the SEC Tournament champion now will be the fourth No. 1 seed,"" CBS Sports Bracketology Expert Palm said.

March Madness® is better with friends, especially when you beat them! Get your bracket pools ready now and invite your friends, family and co-workers to play.

Had the Tigers won the SEC Tournament and had Michigan State won the Big Ten Tournament, the final No. 1 seed line could have consisted of Auburn (SEC), Duke (ACC), Houston (Big 12),  and Michigan State (Big Ten).

But with either Florida or Tennessee guaranteed to win the SEC Tournament, that team will be well-positioned to end up on the No. 1 seed line. Michigan State's loss could also end up being particularly helpful for a team like Tennessee if the Volunteers cut down the nets.

Tennessee entered the day as a projected No. 2 seed in Palm's Bracketology but could usurp Florida on the No. 1 line if they take a 2-1 edge in their season series with the Gators. The Vols no longer have to worry about the Spartans, either.

If Florida wins, it will be a virtual lock as a No. 1 seed. However, if the Vols take the title, it will create an interesting Tennessee vs. Florida debate for the final spot on the top line. Tennessee would be 12-6 in Quad 1 opportunities with a victory, while Florida would be 10-5 in such games with a loss.

But even if the Gators stumble on Sunday, UF coach Todd Golden made the case Saturday for why his team should still be a No. 1 seed.

""I think we secured a 1-seed today,"" Golden said after Florida finished its 104-82 bludgeoning of Alabama in the semifinals. ""That's my opinion. We're second on KenPom right now, beat Bama twice, beat Auburn at Auburn. I don't really think it's a debate regardless of the results tomorrow.""

The SEC is also on track to place 13 or 14 teams in the Big Dance, which will shatter the Big East's old record of 11, which was set in 2011 when the league had 16 teams. When the NCAA Tournament consisted of 48 teams in 1980, both Kentucky and LSU received No. 1 seeds.

Selection Sunday is nigh and the 2025 NCAA Tournament bracket – particularly at the top – is starting to take shape. Despite Auburn losing to Tennessee in the SEC Tournament semifinals, CBS Sports Bracketologist Jerry Palm still projects the Tigers to get the No. 1 overall seed when the bracket is unveiled.

Elsewhere, bubble teams such as Indiana, North Carolina and Texas face some uncertainty about their respective tournament hopes. With Colorado State winning the Mountain West Conference title, it potentially takes away an at-large berth from one of those power-conference programs vying for a bid to the Big Dance.

Auburn, Duke and Houston entered the day as near-locks to receive a No. 1 seed in the bracket, but the final spot is still up for grabs. The final No. 1 seed will likely go to Florida or Tennessee after Michigan State was upset by Wisconsin in the Big Ten Tournament semifinals. Tennessee faces Florida for the SEC title on Sunday.

With the attention turning to the Big Ten and SEC title games and then Selection Sunday, here are the biggest winners and losers from Saturday's slate.

With Michigan State losing to Wisconsin earlier the day and Tennessee upsetting Auburn, the stage is set for the winner of the SEC Tournament Championship between Tennessee and Florida to snare a No. 1 seed, joining Auburn as SEC teams leading their region. Florida entered the weekend as the final No. 1 seed in the latest Bracketology projections and a win over the Vols mean they stay there. 

How the committee handles seeding the rest of the glut of SEC teams is a whole 'nother story. 

– Cameron Salerno

Colorado State and Boise State controlled their destinies to get into the NCAA Tournament, and only one left no doubt they will be playing next week. Colorado State made a statement with a 69-56 win over Boise State in the Mountain West title game. Had the Rams lost, their chances of reaching the NCAA Tournament would've been slim to none. Boise State entered the weekend on the bubble ﻿and now will have to sweat out Selection Sunday, just like every other bubble team. – Salerno

Even without superstar freshman Cooper Flagg in the lineup, Duke won three straight games at the ACC Tournament and defeated No. 2 Louisville 73-62 to bring home the title. Flagg's classmate Kon Knueppel scored 18 points, and veteran guard Tyrese Proctor added 19 in the win. Duke got more good news hours before the ACC title game when NCAA Senior Vice President of Basketball  Dan Gavitt told CBS Sports that Flagg is expected to return for the NCAA Tournament. The Blue Devils were likely going to stay on the No. 1 seed line regardless of tonight's result, but a win over Louisville is more positive momentum heading into the Big Dance. – Salerno

In the penultimate game of this week's Big Ten Tournament, Wisconsin star John Tonje stole the show for the Badgers and made a strong case for his All-American candidacy with 32 points, seven boards and one clutch block to help secure a win over No. 7 Michigan State.

Tonje's offensive output alone was a full-blown superstar show but his timing to seal the win was even better. On one end of the floor, he missed a free throw that would have effectively ended the game — but on the other end he totally redeemed himself with a timing block that could not have been better coordinated. – Kyle Boone

Entering the weekend, Michigan State was one of a handful of teams still in contention to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. It's unlikely MSU is a No. 1 seed after being on the wrong side of a 77-74 upset loss to Wisconsin. The Spartans should still earn a No. 2 seed in the bracket, but losing to Wisconsin made it easy for the committee to exclude MSU on the No. 1 seed line. MSU needed to win the Big Ten title to have a chance. 

So, what went wrong? One obvious answer (as Boone stated above) is Michigan State couldn't stop Tonje. The Wisconsin star made four 3-pointers and attempted 14 free throws. Tonje made his first 12 at the line before missing a pair with less than six seconds left.

Since losing to Indiana last month, Michigan State had won its last eight games. Six of those eight wins were against ranked opponents. Although Michigan State survived and (flawlessly) got through its toughest stretch of the season, they couldn't end the story with a Big Ten conference title. Now, the Spartans will await their draw, and part of the question that's next is, what No. 1 seed will be on the other side of their region.  – Salerno

If the Big Ten Tournament has offered a glimpse of what March Madness will offer in the coming weeks, college basketball fans are in for a treat. Michigan guard Tre Donaldson was not the hero once, but twice in the 81-80 win over Maryland. Donaldson hit a clutch 3-pointer in the final minutes to give his team the lead and scored a layup with 0.4 seconds left that won the Wolverines the game. With a matchup against Wisconsin on deck, Michigan will be able to make its case to move up on the seed line with a win. – Salerno

UNBELIEVABLE!@umichbbaII stuns Maryland in the final seconds! 🤯 pic.twitter.com/qIw8h48w7t

South Carolina State lost the MEAC title game in the worst fashion possible against Norfolk State. After South Carolina State recorded a steal and scored a basket with less than 10 seconds remaining to tie the game at 65, a player on South Carolina State fouled on the ensuing inbounds pass while Norfolk State was in the bonus. Norfolk State's Christian Ings drained a go-ahead free throw, and his team got a stop on the ensuing possession to seal a 66-65 win. Norfolk State will make its third NCAA Tournament appearance since the 2020-21 season. – Salerno

CHAOS AS SC STATE TIES IT ON THE TURNOVER AND THEN THEY FORGET THE SCORE AND FOUL… pic.twitter.com/TA2sNRNEk0

Top-seeded Memphis gave bubble teams a scare in the AAC Tournament semifinals as the Tigers fell behind No. 4 seed Tulane in the final minute. However, the Tigers escaped for a 78-77 win, allowing teams like Xavier, Texas, North Carolina and everyone else who is sweating right now a chance to exhale. If Memphis wins the AAC Tournament, it will be the league's only NCAA Tournament team. If UAB beats Memphis, it will steal a bid (Memphis will make it, too). Crisis averted, for now anyway. – David Cobb

Houston left no doubt about its status as a No. 1 seed with an impressive 72-64 win over Arizona in the Big 12 title game. Just minutes after that game ended, St. John's got over the hump with a 82-66 win over Creighton at Madison Square Garden. Houston won its first Big 12 Conference title in Year 2 as a member of the league, while St. John's captured its first Big East title since 2000. – Salerno

The New York Knicks are in a slide. Jalen Brunson is expected to be out for at least the rest of March and perhaps through early April with an ankle sprain. They register as the third-worst offense with a bottom-10 net rating since the All-Star break. And they've now lost four of their last six games after a 97-94 defeat at the hands of the Golden State Warriors on Saturday. 

Forgive everyone in Knicks land if they're running a little hot under the collar at the moment. 

It is with this context in mind that we bring you this, shall we say, spirited exchange between Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau and forward Josh Hart in a timeout huddle during Saturday's loss. 

Everything is fine....nothing to see here pic.twitter.com/uE305ntObS

""I love Josh, you guys know that,"" Thibodeau said after the game, implying he was simply trying to stoke a fire in his team. ""Just whatever can get us going, just try to get us going."" 

The Athletic's Fred Katz followed up by asking Thibodeau if he would classify the exchange as a ""passionate moment"" and Thibodeau said, ""Yeah, that's it.""

Fred Katz: ""There was a clip…you & Josh kinda exchanging words––""Thibs: ""Aw, yeah, I love Josh, you guys know that. Just whatever can get us going, just try to get us going""Katz: ""Just a passionate moment""Thibs (slight grin): ""Yeah that's it"" pic.twitter.com/npVTcbW1BO

So here's the deal: These little dustups do happen all the time in competitive environments. In a vacuum, it isn't anything to get worked up about. But there is clearly some tension within the Knicks right now. Mikal Bridges and Thibodeau just had to have a ""productive"" meeting after Bridges essentially called out Thibs for playing the Knicks' starters too many minutes. And again, the offense has been a mess for a while and the losses are piling up without Brunson. Hart didn't score a single point on Saturday, missing all seven of his shots. 

This little square-off in the huddle was likely a a result of the cumulative stress that's been building inside the Knicks' walls. Losing will do that. The good news is the Knicks have a really easy run of games ahead, with matchups against the Heat, Spurs, Hornets, Wizards, Mavericks, Blazers and 76ers in seven of their next nine. Perhaps they can reverse their mojo a little over this stretch and then get Brunson back for the close of the season before heading into the playoffs on a good note.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. – Now they're complete, these Houston Cougars. 

You knew it in the second half Saturday in the Big 12 Tournament Championship Game when Milos Uzan began almost every offensive possession with the ball in his hands. Sensing the moment and situation, his teammates began clearing out for the Houston guard like he was Michael Jordan. 

Uzan definitely took advantage driving to the basket with more force than the 65-mph winds that struck the area on Friday. 

It's one thing to bring the ball up. It's another for a teammate to clear out for an alpha guard to make a play. That was what Uzan did several times in Houston's comeback 72-64 victory over Arizona to win its first Big 12 Tournament title. 

March Madness® is better with friends, especially when you beat them! Get your bracket pools ready now and invite your friends, family and co-workers to play.

Uzan is a wiry 6-foot-4 transfer guard from Oklahoma who just may be the difference between Houston going to another Final Four and, this time, winning that Final Four. 

""They saw I had the hot hand,"" Uzan said after scoring a career-high 25 points, including 17 in that pivotal second half. ""They saw what was working so they let me play a little bit.""

That's the brilliance of Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson – knowing what he had to tweak  for the national program he has resurrected since arriving in 2014. A defense that smothers the opposition quicker than a blanket puts out a kitchen fire is a given and Houston continues to lead the nation in scoring defense, allowing 58.3 points per game. 

But the difference for this season's Cougars team is a guy like Uzan – who averaged 8.3 points starting 56 games in two seasons for the Sooners – teaming up with 3-point shooter L.J. Cryer and veteran Emanuel Sharp, the Big 12 Tournament's Most Outstanding Player, to give Houston a potent offense that it has been missing recently.

""We have this series we call 'Push,'' Sampson said. ""Milos is the best ambidextrous pick-and-roll guard I've had … He goes left and right equally good. What we did at halftime was stay away from any big-on-big pick and roll … Instead of setting the screen we ghosted [faked] the screen. By ghosting the screen that allows us to go downhill without anybody in front of us.""

""We didn't set one ball screen [in the second half],"" he added. ""We ghosted [faked] every screen. That allowed us to get in the paint. Once we got in the paint, we could either spray [pass] it or shoot it.""

Milos knocks down the triple 👌📺 ESPN | @lossyuzan pic.twitter.com/VESYsZNCB9

That's a fancy way of saying Uzan had the game in his hands after Arizona led by five at halftime. The Cougars then scored 44 in the second half shooting 50% from beyond the arc. In the final 20 minutes, Uzan went 5 for 9 from the field while making all three of his shots from deep. 

And, oh yeah, that defense. The Cougars backed up their regular-season Big 12 championship holding their three opponents (Colorado, BYU, Arizona) in the conference tournament to a combined 38.5% shooting. 

This is the most complete team Sampson has had at Houston. Maybe the most complete team in the country. 

""That's why I came here. I came here to win a national championship,"" Uzan said. ""This is a great step in the right direction.""

Houston has a case to move to No. 1 in the polls prior to the NCAA Tournament. Their third consecutive No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament is already assured.

A discussion can be had about who the overall No. 1 seed should be as we head into Selection Sunday, but there is no doubt who is playing better than anyone heading into the Big Dance.

""All I see is us,"" Houston forward J'Wan Roberts said. 

The Cougars ran through the Big 12 this season going 22-1 counting this week's three conference tournament wins. The only loss was to Texas Tech by a point more than six weeks ago. Saturday's win was the season's 30th, the sixth 30-win campaign of Sampson's career. Since losing two of three in November's Players Era Festival, the Cougars are 25-2. 

With a bullet.

There's a reason. A program noted for its halfcourt defense, has a more balanced attack – translated: more offensive -- with the likes of Sharp, Cryer and Uzan.

""Our kids are good one-on-one players,"" Sampson said with words you never thought you'd hear him speak. ""There's a lot of old school people that think offense should look like it did when [Princeton legend] Pete Carril was the coach.""

""I'd like to introduce LeBron James, James Harden and Kevin Durant and basketball today … If you can get a good one-on-one player in space you can get a good shot.""

Houston has proved it can win shootouts, rock fights and anything in between. It won vs. Arizona with an intensity that resembled an Elite Eight game. 

It finally came time to ask Sampson himself if this is the best team he's had. Typical of the Houston coach, the answer came after a long, winding reminiscence of the past. His 2002 Oklahoma team went to the Final Four. The 2021 Cougars advanced that far, losing to Baylor in the national semifinals.

""I didn't think that team could win it [all],"" Sampson said. ""Baylor was better than us.""

Since then a series of injuries have impacted the Cougars' NCAA Tournament chances. This season it was Roberts on the sidelines Friday and Saturday after spraining his ankle vs. Colorado. 

But in a twist of basketball irony, Uzan is only at Houston because its best player last season, Jamal Shedd, moved on after winning the Big 12 Player of the Year  and is now in the NBA. 

""I saw how good of players they had here,"" Uzan said. ""They had only one guy leaving, Jamal. I saw the development. There were so many things honestly. When I entered the portal they were one of the first teams that hit my line. 

""I felt like I was wanted here."" 

As for this being Sampson's best team? The 69-year-old didn't get this far without coaching his way out of jams. 

""Sometimes it's not how good you are,"" Sampson said, non-committal. ""It's whether good fortune shines on you.""

The Washington Wizards were leading the way for the worst record in the league a couple weeks ago, but now -- just as tank season has kicked into full effect -- they've suddenly won four of their last seven including Saturday night's 126-123 thriller over the Denver Nuggets. 

Washington trailed by seven with under five minutes to play but worked itself into the lead with a Jordan Poole floater with 44 seconds to play. From there, the teams traded baskets before Jamal Murray, who knocked down the game-winner against the Lakers on Friday, tied the score with five seconds left with another clutch jumper for his scrapbook. 

That left 5.1 seconds on the clock, which was more than enough time for Poole to send the Nuggets packing with a 35-foot bomb from the logo as time basically expired.

Again, these ""wins"" are actually losses for the Wizards at this point. They're still tied with Utah for the worst record and safely inside the bottom three, which would give them the maximum 14% chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick. But Washington's ""lead"" over the Pelicans, who own the fourth-worst record, is now just three losses with 16 games to play. 

They can still blow this if they keep winning games, but don't tell that to Poole, who certainly isn't in the business of missing shots on purpose. He saw a game-winning opportunity in front of him, and he splashed it with conviction. Good for him. 

He's been turned into a punchline since Golden State traded him to Washington before last season, but he's actually been pretty damn good this season. He's averaging 21 points per game and making 38% of his nine 3-point attempts per game. The circus blunders have mostly been erased. And now you can add this game-winner to the ledger.

Bickerstaff goes on fist-slamming rant over officiating: 'What you saw tonight was disgusting'","https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/pistons-j-b-bickerstaff-goes-on-fist-slamming-rant-over-officiating-what-you-saw-tonight-was-disgusting/","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 03:44:08 GMT","

The Detroit Pistons lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder, 113-107, on Saturday night, and suffice it to say Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff was not in a pleasant mood afterward. 

His anger was not directed at his players, but rather ... you'll never guess ... at the officials. If you want the numbers, the Pistons only got to the line 13 times against the Thunder's 22, but judging the equity of officiating in a given game by free throw totals is a flawed measurement. 

For the most part, teams that shoot a lot of free throws earn them with downhill initiative and physical creation. But Bickerstaff wasn't just angry at the fouls that were called or not called, but mostly with what he believes was a refusal on the part of the officials to extend a basic level of respectful consideration and communication to the Pistons. 

Bickerstaff's anger clearly hit a boiling point when Cade Cunningham was ejected late in the third quarter. A foul was reviewed for a flagrant but was deemed a common foul, and Cunningham, per the pool report, was hit with a technical foul for using profanity toward the officials, and then was hit with a second tech for more profanity. 

Magic words aside, this doesn't seem like a very demonstrative brand of arguing.

""['I'm] disgusted by the way that game was officiated,"" Bickerstaff said. ""The level of disrespect was above and beyond. [The Thunder] have a guy fall down, trip on his own teammate's foot, they review us for a hostile act. [The Thunder] throw an elbow to our chest, neck area, I ask [the officials] to at least take a look at it, just show us the respect to take a look at it, no one would take a look at it.

""The disrespect has gone far enough. And I'm not going to allow out guy to be treated the way that they were treated tonight. ... We understand that we play a style of ball that's physical, that's on the edge, I coach my ass off with a passionate way, I'm into the games, our players are into the games, we understand that. But we deserve a level of respect because we're competing our tails off and bringing something positive to this league.""

Now, here's where Bickerstaff nearly lost it, pounding his fists on the table as he unleashed an emphatic, voice-cracking close to his rant before wadding up the stat sheet and spiking it down as he walked off. 

""We're growing young players. Our young players are competing their tail off. The least that they could do is get the same level of respect that everybody else in this league gets, and get refereed the same way that everybody else in this league gets reffed. Enough is enough of it. What you saw tonight was disgusting. It was a disgusting display of disrespect toward our guys and what we're trying to do.""

Even though you've now read the script, this is worth a watch. 

JB Bickerstaff did not hold back at all….here are his thoughts on the officiating from tonight's game…watch the whole thing #Pistons pic.twitter.com/kFw75E1oxQ

Bickerstaff clearly believes this has been going on longer than this game. This was a total straw-that-broke-the-camel's back meltdown, but in the end, it's not going to get Bickerstaff or the Pistons anywhere. They lost the game, their second straight and fourth in six games, and they're losing ground on a top-four seed -- though they're still only two games back from No. 4 Milwaukee. 

To say every coach thinks his team gets officiated worse than everyone else goes without saying. This sort of frustration is even more pronounced against the Thunder and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is going to drive you crazy with his foul hunting and post-contact antics. But again, the Cunningham ejection is likely what sent Bickerstaff over the edge. 

It's a tough deal for the Pistons trying to knock off maybe the best team in the league without their best player for the fourth quarter, and good on Bickerstaff for coming to his players' defense. But chances are, the only thing that's going to come of it is a fine.

The No. 1 seed Houston Cougars won three games in three days in Kansas City, Missouri to claim their first Big 12 Tournament championship in just their second year in the league. The Cougars defeated No. 16 seed Colorado, No. 4 seed BYU and No. 3 seed Arizona in their run to the title, punctuated with a 72-64 win over the Wildcats in the tournament finale on Saturday night.

Arizona gave Houston its biggest challenge of the week in a back-and-forth battle before bowing out down the stretch. It led by five at halftime and traded blows with the Cougars late into the second half until Houston -- in typical Cougars fashion -- slammed the door shut. The Cougars finished the game on an 11-2 run and held Arizona without a field goal over the final 5:32 of game time, turning what was a one-point deficit into an eight-point win.

Oklahoma transfer Milos Uzan paced Houston down the stretch with 17 of his career-high 25 points in the second half. The junior guard drained four of the team's nine 3s and finished 8-of-16 from the field, besting his previous career-high of 22 set earlier this season against Texas Tech.

Under Kelvin Sampson, Houston has made a habit of winning at the highest level regardless of conference affiliation. He led the program to four regular-season championships and two tournament championships in the AAC before joining the Big 12 in 2023. It now has two Big 12 regular season titles and one Big 12 Tournament title -- with a very good chance on Sunday to secure a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive year.

Follow below for updates, analysis and highlights throughout the event.

The Houston Cougars claimed the Big 12 Tournament championship Saturday night with a 72-64 win over the Arizona Wildcats to sweep the league's hardware after claiming the outright regular-season title two weeks ago.

The top-seeded Cougars defeated No. 16 seed Colorado, No. 4 seed BYU and No. 3 seed Arizona in three games across three days in Kansas City to secure the title — its first since joining the league last season after finishing runner-up in 2023-24.

Houston guard Milos Uzan scored a career-high 25 points in the win and drilled a game-high four made 3s on six attempts in a breakout second half to pace the Cougars. He scored 17 of his 25 in the second half as Houston turned a five-point halftime deficit into a six-point win.

The win was propelled by a Houston-like finish as it closed on an 11-2 run. Its defense held Arizona without a field goal in the final 5:32 of game time and the Wildcats missed seven of their final eight shots from the field.

Houston won the Big 12 regular season title in its first season in the conference last year and followed it up with another regular-season title this season. Now with 30 wins entering Selection Sunday, it is a projected 1 seed in Jerry Palm's latest bracket and positioned as one of the heavyweights to contend for an NCAA championship this month.

Houston has turned a five-point halftime deficit into a five-point lead here in the early going of the second half after a huge couple of buckets from Emanuel Sharp. Sharp has seven points in the first seven minutes of the second half and has made three of his four buckets. 

Like the first half, Arizona's defense has thus far not quite been up to speed. Houston shooting 70% from the field and 75% on 3s in the second half even as Arizona's offense is still rolling.

After trailing by as many as eight points early in the first half, Arizona put together a big run to roll into halftime with a 33-28 advantage. The Wildcats closed the half on a 22-9 run as Caleb Love came alive, scoring 14 of the team's 33 points in the opening 20 minutes.

""We knew it was going to be tough, but we're here for it,"" Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said to ESPN at halftime.

Arizona out-rebounded Houston 21-19 in the opening frame and matched the Cougars' signature toughness, which should bode well for the Wildcats if it continues. 

Houston also sputtered a bit on offense after a fast start with Emanuel Sharp finishing 3 of 8 from the field and the team missing 20 of its 32 shots from the floor. 

Against this Houston team, you absolutely have to be tough and match physicality.

That's what Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd was preaching — no, screaming — in his team's huddle a few minutes ago. Cool look here from ESPN with special access demanding his team be tough and be ready for the Cougars' aggressive approach on defense.

It's been an ugly start on offense for both teams, but Houston has taken hold of this one and has not trailed thus far thanks to a big start from Emanuel Sharp and Milos Uzan. Sharp has been red-hot this postseason and he has six points already on two big 3s. 

Arizona on he other hand is 0 of 4 from 3-point range and 3-of-16 from the field. 

We are underway in Kansas City.

Houston, a two-time conference tournament champion in the AAC under Kelvin Sampson, looking for its first Big 12 tournament championship tonight vs. an Arizona team that, under Tommy Lloyd, was a two-time conference tournament champion in the Pac-12 and is now looking for its first Big 12 hardware.

Buckle up! 

The fifteenth and final game of Big 12 Tournament week is set to tip tonight at 6 p.m. ET from Kansas City.

Here's five things to know as Arizona and Houston prepare for battle.

1. Houston forced BYU to miss its first nine shots of Friday's semifinals game before going on to win 74-54. The Cougars of Houston won both their games against the Cougars of BYU this season by a combined 51 points.

2. Houston leads the all-time series between the two programs 7-6. Notably, it ended Arizona's NCAA Tournament run in 2022 in the Sweet 16, 72-60.

3. Arizona is playing for its third conference tournament championship in the last four seasons under coach Tommy Lloyd and first in the Big 12 after joining the league this year.

4. Houston ranks inside the top-10 in the following statistical categories at KenPom: Defense (No. 2), effective FG% defense (No. 3), 3-point % (No. 4), block rate (No. 6). 

5. Since the start of the 2021-22 season, this will be the fifth time that Arizona has played three games in three days. The Wildcats are 12-2 in those games. 

Unsurprisingly, Big 12 regular season champion and 29-win Houston is a betting favorite to win tonight's Big 12 Tournament title game. But oddsmakers have the line fairly close to a toss-up entering the game.

Here's where things stand after Houston opened as a 7-point favorite.

Both the game line and over/under line have seen some movement since open. Houston opened as 7-point favorites and that line is now Houston -6. The over/under also moved upward from 135 at open to 136.5.

Per TeamRankings.com data, Houston is 13-18-1 against the spread this season as a favorite — while Arizona is 4-4 against the spread as an underdog. 

A fifteenth and final game at this week's Big 12 Tournament stands between us and crowning a champion Saturday night in Kansas City.

The tourney finale is scheduled for 6 p.m. ET between No. 1 seed Houston and No. 3 seed Arizona after 14 games across four days leading us into the weekend. The game will air on ESPN tonight with Houston considered a narrow favorite.

Here's a look at the updated bracket and how we got here.

A post shared by Big 12 Conference (@big12conference)

There is arguably no team in college basketball — not Auburn, not Duke — that is hotter entering this weekend's festivities than the No. 2 Houston Cougars. The top-seeded team in the Big 12 has been on a rampage the last few months with 12-straight wins entering Saturday evening and 24 wins in its last 25 games dating back to an overtime loss to San Diego State on Nov. 30.

That 12-game winning streak is the third-longest active streak in college basketball and first-longest among major conference programs behind UC San Diego and High Point.

A post shared by Houston Men's Basketball (@uhcougarmbk)

Year 1 as a member of the Big 12 has been a success for Arizona. The Wildcats punched their ticket to the Big 12 title game with a 86-80 win over No. 2 seed Texas Tech. Arizona star guard Caleb Love scored a team-high 27 points in the win to help set up a date with No. 1 seed Houston for all the marbles on Saturday.

Arizona took a 47-39 lead into the locker room and never trailed for the final 24 minutes of regulation. The Wildcats should have a chance to improve their seed line with a win over Houston in the conference title game. The Cougars are projected to earn a No. 1 seed in the latest Bracketology projections by CBS Sports' Jerry Palm.

It wasn't the 31-point beatdown Houston handed BYU on Jan. 4 of this year, but it wasn't far off, either!

The top-seeded Cougars of Houston downed the fourth-seeded Cougars of BYU in yet another lopsided victory, this time in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals round to punch a ticket to Saturday's title fight.

It was a clinic in typical Houston fashion: suffocating defense, tough shot-making, and capitalizing off opponent mistakes.

Houston finished the game forcing 13 turnovers and on offense shot 10 of 26 from 3-point land to help build a lead that proved insurmountable. Emanuel Sharp was the leader on that front for the Cougars with 26 points in the win, and LJ Cryer was consistent all night as well, finishing with 20 points. Sharp and Cryer combined for more 3s (9) than did BYU as a team (6) on 10 fewer attempts.

The win gives Houston a second consecutive Big 12 Tournament title appearance in as many seasons — after, I'll remind you, joining the league last year — and sets it up to face the winner of Texas Tech-Arizona on Saturday.

The second game of tonight's Big 12 Tournament semifinals doubleheader in Kansas City features No. 2 seed Texas Tech and No. 3 seed Arizona.

The game is scheduled to tip at 9:30 p.m. ET and will air on ESPN2.

Here are five things to know.

1. Texas Tech and Arizona split the regular-season series 1-1. Texas Tech beat Arizona in Lubbock, Texas, on Jan. 18, 70-54. Arizona returned the favor in Tucson, Arizona, on Feb. 8, 82-73. 

2. Friday night will be the eighth time Texas Tech has appeared in a Big 12 Tournament semifinal game. 

3. Texas Tech owns a 29-25 all-time advantage in the series with Arizona. 

4. Texas Tech made 15 3-pointers in its Big 12 quarterfinals win over Baylor which set the program record for 3s in a Big 12 Tournament game. The Red Raiders have now made 10 or more 3s in a program record 20 games this season, including 15 or more in five games. 

5. The four most efficient offensive teams in the Big 12 are the four still vying for a Big 12 tourney title. Arizona's offense was the highest-scoring among all Big 12 teams during conference play at 80.0 points per game but ranks fourth in adjusted offensive efficiency at KenPom among Big 12 teams behind No. 1 Texas Tech, No. 2 BYU and No. 3 Houston.

The first of two games scheduled tonight in the Big 12 Tournament semifinals between No. 1 seed Houston and No. 4 seed BYU tips at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN2.

Here are five things to know.

1. Houston has the third-longest active winning streak in college basketball having won 11 consecutive games. It is 24-1 over its last 25 games since losing in overtime to Texas Tech on Feb. 1.

2. Houston has advanced to seven consecutive (!!) conference tournament semifinals. This is the second year Houston is in the Big 12. It was previously in the American Athletic Conference from 2012-2023.

3. Friday will be the 11th all-time meeting between Houston and BYU and the first at a neutral site since 1978. Houston holds a 7-3 all-time advantage in the series.

4. Houston defeated BYU by 34 points in the first and only meeting of the two teams this season. 

5. BYU has won nine consecutive games and has the eight-longest active winning streak in college basketball. 

Four teams are still standing as we hit the homestretch of the Big 12 Tournament in Kansas City on Friday. Action begins tonight at 7 p.m. with all four of the top seeds still in the hunt for a championship.

Here's a look at the schedule and current odds:

Both games will air on ESPN2.

If the first three days of Big 12 Tournament action are any indication, then Friday night's semifinals should be sublime.

We've got four teams left standing and two games on tap. A doubleheader from the T-Mobile Center this evening starts at 7 p.m. ET. Both games will air on ESPN2.

The first game features No. 1 seed Houston and No. 4 seed BYU in a rematch from a beatdown in January in which the (Houston) Cougars handed the (BYU) Cougars a 31-point defeat. 

The second game of the night features No. 2 seed Texas Tech and No. 3 seed Arizona. The two split the regular-season series 1-1. 

A post shared by Big 12 Conference (@big12conference)

No. 3 seed Arizona is moving to the next round of the Big 12 Tournament after recording an 88-77 win over No. 6 seed Kansas. The Wildcats led by as many as 13 points in the second half and were in control for the majority of the game. They will face No. 2 seed Texas Tech on Friday with a trip to the Big 12 title game on the line.

After an up-and-down season, the Jayhawks now await their seeding on Selection Sunday.

Texas Tech made it harder on itself than it should have, but the No. 2 seed Red Raiders manage to escape potential disaster after dragging their feet to the finish line with a win over Baylor. Tech missed its final 10 shots from the field in a stretch that spanned the entire final 7:26 of game action.

It matters not because Texas Tech loaded up all its ammo early to secure just enough of a cushion.

That was a credit to a big day from Big 12 Player of the Year JT Toppin, who had 26 points and 10 boards and helped Tech build a 15-point second-half lead that it ultimately never surrendered. 

Texas Tech moves into the Big 12 Tournament semifinals on Friday where it will face the winner of Arizona-Kansas. 

Colorado's magical run at the Big 12 Tournament comes to an end at the hands of No. 1 seed Thursday as the Buffaloes fall 77-68 in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals. Colorado won twice in two days to draw a matchup with the top-seeded Houston, but the fresh Cougars handled them throughout in a near wire-to-wire victory to advance into the semifinals.

Houston had four players score in double figures and crucially won the battle both on the boards and in turnovers in typical Houston fashion. Emmanuel Sharp scored a team-high 19 points but fouled out in 26 minutes.

Houston advances into the semifinals where it will play No. 4 seed BYU on Friday at 7 p.m. ET.  

The shorthanded Iowa State Cyclones fittingly fell short in their bid for a comeback as BYU holds them off with big shots late to advance in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals. 

ISU was without both Tamin Lipsey and Keshon Gilbert after suffering injuries Wednesday, which meant for a big day from Curtis Jones — who finished with 31 points. But it wasn't enough to offset the loss of Lipsey (the team leader in steals and second-leading assists man) and Gilbert (the second-leading scorer and team leader in assists).

That was as much because of BYU's performance on a big day as it was because of ISU absences. Richie Saunders scored 23 points and the team made 18 of its 36 3s in a barrage from distance to help bury the Cyclones. 

BYU's win moves it to the tourney semifinals in the bracket where it will play the winner of Houston-Colorado on Friday.

Oddsmakers seem to think Thursday could shape up to be a good one in Kansas City as the Big 12 Tournament's quarterfinals play out. Here's the schedule and a look at the odds for every game that have been posted so far. The day's finale, Kansas-Arizona, could be the best of the bunch.

Afternoon session will be on ESPN2; evening session will be aired on ESPN.

Wednesday delivered a relatively chalky day at the Big 12 Tournament to set up what should be a delectable slate Thursday in conference quarterfinals action. 

Three of the four winners advanced in the bracket as better-seeded teams over their opponents, while the fourth, Colorado, won for a second consecutive day to move into the quarters. Colorado is the worst-seeded team in the field after entering the week as the No. 16 seed following a league-low three wins in Big 12 play.

Thursday's slate begins at 12:30 p.m. ET with Iowa State-BYU followed by No. 1 seed Houston's first outing of the postseason vs. Colorado. The night session wraps with No. 2 seed Texas Tech and No. 3 seed Arizona facing their first postseason action as well vs. Baylor and Kansas, respectively.

The second-round finale of the Big 12 Tournament didn't disappoint, as Kansas held off a late rally from UCF to score a 98-94 win. UCF big man Moustapha Thiam missed a floater with less than two seconds left in overtime that would've tied the game. 

The Knights forced overtime after guard Jordan Ivy-Curry knocked down a 3-pointer with 14 seconds remaining to tie the game at 83-83. UCF went on a 14-0 run to get back into the game after Kansas led by as many as 13 in the second half.

Four different Kansas players scored at least 15 points in the win. Kansas guard Zeke Mayo scored 24, and star big man Hunter Dickinson added 23. The Jayhawks will face No. 3 seed Arizona on Thursday with a trip to the semifinals on the line.

Baylor lands a big win for its bubbly NCAA Tournament outlook with an impressive outing in its first showing of the week at the Big 12 Tournament. The Bears led for all but a few minutes in the opening frame and turned it into a blowout by halftime that never really was contested in the second half.

Baylor got a huge game from Jayden Nunn and VJ Edgecombe for the Bears' backcourt. Edgecombe led the team with 19 points and grabbed 10 boards, and Nunn had 18 points led by a team-best four made 3-pointers.

Norchad Omier added 12 points and 12 boards.

Baylor entered the day as one of the last four teams in Jerry Palm's updated NCAA Tournament bracket projections so this should do well for its hopes to go dancing. It will face No. 2 seed Texas Tech on Thursday in the quarterfinals with a chance to further bolster its resume ahead of this weekend's Selection Sunday.

Colorado for a second time in as many days is advancing in the Big 12 Tournament bracket. The Buffs won in upset fashion, overcoming a 13-point deficit to down the Mountaineers, 67-60. The Buffaloes, who closed as 6.5-point underdogs, rallied with a huge second half capped by hitting seven of their final nine shots from the field. It continues what has been a remarkable two-day stretch for Tad Boyle's club after entering the week as the 16-seed among 16 Big 12 teams following a league-low three regular-season wins in conference play.

Colorado's bench was the difference in this one, outscoring West Virginia's 38-12 while winning the turnover battle 15-11 to boot. CU got 14 points from Elijah Malone and 13 points from RJ Smith.

The Buffaloes move into the quarterfinals round to face No. 1 seed Houston on Thursday.

Iowa State goes wire-to-wire with a resounding victory to end Cincinnati's run at the Big 12 Tournament in the second round. The Cyclones never trailed and finished with their largest lead of the day in the final outcome. Joshua Jefferson and Milan Momcilovic led the way with 19 points and 16 points, respectively.

It was perfect a fresh glimpse at a retooled Iowa State team that has battled injuries to various players throughout the season and a reminder of the potency of the Cyclones when at full strength. It shot 10 of 21 from 3-point range, outscored Cincy 36-16 in the paint and finished the game on an impressive 11-0 run to punctuate the win.

Iowa State moves into the quarterfinals round where it will face No. 4 seed BYU on Thursday.

Four games , four fairly large favorites on the slate Wednesday with second-round action on tap from the Big 12 Tournament. 

Odds for each game are as follows:

Both Baylor and West Virginia are 6.5-point favorites against Kansas State and Colorado, respectively. Call me crazy but I like taking the points with the underdogs there. The regular-season matchups between those teams were within single-digits. In a spotlight like the Big 12 tourney, where neither favorite has a clear home advantage, I think the underdog can cover the number and keep it interesting.

I like laying the points with Iowa State and Kansas as 9 and 10 point favorites in the first and last games of the day, respectively. Iowa State fans notoriously travel WELL — in Big 12 tourney action, they match KU fans. The building will be packed with Cyclones and Jayhawks. I think today will be the start of a big run for both ISU and KU after shaky finishes to the regular season.

The second day of the Big 12 Tournament picks up again Wednesday with a quadruple-header in Kansas City, Missouri, after first-round action from Tuesday saw two games decided by two possessions and two games were decisively won in blowout fashion.

Wednesday's slate begins at 12:30 p.m. ET between No. 5 seed Iowa State and No. 13 seed Cincinnati before moving into the afternoon at 3 p.m. ET with a battle between No. 8 seed West Virginia and No. 16 seed Colorado.

The night session features No. 7 seed Baylor taking on No. 10 seed Kansas State followed by No. 6 seed Kansas and No. 14 seed UCF.

Winners of today's action will move into the quarterfinals round on Thursday with games each of the next three days on tap before crowning a champion on Saturday night.

After trailing by as many as 12 points midway through the first half, UCF used a big run after halftime to defeat Utah 87-72. The Knights will advance to the second round of the Big 12 Tournament for the second consecutive season after defeating Oklahoma State in the opening round of last year's tournament.

UCF star Keyshawn Hall finished with a team-high 23 points, and Darius Johnson added 20 in the win. Just weeks before the Big 12 Tournament, Utah fired coach Craig Smith after four seasons with the program. The Utes went 16-17 in their first season in the Big 12 after exiting the Pac-12 last summer.

UCF will face No. 6 seed Kansas in the second round on Wednesday night at 8:30 p.m. ET. UCF lost both meetings against the Jayhawks this season.

After a regular-season series that saw Kansas State steal one from Arizona State on the Sun Devils' home floor and ASU return the favor weeks later in Manhattan, Kansas, the Wildcats got the last laugh to advance into the second round of the Big 12 Tournament.

Kansas State led for the entire of the second half and largely controlled the game thanks to a huge outing from Illinois transfer Coleman Hawkins, who finished with 26 points and eight boards. It marked a season-high for Hawkins, who set the tone early with 19 first-half points after five consecutive outings of nine or fewer points.

K-State moves into the second round where it will face No. 7 seed Baylor on Wednesday night at 7 p.m. ET. Baylor won the previous matchup in January 70-62 in Waco, Texas.

F1 rookie Isack Hadjar has to bounce back after a brutal moment at the Australian Grand Prix

Going to the next play.

Turning the page.

Moving on to Cincinnati.

Being a goldfish.

Those euphemisms, real or fictional, encapsulate one of the most challenging aspects of sports: Moving on from failure. Putting a mistake, an interception, an error, a soft goal, a fumble, or an accident in the past and finding a way to perform better the next chance you get.

That is the challenge facing Formula 1 driver Isack Hadjar as he looks ahead to the Chinese Grand Prix. 

The rookie was slated for his first Formula 1 race, Sunday's Australian Grand Prix, but did not reach the starting grid. Hadjar spun in wet conditions on the formation lap and slid off the racing line, his VCARB02 backing into the barrier and suffering damage to the rear wing. His F1 debut was over before it began.

Hadjar was, as you might expect, despondent once he climbed out of his car. First alongside a race marshall, and then later as he made the long walk from the track to the Visa Cash App Racing Bulls hospitality space at Albert Park. Along the way a pair of senior figures in the sport — Anthony Hamilton (Lewis' father) and F1 President and CEO Stefano Domenicali — spent time with the young driver, trying to console him after a difficult moment.

Ultimately, Hadjar made his way to VCARB's pit wall, where he was enthusiastically greeted by team members with hugs, handshakes, and high-fives. 

After the race, the rookie admitted he was “embarrassed” by his spin on the formation lap.

“I feel embarrassed today, and I can only learn from my mistake and apologize to the team,” said Hadjar in VCARB's post-race report. “There were tricky conditions out there, and from the installation laps, I felt very low grip and poor confidence. 

“In the formation lap, I tried to prepare the tires as much as I could, but unfortunately, I had a spin and the car was unsavable; I just felt like a passenger before hitting the wall. Now I look ahead to be ready to race in China next week.”

Team Principal Laurent Mekies stated that Hadjar would “learn” from the incident, and that the team would be there to support him heading into next weekend.

“As for Isack, he will learn from this and turn his frustration into good energy for the next race,” said Mekies. “We will be here to support him over the next few days before Shanghai and not let this cloud all the positives we can take from this weekend.”

The young driver also talked about the support from Hamilton and Domenicali.

“It means a lot knowing that [Anthony Hamilton] knew where I was, how bad I felt, to go and see me in the worst moment ever,” said Hadjar. “I think it's nice just from him. I really appreciate that. 

“Stefano came into my driver's room and said similar things [to Hamilton],” revealed Hadjar. “It's nice to feel the support from them. It's nice, just nice.”

The harsh reality of sports, much like life, is that failure is all around you. The old baseball phrase of “you can fail seven out of ten times and make the Hall of Fame” is passed down through generations, but stands for the proposition that in sports you are going to fail as an athlete, but what separates the great ones from the good ones is the ability to move on, leave mistakes in the past, learn from errors, and perform better the next time out.

But it is never easy, and never automatic. 

Thankfully for Hadjar, he will be back in the car before he knows it, and that should help him turn the page.

Felipe Nasr maintained his perfect start to the 2025 IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship season, winning the 73rd Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring for Porsche Penske Motorsport's No. 7 963.

Nasr, who co-drives with Nick Tandy and Laurens Vanthoor, won by 2.239 seconds over Porsche Penske No. 6 963 teammate Mathieu Jaminet, who co-drives with Matt Campbell and Kevin Estre.

Just as flawlessly as he handed the closing stint of his second consecutive Rolex 24 at Daytona victory in January, Nasr was in complete control over the last 31 minutes after a final restart.

“It's just incredible,” Nasr told NBC Sports' Kevin Lee. “I'm speechless. What a job the whole team did it today. What a start to the year. We love winning.”

It's the second overall victory at Sebring for team owner Roger Penske and his first since 2008. His Porsche No. 7 963 now has amassed back to back Rolex 24 at Daytona victories, the 2024 Grand Touring Prototype championship and is unbeaten through the first two races this season in the two biggest races on the IMSA calendar.

“It was a team effort, and all the drivers were on their game today,” Roger Penske said. “The Porsche 963 was outstanding. You could see it just got better and better as the weather got cooler. Smart work in the pits, good job, no issues there. Coming in 1-2 here after it's been a long time since we won this race. Just an amazing day.”

Since May 2023, Penske's racing teams have won consecutive Indy 500s, consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championships, consecutive Rolex 24 at Daytona wins, the WEC driver's championship and the 2025 Twelve Hours of Sebring.

In June, Penske's sports car teams will try to fill one of the only voids in “The Captain's” iconic career: A win in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

Nick Yelloly finished third in the Meyer Shank Racing No. 93 Acura ARX-06 that he shares with Renger van der Zande and three-time IndyCar champion Alex Palou. The No. 31 Whelen Action Express Cadillac finished fourth, and the No. 25 BMW M Hybrid V8 rounded out the top five.

The No. 7 took the lead for the final time with just over two hours remaining when Tandy made a sublime pass of Frederik Vesti on the back straightaway.

“Nick did a great pass on the 31 and then it was just about getting ourselves to the front, looking after the tires, the fuel,” Nasr said. “Very challenging race. Sebring delivers it all. It's challenging, it's physical. But incredible for Porsche, for Penske. It's been a while.”

Porsche Penske Motorsport became the first team in the GTP era (dating to 2023) to win consecutive endurance races. The No. 7 963 also became the first lineup to win the “36 Hours of Florida” since Wayne Taylor Racing won the Rolex 24 at Daytona and Twelve Hours of Sebring in 2017.

“This is just awesome,” Tandy said. “We love winning races.”

At Daytona, Tandy became the first sports car driver in history with overall victories in the four major 24-hour races (Daytona, Le Mans, Spa, Nurburgring). With his first overall win at Sebring, the dream season continued for Tandy, who also has won the overall in the Petit Le Mans.

According to IMSA, Tandy is the 10th driver with overall victories in the 24 Hours of Le Mans (2015), Rolex 24 at Daytona (2025) and Twelve Hours of Sebring, joining A.J. Foyt, Hans Herrmann, Jackie Oliver, Al Holbert, Hurley Haywood, Mauro Baldi, Andy Wallace, Marco Werner and Timo Bernhard.

Winners in other categories Saturday at Sebring: 

—LMP2: The No. 43 Inter Europol Competition ORECA LMP2 07 earned its first IMSA class victory as a standalone team. Last year, it earned a victory in a partnership with PR1/Mathiasen Motorsports. The previous best finish for Inter Europol Competition as a standalone team was third in 2020 at Petit Le Mans.

“IMSA is very, very intense, and you can really go from hero to zero in an instant,” Tom Dillmann, who co-drove with Bijoy Garg and Jeremy Clarke, told NBC Sports' Chris Wilner. “It's very intense. My teammate did a great job keeping the car neat for me to push at the end with a really quick car at the night, which is what we planned. And we executed very well. I'm so happy. A loss for words. Team did a great job, and we deserve this.”

—GTD Pro: Porsche earned another victory as the defending series champion No. 77 AO Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R (992) held off Paul Miller Racing and its two BMW M4 GT3 EVOs. It's the fourth IMSA class victory for AO Racing and first in a major endurance race.

“It means so much to me,” Laurin Heinrich, who co-drives with Klaus Bachler and Alessio Picariello, told NBC Sports' Matt Yocum. “Last year, we won the championship and also three races, but we didn't win any of the big endurance classics like Daytona, Sebring or Petit. So now ticking that off the list, it was one of the big goals coming into the season for me. Incredible.”

—GTD: The No. 57 Winward Racing Mercedes-AMG GT3 captured its ninth IMSA class win and second consecutive at Sebring as Philip Ellis pushed past Jack Hawksworth for the lead with 15 minutes remaining. 

“Had to use everything we had — elbows, shoulders, knees — everything,” Ellis, who co-drove with Russell Ward and Indy Dontje, told Wilner. “It was a good battle with Jack. It was very enjoyable. Just super proud of the team after the late penalty and super stoked we did it back to back.”

HBO's third season of “The White Lotus” is underway. A mostly new cast of guests flock to Thailand's Koh Samui to stay at the show's namesake luxury spa and wellness sanctuary. Here, spirituality and a possible whodunnit are served up to loyal fans of the beloved comedy-drama series. 

This season begins similarly to others, with plenty of intrigue, leaving behind a string of mysteries about who died and how. The show opened with gunshots and a dead body, this time floating face down in a lotus pond. 

As storylines are introduced, a surprising theme running throughout this season is the frequent mention of lorazepam, a prescription medication used to treat anxiety and certain types of insomnia.

Victoria Ratliff, played by Parker Posey, whose Southern drawl brings a distinctive ring to the word “lorazepam,” can't seem to get through the day without popping these anti-anxiety pills like candy, sometimes downing them with white wine at dinner.

Her overuse of the pills leaves her slurring her words, zoning out, and dozing off at the dinner table. At one point in episode 4 (which was released on March 9), Victoria's daughter Piper exclaims, “You don't have enough lorazepam to get through one week at a wellness spa?”

In this episode, Victoria's husband Timothy (played by Jason Isaacs) steps into lorazepam misuse territory to cope with a work-related scandal that could ruin his reputation. While attending a yacht party with their three children, he steals Victoria's prescription bottle from her bag, drinks a few glasses of what looks like whiskey and becomes incoherent.

If you're wondering about this drug and whether it's safe for anxiety, read on. We'll break down how the drug is meant to be used, the main risks, and other ways to manage your anxiety.

Lorazepam is the generic name for the prescription medication Ativan. It belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which also include: 

“Lorazepam is a commonly prescribed medication for anxiety. It's also used to treat panic attacks and can be used for insomnia,” said David Merrill, MD, PhD, a geriatric psychiatrist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.

The drug works by slowing the activity in the brain, which promotes relaxation in the body and a reduction in anxious thoughts.

However, “the first-line treatment [for anxiety] is typically antidepressants like SSRIs [antidepressants], plus psychotherapy,” Merrill told Healthline.

“Something like cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based stress reduction — where you get a better understanding of what's driving your anxieties and how to manage the anxiety when it comes up, versus just popping a pill like is done on a TV show.”

Victoria L. Leigh, DO, FACOI, an internal medicine specialist with Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, CA, said in certain cases, benzodiazepines may be used first, such as with anxiety experienced by cancer patients and hospice or palliative care patients.

Lorazepam may also be used for short-term anxiety related to a medical procedure, she said, such as when people experience panic symptoms in the confined space of an MRI machine.

One 2024 meta-analysis of previous studies found that benzodiazepines were more effective than SSRIs at reducing the physical symptoms of anxiety. Both drugs were similarly effective at reducing the psychological symptoms. 

However, because benzodiazepines have more severe side effects, including a risk of dependence, SSRIs are often recommended first for generalized anxiety disorder.

Therapy can also benefit people by teaching them to notice internal physiological sensations such as racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, numbness and tingling. These are a normal part of the body's stress response, said Merrill, not something that is dangerous or harmful.

“If you learn how to counteract those sensations when they come up, whether by taking a deep breath or taking a break from what you are doing, you can keep them from becoming a full-blown panic attack,” Merrill said.

Some people can manage their anxiety without medication, using therapy alone. However, “with more severe cases of anxiety, we see the best outcomes with a combination of meds and therapy, at least over the short-term,” Merrill noted. “Then sometimes people can taper off the medications when their anxiety is under better control.”

When used as prescribed, lorazepam can cause the following side effects:

More serious problems, such as life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma, can occur if lorazepam is used alongside opioid medications such as codeine, oxycodone, and tramadol. 

Drinking alcohol or using certain illegal drugs alongside lorazepam can also increase these risks.

“Benzodiazepines are generally safe when used as directed,” said Merrill, “but they have the potential to be habit forming, so you can become physiologically or psychologically dependent on them.”

People who are using illegal drugs or other substances should not use lorazepam. People with a history of alcohol dependence or abuse should not use lorazepam unless recommended by their doctor.

“Because lorazepam is short-acting, its onset is faster, making addiction more likely,” Leigh told Healthline. In addition, “withdrawals from this medication are more abrupt than the longer-acting medications in this family.”

Once dependence occurs, “if lorazepam is stopped suddenly, withdrawal symptoms can lead to seizures, altered [thoughts], and can be fatal,” she said.

Lorazepam and other benzodiazepines can cause physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms, even when taken as directed. 

The severity of withdrawal symptoms depend upon the dose you are taking, how long you've been taking the drug, other sedating drugs you are taking, and other factors.

Symptoms of withdrawal include:

Merrill said other signs of lorazepam dependence include:

If you are experiencing physical dependence or if you had withdrawal symptoms when you tried to stop taking lorazepam, ask your doctor about tapering your dose. Tapering means taking smaller doses over the course of a few or several weeks until you can safely stop the drug.

To find a psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in substance misuse issues, search the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) database or call SAMHSA's national helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).

Many non-medication options have been shown to help relieve anxiety symptoms. Some of these may include:

“Focusing on exercise can also help to balance the ‘fight or flight' nervous system response that drives anxiety-related feelings,” said Leigh. “Reduction in alcohol consumption and focusing on a balanced diet can also impact the ‘gut-brain axis' and can improve mental health as well.”

For Amanda Armstrong, founder of Rise As We and author of “Healing Through the Vagus Nerve,” the missing link to healing from anxiety is often the autonomic nervous system.

This part of the nervous system controls unconscious processes such as breathing, heartbeat and digestion. It's also in charge of keeping us safe through the body's fight, flight, fawn and freeze responses.

“Understanding the role of the nervous system really shifts the paradigm from ‘I'm broken,' to seeing that your symptoms make sense when put into the context of basic biological needs, your past trauma history, and how that gets stored in your body,” said Armstrong, who is based near Washington, D.C.

When viewed through the lens of the nervous system, anxiety symptoms are a survival response, one that makes sense in the context of the human body and a person's current and past experiences.

Other factors can also contribute to anxiety, such as sleep deprivation, being overstressed or over-caffeinated, suffering from micronutrient deficiencies, or lacking connection to other people and community.

In her practice, Armstrong teaches clients two types of tools for managing their anxiety.

First are tools that people can use in the moment if they are feeling anxious or having a panic attack. This includes visual orienting (slowly looking around your space), biting into a lemon, and certain kinds of breathing.

These help people move up what Armstrong refers to as the autonomic nervous system ladder — away from the sympathetic activation response (also known as fight or flight mode) toward a state of calm and connection.

The other group of tools helps reduce people's anxiety symptoms long-term. Part of this proactive approach is helping people understand what might be contributing to their anxiety symptoms, including: 

Once clients have mapped out these factors, Armstrong asks: “What feels meaningful, and what feels accessible for you to take on right now?”

While Armstrong said there's a time and a place for the use of anti-anxiety medications, she empowers clients by educating them about how their bodies work and giving them tools to manage their anxiety.

This approach can also pave the way for deeper work with a therapist, whether it's talk therapy, shadow work, or somatic parts (aka inner child) work. If the nervous system is well regulated, therapy is often more productive.

Overall, “the approach I use gives you an entire new framework for understanding yourself, and navigating your world and your symptoms in a way that is not associated with brokenness,” Armstrong told Healthline. “There's also more space for compassion and curiosity.”

In Season 3 of the HBO series “The White Lotus,” some characters appear to pop lorazepam like candy. This prescription drug is used to treat anxiety, panic attacks, and insomnia due to anxiety or situational stress.

Studies show that benzodiazepines such as lorazepam are effective for treating both the physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. However, antidepressant SSRIs are more commonly used first because they have a lower risk of severe side effects.

Lorazepam carries a risk of dependence and potential for misuse. This drug can also cause life threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma when used alongside opioid pain relievers, alcohol, or certain illegal drugs.

How old are your organs? The answer might not match your chronological age - and a new analysis finds that an organ's biological age might predict a person's risk of diseases such as cancer, dementia and heart disease.

The research, published in the Lancet Digital Health, analyzed data from Whitehall II, a long-running British study of aging that has followed over 10,000 British adults for more than 35 years. Between 1997 and 1999, the Whitehall study took blood plasma samples from participants when they were 45 to 69 years old.

Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. 

The current study analyzed those blood samples as well as follow-up data for 6,235 Whitehall participants, who were by then ages 65 to 89. The researchers used the analysis to help measure the gap between a person's age and the biological age of nine of their organs: heart, blood vessels, liver, immune system, pancreas, kidneys, lungs, intestines and brain. Then they looked at follow-up data that showed the kinds of diseases participants developed as they aged over the next two decades.

The organs aged at different rates in different people and even within the body, the researchers write - and those with “fast-aging” organs had an increased risk of 30 of the 45 age-related diseases studied.

Some of the associations linked faster aging organs to diseases in that organ; for example, those with accelerated lung aging were likelier to develop respiratory diseases during the 20-year follow-up period.

But in other cases, the link was not as direct. Faster aging of the kidneys, in particular, was linked to diseases of the kidneys and other organs, such as the liver and pancreas, and accelerated aging of multiple organs in the body increased kidney disease risk.

“Surprisingly,” the researchers say, dementia was not best predicted by accelerated brain aging, but rather by the immune system's biological age.

The researchers say the study shows the promise of an organ-specific blood test, which is simpler than past methods.

In a news release, lead author Mika Kivimaki, a professor at University College London's faculty of brain sciences and the study's lead author, says such tests could one day “advise whether a person needs to take better care of a particular organ, and potentially provide an early-warning signal that they may be at risk of a particular disease.”

Jerry Lewis remains one of Hollywood's most influential comedy stars of all time – but the actor and director was also well known for his explosive personality away from the cameras.

Lewis was never afraid to speak his mind when he was unhappy, whether he was beefing with comedy rivals like Joan Rivers or complaining about being snubbed by the Academy Awards. While the comedian was widely recognized as a humanitarian for his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA), his partnership with the charity eventually soured as well near the end of his life. Lewis even managed to hold a grudge from beyond the grave, as he notoriously disinherited his sons and grandchildren from his first marriage to Patti Lewis.

On what would have been Lewis' 99th birthday on March 16, keep scrolling for a look back at some of the comedy legend's most notorious public feuds:

Lewis's personal and professional life was defined by his on-stage partnership with Martin. The pair became one of the world's most successful comedy duos after World War II, starring in 16 movies and selling out live venues across the globe.



Lewis wrote in his 2005 book Dean and Me that the pair started to butt heads at the height of their success over Martin's reluctance to follow his partner's creative guidance. Martin was anxious to pursue solo projects, while Lewis was insistent that they were most successful when working together.

The two stopped speaking around the time of their final live performance at the Copacabana on July 25, 1956 – 10 years to the day after their first-ever performance – and would not reconcile for another 20 years.

Lewis told People in 2002 that he “broke up the act,” which he said “hurt [Dean] desperately.” The pair's mutual friend Frank Sinatra famously organized a surprise reunion for Martin and Lewis on the 1976 MDA Telethon. The old friends briefly appeared together on stage to raise money for Muscular Dystrophy but didn't reprise any of their old routines.

In the biography King of Comedy: The Life and Art of Jerry Lewis, author Shawn Levy wrote that Lewis made “a few overtures” towards reconnecting with Martin after their TV reunion but was ignored. The pair wouldn't speak regularly again until Martin's son, Dean Paul Martin, died in a botched military training flight for the California Air National Guard in 1987.

The comedy icons took plenty of light-hearted jabs at one another throughout their careers, but it turned serious when Rivers publicly criticized Lewis' charity work with MDA. During an appearance on Sirius XM Radio in 2014, Rivers vowed to never perform on the MDA telethon after observing Lewis openly discussing death in front of the children he was raising money for.

“You don't say in front of a little boy who's going to die, ‘This child is going to die,'” Rivers angrily declared. “Who are you? You unfunny, lucky, stupid a–hole? So, he took umbrage!”

Rivers was perhaps underestimating Lewis' reaction, because he accused her of “setting the Jews back 1,000 years.” In his own Sirius XM interview that same year, Lewis said he would “always feel bad when someone passes away except for Joan Rivers.”

“She went to Israel and uprooted two trees in my name,” he joked during an interview with Maria Menounos.

Lewis objected to Rivers's claim that the MDA telethon benefited his sagging career, adding: “I wrote her a note that night. I said: ‘Dear Ms. Rivers, we never met and I'm looking forward to keeping it that way.'”

The pair reportedly never reconciled before Rivers died as a result of complications from a throat procedure in September 2014.

One of Lewis's most iconic movie performances was his dual roles playing neurotic professor Julius Kelp and sinister playboy Buddy Love in 1963's The Nutty Professor. Because Lewis cowrote and produced the comedy classic, Murphy had to get his permission to remake The Nutty Professor in 1996.

Lewis consented to Murphy's remake, though he was disappointed by the film. Murphy spoke in press interviews around the time of The Nutty Professor‘s release about why he only loosely adapted Lewis's original movie.

“The Nutty Professor is the skeleton of the script, and we stripped down the story to its bare bones and built it up to this whole different thing,” Murphy told the Los Angeles Times.

Despite Murphy describing his version of The Nutty Professor as “an homage to Jerry and how brilliant he was,” Lewis told Entertainment Weekly in 2009 that he regretted his involvement in the remake.

“I have such respect for Eddie but I shouldn't have done it,” Lewis insisted. “What I did was perfect the first time around and all you're going to do is diminish that perfection by letting someone else do it. When he had to do fart jokes, he lost me.”

Lewis' reservations aside, The Nutty Professor remake ushered in a career renaissance for Murphy and made a staggering $273 million at the worldwide box office.

In the early 1950s, two comedy duos ruled the roost in Hollywood – Martin and Lewis, and their predecessors Crosby and Bob Hope. All four men came together for a 1952 U.S. Olympics telethon, hosted by Hope and Crosby, where bad blood between the duos came to the surface live on air.

After being introduced, Lewis rushed to the stage and jumped on Hope, kissing him and hugging him in the trademark style of his energetic alter-ego “The Little Boy.” Crosby wanted no part of Lewis's act and immediately left the stage. Lewis and Martin repeatedly called for Crosby to come back so they could continue their planned routine, but the cohost flatly refused.

“He's hiding and I don't blame him,” Hope joked to viewers.

Crosby never explained his live TV walk off, but there was speculation that he was afraid Lewis would pull off his toupee. In a TV interview decades later, Lewis confirmed that he “never spoke to Crosby” again after their telethon debacle.

“That he didn't know me well enough to know I would never do such a thing [as pull off his toupee],” Lewis insisted. “I was so offended by it that, that was '52, in the next eight years, I never talked to Crosby and our dressing rooms were right adjacent to one another.”

Lewis was the public face of the Muscular Dystrophy Association for more than 40 years and host of its annual Labor Day weekend telethon. The charity leaned into its association with the Hollywood superstar by referring to Muscular Dystrophy patients as “Jerry's Kids.”

Throughout their decades of association, Lewis and MDA were criticised by some for using a “pity approach” to generate donations. Disability activists – including a group calling itself Jerry's Orphans – complained about MDA's fundraising tactic, saying it took away the agency of people living with Muscular Dystrophy to depict them as pitiable.

By the 2010s, the professional partnership between Lewis and MDA soured. Lewis famously had to apologize for using a homophobic slur in a joke on the telethon. He also had a history of making controversial statements during the annual show, such as the time he encouraged drug-traffickers in Miami to donate their earnings to MDA in order to absolve their guilty consciences.

In 2011, MDA announced that Lewis was abruptly stepping down from his role within the organization, though neither side offered any explanation as to why. Negotiations took place about Lewis saying goodbye to viewers on that year's telethon, but terms were never reached. MDA declined to mention its long association with Lewis at all in all of the press materials for its telethon in 2012.

Lewis initially stayed silent about his split from MDA, but ultimately made it clear to Time magazine that he was unhappy about the way his departure was handled.

“That's not a place I want to go. Because if I go there, you'll never get me back,” he warned in 2012. “It's not that I don't want to talk about it. But I have already ingested all that I want from that whole f—ing adventure.”

MDA rebranded its yearly televised fundraising drive as its Show of Strength, rather than calling it a telethon, following Lewis's departure. In more recent years, Kevin Hart has become a spokesperson for the group in a role similar to the one Lewis once held.

Lewis had an acrimonious split from first wife Patti in 1980, with a legal war between the former couple carrying on for three years until they finally reached a divorce settlement in 1983. Jerry allegedly had a child with Lynn Dixon Kleinman outside of his marriage in 1952.

Following his divorce, the comic reportedly had a rocky relationship with his and Patti's six sons, especially after he married second wife SanDee Pitnick in 1983. Jerry and SanDee's daughter Danielle was born in 1992 and frequently appeared with her father on his annual MDA telethon.

In 2009, Jerry's youngest son, Joseph Lewis, died by suicide after struggling with addiction throughout his life. Jerry reacted to his son's death five years later by telling The Hollywood Reporter that the tragedy was “unfair.”

“To this day I don't understand it because it's unfair — not unfair to me, but unfair to him,” Lewis said . “That he went that way made the unfairness stupidity. But he was my son and he's gone, and there's not a lot I can do about that. I beat myself a thousand times. Sam will come to me and say, ‘Are we beating ourselves again?' I will say, ‘A little bit.' [She'll say]: ‘You had nothing to do with that. You sent him out into the world when he was 25. You sent what you thought was a perfect human being. What he did with his time away from you is what the end result showed.' But I'll tell you this: You don't get over that.”

Jerry died from heart failure at age 91 in 2017. It was later reported that Jerry's will specifically stated that his sons and their children “shall receive no benefits” from his fortune.

Jerry's son Gary Lewis – a musician who had a Billboard No. 1 hit with “This Diamond Ring” in February 1965 – was quoted saying his father was “never loving and caring” towards his children. However, Jerry and Patti's son Christopher Lewis offered a more positive portrait of life with the comedian in a 2025 interview with Closer.

“I can't tell you how many dinners I sat at that I couldn't eat because I was laughing so hard,” Christopher recalled. “My mom would be so mad at him. She's like, ‘Would you stop and let them eat?' Which would inspire him more to make us laugh.”

The evolving dynamics among the Brown family have been central to the recent season of Sister Wives. Kody Brown has embraced a new identity as a monogamist with Robyn, while his former wives—Janelle, Christine, and Meri—navigate life after their splits. Janelle and Christine have stayed close, building a new sense of family and marking milestones together, like Christine's marriage to David Woolley.

At the same time, unresolved tensions and financial disputes remain between Kody, Robyn and his ex-wives, fueled by differing memories of shared resources and lingering property issues. Amid the personal reinventions and fractures, the family mourns Garrison Brown, Janelle and Kody's late son, highlighting ongoing emotional challenges.

Kody Brown revealed that after three failed marriages he only has eyes for his remaining wife Robyn Brown — but is she OK leaving polygamy behind?

 Janelle Brown and Christine Brown are still a united front after their respective divorces from Kody Brown — but they don't agree when it comes to sex.

Janelle Brown has seemingly turned over a new leaf since her separation from Kody Brown — which means taking shots with BFF Christine Brown is no longer off the table. 

Janelle Brown is taking a second look at her marriage to Kody Brown after their split — including their finances. “I never felt like I had much control over my own money,"" she said.

Christine Brown‘s daughter Ysabel had some reservations about her mom's whirlwind engagement to husband David Woolley. 

Two of the stars from TLC's Sister Wives are revealing the status of their relationship with their other former sister wives. 

Christine Brown is responding to rumors that she and husband David Woolley have called it quits. 

Janelle Brown is paying tribute to her son Garrison one year after his death.

Perhaps love really is in the air for Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas.

In photos published by People on Saturday, March 15, the actors were spotted arriving via helicopter at the London Heliport on Friday evening. Both Cruise, 62, and de Armas, 36, sported casual looks for the outing —the Top Gun star wore black jeans and a brown button-down shirt and Armas rocked a white T-shirt, jeans and white sneakers under a black trench coat.

The pair appeared to be in good spirits, and were seen chatting and laughing with Heliport staff.

Neither Cruise or de Armas have confirmed the nature of their relationship. Us Weekly has reached out to their reps for comment.



The outing comes one month after Cruise and de Armas were initially seen out to dinner over Valentine's Day weekend. The duo were all smiles as they were photographed in the Soho area of London on February 13 — carrying takeout bags and posing for photos with excited fans before hopping in a car together.

After the photos were published, de Armas was asked about her meetup with Cruise during a stroll in Madrid. She declined to answer whether their relationship was personal or work-related, as seen in a video posted by Spanish news agency Europa Press on February 17.

That same day, de Armas was also spotted out with Manuel Anido Cuesta, stepson of Cuban president Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, whom she's been seen with over the last few months. She's yet to comment on the nature of that relationship, too.

The Blonde actress was briefly married to Spanish actor Marc Clotet until 2013 before making headlines for her relationship with Ben Affleck, whom she dated from 2020 to early 2021 after they met on the set of Deep Water. More recently, she was linked to Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis and Cuesta.

Cruise, for his part, has been married three times — to Mimi Rogers from 1987 to 1990, to Nicole Kidman from 1990 to 2001 and to Katie Holmes from 2006 to 2012. He shares adult children Isabella, 32, and Connor, 30, with Kidman, 57, and daughter Suri, 18, with Holmes, 46.

He has also been romantically linked to a handful of Hollywood stars, including Heather Locklear, Penélope Cruz and Hayley Atwell. Most recently, he was reportedly dating Russian socialite Elsina Khayrova.

Us confirmed in December 2023 that Cruise had been quietly seeing Khayrova, 37, for “a while” before they publicly stepped out at a London party that same month. “They're very happy,” the insider shared. “And Tom's extremely confident about it working out for the long term.”

Yet, the pair split shortly after, with a source telling Us in March 2024, “They weren't gelling and realized they weren't romantically compatible.”

Millie Bobby Brown has quite the growing family.

The 21-year-old Stranger Things star, who lives on a farm in Georgia, recently revealed that she owns 62 animals.

""I have 25 farm animals, and then I have 23 foster dogs, and then I have 10 dogs in my house that are my personal dogs, and four cats,"" she told BBC Radio 1.

As far as the dogs who live in the house, she said: ""I have gotten them real single beds.""

Her husband, Jake Bongiovi, set strict rules about the animals and where they sleep, she said.

""Only one is allowed in the bed now because Jake said, 'No more in the bed.'""

The dogs include a rottweiler, a golden retriever, a Great Dane, and ""an 18-year-old blind dachshund called Rigby"" who she found ""left on the side of the road"" and decided to take him in.

""I took him thinking, 'He's not got long left, he's blind, can't find his way through.' Well, this dog is jumping on my couch now. It's found a new lease [on] life,"" Millie said.

""He is thriving. I mean, killing it. Knows the house. I feel like he's becoming unblind. He starts to look around and he knows where the food is and the bedroom is. He's getting really good. I used to call him Rigor Mortis because I really thought he was on his way out. He is nowhere close to death. Let me tell you, this dog is — he is killing it.""

She's got at least one more coming: ""My donkey is pregnant. Betsy and Bernard got together, had a great night out, and now she's preggers.""

Millie also said the donkeys don't get along with her dogs.

""They will kill a dog if they see a dog. The reason I got them is because I get coyotes, so I got a donkey to deter the coyotes from eating my little dogs,"" she said. 

""I have two donkeys, and one day I went out and Betsy was just — she had a very big stomach, and I got my ultrasound machine out and I saw ribs, and they weren't Betsy's.""

James Van Der Beek is opening up about his cancer battle.

The 48-year-old Dawson's Creek alum spoke out about his battle with Stage 3 colorectal cancer in a post on social media.

In the post, he explained how it also affected his marriage to Kimberly Van Der Beek as well as the lives of their six kids—Olivia, 14, Joshua, 13, Annabel, 11, Emilia, 8, Gwendolyn, 6, Jeremiah, 2.

""Today's my birthday, and it has been the hardest year of my life,"" he explained.

""When I was younger, I used to define myself as an actor...which was never really all that fulfilling. And then I became a husband, and that was much better. And then I became a father, and that was the ultimate,"" he said.

""I could define myself then as a loving, capable, strong, supportive husband, father, provider, steward of the land that we're so lucky to live on. And for a long time, that felt like a really good definition to the question, 'Who am I? What am I?' And then this year, I had to look my own mortality in the eye.""

""I had to come nose to nose with death,"" he continued. 

""And all of those definitions that I cared so deeply about were stripped from me. I was away for treatment, so I could no longer be a husband that was helpful to my wife. I could no longer be a father who could pick up his kids and put them to bed and be there for them. I could not be a provider because I wasn't working.""

James said he ""couldn't even be a steward of the land"" because he would sometimes be too weak to prune trees.

""As I move through this healing portal toward recovery, I wanted to share that with you because I think that revelation that came to me was due in no small part to all the prayers and the love that had been directed toward me. So I offer that to you, however it sits in your consciousness, however it resonates—run with it.""

""And so I was faced with the question,"" he continued, ""If I am just a too-skinny, weak guy alone in an apartment with cancer, what am I?""

""I meditated and the answer came through,"" he said. 

""I am worthy of God's love, simply because I exist. And if I'm worthy of God's love, shouldn't I also be worthy of my own? And the same is true for you.""

He added: ""And if the word 'God' trips you up, I certainly don't know, I can't claim to know what God is or explain God. My efforts to connect to God are an ongoing process that is a constant unfolding mystery to me. But if it's a trigger, it feels too religious, you can take the word 'God' out and your mantra can simply be, 'I am worthy of love.' Because you are.""

""Thank you for the love and prayers, everyone. Have a blessed day,"" he concluded.

We are wishing the best to James and his family. 

It was also revealed that he was selling items to pay for his expensive cancer treatment.

Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot hit the red carpet at the LA premiere of their movie Snow White held at El Capitan Theater on Saturday (March 15) in Hollyweood. 

The 23-year-old and the 39-year-old actresses star as Snow White and Evil Queen, respectively, and were both seen meeting young girls dressed as the titular character.

Also in attendance were their co-stars Martin Klebba (Grumpy), Jason Kravits (Sneezy), George Salazar (Happy), Andrew Grotelueschen (Sleepy), Emilia Faucher (Young Snow White), Lorena Andrea (Good Queen), Dujonna Gift (Maple) and Idris Kargbo (Bingley), as well as director Marc Webb, producer Marc Platt, songwriters Justin Paul and Benj Pasek, Disney stars Joshua Colley and Malachi Barton, Rachel Bloom, David Dastmalchian and Japanese boy band JO1.

The premiere also welcomed children from the San Fernando and Malibu chapters of Boys & Girls Club who were affected by recent fires in Los Angeles.

Michelle Obama is addressing the rumors about Barack Obama.

The 61-year-old former First Lady of the United States spoke about her 60-year-old husband and former President of the United States in a live taping of her IMO with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson podcast.

During the episode, she addressed ""negative energy,"" ""gossip,"" and speculation regarding their marriage.

“People always ask me and Barack, how did we stay hopeful in, not just the eight years that we were in the White House, but beyond?” she said.

“Because, let me tell you, there was a lot of negative energy flipping our way — a lot of rumors, a lot of gossip, a lot of, you know, my husband wasn't born in this country … we weren't patriotic, he didn't get into Harvard.”

“But through it all, what kept us sane — and we tried to instill this in our daughters — is, you cannot live through social media,” she said, adding that she's fairly sure she's never “once looked at a comment section.”

“Don't let that negative energy enter into your space. These are people who don't know you. A lot of this stuff is made up, and it does not feed you,” she continued.

“That doesn't mean you don't stay informed, but staying informed has nothing to do with the comment section. It has everything to do with the content of the stories that you take in,"" Michelle said.

She added that she feels it's not helpful for people to get “so trapped by social media that we feel so caught up into the one way we get information.”

“We've got to broaden our spectrum, and we have to get off the phone,” Michelle concluded.

Jack Quaid's Novocaine is No. 1 at the box office - but the numbers aren't great for the movie industry overall.

In its opening weekend, the movie brought in $8.7 million, via Variety.

This marks one of the worst debuts to still go to No. 1 spot, at least since the days of the pandemic.

In fact, this weekend was among the year's lowest grossing to date, with roughly $54 million across all films, according to the report.

Novocaine also opened behind $10 million to $12 million projections from 3,365 North American theaters. 

That said, the movie only cost $18 million to make before marketing. It's earned a “B” grade on CinemaScore and an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

In the film, when the girl of his dreams (Amber Midthunder) is kidnapped, everyman Nate (Quaid) turns his inability to feel pain into an unexpected strength in his fight to get her back.

Meghan Markle is facing a lot of criticism.

Her lifestyle series ""With Love, Meghan"" was widely panned and both that show and her upcoming podcast ""Confessions of a Female Founder"" have faced accusations of stealing names and ideas.

After Markle announced the podcast – her second after her Spotify podcast ""Archetypes"" was canceled after one season – on her Instagram this week, people were quick to pile on, noting its name is very similar to several others that are lesser known.

""Maybe you would like to know, Meghan Markle has ripped off another woman's podcast called ‘confessions of a CEO,'"" one user wrote on X. ""A simple Google search would help Meghan.""

Another user found a second woman posting videos on YouTube under the exact name, ""Confessions of a Female Founder."" ""Stealing ideas again,"" the user wrote on X.

However, ""Confessions of a Female Founder"" YouTuber Kady Méite is defending the duchess.

""I completely understand why people are drawing connections, and I truly appreciate the support and understand their intention,"" Méite told Yahoo Lifestyle on Thursday, ""but I also understand coincidences as well. It is highly unlikely Meghan even came across my channel, but I am flattered by the thought.""

She went further to say: ""What does concern me is how quickly this is turning into another reason to drag a woman down. That's not something I want to contribute to. I know firsthand what it feels like to have my work actually copied...this isn't that.""

The Duchess of Sussex's new podcast will premiere April 8.

""I'm so excited to share with you something else I've been working on: ‘Confessions of a Female Founder,' my new podcast with @lemonadamedia!"" Markle wrote on her newly-created Instagram also on Thursday where she has been promoting her new media ventures, including her lifestyle brand ""As Ever,"" which has also faced accusations of copying its logo.

She continued, ""I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities, and scaled small ideas into massively successful businesses. They're opening up, sharing their tips, tricks (and tumbles), and letting me pick their brains as I build out my own business, As ever. It has been absolutely eye-opening, inspiring…and fun! (Because what's the point if we can't have some fun on this wild adventure?)""

The duchess also confirmed a week ago – despite bad reviews from critics – that ""With Love, Meghan,"" has been renewed for a second season on Netflix.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently shared his thoughts on various global issues and his relationships with other world leaders in a podcast interview with American scientist Lex Fridman.

One of the key topics he discussed was his bond with former US President Donald Trump, highlighting their mutual trust and shared commitment to prioritising their respective national interests.

He praised Mr Trump's dedication to America, describing him as ""unwavering"" and admiring his resilience in the face of adversity. ""Even after being shot, he remained unwaveringly dedicated to America. His life was for his nation. This showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in nation first - India first,"" Mr Modi said.

He also commended Mr Trump's humility, citing his gesture of sitting in the audience during the 'Howdy Modi' event in 2019. ""That's his humility,"" he added. He further expressed his admiration for Mr Trump's clear vision and roadmap for his second term as President.

The Prime Minister also reflected on his visit to the White House, where Mr Trump broke protocol by personally giving him a tour. ""He personally took me on a tour of the White House,"" he said. Despite not having met in person for years, he emphasised that their communication and trust remained strong.

When asked about Mr Trump's comment that Mr Modi is a better negotiator, he attributed it to Mr Trump's graciousness and humility. ""He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals,"" he said on Mr Trump's second term as President. He stressed that his approach to negotiation always prioritises India's interests.

In addition to discussing his relationship with Mr Trump, he also addressed the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He reiterated India's stance that the war can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation between Ukraine and Russia. He emphasised that he has a close relationship with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and that he would advise them to prioritise diplomacy.

""I can sit with President Putin and say it's not the time for war. I can tell President Zelenskyy in a friendly way that brother, regardless of how many people stand with you in the world, there will never be a resolution on the battlefield,"" he said.

Furthermore, he discussed the importance of strengthening relations between India and China. He emphasised that competition between the two nations should not lead to conflict, and that dialogue is essential for building a stable and cooperative relationship. Mr Modi highlighted the deep cultural connections between India and China, noting that the two nations have learned from each other for centuries and have contributed significantly to global growth.

""If you look at historical records, for centuries, India and China have learned from each other. Together, they have always contributed to the global good in some way. Old records suggest that at one point, India and China alone accounted for more than 50 per cent of the world's GDP. That's how massive India's contribution was. And I believe our ties have been extremely strong, with deep cultural connections,"" he said.

Mr Modi acknowledged the border disputes between India and China but expressed optimism about the future of their relationship. He noted that his recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping has led to a return to normalcy at the border, and that efforts are underway to restore conditions to how they were before 2020.

""After my recent meeting with President Xi, we have seen a return to normalcy at the border. We are now working to restore conditions to how they were before 2020. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm, and energy will return,"" he said.

Mr Modi's podcast interview with Lex Fridman provided valuable insights into his relationships with other world leaders, his approach to global issues, and his vision for India's role in the world. His emphasis on dialogue, cooperation, and mutual respect highlights the importance of diplomacy in resolving conflicts and promoting global stability.

As he emphasised, ""Our focus is to ensure that these differences don't turn into disputes. That's what we actively work toward. Instead of discord, we emphasise on dialogue. Because it is only through dialogue, that we can build a stable, cooperative relationship that serves the best interests of both the nations."" ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

 Power was slowly being restored across most of Cuba on Sunday, after nearly 40 hours without electricity, in the island's fourth major blackout in six months. 

 Lazaro Guerra, director of the island's Energia Electrica utility, said the Cuban power grid was now again ""interconnected"" from the western port of Mariel, some 30 miles from Havana, to Guantanamo province in the far east. 

 Power had yet to be restored, however, in part of western Cuba. 

 The authorities said the system was generating 935 megawatts of power nationwide on Sunday, well below the normal daily demand of 3,000 MW. 

 In Havana, a city of 2.1 million, just 19 percent of homes had regained power. 

 Some Cubans were awakened early Sunday by the sounds attending a restoration of power. 

 ""At 5 am, there was a tremendous rush, charging phones, lamps, pumping water into tanks a tremendous uproar waking up the neighbors,"" Alex Picart, a 60-year-old resident of Guanabacoa, just east of Havana, told AFP. 

 Cubans have grown resigned to frequent outages including blackouts ranging anywhere from four hours to 20 hours or more. 

 But the constant disruptions are exhausting, they say, as outages cut off water and gas supplies as well as phone communications, and can virtually paralyze public transit. 

 ""No elevator, no water, it's awful. I feel cornered, very annoyed,"" said Ruben Borroto, 69, who has to walk up seven floors to his Havana apartment. 

 The latest blackout began Friday with a failure at a substation in a Havana suburb, then spread across the island. 

 Cuba had seen three other major outages in the past half-year. 

 The island is suffering through its fourth year of economic crisis, and its eight thermal power plants, nearly all dating to the 1980s or 1990s, regularly fail. 

 Floating power barges and a series of generators shore up the national power system, but the US embargo makes it difficult to import fuel. 

 The government is rushing to install at least 55 solar parks this year enough, it says, to supply 12 percent of national demand.

 Pope Francis acknowledged being fragile and ""facing a period of trial"", as he thanked well-wishers Sunday for prayers in a message from hospital, where he has been slowly recovering from pneumonia. 

 The 88-year-old pope, who has weathered setbacks along with periods of improving health since being hospitalised on February 14, sent a particularly personal message to the faithful that referenced both his faith and his frailty. 

 ""I am sharing these thoughts with you while I am facing a period of trial, and I join with so many brothers and sisters who are sick: fragile, at this time, like me,"" wrote the pope in the message published by the Vatican. 

 ""Our bodies are weak but, even like this, nothing can prevent us from loving, praying, giving ourselves, being for each other, in faith, shining signs of hope,"" added the Argentine pontiff in the message marking the second Sunday of Lent, a 40-day period of prayer and reflection leading up to Easter. 

 Sunday was the fifth time in a row that the pope's illness had prevented him from personally giving the Angelus prayer, usually delivered to a crowd gathered in St Peter's Square following mass. 

 Although Francis has yet to appear at the window of his papal suite on the 10th floor of the Gemelli hospital, this has not dissuaded a steady stream of well-wishers from gathering, including tango dancers and dozens of children on Sunday. 

 Under grey skies, about a dozen couples in street clothes danced the tango in front of a throng of cameras as the Argentine pontiff recuperated inside. 

 ""With this tango, he must be discharged,"" enthused dancer Daiana Guspero, 38, who like the pope hailed from Buenos Aires. 

 ""I want him to feel our energy, our love for tango and for an Argentine pope,"" she told AFP. 

 Earlier, a group of young scouts from a Catholic group stood at the foot of a statue of former Pope John Paul II at the hospital entrance, holding yellow and white balloons and vainly striving to catch a glimpse of the pope. 

 ""You see the pope there!"" shouted one of them eagerly, before being set straight by the group leader, Valerio Santobonio, 23: ""I don't think that's him."" 

 Santobonio told AFP the five to seven-year-olds don't quite yet grasp who the pope is, nor his health situation. 

 Nevertheless, their visit was ""a bit like giving them a window onto a wider stage of Christian life,"" Santobonio said. 

 Other children had arrived in the early morning from an impoverished town near Naples to deliver a letter to Francis, said Andrea Lacomini from UNICEF, which organised the excursion. 

 ""He loves children, he is the pope of the children, so we are waiting for him. We're sure he will get better,"" Lacomini told AFP. 

 ""We need an important leader like him, because at this time there aren't many heroes in the world,"" he added. 

 ""He's the only one who talks about peace."" 

 Despite failing to appear at the window, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message. 

 ""I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to 'Gemelli' as a sign of closeness,"" Francis wrote. 

 ""Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you.""

 Last week the Vatican signalled that Francis was out of immediate danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for the Jesuit's life. 

 On Saturday, the Vatican said his condition continued to be stable and showing progress, but cautioned that he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting. 

 ""The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements,"" it said. 

 That message appeared to quash speculation that the pope's progress could signal an imminent release from hospital. 

 Although the Vatican has said he continues to work from his hospital suite when able, Francis's absence is particularly felt as Easter approaches, the holiest period in the Christian calendar just five weeks away. 

 The head of the world's nearly 1.4 billion Catholics traditionally presides over a busy programme of events during the period, including a Good Friday evening procession and Easter mass in St Peter's Square before tens of thousands of faithful. 

 In his written message Sunday which also called for peace in war-torn countries including Ukraine, Myanmar and Sudan Francis once again thanked his caretakers and those who have been praying for him. 

 ""How much light shines, in this sense, in hospitals and places of care! How much loving care illuminates the rooms, the corridors, the clinics, the places where the humblest services are performed!"" he wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news","Thousands Show Support For Coup-Accused Bolsonaro At Rio Rally","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/thousands-show-support-for-coup-accused-bolsonaro-at-rio-rally-7938299","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 17:57:58 GMT","

Several thousand supporters of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro packed Copacabana beach in Rio on Sunday to show their backing for the right-wing firebrand, who is accused of attempting to overthrow his left-wing successor.

Bolsonaro, 69, has called for a million-strong demonstration on the famous beach in a show of strength ahead of elections next year in which he hopes to be a contender.

Brazil's 2019-2022 president is hoping to emulate US President Donald Trump's political comeback.

""I am here because I want to leave a better Brazil for my children. We are living in a dark time,"" 64-year-old former military officer Jose de Souza Vitorino, who was among the demonstrators, told AFP.

On the stage, where Bolsonaro was due to give a speech, a banner showed Trump with his fist raised following the attempt on his life on the campaign trail last year in Pennsylvania.

The rally's stated purpose is to demand amnesty for hundreds convicted over the January 8, 2023 riots in the capital Brasilia, when Bolsonaro backers stormed the presidential palace, Congress and Supreme Court.

The demonstrators demanded that the military oust leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who had defeated arch-rival Bolsonaro in the October 2022 elections and had been sworn in just a week earlier.

The violent rampage evoked the storming of the US Capitol building in Washington by Trump's supporters almost exactly two years earlier.

Prosecutors believe the riots were part of a criminal plot hatched by the then-former president Bolsonaro to overthrow Lula and return to power.

On March 25, Brazil's Supreme Court will consider whether there is sufficient evidence to try Bolsonaro, who risks a prison term of more than 40 years.

'Send a message'

Dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics,"" Bolsonaro -- like his political muse -- claims to be the victim of political persecution aimed at excluding him from seeking a second term in 2026 presidential elections.

He has been declared ineligible to hold public office until 2030 for having made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in Brazil's electronic voting system, but is hoping to have the ban overturned to make a Trump-like comeback.

Independent political analyst Andre Rosa told AFP the real purpose of calling for protests Sunday was so Bolsonaro can ""send a message to his competitors on the right... and reaffirm his intention to be a candidate in 2026.""

""For now, I am a candidate,"" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia this week.

There are also continuity concerns in Lula's camp, with worry over the 79-year-old president's health and his popularity dragged down by consumer inflation.

A fire tore through a nightclub in North Macedonia early Sunday, killing 59 people, apparently after on-stage fireworks set the venue ablaze, authorities said, announcing arrest warrants for four people.They said 155 injured people had been taken to hospitals across the country, 18 of them in critical condition. Some of the serious cases were to be taken to other European countries for treatment.

The blaze started in the Club Pulse in the eastern town of Kocani around 3:00 am (0200 GMT), as the place was packed with more than 1,000 mostly young fans attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo called DNK.

""Initially we didn't believe there was a fire. Then there was huge panic in the crowd and a stampede to get out,"" one young woman who was at the concert told local media outside a hospital in the capital Skopje.

Fire crews and paramedics responded quickly and ""tried to resuscitate people... but it wasn't enough"", said the woman, who was waiting outside for one of her friends, who was being treated for burns to his hand.

The fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices ""used for light effects at the concert"", said Interior Minister Pance Toskovski, who visited the scene with Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski.

""Sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke,"" Toskovski said.

The interior ministry announced that arrest warrants had been issued for four people in relation to the tragedy, and a criminal investigation opened. They did not immediately give further details about those targeted by the warrants.

""According to the information that we have, there are 59 persons dead of which 35 are identified. Of the identified, 31 persons are from Kocani and four from Stip,"" Toskovski said.

""The number of wounded, according to latest information up to noon (1100 GMT), is 155 persons who are in hospitals across the country,"" Toskovski said.

""Preparations are being made to transport people seriously injured in the fire in Kocani to top hospitals in several European countries,"" the head of North Macedonia's Crisis Centre, Stojanche Angelov, said.

The head of the Kocani hospital, Kristina Serafimovska, told media that the patients being treated there were aged between 14 and 25.

""Seventy of the patients have burns and carbon monoxide poisoning,"" she said.

One of the members of the DNK duo that had performed, Vladimir Blazev, had burns to his face and needed assistance breathing, his sister told local media outlets.

- 'Very sad day' -

""This is a difficult and very sad day"" for the country, Prime Minister Mickoski wrote on his Facebook account.

""The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the grief of their families, their loved ones and their friends is immeasurable,"" he said.

Pope Francis sent prayers to the victims and survivors and wished ""the families of the dead, mostly young people, the expression of his deep condolence, signifying spiritual closeness to the wounded"", the Vatican said in a message addressed to the bishop of Skopje, Kiro Stojanov.

Videos posted on social networks and shot before the fire showed the use of ""stage fountains"", which are a type of indoor fireworks used during performances.

Other videos published by media showed huge flames emerging from the building, a two-storey white structure in Kocani, a town with 30,000 residents.

An AFP photographer in the town saw military medical vehicles arrive to reinforce staff at the local hospital tending to some of the injured.

Leaders of neighbouring countries offered help.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Rossen Jeliazkov spoke on Facebook of the fire being ""a huge human tragedy"" and offered to have his air force fly some of those injured to medical facilities in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and the city of Varna.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on X, formerly Twitter, that he sent ""heartfelt condolences to the people of North Macedonia for the lives lost in the tragic fire"".

""Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time,"" he added.

Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said he was ""at a loss for words"" and expressed readiness ""to provide any assistance that may be needed"".

There were also messages from parts of the European Union, which North Macedonia has ambitions to join.

The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said on X that she was ""deeply saddened about the tragic fire"" and that ""the EU shares the grief and pain of the people of North Macedonia"".

The creation of a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" in the United States is further proof of President Donald Trump's support for the cryptocurrency sector.

Trump earlier this month signed an executive order establishing the reserve, which White House crypto chief David Sacks has likened to ""a digital Fort Knox"", comparing it to the stockpiling of gold bars at the US military base.

Gold is held in reserves by countries worldwide as the metal is seen as a safe-haven asset, protecting against financial instability such as high inflation.

The metal on Friday surpassed $3,000 per ounce for the first time, boosted by an uncertain economic outlook amid Trump's tariffs.

Gold reserves can help also stabilise a country's currency, while bars are used as collateral for loans and transactions.

How will US bitcoin reserve work?

It is to be funded by about 200,000 bitcoins, worth around $17 billion in total, that have been seized in the United States as a result of civil and criminal cases.

The reserve will be virtually secured for an indefinite time.

Additional bitcoin can be added to the reserve as long as such action is ""budget-neutral"", thus not costing the taxpayer.

Announcement fails to impress

The price of bitcoin initially slid after Trump signed the executive order but has since stabilised.

Analysts have blamed the lack of support on a failure to immediately buy more bitcoin.

Dessislava Aubert, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, told AFP that ""legally"" the US government must return bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack.

According to Aubert, ""a big chunk"" of the bitcoin held by the United States -- estimated at around 198,000 tokens -- would have to be returned to victims of a hack at crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016.

Sector watchers are also waiting to see if other digital tokens will be added to the reserve, which is possible according to the executive order.

Trump has said that bitcoin's nearest rival, ether, along with three other tokens -- XRP, Solana and Cardano -- could be added.

Reason to copy gold reserve?

Critics of the US bitcoin reserve point out that, unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are risky assets and have no intrinsic value.

However, Sacks believes that by storing bitcoin over time, the government would protect itself from the cryptocurrency's massive short-term volatility.

Meanwhile, Stephane Ifrah, an investment director at crypto platform Coinhouse, said that bitcoin, like gold, can profit from its rarity thanks to a limited 21 million tokens.

An advantage of the bitcoin reserve is its transparency, since the level of tokens will be known at all times -- unlike the amount of gold placed in Fort Knox.

Additionally, with the bitcoin reserve, ""we're dealing with a rare asset that's much more suited to today's world"", Ifrah told AFP.

Prominent cryptocurrency critic, Molly White, believes the ""true reason"" for the reserve ""is a way to drive interest in the crypto industry"", which could financially benefit investors.

Trump has been accused by some of showing a conflict of interest, having vowed ahead of being elected to make the United States the ""bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world"".

The Financial Times reported that Trump earned $350 million from launching a meme coin, $TRUMP, to coincide with his inauguration.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Trump family discussed acquiring a possible stake in the Binance platform -- a report denied by the crypto exchange's founder.

Other country plans

Brazil is also considering the creation of a cryptocurrency reserve, an idea recently ruled out by the Swiss central bank.

Governments around the world are partaking in cryptocurrency activity, notably by selling digital assets seized in court cases, as was the case in Germany last year with 50,000 bitcoins.

El Salvador made bitcoin one of its official currencies, reversing the decision this year owing to a lack of take-up by citizens.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke on Saturday to discuss the next stage in talks on ending Moscow's war against Ukraine.

According to State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, the top diplomats ""agreed to continue working towards restoring communication between the United States and Russia.""

The statement gave no details on when the next round of US-Russia talks, which are being hosted by Saudi Arabia, would begin.

Rubio also updated Lavrov on military activity in the Middle East, where US forces carried out deadly strikes Saturday against Huthi rebel targets in Yemen, the statement said.



Despite recent tensions between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, Kyiv has agreed in principle to a US-brokered 30-day unconditional ceasefire if Moscow halts its attacks in eastern Ukraine.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin has not however agreed to any truce, instead setting conditions that were beyond what was called for in the US agreement with Ukraine.

 US officials on Sunday vowed further strikes in Yemen until the Huthi rebels decide to end their attacks on Red Sea shipping, while also threatening action against the group's backer Iran. 

 In a wave of strikes on Saturday, the first against the rebel group since US President Donald Trump returned to office in January, several Huthi leaders were killed, the White House said. 

 The airstrikes ""actually targeted multiple Huthi leaders and took them out,"" National Security Advisor Michael Waltz told ABC News. 

 He added that the United States ""will hold not only the Huthis accountable, but we're going to hold Iran, their backers, accountable as well."" 

 ""And if that means their targeting ships that they have put in to help, their Iranian trainers... other things that they have put in to help the Huthis attack the global economy, those targets will be on the table too."" 

 In a separate appearance on Fox News, he said the strikes ""put Iran on notice that enough is enough."" 

 The US strikes killed at least 31 people and wounded 101, the Yemeni rebel group's health ministry said Sunday. 

 The Tehran-backed group, who have controlled much of Yemen for more than a decade, staunchly oppose Israel and the United States and say the shipping attacks are in protest of Israel's war in Gaza. 

 The Huthis have launched scores of drone and missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the outbreak of the war, which was spurred by the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. 

 US warships have been attacked 174 times and commercial vessels 145 times since 2023, according to the Pentagon, putting a major strain on a sea route that normally carries about 12 percent of world shipping traffic. 

 Trump, in a lengthy Truth Social post Saturday announcing the latest attacks, warned Huthi leaders that ""YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!"" 

 Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth echoed that message Sunday, vowing an ""unrelenting"" missile campaign until the Huthi attacks stop. 

 ""I want to be very clear, this campaign is about freedom of navigation and restoring deterrence,"" Hegseth said in a televised Fox Business interview. 

 ""The minute the Huthis say, 'We'll stop shooting at your ships, we'll stop shooting at your drones,' this campaign will end. But until then, it will be unrelenting."" 

 Yemen has seen over a decade of civil war, with the Huthis controlling the capital Sanaa since 2014. 

 Hegseth, in blunt terms, said the United States was not seeking to get involved in a long Middle East war. 

 ""We don't care what happens in the Yemeni civil war,"" he said. 

 ""This is about stopping the shooting at assets in that critical waterway, to reopen freedom of navigation, which is a core national interest of the United States."" 

 Trump last month sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei proposing nuclear talks and saying that in the absence of a deal the matter could be handled ""militarily."" 

 Tehran chafed at that suggestion, saying it would not negotiate while being ""threatened."" 

 Waltz, in his ABC interview, said flatly: ""Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one."" 

 He added: ""They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences, but either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button.""

 Major-General Andriy Hnatov named chief of the general staff 

 * 

 Replaces Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Barhilevych

 Defence Minister says Ukraine consistently changing armed forces 

 * 

 Says aim is to make military even more combat ready 

 By Olena Harmash 

 KYIV, - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday appointed Major-General Andriy Hnatov as Ukraine's chief of the general staff as Kyiv seeks to speed up army reform. 

 A decree published on the presidential website said General Hnatov, a deputy chief of staff, would replace Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Barhilevych. 

 ""We are consistently changing the armed forces to make them even more combat ready. To achieve it, we are changing the management system and introducing clear standards,"" Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in a statement. 

 Hnatov has 27 years of military experience, having risen through the ranks from marines brigade commander to leading troops in the eastern Donetsk region. 

 Barhilevych would now oversee military standards and strengthen discipline in the army, the minister said. 

 With the war against Russia in its fourth year, Ukraine is seeking to restructure and strengthen its military as it fights the much bigger enemy. 

 Ukraine is on the back foot on the battlefield, with Kyiv's troops retreating from Russia's Kursk region and battling under growing pressure in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been advancing for months. 

 Military analysts estimate that about 880,000 people currently serve in the Ukrainian armed forces. 

 Despite the wartime challenges, the country has implemented changes to shed the Soviet legacy and make its military more efficient, appointing younger commanders with combat experience and supporting innovations. Last year Ukraine introduced a dedicated unmanned systems force. 

 At the start of this year, Ukrainian military officials said the country would move away from its brigades-based system towards a ""corps"" system of larger units, aiming to improve coordination among its forces spread along more than 1,000 kilometers of frontline and speed up decision-making. 

 One of Ukraine's top fighting units - the 3rd separate assault brigade - announced on Friday that it was reorganized into a corps. 

 ""We plan to change the principles and methods of this war,"" Commander Andriy Biletskyi said in a video announcing the change. ""This means changing the course of the war in favour of Ukraine.""

The salubrious environs of New Delhi's diplomatic landscape, where many subtle messages are exchanged in quiet diplomatic niceties, are suddenly abuzz with something much more direct - and the Russian embassy isn't shy about amplifying it. 

With prominent hoardings splashed across Lutyens' Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin's faces stand side by side, proclaiming: ""India-Russia: Driving Global Change."" 

Displayed in English, Hindi, and Russian, the message is impossible to miss.

The timing is no coincidence. As the Raisina Dialogue - India's significant multilateral conference - takes centre stage, these larger-than-life images push a real-life account of a partnership that has stood the test of time. One that perhaps feels pointed, given the anticipated presence of Ukraine's foreign minister. With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war looming large in the backdrop, these displays are more than just routine showmanship.

What's interesting to watch is how the Russia-US relationship will unfold in the coming months. With US President Donald Trump - some would say a pragmatist on Russia - pursuing a drastically different policy from the previous administration, global geopolitics is being keenly observed. The Raisina Dialogue is sure to focus on that.

At the same time, the US has been signaling to New Delhi to distance itself from Moscow. In the backdrop of shifting US politics, what happens next in Russia-India-US ties is something many will keenly watch.

Adding to the mix is Russia Today - Moscow's media arm - actively promoting its perspective. The Russian embassy in India has also posted for RT while extending Holi wishes, further reinforcing the message and ensuring that the narrative of India-Russia solidarity resonates loud and clear.

Decades of trusted friendship epitomised across #NewDelhiThese colours signify 🇷🇺🇮🇳 friendship — Happy Holi, India! https://t.co/hMwPiymlFw

In a world shaped by shifting alliances, Delhi's streets seem to say: Pay attention - not just to what's happening, but to how it's being framed for public consumption. The display is as important as, perhaps even more so, than the content itself.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Nightclub fire in North Macedonia kills 59, injures over 100

Fire ripped through a packed nightclub early on Sunday in the North Macedonian town of Kocani, killing 59 people and injuring more than 100, after sparks ignited the roof over a live band.

Arrest warrants have been issued for four people in connection with the fire, said Interior Minister Panche Toshkovski. State news agency Mia said police have detained the owner of the club over the incident.

One video from the event, verified by Reuters, showed a band playing on stage flanked by two flares firing white sparks into the air, some of which set the ceiling alight.

The fire caused immediate panic, and friends and loved ones were separated as people fled to the exits.

""Everyone was trying to save themselves,"" survivor Marija Taseva, 22, told local TV 5.

As she tried to escape, Taseva fell to the ground and people ran over her, leaving her with an injury on her cheek. In the rush, she lost contact with sister, who is still missing.

""We can't find her in any hospital,"" she said.

Health Minister Arben Taravari said 148 people were hospitalized in Skopje, Kocani and surrounding towns. Eighteen people were critically injured, Taravari said.

North Macedonia's MRT public broadcaster reported that 27 people were hospitalized at the Skopje City Hospital with severe burns, and another 23 were being treated at a clinical centre. Among the injured were minors, it said.

The fire, which began at about 3 a.m., was caused by ""pyrotechnic devices"" whose sparks triggered the blaze, Toshkovski said.

Ljupco Kocevski, North Macedonia's public prosecutor, said five prosecutors would investigate the incident.

""At the moment, orders have been issued for collecting of evidence"" and some people were being interviewed, Kocevski said, without elaborating.

Firefighters doused the charred and smoking entrance to the Pulse nightclub, as ambulances rushed from the scene, TV footage from a local broadcaster showed. Reuters pictures showed the club's corrugated iron roof burned through and collapsed in places, its interior wooden beams exposed and blackened.

Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski said on Facebook: ""This is a difficult and very sad day for Macedonia! The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, the pain of the families, loved ones and friends is immeasurable.""

After visiting injured in a hospital in Skopje, North Macedonian President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, dressed in black and fighting tears, said authorities were ready to do everything to help all affected.

""I simply cannot comprehend this ... what a disaster, what a tragedy.""

A pair of astronauts stranded for more than nine months on the International Space Station were a step closer to returning home Sunday after a replacement crew docked with the orbital outpost.

The astronauts were shown on live TV embracing and hugging their counterparts in zero gravity on the space station shortly after their SpaceX Crew Dragon arrived at 0545 GMT.

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have been stuck aboard the ISS since June after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed unfit to fly them back to Earth.

William said it was a ""wonderful day"" and ""great to see our friends arrive,"" speaking shortly after her colleges emerged onto the orbital lab.

Footage posted online by NASA astronaut Don Pettit showed the Crew Dragon vehicle approaching the ISS as it orbited the Earth.

The NASA duo's Starliner had returned to Earth empty, without experiencing further major issues -- leaving them stuck for nine months after what was meant to have been a days-long roundtrip.

Their prolonged stay was significantly longer than the standard ISS rotation for astronauts of roughly six months. 

But it is much shorter than the US space record of 371 days set by NASA astronaut Frank Rubio aboard the ISS in 2023, or the world record held by Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 continuous days aboard the Mir space station.

Still, the unexpected nature of their stint away from their families -- they had to receive additional clothing and personal care items because they hadn't packed enough -- garnered interest and sympathy around the world.

Wilmore and Williams will now begin preparing for departure and their ocean splashdown off the Florida coast, no sooner than March 19.

Along with the pair, NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov will also be aboard the returning Dragon capsule.

The replacement Crew-10 team had blasted off Friday from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

The team consists of NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russia's Kirill Peskov. During their mission, the new crew will conduct a range of scientific experiments, including flammability tests for future spacecraft designs and research into the effects of space on the human body.

The US is weighing in with Lebanon's government on the selection of the country's next central bank governor in a bid to curtail corruption and illicit financing for armed group Hezbollah through Lebanon's banking system, five sources familiar with the issue said. 

Washington's feedback on the candidates for the top role in shaping Lebanon's monetary policy is the latest example of the US' unusually hands-on approach to the Middle Eastern country, where a more than five-year financial crisis has collapsed the economy. 

It also demonstrates the US' continued focus on weakening Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group whose sway over the Lebanese government has been reduced after the group was pummelled by Israel in last year's war.

Since then, Lebanon has elected US-backed Joseph Aoun as president, and a new cabinet without a direct role for Hezbollah has taken power. That government must now fill vacant posts - including at the central bank, run by an interim governor since July 2023. 

The US is reviewing the profiles of a handful of candidates for the role, according to three Lebanese sources briefed on the issue, one Western diplomat and an official from US President Donald Trump's administration. 

The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity to discuss Washington's role in the selection process, the details of which have not been previously reported.

US officials met with some potential candidates in Washington and at the US embassy in Lebanon, two of the Lebanese sources and the Trump administration official said.

The Lebanese sources, who were briefed on the meetings, said the US officials asked candidates questions, including how they would fight ""terrorist financing"" through Lebanon's banking system and if they were willing to confront Hezbollah.

The State Department, White House, and the offices of Lebanon's president and prime minister did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 

The Trump administration official said the meetings were part of ""normal diplomacy"" - but said the U.S. was making its guidance on candidates' qualifications clear to the Lebanese government.

""The guidelines are, no Hezbollah and nobody who has been caught up in corruption. This is essential from an economic perspective,"" the official told Reuters.

""You need somebody who is going to implement reform, demand reform, and refuse to look the other way whenever people try to do business as usual in Lebanon,"" the official said. 

The Lebanese sources said the candidates being seriously considered included former minister Camille Abousleiman, Firas Abi-Nassif, head of an investment firm, and Philippe Jabre and Karim Souaid, both heads of their own asset management firms. 

The next governor will play a major part in any economic and financial reforms, which Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam have pledged to prioritise to help Lebanon emerge from a devastating financial meltdown that began in 2019.

Triggered by widespread corruption and profligate spending by the governing political elite, the economic crisis impoverished most Lebanese, demolished the Lebanese pound and brought the banking system to a standstill. 

Lebanon's new government is looking to resume talks with the International Monetary Fund for a financing programme, but the reforms remain a prerequisite. 

Western and Arab countries have also set reforms as a condition to provide any reconstruction support to Lebanon, large swathes of which were left in ruins by Israel's military campaign last year. 

In that vein, U.S. officials were discussing the candidates for central bank governor with Saudi Arabia, according to the Western diplomat and the Trump administration official. 

The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The incoming governor would replace interim chief Wassim Mansouri, who has been overseeing the bank since the 30-year tenure of longtime head Riad Salameh ended in disgrace in 2023.

Through most of his time as central bank chief, Salameh was feted as a financial wizard and enjoyed the backing of the U.S., which has a keen interest in the position because it oversees Lebanon's broader banking system and helps keep it compliant with U.S. laws preventing the financing of groups designated as ""terrorist"" factions, including Hezbollah.

But Lebanon's financial collapse tainted Salameh's legacy.

A month after he left office in 2023, Salameh was sanctioned by the United States, Britain and Canada, which accused him of corrupt actions to enrich himself and his associates, and is facing charges of financial crimes in Lebanon and broad. 

Last year, Lebanon was placed on a financial watchdog's ""grey list"" after failing to address concerns about terrorism financing and money laundering through its financial system.

Silicon Valley is abuzz with controversy following the release of 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism', the latest crusading memoir from Facebook whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams. The book, which hit shelves on Tuesday, delivers a scathing insider account of Meta's corporate culture, exposing the inner workings of one of the world's most influential tech companies.

Described by The Sunday Times as a “shocking, darkly funny, and highly critical exposé,” Careless People details the six years Wynn-Williams spent at the tech giant before she was fired, just ahead of Facebook's rebranding as Meta. The former executive alleges that Mark Zuckerberg and company leaders tried to silence her before her abrupt departure.

Wynn-Williams later filed a whistleblower complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as reported by The Washington Post. Her claims highlight the company's willingness to adjust content moderation policies and privacy standards to accommodate China—an accusation that could further fuel concerns about Big Tech's influence on global politics and free speech.

Published by Flatiron Books, the memoir is described as “a deeply personal account of why and how things have gone so horribly wrong in the past decade—told in a sharp, candid, and utterly disarming voice.” It is now available for purchase through retailers such as Bookshop.org, Barnes & Noble, and Amazon.

Wynn-Williams makes serious accusations against Meta's top executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, and Vice President Joel Kaplan in the book. The book also details serious allegations against Meta's leadership, including claims of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour.

She alleges that the company prioritized profit over ethical responsibility and turned a blind eye to serious issues, including the role Facebook played in spreading misinformation and inciting violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.

Flatiron Books has described the memoir as an expose of a “rotten company culture,” featuring “shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards.”

Additionally, Wynn-Williams claims that Meta sought to comply with Chinese government demands in an effort to gain access to the country's market, raising further ethical concerns about the tech giant's global operations.

As the book continues to generate headlines, the battle between Meta and Wynn-Williams shows no signs of slowing down, with legal and public relations ramifications still unfolding.

Meta has strongly refuted the claims made in the memoir. In an official statement, the company dismissed the book as “a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives.”

Meta further alleged that the book's author, former company executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, was terminated eight years ago for “poor performance and toxic behavior.” The company also claims an internal investigation at the time found her allegations of harassment to be misleading and unfounded.

“Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work,” Meta stated, asserting that whistleblower protections do not extend to “disgruntled activists trying to sell books.” The company has also pursued legal action against Wynn-Williams, citing a violation of a non-disparagement clause in her severance agreement.

Macmillan, the parent company of Flatiron Books, has backed its author amid the controversy.

“The arbitration order has no impact on Macmillan. However, we are appalled by Meta's tactics to silence our author through the use of a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement,” the publisher stated.

Unlike most book releases, which are announced months in advance, Careless People was kept under wraps until just a week before publication. Initially listed on Amazon as “Untitled-Flatiron-Author-Revealed-March,” the book has since captured widespread attention.

Brian Evanko, CEO and chief financial officer of Cigna's Cigna Healthcare arm, has been named president and chief operating officer of the Cigna Group as the company shuffles its top leadership.

The leadership changes, said Cigna, are designed to further drive the company's focus on patients and ""accelerate its growth strategy.""

 ""These leadership changes create a sharpened structure to build upon our strengths for continued growth, enhance our customer focus, and deliver even greater value for those we serve,"" said David M. Cordani, chairman and CEO, The Cigna Group. ""The bedrock of our continued success is our exceptional talent.""

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Evanko will assume responsibility for all business lines reporting to Cordani effective March 31. In January 2024, Evanko was named president and CEO for Cigna Healthcare with oversight of all Cigna Healthcare businesses. Evanko also serves as the company's chief financial officer, a role he has held since 2021.

Since joining the company in 1998, Evanko has served in a variety of key commercial and functional leadership roles in the U.S. and abroad, said Cigna.

Meanwhile, Ann Dennison has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer, the Cigna Group, reporting to Cordani and joining the company's Enterprise Leadership Team. In that capacity, she'll have responsibility for all enterprise financial operations and functions.

Prior to joining Cigna in early 2024 as deputy CFO, Dennison was executive vice president and the chief financial officer at Nasdaq, where she led a global team responsible for corporate finance, treasury, planning and analysis, investor relations, ESG reporting, procurement and real estate. She joined Nasdaq in 2015 as senior vice president, controller and chief accounting officer, and prior to that, she was a managing director and head of financial reporting at Goldman Sachs.

At the same time, Eric Palmer is departing The Cigna Group at the end of April. After a 25-plus year career, he currently oversees the Evernorth Health Services business, which has expanded its service capabilities during Palmer's tenure and today is ""well-positioned for continued, sustained growth,"" according to Cigna.

THE LARGER TREND

Cigna reaffirmed projected full-year 2025 consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $29.50 per share in January. The company also reaffirming 2025 Evernorth pre-tax adjusted income from operations of at least $7.2 billion, and Cigna Healthcare pre-tax adjusted income from operations of at least $4.1 billion.

The Cigna Group saw profits take a hit in the fourth quarter of 2024, reaching $1.4 billion, while it struggled with elevated medical costs, officials said during a January earnings call. 

Cigna's profits for the year were $3.4 billion, a decrease from the $5.2 billion in profit logged in 2023.

For many, the Shriners are a bit of a mystery, known for their distinctive fezzes, parade appearances, and charitable work, but not always for the details of their organization. While some might joke about them being a ""secret society,"" the reality is much simpler: the Shriners are a fraternal organization dedicated to fun, fellowship, and philanthropy, particularly through their support of children's healthcare.

The Shriners organization was founded in 1872 in New York City by a group of Freemasons who wanted to create a fraternity with a focus on both camaraderie and charitable work. Over the years, the group has attracted notable members, including Presidents Gerald Ford and Harry Truman, Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, General Douglas MacArthur, and even cultural icons like John Wayne and J. Edgar Hoover.

The Shriners' commitment to philanthropy led to the establishment of Shriners Hospitals for Children, a network of 22 hospitals across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. These hospitals specialize in treating children with orthopedic conditions, burns, cleft lip and palate, and other disabilities. Until 2012, all care was provided entirely free of charge. Today, while insurance is billed when available, any costs not covered are absorbed by the hospital—ensuring that families never have to pay out of pocket for necessary medical care.

Bulloch County has its own Shriners group, the Statesboro Shrine Club, which was rechartered in May 2016. Though still a relatively young club, its members are working to grow their presence in the community and increase awareness of their mission. The club specifically supports the Shriners Children's Hospital in Greenville, South Carolina, which provides life-changing treatment for children in need.

To raise funds, the club engages in a variety of community events. A key initiative is their paper sale, where members stand on street corners handing out papers in exchange for donations, with 100% of proceeds going directly to the children's hospital. While the exact date for this year's sale is still being determined, they are aiming for April or May to avoid extreme summer heat.

The club also participates in local parades, where their brightly decorated vehicles and enthusiastic members bring smiles to children and adults alike. Beyond just entertainment, these appearances help build awareness of the Shriners' mission. One of their biggest annual events in Bulloch County is their boiled peanut sale at the fair, which has grown significantly in the past two years. The club also takes part in community activities like Trunk-or-Treat events, strengthening their ties to local families.

Despite their rich history and ongoing charitable work, the Shriners are still working to establish a stronger presence in Statesboro and Bulloch County. While cities like Vidalia have long-standing and well-known Shriners groups, the Statesboro Shrine Club is still growing its local reputation.

One unique approach they take is holding their meetings at different local restaurants each month. This not only helps the club engage with the community but also supports small businesses in Bulloch County. Eventually, the club hopes to raise enough money to purchase its own meeting space, but for now, it remains focused on outreach and engagement.

One key requirement for joining the Shriners is that members must first be Freemasons. While Masonic membership may seem mysterious to outsiders, the process is relatively simple: you have to ask to join. Those interested in becoming a Mason, and, by extension, a Shriner, can reach out to a local Mason or Shriner for more information on the process.

Beyond membership, community members can support the Shriners' mission by attending their events, donating to their fundraisers, or simply spreading the word about their work.

The Statesboro Shrine Club is actively looking for ways to expand its reach, increase participation, and deepen its impact on the community. For those interested in supporting their efforts, keeping up with local events, and learning more, Grice Connect's events calendar is a great resource for staying informed about upcoming fundraisers and activities.

Additionally, the club is seeking photos from past events to help showcase their work. If you've attended a parade or fair and have pictures of the Shriners in action, they would love to see them!

With 200,000 members worldwide and a network of hospitals providing life-changing medical care, the Shriners' impact is undeniable. And as the Statesboro Shrine Club continues to grow, so too does its ability to make a difference right here in Bulloch County.

As political tensions rise across the country, Oklahoma lawmakers are addressing both state and national concerns, from economic uncertainty to health care reforms and tax cuts.

During a recent episode of Your Vote Counts, Senator Avery Frix and Representative Suzanne Schreiber shared insights into the pressing issues affecting Oklahomans, emphasizing that federal concerns are dominating conversations at the local level.

“I had a town hall about a week ago, and we had two times the people that we typically have at these town halls,” Schreiber said. “They wanted to know about what's going on with the layoffs, is their veterans' health care still going to be good, how are they going to deal with Medicaid and Medicare changes, and how are they going to take care of their families.”

Although state lawmakers don't directly handle federal issues, Frix noted that they are in close communication with Oklahoma's congressional delegation.

“You know, where we're at in our country is we have over $36 trillion in debt, and we have to do something,” Frix said. “I support President Trump and Elon Musk's effort to try to make our government more efficient, cut out that waste, fraud, and abuse.”

One key issue making its way through the Oklahoma legislature is health care reform, with a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering out-of-pocket costs for patients.

“Our bill together allows people to use that [cash] price, and it goes against their deductible rather than having to pay the contracted price,” Schreiber explained. She cited her own experience with an angiogram, where the cash price was significantly lower than the insured price.

The legislative session is also seeing major structural changes, including leadership shifts and new processes for moving bills through committees. Frix highlighted a growing appetite for a tax cut in the Senate, an issue that has been heavily debated in recent years.

“As I go out and talk to folks in my district, we hear from folks that are hurting from inflation,” Frix said. “We know that times are tough, and they need some relief. And this is one way that we can do it.”

Schreiber also pointed to the state's childcare crisis as a major issue under discussion.

“We passed a bill off the floor with great majority this week with very good bipartisan support,” she said. “We will continue to work on that child care issue for our businesses, our employers, and our families who really need that.”

As the session moves forward, lawmakers are balancing tax cut discussions with the need to invest in essential services such as health care and education.

“There's robust conversations about the tax cut, and I think there's also some conversations about what we need to invest in,” Schreiber said. “Do we have the money to do a tax cut and that?”

With national politics continuing to overshadow state affairs, Oklahoma lawmakers remain focused on local solutions while keeping an eye on Washington's impact.

Tenney

GENEVA — A group that calls itself Concerned Citizens of NY24 is hosting a forum Tuesday night on the impacts federal actions are having on healthcare.

And, they're hoping the region's congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will attend during a legislature recess scheduled for next week.

The forum will be held from 7-8:30 p.m. at the Smith Opera House, 82 Seneca St. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.

Other forums are planned, the group said.

“Hearing that public concerns of the constituents of New York's 24th Congressional District were not being heard, a group of citizens has come together to hold a series of public forums in order to give people a place to voice their concerns and ask questions with the hope that the congressional representative, Claudia Tenney, will hear and represent the consensus,” said Scott Comegys, chair of the Wayne County Democratic Committee.

The Geneva forum will include Dr. Laurel Dallmeyer, a retired physician who worked in Geneva for many years, along with other retired and current healthcare industry professionals, including Anne Ruflin, Jennifer Scott, and Dr. Robert Scott.

Comegys said Tenney “has been invited to attend and participate, although at the time of this release (Friday morning) the representative has not responded to the invitation that was hand-delivered to their Canandaigua office.”

Tenney's office did not reply to a request for comment as of Friday morning's print deadline.

Stock Analysis

 Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.'  It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses.  As with many other companies Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) makes use of debt.  But is this debt a concern to shareholders? 

 Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow.   If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business.  However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control.  By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return.  The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. 

 View our latest analysis for Molina Healthcare 

 As you can see below, at the end of December 2024, Molina Healthcare had US$2.92b of debt, up from US$2.18b a year ago. Click the image for more detail.    But it also has US$8.99b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$6.06b net cash.  

 We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Molina Healthcare had liabilities of US$7.90b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.24b due beyond that.   Offsetting this, it had US$8.99b in cash and US$3.30b in receivables that were due within 12 months.   So it actually has US$1.15b more liquid assets than total liabilities.   

 This short term liquidity is a sign that Molina Healthcare could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched.    Succinctly put, Molina Healthcare boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!   

 The good news is that Molina Healthcare has increased its EBIT by 5.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment.      The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt.  But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Molina Healthcare can strengthen its balance sheet over time.  So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. 

 Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits.   While Molina Healthcare has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance.    During the last three years, Molina Healthcare produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 60% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect.  This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.   

 While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Molina Healthcare has net cash of US$6.06b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities.      So we don't think Molina Healthcare's use of debt is risky.      We'd be very excited to see if Molina Healthcare insiders have been snapping up shares.

This is the result of a study published in the journal npj Digital Medicine by researchers from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, Emory University in the United States, and the company itself. “The study included the largest number of patients and showed that the technology we developed had the lowest error in estimating the value of intracranial pressure among all the non-invasive methods already available in the world,” Gustavo Frigieri, scientific director of brain4care and one of the authors of the study, told Agência FAPESP. 

In the articles we've published, we've shown that the pulse is very important and that it does the same thing as an invasive ICP measurement, but in a non-invasive way

The technology developed by the Brazilian company, with support from FAPESP's Innovative Research in Small Businesses Program (PIPE), consists of a sensor placed on the patient's head that registers the nanometric expansions of the skull in each cardiac cycle and generates, in real time, a wave that indicates the variations in volume and intracranial pressure. The data obtained are processed by an artificial intelligence platform that generates reports to help doctors make decisions. 

According to Frigieri, the difference in the solution developed by brain4care is the way it analyzes ICP, which has three basic components: the numerical value, the trend (up or down), and the morphology of the pulse. Instead of focusing on the numerical value, as traditional methods do, it evaluates the morphology of the pulse – that is, the way it behaves over time. This approach makes it possible to identify changes before they manifest themselves in the numerical values of the pressure. “This understanding has been consolidated worldwide,” says Frigieri. “Invasive ICP is reactive, and brain4care is proactive because it allows us to act in advance. Still, physicians are used to the number, which comes in late, meaning that they only act when there are changes in the patient. Our technology already provides the morphology and trend of the ICP and is moving towards showing the absolute number.” 

In developing the system, the company's researchers also translated the ICP pulse into numbers. “We show the physician the patient's situation so he can decide how to proceed. In the articles we've published, we've shown that the pulse is very important and that it does the same thing as an invasive ICP measurement, but in a non-invasive way. It allows the physician to see if the patient is getting worse or better based on the trend.” 

More than 80 billion neurons, trillions of synapses and almost 6 kilometres of neural pathways: The brain is an anatomical masterpiece – and still puzzles science. Keep reading to find out about latest research and therapies of brain diseases.

With the system, doctors can detect neurological changes early and intervene more quickly and accurately, which can mean the difference between life and death in critical cases. “The longer a neurocritical patient goes without proper care, the greater the risk of sequelae,” he points out. “I provide the sensor and train the professional to make treatment decisions and achieve the best outcome.” 

The effectiveness of the brain4care method has been proven in over one hundred published scientific articles. The new study recruited patients from Brazil, the United States and Europe. “We accelerated the process of collecting this information and today we have a very interesting database of patients with invasive and non-invasive ICP. Using a machine learning model, we were able to estimate the value of ICP in these patients,” he explains. “We were able to achieve an error of 3 millimeters of mercury [the means by which ICP is usually measured] in more than a hundred patients. Many researchers are looking for non-invasive ways to measure ICP, but the techniques used have a very large error, which makes the system not ideal for clinical use.” 

Having proven in the laboratory that it is possible to make the estimate, Frigieri continues to work on obtaining robust evidence. “I currently have 168 patients in the database and I've already reduced the error to 2.6 mm of mercury.” The goal is to consolidate the model later this year to demonstrate in the field that, in addition to morphology and trend, brain4care can provide the number doctors are looking for. “We've already shown that it's possible to derive ICP from morphology in a completely non-invasive way. The next step is to make this a reality for the market.” 

For Frigieri, any neurosurgery patient at risk of bleeding can benefit from the method. This is because when they are in an intensive care unit (ICU), sedated and ventilated, it is not possible to see their symptoms and the doctor often acts almost blindly: for example, he performs a CT scan after the operation and repeats it after 24 hours. “In these cases, you can use brain4care every two hours and, if things get worse, add a CT scan to see what happened in more detail.” 

This versatility is one of the advantages of the device. It can be used in environments other than the ICU, such as medical clinics, outpatient clinics and emergency departments. This greatly expands access to ICP monitoring. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical in cases of head trauma, where every minute counts to preserve brain function. According to him, brain4care is easy to use and doesn't require complex training: “It can be adapted to the scenario. For example, if you just need to check whether the patient has intracranial hypertension, 5 to 10 minutes of use may be enough,” explains Frigieri. “A more unstable patient, on the other hand, can wear the device for an hour or two for longer monitoring.” 

According to the researcher, with the invasive method of ICP monitoring, it is necessary to take the patient to the operating room to place the device. Brain4care, on the other hand, can be taken anywhere. “I always say that we're not going to replace invasive ICP, but we will be able to determine who really needs it. We want to make sure that the majority of patients are treated before they become critical, but that those who need this type of intervention can receive it safely. At the same time, this will help to optimize the use of resources.” 

Currently, brain4care is present in more than 85 institutions in Brazil, from top hospitals in São Paulo to small charity hospitals in rural areas. This wide distribution demonstrates the system's adaptability to different contexts and needs. At the same time, the company is expanding internationally, with operations in the United States since 2018 and formal marketing since last October. “We've gone the other way: we're exporting medical technology around the world. We have a company in the United States that's a subsidiary and distributor, but all the intelligence and production is Brazilian,” Frigieri says proudly. 

The technology has already been approved by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA), the regulatory body for therapies, medical technologies and drugs in Brazil, and by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), its counterpart in the United States. In addition, it has already allowed 128 scientific studies to be conducted (some completed and others still in progress). Because it is non-invasive, the method allows studies that would not be possible with traditional techniques, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields of medicine. This feature has attracted researchers from different specialties, who use the data obtained by brain4care in other scientific investigations. “Previously, this information was not available for scientific use. The arrival of brain4care has opened up opportunities for the development of knowledge.”

The Department of Adult Correction is constitutionally required to provide medical, mental and dental health care to the roughly 31,000 people in North Carolina's 53 prisons. However, providing this health care comes with a growing price tag, a fiscal analyst told state lawmakers March 4 during a presentation to the Joint Appropriations Committee on Justice and Public Safety.

Health care costs totaled $429.1 million — or about one-quarter of the Department of Adult Correction's annual budget of about $2 billion — during the fiscal year 2023-24. It's a 36 percent increase in cost over the past five years.

Health care expenditures came in more than $48.1 million over budget — one of the widest gaps to date.

However, health care costs exceeding the budgeted amount are not unusual. Mark White, an analyst from the General Assembly's nonpartisan Fiscal Research Division, told state lawmakers that's been the pattern for at least a decade.

White said many factors are driving costs up. 

“The aging population, the large medical need of this particular population, the constitutional obligation the department is under to attend to offender conditions, and growing industry costs in general have resulted in multiple years of cost overruns for health services,” White explained.

For example, state lawmakers allocated an additional $50 million of recurring funding to address medical budget deficiencies and $3.4 million in recurring funding for prison pharmacy operating costs in the 2021 state budget.

But those funds weren't enough to close the gap. 

White said he expects health care costs to exceed the budgeted amount again this year.

The Department of Adult Correction has been able to pay for these overages through lapsed salaries — a budgeted amount of pay and benefits that remain unused because a position is vacant.

“On the one hand, the budget does not reflect the actual spending needs,” White said. “On the other hand, because of lapsed salary, the agency is able to continue operations.”

The Department of Adult Correction's Comprehensive Health Services Divisionprovides medical care to all people in custody from entry through release.

In 2024, the division recorded 1.4 million health encounters. This included just under 700,000 visits with nurses, 418,000 with medical providers, 170,000 with psychological and social workers, 88,600 with dental staff and 40,000 with psychiatrists.

About 98% of this medical care occurred inside prisons. Routine outpatient medical care is available at all prisons across the state, and inpatient care occurs at Central Prison and the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women — both in Raleigh.

The remaining needed medical care — most often surgeries — was provided at community medical clinics and hospitals.

Not all of this care is provided free to incarcerated people. The Department of Adult Correction charges $5 for medical and dental services initiated by an incarcerated person and $7 for a self-declared emergency visit, according to the prison system's copay policy. In 2023, the prison system collected $353,673 in copay fees.

NC Health News has previously reported that copays can pose a barrier for incarcerated people seeking medical care as the fees can be a financial barrier, particularly in the context of low prison wages — leading some people to delay or even avoid care.

But Brad Deen, a prison spokesman, told NC Health News that copays are intended to prevent the overuse and abuse of health care resources.

People behind bars are generally sicker than people in the general population; they are disproportionately likely to have chronic health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure and HIV, as well as substance use and mental health problems.

This means there's a large need for health care services. Changing demographics of North Carolina's prison population are also putting increased pressure on the prison health care system to meet the demands for care.

For one, the state's incarcerated population is aging. White told lawmakers that over the past 10 years, the number of incarcerated people older than 60 has doubled. Now, this group of more medically demanding people comprises 10 percent of the overall prison population and is expected to grow.

Research shows that incarceration has adverse effects on health and accelerates aging. One study found that an incarcerated 59-year-old has the same morbidity rate as a non-incarcerated 75-year-old. Other studies show that people face chronic and life-threatening illnesses earlier in prison than would be expected for someone outside.

“As individuals age, they have greater health care costs and needs,” White said.

More and more people in North Carolina prisons also need mental health and substance use treatment. About one-quarter of the 31,000 people incarcerated are on the prison system's mental health caseload, and nearly 80 percent of people entering prison have a substance use disorder in need of treatment.

The Department of Adult Correction spent $45 million on mental health care last fiscal year. Most behavioral health services are provided through telehealth, with virtual clinics held on an ongoing basis at more than 30 state prison facilities. The Department of Adult Correction also offers inpatient psychiatric services, operating 144 beds for men at Central Prison and 10 beds for women at the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women.

The department's Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency Programs cost $16 million last fiscal year. Staff operate just over 1,300 beds for prison-based, cognitive-behavioral substance use disorder treatment programs, which range in length from 90 days to a year.

According to the 2022-23 annual programs report,12 prisons offered a total of 657 beds for intermediate treatment programs lasting 90 days. Another 10 prisons offered a total of 650 beds for long-term treatment programs ranging in length from 120 to 365 days.

But as NC Health News has previously reported, demand for this treatment significantly outpaces treatment availability. On average, the yearly treatment need is double the yearly treatment slots, according to a March 2024 report on the prison system's substance use disorder treatment programs.

About $76 million, or nearly 20 percent of the Department of Adult Correction's health expenses, are pharmacy-related. White said pharmacy costs have ticked up in recent years, driven partly by an aging prison population that requires more medications.

White provided another driver of cost increase: hepatitis C treatment. 

Hepatitis C is a highly contagious disease — spread through contact with infected blood, often through intravenous drug use — that targets the liver and is curable thanks to newer medication that can eliminate the virus.

In 2021, the prison system settled a lawsuit brought by three incarcerated men who sued for access to hepatitis C treatment and, as a result, more incarcerated people are now screened and treated for this disease. However, this treatment comes with a steep price tag that strains the budget.

White said that before the court settlement in 2019, the prison system spent about $4.6 million on hepatitis C treatment — a price tag that ballooned to $25.4 million in 2024, despite falling prices for the treatment. Last year, 1,725 people were treated at a cost of about $14,700 per person.

Persistent staff vacancies also make providing health care more challenging.

Overall, the Department of Adult Correction — an agency with more than 18,000 full-time employees — has a vacancy rate of 24 percent. Health care positions have an even higher vacancy rate of 28 percent. Nurse positions are particularly tough to fill, with a vacancy rate of 37%.

“When we have prolonged vacancies, the requirement [for health care] doesn't go away,” said Arthur Campbell, chief medical officer at the Department of Adult Correction. “We're still obligated to provide the care that's needed.”

In response, the department has had to turn to contract or travel nurses, who are more expensive on a per capita basis. Campbell said that about 55 percent to 60 percent of the prison system's nursing and provider staff who perform in-house health services are now contract workers.

Correctional officers, who supervise and transport incarcerated people, account for the largest number of vacancies. Over one-third of about 8,000 positions are unfilled.

A shortage of correctional officers is hitting some prisons harder than others. Craggy Correctional in Asheville, Granville Correctional in Butner and Pender Correctional in Burgaw have the highest vacancy rates — all above 60 percent. In comparison, the best-staffed prisons have correctional officer vacancy rates as low as 3%.

In response to staffing challenges, the Department of Adult Correction has closed beds at some prisons.

They've also relied heavily on overtime, requiring staff to pick up extra shifts to keep operations going. In fiscal year 2023-24, the department spent $67.7 million on overtime — over 11 times the budgeted $5.8 million.

Brandeshawn Harris, chief deputy secretary for operations at the Department of Adult Correction, told lawmakers the department wants overtime numbers to drop. She acknowledged that employees working such long hours puts facilities at risk and takes a toll on staff.

“We do try to get individuals to volunteer for it, but that doesn't always work,” Harris said. “It's a difficult balance, and we try to do as much as we can to keep the overtime numbers down.” Harris said two of the top reasons people leave the Department of Adult Correction are because of overtime and low pay. The starting salary for a new correctional officer is just over $37,600, with pay rising based on years of experience and the custody level of the prison.

Filling these tough front-line jobs will take better pay, said Anthony Vann, interim chief deputy secretary for administration at the Department of Adult Correction. He told lawmakers that correctional officer starting pay in Tennessee is about $51,000, and county jails are similarly paying around $50,000 — places people are opting to work instead.

“Do we know a magical number?” Vann asked. “No, we don't. They're still having problems recruiting — even at those particular numbers — but it's not as bad as ours.”

Franciscan is building a new cancer center at the campus of its new Crown Point hospital at I-65 and 231.

The new Franciscan Health Crown Point opened in 2024.

Franciscan Alliance is set to recognize our 150th anniversary at the end of this year.

Many things have changed in healthcare during that century and a half and we have adapted to meet the changing needs of our communities with state-of-the-art innovations throughout. What hasn't changed is our Catholic nonprofit healthcare ministry's fidelity to our mission of continuing Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition.

Last year, Franciscan Alliance set into motion multiple projects that support our regional approach to healthcare, optimizing facilities and resources with state-of-the-art services to improve the level of care for all of Northwest Indiana.

The year began with the opening of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point at the corner of U.S. 231 and Interstate 65, which replaced the 50-year-old Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital on Main Street.

This facility was constructed to support the highest acuity of patients in a convenient location and designed to keep patient care and safety at the center while enveloping employees, patients and families in our Catholic traditions.

The hospital includes 207 inpatient beds with room to expand to 300, as well as an attached medical office building and expandable diagnostic and treatment centers. It includes a hybrid operating room with the latest technology to care for cardiac patients, enhanced patient safety and convenience and private rooms in the neonatal intensive care unit, which is staffed by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago neonatologists.

In July, Franciscan Health Crown Point and Lurie announced their expanded partnership with the addition of a Lurie Children's pediatric hospitalist to serve young patients admitted to the pediatric unit. The partnership allows for board-certified/board-eligible Lurie pediatricians to provide daily management of pediatric inpatients, in-house care 24/7 in the pediatric inpatient unit, coordination of care with the child's pediatrician, management of care for newborns and pediatric consultations in the emergency department.

In the past, when children would require hospitalization, they would often be transferred by ambulance to hospitals hours from home, creating added stress for families during an already challenging time. This collaboration helps to ensure children and adolescents from across Northwest Indiana receive exceptional, comprehensive care close to home.

Franciscan Health Crown Point saw the groundbreaking in September of The Dean and Barbara White Cancer Center, which is slated to open in early 2027. This project was made possible in part by a $30 million donation from The Dean and Barbara White Family Foundation in November 2023, the largest gift ever received by the Franciscan Health Foundation, the fundraising support arm of our nonprofit healthcare ministry.

The 71,000-square-foot, three-story cancer center is being constructed by Tonn and Blank Construction on the campus of the new Franciscan Health Crown Point hospital. This state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment center will consolidate existing Franciscan Health Crown Point cancer care services into one convenient location.





Providing kind, considerate and well-connected care throughout a family's journey through oncology treatment and recovery is our mission, and we are pleased to have such an aligned partner in the White family.

Franciscan Health Michigan City saw a groundbreaking in October for a new medical office building in Valparaiso. The two-story, 82,881-square-foot building is being built by Tonn and Blank Construction at the southeast corner of State Roads 2 and 49. It will house an ExpressCare, primary care and specialty physician offices, diagnostic imaging, CT, MRI, ultrasound and laboratory services.

We are excited to be significantly expanding our presence in Valparaiso with this project. The new building is scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

In early November, Franciscan Health also broke ground on a new medical office building in St. John. The building mirrors the Valparaiso building in design and services and is also being built by Tonn and Blank Construction, at 10323 Wicker Ave. This building is also scheduled to be complete by the end of 2026.

Also in November, we announced that Franciscan Health Dyer will transition in late 2027 to a campus dedicated to treating behavioral health patients, a move designed to meet the growing need for behavioral health treatment while supporting Franciscan Alliance's regional approach to healthcare.

The transformation into a behavioral health campus will allow for the expansion of the current 92-bed inpatient behavioral health unit and the addition of behavioral health services. The existing Dyer emergency room will be transformed as well, with the space being used to house a new high acuity Franciscan ExpressCare for patients seeking medical care and the addition of an emergency intake department specifically dedicated to behavioral health. Patients seeking emergency room care may seek treatment at Franciscan Health Munster, just 2 miles away.

Inpatient, emergency and surgical services will move from Dyer to the expanded Munster campus in late 2027. Inpatient rehabilitation will also move from Dyer to a new rehabilitation facility on the Munster campus around the same time.

The expansion of the Munster campus is already underway and includes a three-story addition to an existing three-story medical structure and the construction of a new five-story medical structure.

Franciscan also offers a multitude of Community Health Improvement programs designed with input from community health surveys. From a variety of food insecurity programs to diaper pantries, the Prenatal Assistance Program, free health-related classes and much more, our Community Health Improvement programs further support our values of compassionate concern and Christian stewardship.

Backing these and many other initiatives is the Franciscan Health Foundation, which exists to support our mission. From cancer and cardiac care to community education, family health programs, women and children's services, educational scholarships and more, the Foundation supports Christ's ministry in our Franciscan tradition by caring for our neighbors with compassion and the love they need during their most trying times.

As we prepare to look back on 150 years of service, we are proud to look toward the future with hope for a more resilient, healthier Region, with the needs of our neighbors being met at locations closer to their homes than ever before.

Dean Mazzoni is the president and CEO of Franciscan Health Dyer, Michigan City and Munster. Daniel McCormick, MD, is president and CEO of Franciscan Health Crown Point. The opinions are the writers'.

In Saturday's semi-final, Draper scored one of the most significant wins in his career when he overcame Alcaraz, the Wimbledon champion who's a two-time victor at Indian Wells.

The Briton beat Alcaraz 6-1 0-6 6-4 to reach the final after Rune, the 12th seed in this competition, had defeated Daniil Medvedev in straight sets, 7-6 6-4.

Draper's victory sends him into an ATP Masters 1000 final for the first time and ensured he would rise into the world's top 10 for the first time.

""It feels unbelievable,"" Draper told Sky Sports. ""I've been through so much the last few years with injuries and setbacks.

""It feels incredible, but I've got another one.""

He added: ""You've got to get over wins like today, and all my focus and energy is on making sure I do all the right things to give myself the best chance to win the tournament.""

It's a point in his career that Draper, who reached the semi-finals of the US Open last year, has been determined to reach. He wants to keep this run going.

""I've been through a lot in my few years with playing and especially the last ones with some injuries and a lot of hard work to always try and get back to a decent level,"" he said.

""It was my goal at the end of last year that I obviously had some good results, but I want to really achieve some consistency and get to the point where I'm pushing these top players in the world in the biggest tournaments.""

Draper is now relishing the final against Rune, spurred on by defeating an elite player like Alcaraz.

""That will give me so much confidence,"" he said. ""Obviously each day as it comes, you feel different.

""Against the top players in the world, they can change their momentum very quickly. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.

""I thought I was going to feel really energised [on Saturday] after a day off but I kind of felt the opposite. I'll be more aware of that.

""More aware of the way I've been feeling today and then I'll make sure I lift myself even more the final so that doesn't happen.""

Sky Sports pundit Tim Henman said: ""It was an amazing performance. Not necessarily the match that we were expecting. Jack absolutely dominated that first set 6-1 and then looked like he really struggled with energy levels and Alcaraz came through a couple of tight games and the beginning of the second set and suddenly it was 6-0 and one set all.

""That's when I think Jack did such a good job. Stepped away, had to regroup, regain that momentum and even when he was up 5-2 with a double break it wasn't over. You know Alcaraz is going to keep fighting, but Jack did so well to get over the line.

""Rune hasn't had the best of years but he played a very, very smart match against Medvedev, changing the pace, using the slow slice then really injecting power with those amazing ground strokes. Let's not forget he's won a Masters 1000 before, he's been in another final, so he has that experience.

""But I feel with the momentum that Jack has had, the results he's had, beating Alcaraz in the semi-finals, I give him a great chance in the final.""

Westfield's Carson Swanson is fouled on a layup attempt during Saturday's Class C Far West Regional against Honeoye at Rush-Henrietta High School.

HENRIETTA – One by one, teary-eyed members of Westfield's basketball team filtered out of their locker room to find family and friends in the lobby of the Rush-Henrietta High School gymnasium Saturday evening.

When the day started, the Wolverines truly believed they would still have another week of basketball ahead of them this winter.

Honeoye had other ideas.

The Bulldogs sank 7 of 10 free throws in the final 1:14 of the game and survived fouling Section VI's all-time leading scorer on a 3-point attempt with 1.8 seconds remaining to beat Westfield 64-60 in the Class C Far West Regional in suburban Rochester.

With the win, Honeoye clinched its second trip to the New York State Public High School Athletic Association semifinals and first since 1985.

“I knew that these kids work incredibly hard,” Honeoye head coach Robb Delisanti said postgame. ” … We played 34 games together in the offseason. I knew we'd be good.”

For the Wolverines, the loss ends their season and those of five seniors, including Carson Swanson, the school's all-time leading scorer who finished second in Western New York history with 2,448 points – 28 shy of the record.

“Just like the last two weeks, we said let's get through this one and practice another week to play again,” Westfield head coach Nolan Swanson said. “It's a great group of guys.”

Two statistics were crucial to Westfield's downfall: 17 turnovers and 14-of-25 shooting at the foul line.

“As a coach, I just had them a little underestimated and didn't get us quite ready,” Swanson said.

The Bulldogs led by as many as 10 midway through the fourth quarter before things started to get a lot tighter.

Carson Swanson hit a 3-pointer with 3:48 remaining to make it 56-49 and, after a free throw from Honeoye's Landon Washburn, Zach Maguire hit a 3-pointer to make it a five-point game.

“It was a typical game of so many people coming at him,” Nolan Swanson said of his middle son, Carson. “He's seeing open people and trying to get the ball to the right spot.”

Swanson then converted a three-point play to make it 57-55 with 2:36 left and Maguire followed with a putback through contact before making the free throw to give the Wolverines a 58-57 lead with 1:35 left – Westfield's first lead since it was 18-16 early in the second quarter.

But even with a pair of Bulldogs starters fouling out on back-to-back possessions, the Wolverines were not able to execute down the stretch.

“We've had two guys foul out all year and we had two foul out tonight,” Delisanti said. “I'm not really sure what happened, but Swanson probably had something to do with it.”

Braiden Schneider tied the game at 58-all on a free throw with 1:14 remaining and Westfield turned the ball over on its next possession. Washburn, a sophomore who finished with a game-high 28 points, then made 1 of 2 free throws to give his team a 59-58 lead.

“He goes both directions well. He's heavy and pretty aggressive,” Nolan Swanson said of Washburn. “Quite honestly, when we did play him well, the off guys hit some shots. I hadn't seen any of that to that degree. They just made too many shots.”

The Wolverines came up empty on their next trip and Dylan Washburn added a free throw for Honeoye with 18.8 seconds remaining.

Swanson then made it a one-point game with a free throw and Westfield grabbed an offensive rebound before a miss on a point-blank layup that would've given the Wolverines the lead.

“We had a lot of chances and things that went well with certain plays,” Nolan Swanson said. “But people sometimes end up having to hit a reverse or a backwards shot, or catch it in a weird spot and it makes the shot tough sometimes.”

Dylan Washburn sank two free throws with 5.7 seconds left and Westfield was in need of a miracle.

It nearly came as Swanson was fouled on a 3-point attempt at the top of the key with 1.8 seconds remaining. But after his first free throw fell, the second glanced off the rim. Needing an intentional miss to get the ball back, Swanson's third attempt didn't touch iron.

“We had four sophomores on the court there at the end,” Delisanti said. “They didn't quit and they didn't fold.”

The Bulldogs inbounded and Schneider hit a pair of free throws to seal the Wolverines' fate.

“You just come up against it sometimes,” Nolan Swanson said, “and it didn't bounce in.”

Honeoye will play for the first state title in program history next weekend at Visions Veterans Memorial Arena in Binghamton.

” … In Section V you have to face 36 other schools, just to get out and go to the Far West Regional,” Delisanti said. “It's not an easy task.”

The Bulldogs will take on the winner of today's quarterfinal between Section III's Cooperstown and Section IV's Moravia. The other side of the bracket will feature Section I's Tuckahoe and Section II's Berne-Knox-Westerlo.

“They are a great team. The Swanson kid was the best player we've faced all year by far. They were huge. Maguire and (Grant) Beadle are huge,” Delisanti said of the Wolverines. “They are the biggest team and the best team we played all year.”

NOTES: Carson Swanson had 23 points, nine rebounds, eight assists and eight steals; Maguire had 13 points and nine rebounds; and Braylon Swanson had 10 points for Westfield, which shot 19 of 51 from the field, including 8 of 25 from 3-point range. … Schneider had 15 points and Dylan Washburn had 10 for Honeoye, which shot 22 of 46 from the field, including 4 of 14 from 3-point range, and turned the ball over 21 times.

Bickerstaff blasts refs for 'disgusting display of disrespect' after loss to Thunder","https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/pistons-jb-bickerstaff-blasts-refs-for-disgusting-display-of-disrespect-after-loss-to-thunder-141709319.html","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:18:43 GMT","

The Detroit Pistons are vastly improved over last season's team, which compiled one of the 10 worst seasons in NBA history at 14-68.

However, the Pistons aren't quite good enough to defeat the NBA's best teams consistently, as demonstrated by their 113-107 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night.

Following the game, Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff was fuming. In his view, the Pistons didn't just have to contend with the second-best team in the NBA on Saturday. They also had to battle the officials.

""What you saw tonight was disgusting,"" Bickerstaff said. ""It was a disgusting display of disrespect towards our guys and what we're trying to do.""

Bickerstaff's voice shook as he ranted about the officiating, pounding the table before leaving his postgame press conference.

""I tried to have a conversation with an official, the official is arguing with [Thunder coach] Mark [Daigneault], I say his name one time and he screams at me and tells me that's enough,"" Bickerstaff said.

""We understand that we play a style of ball that's physical, it's on the edge. I coach my ass off in a passionate way, I'm into the game, our players are into the game. We understand that. But we deserve a level of respect because we're competing our tails off and bringing something positive to this league.""

Beginning at the seven-minute mark of the third quarter, Detroit was whistled for five technical fouls. Ausar Thompson and Bickerstaff first picked up technicals. Then with 47 seconds remaining in the frame, Cade Cunningham was called for two technicals for arguing with the officials and was ejected from the game. (Dennis Schröder also picked up a tech, sandwiched between Cunningham's.)

After the flurry of technicals and Cunningham's ejection, the Thunder expanded their lead to 91-75 by the end of the third. Despite their All-Star's absence, the Pistons twice cut the margin to one point on 3-pointers by Malik Beasley and Tim Hardaway Jr.

But with under three minutes remaining, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander made two consecutive baskets to restore the Thunder's lead to 106-100. Cason Wallace then effectively put the win away, hitting a 3 with 1:33 remaining.

— Steve Jones Jr. (@stevejones20) March 16, 2025

Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 48 points, his 12th game reaching 40 or more this season and nearly his fifth 50-point performance. He shot 4-of-6 on 3-pointers and 10-for-10 on free throws to lead the Thunder to their 55th win of the 2024-25 campaign and boost his case for NBA MVP.

Cunningham scored 11 points with seven rebounds and nine assists before leaving the game. Tobias Harris led Detroit with 18 points and seven boards, followed by 17 from Dennis Schröder.

Asked by the pool reporter about ejecting Cunningham, crew chief Brian Forte said the technicals resulted from how he spoke to officials.

""Cunningham was given his first technical foul for disrespectfully addressing an official with profanity,"" Forte said, via the AP. ""After the free throw for the first technical was shot, Cade continued to use profanity toward the official and received his second technical foul and was ejected.""

Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said in his postgame remarks that the ""crew was the loosest whistle coming into the game that we've seen all season in terms of how little they call.""

Despite the loss, the Pistons hold the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference standings at 37-31 and could move up to fifth or even fourth place.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

DAYTON — Waterford and Fort Loramie know each other well.

The two girls basketball powerhouses had met twice in state championship games prior to Saturday, including last year when the Redskins claimed a 42-29 victory. 

Right after that loss, Waterford senior Avery Wagner declared the Wildcats would be back. Fast-forward to Saturday's Division VII state final at UD Arena, where Waterford won the rematch with Fort Loramie 48-46.

“Us three seniors, we keep our promises,” Wagner said. “We had a feeling it was going to be Fort Loramie. We knew we had to come in here and get it done. I have a lot of faith and trust in my teammates and I knew we could get right back here again and win it this time.”

As confident as Wagner and her classmates Kendall Sury and Avery Smithberger were that Waterford would get redemption, it's never easy winning a state title in Ohio.

“It is extremely hard to get here,” said Waterford head coach Jerry Close, who has now guided three state championship teams (2016, 2022, 2025). “What has happened — the first time we came (to state) in 15, that group of girls laid the foundation for this. These girls see that as young ladies, and you've got other young ladies watching this. Nobody wants to be the team that lets the program down right now. They expect to win.”

Prior to that 2015 team breaking through, Waterford struggled for years to get past the regional tournament. Now, they've gotten past the Elite Eight eight times in the last decade, making the state finals six times and winning three — Wagner, Sury and Smithberger were part of two of those championship runs.

“Freshman year we came in and won,” Sury reflected. “It was good for those three seniors. We were like, ‘Hey, we want to do that our senior year.' We came in this season for our senior year, and every single game we all did it for this point. I think we really dug deep. Throughout the tournament, we faced so much physicality. Going into this game, we knew it was one more game, 32 minutes left for our entire high school career.”

WAGNER'S IMPACT

At 6-foot-4, Wagner always makes her presence felt on the basketball court.

But, after finishing with three points in last year's state championship loss, the Purdue-Fort Wayne signee was eager to come through for her squad this time around. 

The result was an all-time clutch performance on both ends of the floor. 

Wagner led Waterford with 16 points on 6 of 9 shooting and even buried a couple of 3-pointers. She also registered team-highs in rebounds (5), assists (4), steals (3) and blocks (4).

Fort Loramie had two offensive possessions in the final minute —  Wagner halted both with a steal and a block. 

And it wasn't an easy defensive assignment as Wagner had to go toe-to-toe with Victoria Mescher, a Findlay volleyball commit listed at 6-feet tall.

Mescher finished with a game-high 19 points, but took 16 shots and had to get creative to counter Wagner's size.

“She was a lot taller than me, so I couldn't just go straight at her,” Mescher said. “I needed to use my pivot and use some pump fakes to hopefully get her off of her feet. I feel like I did that successfully at times. I knew that she's a shot-blocker so we had to figure out other ways to go around her.”

By the end of the game, Wagner was spent.

“I was tired,” she said. “She's a great player, obviously. Me and her were just going back and forth.”

SCHEDULE PAYS OFF

Close said earlier in the season his team plays one of the toughest schedules in the state.

A quick check of MaxPreps confirms the Wildcats went through an absolute gauntlet this season.

Among Waterford's 27 wins are Unioto (D3 Sweet 16), Fort Frye (D6 Final Four), Federal Hocking and Belpre twice apiece (D6 Sweet 16), Athens (D3 team with 18 wins), Marietta (D3 team with 20 wins) and Williamstown (top three team in W.Va. Class AA).

To come out of it with just one loss — to a Sheridan team that made the Elite Eight last year — is another example of how impressive of a year the Wildcats had.

“I never dreamed we'd be 27-1,” Close said. “I'm not saying — I expected to win this title, OK, but I didn't expect them to only have one loss. What they've done this season is amazing.”

MAKING HISTORY

With this being the first year of Ohio high school basketball expanding from four divisions to seven, Waterford becomes the first team ever to win the Division VII state championship.

The Wildcats' previous two state titles came in Division IV.

“We were hoping to get the last Division IV (title) and the first (Division) VII (title), but (Fort Loramie) got the last IV,” Close laughed. “We'll take that. That's something they'll always have. They got the first one.”

Lewis Hamilton's relationship with his new Ferrari team was pressure tested in Australia, where he finished a disappointing 10th on debut, and was frustrated by a bad strategy that cost him a potential victory, and constant radio chatter throughout the difficult race won by McLaren's Lando Norris

Frustrating Start for Lewis Hamilton and Ferrari at F1 Australian Grand Prix

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Lewis Hamilton's relationship with his new Ferrari team was pressure tested in Australia, where he finished a disappointing 10th on debut, and was frustrated by a bad strategy Sunday that cost him a potential victory, and constant radio chatter throughout the difficult race won by McLaren's Lando Norris.

Hamilton started eighth, and spent the first third of it behind the rear wing of Williams' Alex Albon. But, while the seven-time world champion hit the lead on lap 46 after those ahead pitted for fresh intermediate tires, Hamilton angrily stated over team radio that “we missed a big opportunity” after subsequent traffic and a late stop dropped him back to ninth.

Dropping a further place to tenth after Oscar Piastri overtook the Brit in the final lap did little to lighten Hamilton's mood.

“The rain always mixes things up and strategy comes down to timing and a bit of luck,” the 40-year-old said. “We took a gamble and made up places, but then boxing too late for Inters (intermediate tires) cost us, dropping us to the back of the top 10 with too much ground to recover.”

Hamilton also had trouble keeping his Ferrari in a straight line, showing just how much the Prancing Horse has to do to claw back its pace.

“I struggled with the balance, but it was an important race for learning more about the car and in different weather conditions, as well as gaining more experience working with a new team,” Hamilton said.

The Los Angeles Dodgers may begin their season-opening Tokyo Series versus the Chicago Cubs without shortstop Mookie Betts.

Betts, 32, began feeling flu-like symptoms during the final week of spring camp before the team left for Tokyo and continued to feel ill during the flight to Japan and workouts, according to manager Dave Roberts.

""He's been really sick, lost some weight, so we were trying to get him hydrated,"" Roberts told reporters, via the Orange County Register.

The Dodgers star did not play in Saturday's exhibition game versus the Yomiuri Giants, nor in Sunday's matchup with the Hanshin Tigers.

Betts skipped Friday's workout but participated in pregame drills on Saturday before the Dodgers played an exhibition game versus the Yomiuri Giants. However, he quickly got tired during a light workout on Sunday.

""Really showed some fatigue, understandably so,"" Roberts said. ""We'll see how he comes in tomorrow. He should be here for the workout. We'll try to do a little more tomorrow.""

If Betts doesn't show improvement on Monday, Roberts said he won't play Tuesday's season opener against the Cubs.

""I just don't think our training staff would feel good about that,"" Roberts added. ""We're really trying to be mindful of not just Opening Day,"" Roberts said. ""We don't want to put him in position where he could get hurt.""

Betts is planning to be the Dodgers' shortstop this season after beginning last year at the position before moving back to right field, where he's played most of his career. Despite the position switch, he still batted .289 with an .863 OPS, 19 home runs, 24 doubles, 75 RBI and 16 stolen bases. He was limited to 116 games due to a fractured left hand.

In Betts' absence, Miguel Rojas will likely play shortstop for the Dodgers with Tommy Edman, Enrique Hernández and Chris Taylor also providing options at the position.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

We are just hours away from Selection Sunday and the action is getting better all the time.

On a jam-packed Saturday of marquee showdowns, favorites ruled in major conference title games.

Duke ran away from Louisville 73-62 to win the ACC title, Houston put a cap on its brilliant season with a 72-64 win over Arizona in the Big 12 championship game and St. John's knocked off Creighton for the Big East crown. All three conference tournaments were won by the top seeds.

Did Duke or Houston put themselves in the conversation for the No. 1 overall spot in the NCAA tournament?

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

It's possible as the day started off with a pair of upsets in the Big Ten and SEC semifinals. Wisconsin knocked off top-seeded Michigan State and Tennessee held off Auburn to advance to their respective conference finals. Michigan also delivered a dramatic finish with Tre Donaldson hitting the game-winner with 0.9 seconds left to beat Maryland.

SEC semifinal: No. 8 Tennessee 70, No. 3 Auburn 65

Big Ten semifinal: No. 18 Wisconsin 77, No. 7 Michigan State 74

AAC semifinal: No. 16 Memphis 78, Tulane 77

SEC semifinal: No. 4 Florida 104, No. 5 Alabama 82

Big Ten semifinal: No. 22 Michigan 81, Maryland 80

Big 12 championship game: No. 2 Houston 72, Arizona 64

Big East championship game: No. 6 St. John's 82, Creighton 66

ACC championship: No. 1 Duke 73, No. 13 Louisville 62

With star freshman Cooper Flagg sidelined for most of the tournament, No. 1 Duke still ran off with the ACC championship. Could the Blue Devils be in the running for the overall No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament?

The last autobid of Saturday night goes to Grand Canyon.

That leaves 5 autobids left to claim on Sunday.

And yet another ticket punched as Alabama State finishes off an unlikely run to the SWAC championship as the 5 seed in the tournament.

UC San Diego is going dancing in its first year of eligibility for the NCAA tournament after recently transitioning from Division II. One of the best stories of the tournament.

Liberty knocks off Jacksonville State in the Conference USA final to clinch an NCAA tournament spot.

Duke leads 68-58 with 1:05 to go. Even without Cooper Flagg, the Blue Devils have rolled through the ACC

Bubble teams will have a close eye on this one, with UC Irvine a potential bid stealer if they win the Big West autobid here. UC San Diego may be in the field regardless of result.

Duke maintains a slim 17-15 lead into the under-12 timeout of the ACC title game. This has been a fun and frenetic start.

St. John's secures the double title, regular season and tournament, in the Big East. First tournament title since 2000.

RJ Luis (29 points) led the game-deciding surge in the 2nd half.

The Red Storm have this one in hand, leading 78-66 with about 2 minutes to play.

It was close until SJU went on a massive surge midway through the 2nd half.

The No. 1 seed Cougars finish the game on an 11-2 run to hold off a feisty Wildcats team.

That most likely secures Houston as a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tourney.

DAYTON, Ohio — For Avery Wagner, Kendall Sury and Avery Smithberger, their high school basketball careers ended exactly as they began — hoisting the state championship trophy.

Waterford's senior trio combined for 39 points to help lead the Wildcats to a nail-biting 48-46 victory over Fort Loramie in Saturday's Division VII state final at UD Arena. 

Wagner, Sury and Smithberger were freshmen on the 2022 team that won it all and are now the only three players in program history with two state crowns. It's the third state title overall for Waterford, which won the first one in 2016. 

The Wildcats lost to Fort Loramie 42-29 in last year's state final. They had to wait a year for a shot at revenge and didn't miss.

Wagner, who finished with team-highs of 16 points, five rebounds, four blocks, four assists and three steals, came up with two pivotal defensive plays down the stretch.

Waterford led 47-46 with 17 seconds left. Fort Loramie had the ball, but an entry pass into the post was stolen by Wagner. Brynnlee Pottmeyer was fouled and made 1 of 2 at the free-throw line to make it a two-point game. 

Victoria Mescher, who scored a game-high 19 points, took a short jumper to try and tie it, but Wagner rejected the shot out of bounds with three seconds on the clock. The Redskins were unable to get another shot off, turning it over with seven-tenths of a second remaining. The Wildcats inbounded quickly to Sury, ending the game and kicking off the celebration.

“These three young ladies right here have put us in this position,” said Waterford head coach Jerry Close, gesturing to his three seniors during the postgame press conference. “They come in as freshmen and get us a state championship. They've been fighting to get back. Got back last year and were disappointed. These girls have no idea how much they mean to me. The leadership they've given us all year — they have been patient, they have been leaders, they have been encouragers, everything you need the three young ladies to be to get us to this point.”

In last year's matchup, turnovers were a huge issue for Waterford. This time around, the Wildcats committed 15 — the same as Fort Loramie — but only allowed 14 points off those miscues.

“We knew they were going to come out and pressure us, because that's what they did to us last year,” said Sury, who had 15 points, four boards and four dimes. “We had so many turnovers (last year). We knew they were going to bully us out there. First quarter, we really held that to ourselves and got through that. Second quarter, they kind of got to us. So in the locker room we kind of talked about ‘They're bullying us. We can't let them do that.' Second half, we did way better with the pressure. We felt more confident driving in and kicking out for those shots.”

Fort Loramie head coach Carla Siegel felt Wagner's length was a key factor in Waterford handling the pressure.

“They have a 6-foot-4 girl they kept outletting to,” Siegel said. “We knew that was going to happen, we were just hoping we would sneak a steal here or there before it got to her. Getting steals is our transition for offense and we really didn't get into that as much today as what we're used to.”

The Redskins did, however, get plenty of offense. They shot 40.5% (15 for 37) and were 5 for 7 from the 3-point line.

“If you'd have told me before the game we were going to score 46 points today, I would've said we were going to win the game,” Siegel said. “I know it was two defensive teams going at it. Last year, it was 42-29. So if you would've said, ‘Hey, you're going to score 46 points today on Waterford,' I'd be like, ‘That's a pretty good number. I think we're going to win the game.'”

However, 46 wasn't quite enough as Waterford was 16 for 34 (47.1%) from the floor and made seven 3-pointers on 16 attempts.

Smithberger, who tallied eight points, four rebounds and two assists, got the 3-point barrage started in the final seconds of the first quarter when she banked in a trey from the corner. That gave the Wildcats a 12-7 lead after one. 

“We knew coming in today they were probably going to double down on Avery and Kendall,” said Smithberger, who added another 3-ball late in the second to make it 23-15. “(Assistant coach) Todd (Hilverding) told me I have to be ready to shoot. Getting that shot off and making it gave me the confidence to keep shooting. This game, we hit big threes when we needed them.”

Wagner, who hit a pair of 3-pointers of her own, added “We've been working on our shooting and the threes came in clutch this game.”

Sury, Elsie Malec and Ava Hurley knocked down one 3-pointer apiece.

Trailing by eight, the Redskins got a 3-pointer from Mylee Shatto and a basket from Mescher to cut it to 23-20 at halftime. Mescher then opened the third with another basket to make it a one-point game.

Waterford, however, responded with an 8-0 run to extend the lead to nine. Sury scored Waterford's final six points of the quarter to make it 40-30, but Ariel Heitkamp's off-balance triple at the buzzer made it a seven-point game with eight minutes to play.

The Redskins got a 3-ball from Autumn Turner and a basket by Avery Brandewie, who finished with eight points and a game-high 12 boards, to get within two. 

Sury scored Waterford's next six points to pull back ahead 46-40, but the Redskins used a 6-1 run, capped by Mescher's final basket of the game, to make it 47-46 with 1:02 left.

The Wildcats turned it over on their next possession, giving Fort Loramie the ball with a chance to take the lead, but the Waterford defense rose to the occasion. 

“It's guts. It's leadership. It's everything,”  Close said.

“You ask these kids — they're beat up. To go through three years of going to the state tournament and playing 27, 28, 29 games a year, it's tough. They've never, not one time, made an excuse to not step forward. That's what's special about the program right now.”

The Washington Wizards are as much of a rebuilding team as you can get, but they might have something finally working for them. Especially when Jordan Poole is making heat checks.

[Yahoo Fantasy Bracket Mayhem is back: Enter for a shot to win up to $50K]

The Wizards guard stunned the Denver Nuggets on Saturday with a deep, pull-up 3-pointer to break a 123-123 tie with 1.8 seconds left. A final heave from Nikola Jokić missed, giving Washington its sixth win in its past 10 games.

By Wizards standards, that's a hot streak.

The NBA's site measured Poole's shot as a 35-footer.

More encouraging for the Wizards was a career game by 2024 No. 2 overall pick Alex Sarr, who posted 34 points on 12-of-28 shooting, plus six rebounds and five assists. Before Saturday, his career high was 22 points. Poole finished with 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting.

Jokić finished with 40 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, which would have helped him in the NBA MVP race had Shai Gilgeous-Alexander not posted 48 points in a win over the Detroit Pistons the same day.

Make no mistake, the Wizards are still 15-51 and dead last in the Eastern Conference, but the win does make them a half-game better than the Utah Jazz for the worst record in the league. Before Feb. 24, they were 9-47 and on pace for one of the worst seasons in NBA history.

Three weeks ago, it seemed as if he was in danger of slipping into irrelevance. Now, he's in the center of the NFL's spotlight.

And everybody wants to know what Aaron Rodgers will do in 2025.

The four-time NFL MVP participated in the RX3 charity flag football game on Saturday. We've searched high and low for any indication that Rodgers had anything to say, to anyone about anything. We've seen no quotes from him.

The rumor mill will churn, with or without his input. And we've seen reports and contentions aiming in every possible direction: Steelers, Vikings, Giants, and even possibly retirement.

Retirement is a new one. While Rodgers hasn't addressed the situation personally (and silence contributes to, if not invites, speculation), reports that he wanted to return to the Jets have fueled the presumption that he wants to play this year. And that, if he wanted to play for a chronically misguided franchise like the Jets, he'd play for anyone.

That perception was fueled by the news that, during the week of the Scouting Combine, he reached out to the Giants. This confirmed the notion he wants to play — and reinforced the appearance that there wasn't widespread interest in his services.

Since then, the Steelers lowballed Justin Fields, the Vikings saw Sam Darnold sign with Seattle, and the Giants have added no one at the position (but for a one-year deal with Tommy DeVito).

On Saturday, TheAthletic.com posted a three-byline article regarding Rodgers's interest in the Vikings. It was the most definitive link yet between Rodgers and Minnesota.

At the risk of being chastised, privately or publicly, for pointing this out, the Cal connection between Rodgers and one of the three names on the article (Mike Silver) gives the report added credibility, since it's easy to conclude that Rodgers either supplied information or did nothing to tell Silver that he was way, way, way off.

Per the report, “Rodgers is hoping to sign with the Vikings.” And the Vikings have been “strongly weighing the possibility” of signing Rodgers.

The report claims that Rodgers wants a Darnold-style deal, at $33.5 million per year. That's on the low end of reasonable for a quarterback like Rodgers, whose agent might be pushing him to expect more. (The agent, of course, gets a percentage of whatever Rodgers receives. Moreover, few agents want their names to be attached to contracts that look objectively subpar.)

The item from TheAthletic.com paints the situation as a simple one. Rodgers is waiting for the Vikings to make a decision, and he has put the Steelers and Giants on hold until he gets an answer from Minnesota.

It's unclear why Rodgers would want to take the next step on the Brett Favre career arc, especially since joining the Vikings made Favre into Public Enemy No. 1 in Green Bay. Although fences eventually mended, Favre had to endure a game at Lambeau Field in 2009, during which he was loudly booed from start to finish. Rodgers might not be interested in having those who loved him for so long hating him, if only for one season or as little as one day.

The Vikings' interest in Rodgers is confusing, too. First, Rodgers has shown only flashes of what he was when he won back-to-back MVP awards in 2020 and 2021. The Vikings need to see what they have in J.J. McCarthy. If they make a two-year commitment to the 41-year-old Rodgers, McCarthy could (and perhaps will) request a trade.

Rodgers could be the difference between another “just good enough is just good enough” season for the Vikings and a return to the Super Bowl for the first time in 49 years. Or it could be a siren's song that crashes Minnesota's entire season, while also delaying if not destroying the possibility that they have a young franchise quarterback in McCarty.

Ultimately, it comes down to what Rodgers wants, and what the Vikings want. Are the Steelers and Giants leverage for the Vikings? Are the Vikings leverage for the Steelers or Giants? Do the Giants realize, given that they recently hosted Russell Wilson and Joe Flacco, that they're the team Rodgers is least likely to choose?

We'll all keep waiting. And until Rodgers speaks for himself on the matter, the reports and rumors and speculation and candid (or staged) beach photos will continue.

CHARLESTON — Top-ranked Gilmer County captured its second Class A state girls basketball championship in school history here Saturday night inside the Charleston Coliseum as the Titans smothered No. 2 Tug Valley and snapped the Panthers' 19-game win streak following a 66-22 domination.

The Titans of head coach Amy Chapman, who won their first state crown back in 2016 while also owning runner-up finishes in 2001, 2022 and 2024, held the Panthers of head man Seth Ooten to a season-low in scoring, which had previously been 41.

Allie Ellyson, who played in her final game alongside fellow seniors Malory Casteel, Summer Bourn and Layla Smith, was named tournament MVP after she saw 31 minutes of action and produced 18 points and six boards to go along with game-highs of nine assists and five steals.

“It means everything to me. I've wanted this for so long,” admitted Ellyson, who shared game-high scoring honors with junior teammate Lena Frymier. “To lose two state championships in three years, it was very mentally draining for me, but from the start of the season, and honestly last year, I knew that we could come back here and do the same thing but with a different result and that's what we did. It was just a surreal feeling to be doing this with everybody that I love.”

Ellyson's layup 1:54 in finally dented the scoreboard as a Kenzie Browning runner 1:27 later knotted the affair for the only time.

At the 2:39 mark, Ellyson assisted on the first of Frymier's five 3s to make it 5-2 as the Titans led the rest of the way en route to a 23-4 record.

“After I made my first 3 I knew my team was there to hype me up and it just helped lead into the next possession. I couldn't have done it without my teammates,” said Frymier, who chipped in four rebounds and three assists while adding “we will try to come back down here and we'll just have the best season next year, hopefully, and we are going to miss our seniors, of course, and just try to make the best of it.”

Pivot Ava Dobbins followed with consecutive deuces and Frymier added a foul shot before a putback by Dobbins had the Panthers in a 12-2 hole late in first which led to a 13-3 cushion after one.

“I just make sure to keep my hands up and follow the person with the ball and try not to fall into them, just go straight up and swat it out of the air,” replied Dobbins when asked about her blocking abilities as the junior went for game-highs of 10 stuffs, a baker's dozen boards and hit 8 of 12 from the field for 16 points. “This is my first triple-double ever.

“At first it was like nerve-racking but after that first timeout coach told us to calm down and everybody was a little wild so we calmed down after that and got our offensive flow going and made sure to do our stuff on defense.”

During Tug Valley's semifinal win the Panthers hit a dozen treys. Versus the Titans, Tug Valley missed all 11 of its attempts from beyond the arc and shot just 15.6% (10 of 64) from the field as Haven Deskins had the only Panther assist while leading the team with nine points and grabbing nine rebounds.

“We definitely keyed in on their guards. We have a very good defensive unit and we definitely have one at the helm, Malory Casteel,” said coach Chapman, who watched Casteel help keep TVHS leading scorer Kenzie Browning in check to the tune of five markers. “She did a great job on Browning. At one point she only had one point and every shot she took was a very difficult shot. Credit to Malory. That was her assignment and she executed it really well.

“Honestly, I think they are such a close-knit team. Their chemistry is very, very good. They definitely respect one another. They are very happy with whoever is successful that night and it wasn't just always one person. It was a total team effort all year and they just knew where the ball needed to go to at certain times of the season, and just defensively they committed to just sitting down and playing good defense all year.”

Laura Brannon's assist to Blair Dobbins got the Titans going in the second quarter and it was 18-3 with 4:44 to go in the half after Frymier hit from downtown.

Tug Valley got a pair of baskets from Bailee Hall, who had six points and tied Ava Dobbins with 13 caroms, as the Panthers cut the deficit to eight following a 7-0 spurt. However, the Titans ended the half on an 11-0 run to forge a 29-10 halftime bulge. Casteel and Ellyson canned two charity stripe tosses apiece, Ava Dobbins scored twice inside and Frymier drained a 3 after being left open from the top of the key.

“I'm telling you we've had a defensive effort all year. It showed up this week,” added coach Chapman, whose squad held TVHS to 13.3% (4 of 30) in the opening half.

“It was pretty impressive. The commitment to defense this week from the young ladies and the execution and just being able to stay with it all week long.”

Tug Valley, which won the state crown back in 2021 versus Cameron, couldn't make up any ground the rest of the way as the Panthers trailed 41-18 entering the fourth.

Despite the slow start and having half of their 14 turnovers in the opening quarter, Chapman wasn't overly concerned.

“I think nerves were showing a little bit. Once they settled down we started to do our thing pretty good,” said the coach, who opened her post game press conference by saying “first of all I want to give glory to God and I want to thank my coaching staff. They are wonderful to work with and they bring so much to the table as far as working with our young ladies. I want to thank our fans. Wow. They showed up this week and really supported us and supported us all year. Really appreciate everything they have done for us and I especially want to thank these young ladies.

“What a ride this has been. It's been incredible. They've worked really hard. They are wonderful young ladies and they absolutely 100,000% deserve being here right now with this trophy. It's just been a blessing. It's been a great week this week being around them. I hate to see them go. I want to thank my seniors. I love these girls. They are just wonderful, wonderful leaders and great kids in the community. We're going to miss the seniors. They are all just wonderful young ladies.”

Bourn, a senior role player, put the exclamation point on the championship when she capped the scoring via a corner 3 with 1:11 remaining thanks to an Erin Stoddard dime.

Blair Dobbins finished with seven points, seven rebounds and had the Titans' other three blocked shots. Casteel, who had two assists and five rebounds, joined freshman Kenley Hartshorn, who grabbed six caroms, with two points apiece.

The Titans were given the school spirit award as Ellyson, Ava Dobbins and Frymier were joined on the all-tournament team by the Panther trio of Hall, Browning and Deskins along with Tucker County's Raven Matthews and Greenbrier West's Preslee Treadway.

The first trophy of the season in England is up for grabs on Sunday at London's Wembley Stadium, where Liverpool and Newcastle United will face off to win the EFL Cup. The occasion comes with added significance for both sides, outside of the usual pomp and circumstance of a cup final. The Reds are the reigning champions, with the EFL Cup serving as the final trophy ex-manager Jurgen Klopp lifted before his summer exit and offers a chance at continuity since it could be the first title his successor Arne Slot lifts during his stellar first campaign with the club. For Newcastle, the opportunity is arguably more momentous – the team has not won a major trophy since 1969 and ending a decades-long trophy drought would be quite the accomplishment for manager Eddie Howe, who is in the midst of his fourth season with the Magpies.

Considering Slot's start to life in Liverpool, the EFL Cup feels like theirs to lose, though recent form suggests that things could get complicated on Sunday. The demands of a long season seem to have caught up to the Reds, who now also have the baggage of Tuesday's elimination from the UEFA Champions League in a penalty shootout against Paris Saint-Germain. Newcastle will be fresher, though they did play on Monday in a 1-0 Premier League win against West Ham. Player availability will also play a big role in this final, with concerns around Trent Alexander-Arnold's fitness and Anthony Gordon missing out for Newcastle through suspension.

Ahead of a statement-making game, here's what you need to know.

This tournament has been held since 1960, known as the Football League Cup for 65 years, and for the last nine years it's been known as the EFL Cup. No team has won the competition more than Liverpool, with the Reds making 14 finals and winning it 10 times. They won it last year against Chelsea thanks to a goal in extra time by Virgil van Dijk. Newcastle have made the final twice in their history ahead of Sunday's game, losing both finals in 1976 and 2023. The most recent final saw them lose to Manchester United 2-0 with goals from Casemiro and Marcus Rashford.

Liverpool are hoping for two trophies this season, while Newcastle are after their first domestic cup trophy since 1954-55. Our James Benge looked at the matchup ahead of the match and had the following to say about both.

Liverpool

""Certainly, what history there is to be made for Liverpool is a little more esoteric. There will be no treble, but a win on Sunday would draw Arne Slot's men level with Manchester United for the most domestic cups won in England. Sometime in April or May they will tie their great rivals on 20 top-flight titles. Add in their superior record in the European Cup and the statistical case that the greatest team in the country plays at Anfield becomes hard to debate.""

Newcastle

""Eddie Howe's side, backed by the transformative wealth of Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, are tailor-made to take on the best in the land. They showed as much in a semifinal against Arsenal where they rode the moments on the back foot, trusting that star forward Alexander Isak could win it for them at the other end. Newcastle have had to get to Wembley the hard way, beating Chelsea and Brentford on their way to the Arsenal semifinal they won so emphatically. That rather suits this team.""

Even with Liverpool's form, this game was always going to be an uphill battle for Newcastle but finding a way to win without Gordon might be too tall a task. Expect the Reds to put this week's Champions League defeat behind them and rediscover their strong performances of this season in order to win Slot's first trophy as the Liverpool boss. Pick: Liverpool 2, Newcastle United 0

Manchester United travel to face Leicester City and former favourite Ruud van Nistelrooy this evening.

Fresh from a morale-boosting Europa League win over Real Sociedad, the Red Devils turn their attention back to the Premier League. Ruben Amorim's side have little but pride to play for in the Premier League but the head coach will be keen to continue the momentum. United face Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals after the international break.

Hitting his stride 💫#MUFC || #UEL pic.twitter.com/iQnbD2JzHk

— Manchester United (@ManUtd) March 15, 2025

Bruno Fernandes scored a hat-trick in that win over Sociedad on Thursday and set a new record of 41 goal involvements in the Europa League. The midfielder has now scored six times in his last eight appearances across all competitions.

United face a Leicester side struggling at the bottom of the table. Mired in 19th, the Foxes are nine points from safety. Ruud van Nistelrooy was appointed as the club's manager in December, following an impressive interim stint at Manchester United earlier in the campaign. However, the Dutchman has lost 12 of his last 13 league games in charge.

Mason Mount could make his return to the Manchester United team after resuming first-team training. However, a cautious approach is likely to be taken with his reintroduction.

 

Amorim is still dealing with several high-profile absentees. Leny Yoro has joined Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez on the sidelines, while Amad Diallo (ankle) and Kobbie Mainoo (calf) are still in the treatment room.

There's better news on Manuel Ugarte and Harry Maguire, who could return. Patrick Dorgu is suspended for the Red Devils.

Manchester United predicted XI: Onana; Mazraoui, Lindelof, Maguire, De Lift, Dalot; Casemiro, Fernandes; Garnacho, Zirkzee, Hojlund.

Leicester host Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday 16th March 2025. Kick-off at the King Power Stadium is 19:00 GMT.

The game will be televised on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League.

On the 29th matchday of Serie A, Bologna and Lazio will share the pitch in a direct showdown for a Champions League spot.

Barring any postponements due to the weather conditions, the contest will take place at the Renato Dall'Ara. It kicks off at 15:00 CET.

Vicenzo Italiano has a full and rested squad to choose from. Lukasz Skorupski should start between the sticks, with Sam Beukema and Jhon Lucimi ahead of him. Davide Calabria and Juan Miranda could take the full-back roles, but Emil Holm and Charalampos Lykogiannis are also in the running.

Remo Freuler and Lewis Ferguson should combine in the double pivot, with Jens Odgaard in front of them. Benjamin Dominguez is pushing for a starting role, but the in-form Riccardo Orsolini and Dan Ndoye remain the favourites on the wings. Finally, Santiago Castro will be looking to overcome competition from Thijs Dalinga to maintain his spot upfront.

Bologna (4-2-3-1): Skorupski; Calabria, Beukema, Lucimi, Miranda; Freuler, Ferguson; Orsolini, Odgaard, Ndoye; Castro.

Except for Fisayo Dele-Bashiru, Marco Baroni also has a full squad at his disposal, even though Taty Castellanos isn't at his best physical condition, while Elseid Hysaj has only just returned to the group. Bouale Dia is thus expected to spearhead the charge supported by Mattia Zaccagni and Gustav Isaksen on the wings.

Matias Vecino is expected to play in a more advanced role than usual, acting as an attacking midfielder in front of Nicolo Rovella and Matteo Guendouzi. Adam Marusic had some issues in training earlier this week, but is tipped to start ahead of Manuel Lazzari, joining Mario Gila, Alessio Romagnoli and Nuno Tavares at the back, with Ivan Provedel in goal.

Pakistan won the bronze medal at the International Tennis Federation Masters 45+ World Championship after defeating Germany 2-1 on Sunday, according to a statement by the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF).

A total of 21 nations participated in the men's team event that was held in Manavgat, Turkiye in the 45+ age category known as the Dubler Cup.

Pakistan had dominated the group stage with emphatic 3-0 victories over Romania and the host nation, according to the PTF.

“Competing for the first time in this prestigious event, the team, led by captain Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and featuring Aqeel Khan and Shehryar Salamat, delivered an outstanding performance against some of the world's top tennis nations.” the statement said.

In the quarterfinals, the team overcame Czech Republic 2-1 to secure a place in the final four, the statement added.

“In a hard-fought semifinal battle against France, Pakistan fell just short, losing 2-1, despite an epic singles victory by Aqeel Khan. The doubles match proved decisive, where France edged out Pakistan,” it continued.

Pakistan team captain Shahzad Khan was quoted as having said, “I am extremely happy with the way the boys played from start to finish. Their dedication and hard work paid off, and I am incredibly proud of all the players.”

He commended the players, Mikaeel Ali Baig, Abubakar Talha, and Hamza Roman as well as Captain Shahzad Khan for their dedication and commitment, the statement continued.

Qureshi highlighted the remarkable progress made in international competitions, noting that while the team finished 16th out of 16 in 2023, and 5th out of 16 in 2024, it had won the championship this year indicating that the country's tennis was on the right path.

Before the start of 2025 members of our very own TENNIS.com panel asked if 2025 could be a make-or-break season for Holger Rune, a player with obvious potential but one who was falling behind Slam-winning peers like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner.As of Indian Wells, the former world No. 4 looks to be back on track with a first Masters 1000 final since 2023, defeating Daniil Medvedev, 7-5, 6-4 at the BNP Paribas Open to snap a seven-match losing streak in tour semifinals.""It means everything,"" Rune said after the match. ""The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing, for sure. Playing Daniil is, I think, for me, one of the toughest challenges on tour. We know each other well and we've practiced a lot, so it was super difficult. I obviously had the right tactic but he still made it so difficult because he's putting in great effort and great shots, just being super solid. I'm very proud of myself.""The No. 12 seed fell as low as No. 17 in the ATP rankings last year after struggling to back up a breakthrough 18 months that featured a 2022 Masters victory over Novak Djokovic in paris and two more Masters finals in Monte Carlo and Rome. The 98-minute victory over the fifth-seeded former world No. 1 not only puts him into his first ATP final since January 2024 (Brisbane) but also on the precipice of returning to the Top 10.

Still just 21 years old, Rune posted mixed results through the first quarter of 2025, pushing eventual Australian Open champion Sinner to four sets in Melbourne but failing to win back-to-back matches in any of his other ATP appearances, arriving under the radar to Tennis Paradise.A narrow win over No. 18 seed Ugo Humbert looked to reignite the Dane's famed fighting spirit, and he backed up the result with a statement victory (including a sick tweener) over No. 8 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, himself fresh off a title run at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. A first win over Dutch nemesis Tallon Griekspoor booked a rematch with Medvedev, who had won their last two head-to-head meetings—most recently at this very tournament 12 months ago.But Medvedev, too, has struggled to get going in 2025, posting solid results in February but lacking a signature result after bowing out of the Australian Open in the second round. The 2021 US Open champion scored an emotional victory over No. 20 seed Arthur Fils—where he quite literally jumped for joy after winning a third-set tiebreaker—but struggled in the key points against Rune on Saturday.""It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got decent leg work to reach many balls, but it was a very specific tactical plan that I made with my coach yesterday evening and this morning. It was all about finding the right pace and the right shots to hit. So many players miss too many shots against Daniil because he gets so many balls back and it makes you want to hit the ball even stronger and go for more. I'm super proud I found the right rhythm, the right tempo, and that I stayed super composed at the end.""

Rune scored the crucial break of the opening set, edging through the final two games from 5-5, and broke early in the second set to put himself in position for the win. Medvedev played strong with the finish line in sight, holding to love down 3-5 and taking a 0-30 lead as Rune served for the match, but Rune reeled off the final four points to clinch victory in just over an hour and a half on Court 1.""Mentally, I want to stay like I did today because today was a big match; I'd had two losses against Medvedev in a row. I think, in the past, I wasn't there mentlally, and it wasn't about the level. No matter who I play tomorrow, I need to stay focused, composed, and stay relaxed so I can go for it.""Standing between Rune and his biggest title in over two years could be defending champion Alcaraz, who will take on No. 13 seed Jack Draper in the second semifinal. Rune scored his lone win over the four-time Grand Slam champion via retirement in 2022, where he went on to win his Masters title in Paris-Bercy. Their most recent encounter came at Wimbledon in 2023, Alcaraz winning in straight sets en route to his own title.

							By 

	Lev Akabas


Data Reporter


	A number of sports leagues face the same issue: Modern playing styles that put increased physical demands on athletes' bodies are contributing to an increase in injuries.


	The average NBA star player in the 2020s misses more than a quarter of each season, nearly twice the number of missed games as the 2000s, when there were roughly 10 fewer possessions per game than today's “pace and space” era. Nearly 40% of all MLB pitchers who played in 2024 have undergone Tommy John surgery (UCL reconstruction), up from 27% in 2016, as throwing velocities and spin rates have increased.

	











	Tennis might be next.




	There have been 37 instances on the 2025 ATP Tour of a player retiring during a match or withdrawing mid-tournament prior to a match, accounting for about 6% of all matchups. That equals the highest number at this point in the tennis calendar over the past 20 years and 50% higher than the annual average of 23.8.


Novak Djokovic retired from his Australian Open semifinal versus Alexander Zverev with a muscle tear after one set and was met with boos from the crowd. Earlier in January, Reilly Opelka had to call it quits in the Brisbane International final after just 13 minutes of play. 


	The injury bug has not made its way to the WTA Tour, which has seen only 23 retirements or walkovers through the 2025 Indian Wells Open, just a tad higher than the 20.6 average from the past decade.


	Interestingly, this outlier year in men's tennis follows what had appeared to be a decrease in injuries. On average, there were slightly fewer retirements and walkovers in the early portion of the season between 2015 and 2024 than there had been between 2005 and 2014.


	This year's heightened total, therefore, could simply be a fluke. The sample sizes are small. Additionally, a stomach illness forced the withdrawals of multiple players from the Mexican Open in February.


	There are several concerning trends, however, when it comes to player health. The first is that they are simply spending more time on court. An analysis of ATP data by The Athletic in 2023 showed that men's Grand Slam matches are 23% longer than they were in 1999. Data from the WTA only goes back to 2008, but demonstrated a 5% increase during that time.

	











	Changes in racket technology have led to improvements in groundstroke velocity and topspin, meaning there are more grueling rallies from the baseline and fewer serve-and-volley points than there were 20 years ago. Players are also faster than in previous eras, allowing them to extend points with their defense and keep balls in play. All in all, points have gotten longer and require more physical exertion.


	A study by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) concluded that longer points increase the risk of injury. “The metric of minutes per point is notably significant,” the report said, “with injured players experiencing longer points per minute compared to the average player.”


	Then there are the balls. Many players across both tours have been outspoken about the quality of the tennis balls, which vary from tournament to tournament. The consensus seems to be that the newer balls are less aerodynamic and slower, requiring more power to drive them through the court, which again adds to players' physical toll.


	“Every week, practically every week, we have different balls,” No. 3 ranked Carlos Alcaraz said at a press conference in February. “I think last year there were many injuries, many players with elbow or shoulder issues. Something needs to change. I know they will change it.”


	Modern players are playing longer matches and engaging in a more demanding style of play, but they are not playing fewer matches. In fact, the average number of tournaments played by the top 100 ATP players in 2024 (25.12) was almost exactly the same as it was in 1999 (25.10).


	The early injury trend in 2025 is a concern for professional tennis given that physical ailments tend to increase as the year goes on. For instance, since 2009, there have been 50% more retirements or walkovers in the men's draw of the U.S. Open, the final major of the year, than in the Australian Open, which takes place eight months earlier in January.


	And while Sportico's analysis is limited to the first few months of the tennis calendar, a study published in the European Journal of Sport Science corroborates the overarching finding, stating that “an increasing trend in match retirements has been observed in both Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) events, especially in recent years, indicating a growing issue in professional tennis.”

	











	Tennis already has an unusually long season and short offseason when compared to other sports. Recently, the WTA has increased the number of mandatory tournaments on the calendar, while the ATP has also lengthened several Masters 1000 events to two weeks and provided a financial incentive for competing in more tournaments by way of a bonus pool.


	“Most sports have four months off, sometimes even six,” No. 2 ranked Iga Świątek said at a press conference last August. “Our schedule is crazy, and it's getting more crazy every year, which is scary.”


	Compounding the problem is the emergence of numerous high-profile exhibition tournaments throughout the year. Alcaraz, who voluntarily participated in The Netflix Slam, the 6 Kings Slam and The Garden Cup exhibitions last year, told the BBC in September that the sport's condensed schedule is “going to kill us in some way.”


	Indeed, the aforementioned PTPA report writes that “it is imperative to consider strategic adjustments to their playing schedules” and that “reducing the number of matches and extending the intervals between tournaments could prove beneficial.”


	Neither the ATP nor WTA provided comments for this story.


	Andrea Gaudenzi, the chairman of the ATP Tour, suggested last fall that top players could choose to play fewer exhibition and lower-level events if they feel overtaxed, and that the eight required Masters 1000 tournaments per year is “not a lot.”


	For now, the expansion of the calendar continues unabated, as the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Open will grow to 12-day events in 2025. But discussion surrounding the physical demands of the schedule has already begun, and a sustained uptick in injuries will only accelerate those talks.

Indian Wells

INDIAN WELLS, Calif. — Conchita Martinez, one of the queen bees of tennis, had done just about everything there was to do in the sport.

She had won Wimbledon. She had coached Garbine Muguruza to win Wimbledon. She had won five Federation Cup titles as part of Spain's women's national team, going on to captain the team and then to run the entire tournament, by which time it was known as the Billie Jean King Cup. She found time to captain the men's national team in the Davis Cup, too.

But last spring, a new type of opportunity arrived: molding a teenager with the chance to be a generational talent. Did she want to coach Mirra Andreeva, the Russian already making waves on the WTA Tour at 16?

Muguruza was in her early twenties when Martinez helped guide her to the Wimbledon title in 2017. There's only so much a coach can do at that point. Coaching a teenager is a chance to help define their tennis for the better, perhaps forever. It's also coaching a teenager … yikes!

Not really. A year later, Andreeva, 17, is the toast of tennis. She is the ascendant player on the WTA Tour, on a 10-match winning streak that brought her a debut WTA 1,000 title in Dubai, UAE, and took her into the top 10 of the rankings for the first time. Coco Gauff did not win one of those titles, one rung below a Grand Slam, until she was 19.

She has beaten all comers in that streak: Iga Swiatek, the world No. 2 and the dominant player in the sport the past three years, was demolished in Dubai. Andreeva beat Elena Rybakina there too, and when she played the 2022 Wimbledon champion again at Indian Wells on Tuesday night, it wasn't even competitive. Andreeva produced a 6-1, 6-2 masterclass.

Thursday afternoon brought tighter competition against Elina Svitolina, a former world No. 2, but the same result: 7-5, 6-3 to the young Russian. Andreeva didn't just win. She confused and beguiled an opponent 13 years her senior, moving Svitolina around the court, interspersing drop shots with power and angles in a way that teenagers rarely do. They are supposed to be one- or two-dimensional in their first years, and then develop an arsenal.

And then came Friday, a rematch with an extra-motivated Swiatek, still smarting from the loss last month in Dubai and trying to win a tournament for the first time since the French Open last year. She blasted her way into their semifinal with her usual brutal efficiency. Surely this was too tall a task for Andreeva, especially as she kept slipping behind in her service games, setting up moment after moment when Swiatek's opponents so often crumble.

Andreeva did the opposite of that, in a flurry of those flat, cross-court and down-the-line backhands that Swiatek couldn't touch. Or she hung in rallies until Swiatek's impatience got the better of her and the former world No. 1 sent forehands wide and backhands into the net. Swiatek had inroads in nearly all of Andreeva's service games, but she rarely took them to break points. Soon, she was swatting balls in anger and snapping at her coaches. Andreeva, cool and collected and courageous when it counted most, was marching into the final, having won fewer points and been under more pressure.

“I don't know why I felt so much confidence,' Andreeva said in her post-match news conference.

That may have something to do with the 52-year-old Spanish woman sitting in Andreeva's box, often with a resting grin-face as she watches her latest charge. Andreeva said Wednesday that she was always smaller than her competition growing up — at 5ft 9in (175cm), she isn't anymore — and that forced her to find ways to win without overwhelming power. She learned to use her legs, to counterpunch and to spin the ball in all directions. Those attributes propelled her during her breakout tournaments, the 2023 Madrid Open and the 2024 Australian Open, where she put top players to the sword and puzzled lost positions into winning ones.

Martinez, Andreeva said, has taken those skills to a different, more aggressive level. Now she uses her tricks on offense as well as defense.

“Conchita is helping me to not be defensive all the time, when I have a chance to step in and try to be aggressive and to go for my shots,” she said in her news conference after beating Svitolina. “It's working pretty good.”

It is. In 2025, Andreeva is winning a lower proportion of return points than she did in 2024, according to data collated by Tennis Abstract. She's making fewer of her first serves. But she is winning a higher proportion of points behind those serves — 69 percent vs. 64 — and her dominance ratio, which divides the percentage of return points won by the percentage of serve points lost, has increased from 1.14 to 1.22 despite her drop-off on return. She is dictating more than she is being dictated to.

Beyond the results, Martinez has evolved into an Obi-Wan Kenobi to Andreeva's Luke Skywalker, but only sort of. Skywalker never really tried to prank Kenobi as Andreeva often does Martinez, including Wednesday afternoon, when her coach was attempting to have a quasi-serious conversation with a journalist.

Cue the goofy faces and poses about 15 feet behind said journalist, attempting to mess with Martinez's game face. Mission accomplished. Then off went a giggling Andreeva, simultaneously embarrassed and thrilled to have one of the legends of the sport kvelling about her.

Oh, to be 17 and have it all happening for you, in ways that sometimes even Andreeva does not understand.

“I don't know why people are supporting me this much because honestly, when I was playing in U.S., my results were not great,” she said in her post-match news conference after easing past Rybakina. Andreeva lost in the first round in her only previous appearance here last year and lost in the second round in her two U.S. Open appearances.

“People are so energetic,” she said. “It kind of lights me up.”

Once that happens, watch out. Here comes a drop shot on an angle, followed by a whistling topspin lob. Or another searing, flat backhand diving onto the knot of the singles sideline and shooting off the court. Or, and perhaps most often, there's her forehand squash-shot slice, which converts a position of stress into one of control.

In Andreeva, Martinez has found a near perfect muse, a player who aspires to play with the creativity that Martinez had, with her own style of quiet determination and passion. Andreeva barely had a slice a year ago. Now, she can use it for defensive or offensive shots. Martinez wants her to develop a heavier forehand with more spin to make it more difficult for an opponent to get the ball back. She's working with her to play around with different trajectories, “instead of just hitting flat from nowhere.”

She wants her to have choices and is trying to teach her how to make the good ones.

“She's not making a lot of stupid decisions on the court,” Martinez said. “It's about having the good choices, waiting for the right ball, to compete against any player.”

Coach-player relationships can be overrated in tennis, a sport where there are few chances for a real tactical discussion and no timeouts. Plenty of players run through coaches like toilet paper, jettisoning them at the first patch of poor results.

There are some relationships, though, that evolve into so much more than discussions about forehands and backhands, serves and returns. Carlos Alcaraz has one of those with Juan Carlos Ferrero, Martinez's compatriot and a former world No. 1. Ferrero has guided Alcaraz for seven years, since he was 14.

Andreeva and Martinez have some way to go to catch up with them, but they are off to a good start. They are living similar versions of the same life in different eras. Martinez was just 16 when she made the fourth round of the French Open, in her third professional tournament. The next year, she reached the quarterfinals at Roland Garros and finished the year as the world No. 7. She and her compatriot, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, captured the imagination of the sport, a creative and passionate yin to the brutalist, machine-like yang of Steffi Graf.

Martinez knows what it's like to be on the verge of the world discovering you, and then to make that leap from tennis being an exercise in what is fresh and fearless to a world of expectation. First, they ask, “How did you do that?” Then it becomes: “Why didn't you do that?”

“Tennis forces you to grow up quickly but she maintains that playfulness in there, she likes to joke around,” she said. “I am very much like that too. I like to joke around. I like to bother her. She likes to bother me.”

Andreeva is a student of the game's history. She passes evenings in bed watching old tennis matches on YouTube. She knew all about Conchita Martinez. During her first months on the tour, though, she didn't realize that Martinez was the woman who kept smiling and nodding to her at various tournaments.

When she finally did, she couldn't believe that Martinez knew who she was, or that she would take the time to be cordial to her. Then, after she split with her coach and Muguruza retired, Andreeva's management team floated Martinez as a potential match.

Andreeva knew the resume. Wimbledon champion, coach of a Wimbledon champion. Good enough for her.

They had several talks to feel each other out, which was more Martinez taking the measure of this teenage girl born in Siberia, raised in Sochi, Russia, and who moved to the south of France to traipse the tennis world. She needed to make sure that Andreeva was ready to be serious, that she was hiring a coach and not a babysitter.

She quickly realized that Andreeva is mature beyond her years. She eats right, she rests, she listens to adults older and smarter than she is. She could look someone in the eye and have a serious conversation in three languages, soon to be a fourth as she picks up Spanish.

“She's a sponge,” Martinez said.

They tried a tournament together and Andreeva said she immediately felt comfortable with Martinez. “Super great,” is how she described their chemistry.

“She told me that it was the same for her, so thank God it's not just me,” she said the other day in a news conference, with her trademark grin and twinkle in her eyes. “I completely trust her with everything. I think she knows everything that's going on in my life. I don't know if it's good or bad, but, no, it's just like this.”

When they first started, Martinez worried that Andreeva might not be enough of a teenager, rather than too much of one. On the practice courts in France or in Barcelona, where Martinez lives, Andreeva would hit 10 great shots in a row, miss on the 11th and drama would ensue.

Martinez told her to give herself a break, maybe focus on the 10 good ones instead of the last miss. And when she hit a great shot, she needed to learn to acknowledge it, to enjoy it and be proud of what she has accomplished.

“I always tell her, ‘Wow, amazing',” she said. “You need to have fun with those things. Amazing drop shots, amazing angle. Wow, great, don't take it for granted. Enjoy that.”

There has been plenty to enjoy lately. Andreeva's ranking was hovering around 40 when Martinez came on the scene. She finished last year making the final of the Ningbo Open in China, where she lost against Daria Kasatkina from a winning position and broke down in tears at the trophy ceremony. Then she made the fourth round of the Australian Open, went 1-1 in Qatar and 6-0 in Dubai. Until very recently, she was the only teenager in the WTA top 100.

While the tennis world had long expected Andreeva's ascendancy, the steepness and immediacy of this year's trajectory has been a surprise. Not for Martinez. She couldn't make much of an impact last year, because she started with Andreeva in the middle of the season, but the off-season let the Russian get the full Martinez treatment. They combined fitness and weight training with their goals to achieve a certain style of play.

Now comes the task of maintaining the work ethic that has lifted Andreeva to her lofty heights so quickly. People think getting to the top 10 is the hard part. It isn't, Martinez said.

“It's not getting there, it's staying there — year after year, dealing with the pressure of defending those points and staying in a good frame of mind. And doing it all over and all over again,“ Martinez said.

She has shown few signs of doing anything else. Even after she got steamrollered in the second set against Swiatek, she told herself to run and fight for every point, to not worry how she got balls back but to get them back, however she could. When it was over, and Andreeva was 7-6(1), 1-6, 6-3 winner, Andreeva gave a nod to Martinez, a two-time finalist at Indian Wells, and a little ribbing, too.

“My coach lost in the finals,”  she said. “I'm going to try to do better than her.”

Nothing would please Martinez more.

Old Dominion women's tennis came out victorious in its first outdoor match against Troy, 5-1.

TROY, Ala. – Old Dominion women's tennis came out victorious in its first outdoor match against Troy, 5-1.

“Tough windy match today,” Head Coach Dominic Manilla said. “I'm pleased how we stayed focused and got the job done.”

ODU began Saturday afternoon with a strong doubles win, after No. 1 Sofia Johnson and Victoria Matasova downed Maria Guirguis and Valeriia Avdeeva (6-2) with No. 3 Marina Markina and Kira Matushkina following suit with a win over Leena Metwally and Gabrielle Leslie (6-2). No. 2 Lidiia Rasskouskaia's and Ulyana Romaova's match against Veena Nazar and Emilia Namyslo was suspended at 4-5.

No. 3 Rasskouskaia put ODU just one point away from claiming the match after she defeated Metwally (6-3, 6-3), and following suit, No. 1 Johnson and No. 6 Markina defeated their respective opponents Leslie (7-5, 6-3) and Namyslo (7-5, 6-4) to secure an ODU 5-1 win.

Jack Draper will make his Top 10 debut next week, rising to No. 8.

Holger Rune is bidding for his second Masters 1000 title. 

Both Rune and Draper have earned two Top 10 wins to reach the final. 

Two immensely talented players have come of age on the big stage at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden over the last ten days. Now, they'll go head-to-head in the final, as Rune and Draper will contest Sunday's men's singles final after pulling major upsets on semifinal Saturday at the BNP Paribas Open. 

Rune claimed his only previous meeting with Draper, a quarterfinal tilt at last year's Cincinnati Open, 6-4, 6-2, and the 13th-ranked Dane, who won his lone Masters title in 2022 in Paris, comes into Sunday's final carrying full confidence in his game. 

He's not gripping and ripping – Rune is playing a sustainable brand of tennis that can cause problems for anyone, anytime. 

“I feel like I can play like this day in and day out,” he said on Saturday after toppling two-time finalist Daniil Medvedev, 7-5, 6-4. “I'm not closing my eyes and hitting the lines on every shot like you can maybe do once per year. I feel like I'm definitely building the points, mixing up the tempo, grinding, finding solutions when they're tough. 

“I really try to focus on what I can control, and I try to find a way to win really.” 

Rune has upset No. 8-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas and No. 5-seeded Medvedev en route to his fourth career Masters final, but he has also rallied from a set down against France's Ugo Humbert and Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor. 

That type of grit has the Dane believing that he's evolved considerably, as a player and a competitor. 

“I don't believe I have become a worse player the last two years,” he said. “I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.”

Draper can say the same thing about himself. The Brit played the match of his life on Saturday, dethroning defending two-time champion Carlos Alcaraz with an inspired effort that put all his firepower and problem-solving skills on display. At times the 23-year-old's game was too hot to handle, even for a four-time major champion that has owned this court for the last three years.

Next he'll seek to put the cherry on top of a run that has already assured him of a Top 10 debut in Monday's ATP rankings. He knows he'll have to come down from an extremely emotional victory to finish the deal.

“To come through the match today, that means so much to me, especially against a player of Carlos' caliber,” Draper said after upsetting Alcaraz 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 in Saturday's second men's semifinal. 

“I'm looking forward to tomorrow already. That's the thing with tennis. You've got to get over wins like today, and all my focus and energy is on making sure that I do all the right things to give myself the best chance to win the tournament tomorrow.”

After two weeks of intense action, we're down to the final four players. In the women's final, world number one Aryna Sabalenka takes on teen sensation Mirra Andreeva before British ace Jack Draper faces a resurgent Holger Rune in the men's final.

Read on and we'll show you how to watch the 2025 Indian Wells men's and women's finals from anywhere with a VPN.

► Date: Today (March 16)► Start time: 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT / 6 p.m. GMT / 5 a.m. AEDT• U.S. — Tennis Channel via Sling or Fubo• UK — Sky Sports• AUS — beIN Sports (7-day trial)• Watch anywhere — Try NordVPN 100% risk free

Russian ace Andreeva is currently the form player on the WTA Tour and now has the chance to win her second straight tournament. The 17-year-old became the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 tournament in Dubai last month and reached the final with a stunning 7-6, 1-6, 6-3 win over second seed Iga Swiatek in the last four.

Andreeva will now play top seed Sabelanka in the final after the Belarusian avenged her Australian Open final defeat by Madison Keys with a brutal 6-0, 6-1 victory. The two have met on five occasions, with Sabalenka boasting a 4-1 record against the teenager.

In the men's final, Draper will play in the biggest match of his career after stunning defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals. The 23-year-old secured a 6-1, 0-6, 6-4 win over the Spaniard and will now be inside the world's top 10 for the first time.

Standing in the Brit's way is Rune who reached the fourth Masters final of his career with a comfortable 7-5, 6-4 victory over Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev. The Dane has only played Draper once before, securing a straight set victory last year in Cincinnati.

You won't want to miss any of the action so read on for all of the TV and streaming details and how you can watch the Indian Wells men's and women's finals from anywhere.

Away from home at the moment and blocked from watching the tennis on your usual subscription?

You can still watch Indian Wells live thanks to the wonders of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). The software allows your devices to appear to be back in your home country regardless of where in the world you are. So ideal for sports fans away on vacation or on business. Our favorite is NordVPN. It's the best on the market:

There's a good reason you've heard of NordVPN. We specialize in testing and reviewing VPN services and NordVPN is the one we rate best. It's outstanding at unblocking streaming services, it's fast and it has top-level security features too. With over 7,000 servers, across 110+ countries, and at a great price, it's easy to recommend.

Get 70% off NordVPN with this deal

Using a VPN is incredibly simple.

1. Install the VPN of your choice. As we've said, NordVPN is our favorite.

2. Choose the location you wish to connect to in the VPN app. For instance, if you're in the U.K. and want to view an Australian service, you'd select Australia from the list.

3. Sit back and enjoy the action. Head to beIN sports or another service and watch Indian Wells.



Tennis fans in the U.S. will need the Tennis Channel to watch the 2025 Indian Wells men's and women's finals.

The Tennis Channel is available through most cable packages as well as some of the best cable TV alternatives, including Sling TV, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream. Of these options, we recommend Sling and Fubo.

If you're not already a Sling TV subscriber, you'll want Sling Orange to watch the Tennis Channel. It costs from $45.99/month and includes dozens of other great channels. New users get a 50% discount on their first month, too.



Sky Sports will be showing all the action from Indian Wells in the UK, including the men's and women's finals, so if you already have a Sky subscription that doesn't include Sports, you'll need to pay £18/month to add those channels. The game will be shown on Sky Sports Tennis.

Whichever package you go for, you'll also gain access to coverage in 4K and HDR, so long as you also have an HDR-ready Sky Q box and HLG-compatible TV.

Sky Glass is another option. This gives you Sky TV within a 4K TV that has a built-in Dolby Atmos soundbar, and without the need for a dish. Prices start at £13/month for the TV, plus a sky sub on top of that.

If you don't want to shell out for a full Sky subscription, you could also consider its Now Sports streaming service. This gives you 24-hour access for £11.99 or month-long access for £34.99.

All sounds great, right? But if you're not in the UK, you can still follow the 2025 Indian Wells tournament live stream by using one of the best VPN services, such as NordVPN.



Tennis fans in Australia can watch every Indian Wells match, including the men's and women's finals, on beIN Sports.

To access beIN sports you will have to pay $14.99 a month or $149.99 a year. Both options include a 7-day free trial. You can also use the beIN Sports Connect app to stream the BNP Paribas Open 2025.

Traveling outside Oz? Don't worry — you can watch via a VPN instead. Our favorite VPN service right now is NordVPN, but you'll find others in our best VPN services list.

We test and review VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example: 1. Accessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service). 2. Protecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad. We do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid-for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.

The Hurricanes (6-5, 2-1) showed Notre Dame (12-3, 2-2) their fight on Friday as Miami Women's Tennis shut them out (4,0) at the Neil Schiff Tennis Center.

Junior doubles partners Raquel Gonzalez and Xinyi Nong kicked off the battle against Notre Dame with a 6-4 win over Notre Dame's Carrie Beckman and Maria Olivia Castedo.

Miami took home the doubles point after Alexa Noel and Maria Paula Vargas won a 6-4 matchup with Bianca Molnar and Akari Matsuno.

Following the doubles, Alexa Noel continued her successes for the day in singles play with an easy 6-0, 6-3 win over Akari Matsuno, and Hurricanes Jaquelyn Ogunwale and Aely Arai finished off the day with singles wins of their own. 

This win comes as the team's first top-25 win of the season, and Miami looks to continue its success as it faces Louisville on Sunday.

The Miami Hurricane is the student newspaper of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida. The newspaper is edited and produced by undergraduate students at UM and is published in print every Tuesday and online everyday during the academic year.","{'href': 'https://themiamihurricane.com', 'title': 'The Miami Hurricane'}"

PHOENIX — The Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine (SWSIE), a multi-institutional tech group spearheaded by Arizona State University, announced Wednesday it has invested $1.5 million into eight startup companies in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.

SWSIE was launched in 2024 as one of the first 10 tech groups under the umbrella of National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Engines. It specifically received its own startup funding of $15 million to research and execute solutions for water scarcity and equitable energy access in extreme desert conditions.

The eight startup companies being doled out funding are being supported in the commercialization process of their “proven model or prototype,” according to a press release. Models or prototypes awarded funding deal with finding industry solutions for semiconductor manufacturing, solar power, mining, atmospheric water harvesting and other environmental issues.

SWSIE processed more than 220 grant applications from 16 states before ultimately narrowing down their selections.

“These startups emerged from a competitive selection process due to the promise of their technologies, which stand to advance new industries and future-proof existing ones,” SWSIE CEO Brian Sherman said in the release.

Sherman added SWSIE's funding is just beginning, as this will be the first of “many funding cycles” while the innovation group continues to grow itself.

A few solutions SWSIE is actively working on in the Valley are saving water needed for semiconductor manufacturing (it is estimated to use eight million gallons daily by 2030), expanding the capacity of silicon-based solar cells and recuperating carbon emissions into fuel and “other sustainable carbon products.”

In addition to receiving funding for prototypes, the eight startups will have the opportunity to introduce their businesses to investors at SWSIE's Innovation Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 21-22.

“The overwhelming response to this funding opportunity underscores the dire need for investment in technologies at this stage, as well as the broad interest in new solutions for critical resource management,” SWSIE chief innovation officer Katie Pettinger said in the release.

JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — After being gang-raped by armed men while collecting firewood, the 28-year-old tried in vain to get help. Some clinics were closed, others told her to return later and she had no money to access a hospital.

Five months after the assault, she lay on a mat in a displacement camp in South Sudan's capital, rubbing her swollen belly. “I felt like I wasn't heard ... and now I'm pregnant,” she said. The Associated Press does not identify people who have been raped.

In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, it can be a daunting task to keep up with all the important news. To make it easier for readers, we've put together the Weekly Tech Recap, where we take a look at the top news stories making waves in the tech world. This week, Google confirmed that its Google Assistant will soon be retiring, Samsung began rolling out the One UI 7 beta update, and more.



Google has officially confirmed that its classic Google Assistant will be retiring later this year, and Gemini will take up the mantle of default assistant app on Android. In a blog post about the big change, Google said that the classic Google Assisstant will no longer be available on most Android devices or for new downloads.

The company also confirmed that tablets, cars and other devices that connect to the phone, such as headphones and watches, will also be upgraded to Gemini. The tech giant also confirmed that it will be bringing Gemini to other home devices such as speakers, displays and TVs.

Samsung has begun rolling out the Android 15-based One UI 7.0 beta update for its Galaxy S23 series in select regions, including India, the United States, and South Korea. The update, which was previously restricted to the Galaxy S24 series, is now available for users of the Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23+, and Galaxy S23 Ultra who wish to test Samsung's latest custom interface ahead of its official release.

As per user reports on Samsung's community forums, the beta update is currently available only for unlocked models. In India, the Galaxy S23 is receiving the update with firmware version S918BXXU8ZYC3, while the Galaxy S23+ and Galaxy S23 Ultra are receiving firmware versions S918BOXM8ZYC3 and S918BXXU8DYC3, respectively. The update also includes the March 2025 security patch, ensuring the latest security enhancements.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has introduced Copilot for Gaming, an AI assistant aimed at improving the gaming experience. Announcing the feature on social media platform X, Nadella said, “With Copilot for Gaming, you can jump back into games faster, get real-time coaching, and stay connected... all on your own terms.”

A promotional video posted by Nadella demonstrated the AI assisting a user in downloading Age of Empires IV using voice commands on a smartphone. The AI also provided guidance in Minecraft, suggesting the next move in a survival scenario and aiding in-game strategy.

OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has officially confirmed the company's plans to replace the iconic Alert Slider, a feature that has been synonymous with OnePlus smartphones for years. The decision, long speculated upon, has now been made public through a community post from Lau, who framed the change as an “evolution” rather than a removal. However, for many devoted OnePlus users, the news marks the end of an era.

For years, the Alert Slider has been a hallmark of OnePlus devices, allowing users to toggle between sound profiles – a feature particularly useful in meetings or quiet settings. Its removal is set to disappoint loyal OnePlus fans who appreciated the convenience it offered.

OpenAI is reportedly geared toward introducing several artificial agents soon. Various reports hint that the tech giant is working to roll out these AI agents on specialised domains.

A recent report from The Information hinted that OpenAI is working to launch three different AI chatbots. These AI chatbots are believed to offer specialised knowledge-based information on various domains. Citing sources, the publication suggested that these AI agents will be launched with monthly charges of up to $20,000 (approx  ₹17,40,800).

Noida International Airport recently inked a pact with Kyndryl to manage its technology infrastructure and provide operational support. Kyndryl, which was created as a spinoff from IBM's infrastructure services business, will support the upcoming airport's IT estate on Kyndryl Bridge, an AI-powered open integration platform. “A key driver of Kyndryl's growth in India is our deep sectoral expertise as we help businesses modernise IT and build for scale,” says Lingraju Sawkar, president, Kyndryl India, as he discusses with Sudhir Chowdhary their go-to-market strategy. Excerpts:

How are enterprises integrating AI into their operations?Customers in India have always been keen to adopt new technologies and drive innovation in their organisations. The Kyndryl Readiness Report perfectly sums it up, stating that India's leaders overwhelmingly prioritise technology modernisation with 96% considering it as a high priority and 37% already in a leading position. Generative AI (GenAI) remains a dominant trend with the conversation shifting from exploration to enterprise-scale deployment. Businesses are increasingly adopting AI co-pilots, agentic AI ecosystems, and domain-specific solutions to streamline decision-making and boost productivity. At the same time, concerns around data privacy and compliance is driving adoption of private clouds. Compact, cost-effective AI models are also gaining traction, offering a balance between security and efficiency. AI is also redefining cyber resilience strategies with advanced threat detection capabilities, predictive analytics and significantly enhancing our response times.

What new facets are favouring Kyndryl's business growth?Gartner predicts India's IT spending will reach $160 billion in 2025 as enterprises accelerate digital transformation, cloud adoption, and automation. We partner with leading enterprises across BFSI, automotive, telecom, and travel—the most recent one being with Noida International Airport (NIA). We are working with NIA to manage and modernise their technology environment powered by insights from Kyndryl Bridge. Beyond traditional sectors, global capability centres (GCCs) are a major focus area as there is an increased focus on empowering GCCs to drive strategic growth for their parent organisations.

How do Kyndryl Consult and Kyndryl Bridge help companies in their digital initiatives?As enterprises adopt new technologies and modernise their IT to stay competitive, they need to navigate challenges in legacy systems and technology integration while ensuring security and compliance. Kyndryl has built capabilities in Kyndryl Consult, Kyndryl Vital, and Kyndryl Bridge to help businesses integrate, monitor and manage their operations more efficiently and cost-effectively. Kyndryl Consult provides pragmatic transformational solutions for customers, breaking down complex challenges into achievable projects with actionable insights. By controlling costs, integrating business processes, and streamlining operations we ensure efficiency and stability. Kyndryl Bridge is an AI-powered, open integration platform that is transforming IT operations by automating tasks, identifying potential risks and optimising infrastructure performance. Kyndryl Vital, a designer-led, open and collaborative co-creation experience, helps customers solve complex business challenges.

What are the challenges you see in scaling AI innovations?AI and Gen AI have shown great potential to redefine business operations, yet scaling their adoption beyond pilots remains a challenge. AI's success largely depends on data readiness, but 65% of enterprises struggle with access to data and preparation. In India, where businesses manage vast and diverse data, ensuring its accuracy and security becomes critical. The AI talent gap, ensuring ethical usage of AI and ensuring regulatory compliance are some key challenges that need to be addressed through strong AI governance and ecosystem partnerships. India's digital success offers a roadmap – just as the India Stack drove large-scale adoption, enterprises can build on this foundation to scale AI responsibly and drive economic growth.

How do you plan to expand your India operation?FY25 has been a year of growth driven by strong momentum in Kyndryl Consult and robust signings and we plan to accelerate this further in FY26 by expanding margins and driving profitability. Our focus remains clear: to be the preferred technology services partner for enterprises in India.  We are successfully executing our 3A strategy—alliances, advanced delivery, and accounts —and we're scaling Kyndryl Bridge and Kyndryl Consult, that will help companies navigate complexity, mitigate risk, and drive business growth. India is at the heart of this strategy. With our talent, expertise, and execution capabilities, Kyndryls are helping customers prepare for an increasingly complex digital future.

The OnePlus 13 is primarily known for its Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered performance, Hasselblad-tuned cameras, and OxygenOS 15. However, the latest flagship from OnePlus offers much more than just these highlights. In fact, some of its lesser-known features are so handy that they elevate the user experience, making the OnePlus 13 an even more compelling flagship offering than it was perceived to be.

Here are five such features that every OnePlus 13 (review) user—and those considering getting one—must know:

The OnePlus 13 is the first smartphone from the brand to support eSIM in India. Unlike most phones with eSIM—especially from brands like Google and Apple, which offer a single physical SIM slot along with eSIM support—the OnePlus 13 includes two physical nano SIM card slots in addition to eSIM support. However, when using an eSIM, the secondary physical SIM card will be automatically disabled, meaning the phone can only accommodate two SIM cards at a time.

The OnePlus 13 is one of the first Android smartphones in the world that can be tracked even when turned off. This feature, which has been available on iPhones for a while, allows users to locate their device via Google's Find My network even when it is powered down. This can be especially useful in case of theft, as owners can continue tracking their phones.

The OnePlus 13 can function as a walkie-talkie, thanks to a feature called BeanLink. This allows the device to connect with other OnePlus and Oppo smartphones without requiring an internet connection, enabling users to make calls and send messages. Although it has a limited range, this feature can be highly useful in scenarios such as trekking or in areas with weak network coverage.

This feature ensures that the OnePlus 13 remains responsive even when the screen is wet. Combined with support for gloves mode, it makes the phone easy to use in extreme conditions. Simply put, the display on the OnePlus 13 will stay active and responsive in almost any environment.

Last but not least, the alert slider is a signature hardware feature on the OnePlus 13. However, this is likely to be the last OnePlus smartphone to include it, as the brand plans to replace it with a programmable button similar to the Action Button on the iPhone 16. The alert slider makes it easy to switch between different sound profiles without needing to turn on the screen.

This No Is Already Registered.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=technology+news","Experts warn Android users about North Korean spy apps","https://telegrafi.com/en/Experts-warn-Android-users-about-these-spying-apps-from-North-Korea/","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:59:14 GMT","

Download the app:

Cybersecurity researchers discovered a group of malicious apps on the Google Play Store that actually served as a spying tool linked to North Korea.

Researchers from Lookout Threat Lab identified five applications that appeared to be regular system tools, but were collecting private user data in the background, reports Telegraph.

These apps, available in English and Korean, were called:

Phone Manager

File Manager

Smart Manager

Kakao Security

Software Update Utility

Although they seemed like useful programs, some of them only offered basic functions, while others were completely non-functional.

Their real goal was to steal data – SMS messages, call logs, device location, phone files, even audio and screen recording.

These apps used new spyware called KoSpy, which is attributed to the North Korean hacker group ScarCruft (also known as APT37).

The group has previously been linked to attacks on journalists, activists and state institutions in South Korea and other countries.

""KoSpy is a new Android spyware that masquerades as user apps and targets English and Korean-speaking users,"" the researchers warned.

Once installed, these applications can download additional modules that enable:

Access to SMS messages and call logs

Real-time user location tracking

Collecting files from the device

Screen and keyboard recording (keylogging)

Activating the microphone and camera for secret recording

Attackers used these features to closely monitor user activity and potentially steal sensitive data.

Google has since removed these apps from the Play Store, but it is unknown how many users downloaded them before they were deleted.

This incident shows once again how important it is to check the sources of applications before downloading, read reviews, and pay attention to the permissions the application requests during installation. /Telegraph/

New Delhi: Nine miniature satellites designed and developed by Israeli high school students were launched into space, according to the Israel Space Agency (ISA).

Calling it ""the largest Israeli satellite constellation built by students in nine municipalities,"" the ISA said on social media platform X that the satellites were launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base.  

According to SpaceX, the satellites were launched at 8.43 a.m. local time, Xinhua news agency reported.  

The satellites, including the first-ever Druze satellite developed by students from the Druze community, were deployed into an orbit about 500 km above Earth, where they will remain for about three years with the mission of measuring cosmic radiation and its effects on electronic components, the ISA said in a separate statement on its website.  

The development of the satellites was part of the Tevel 2 national project led by the ISA and Tel Aviv University, at a cost of 10.5 million shekels (about 2.88 million dollars), the statement said.  

The project aims to connect different Israeli communities and promote equal opportunities in science and technology education, the statement mentioned.  

The Innovation, Science, and Technology Ministry, in partnership with Tel Aviv University and nine local authorities, has launched the Tevel 2 project with a budget of NIS 10.5 million.  

This initiative involves setting up satellite communication stations, allowing students to track mission data and manage operations.  

""We are witnessing a winning combination of scientific excellence, technological education, and societal integration,"" Uri Oron, director of ISA said.  

He added that the Tevel 2 project is a testament to the power of Israeli innovation.  

""These satellites will not only provide crucial scientific data but also serve as an inspiration for the next generation of Israeli space scientists,"" Oron stated.  

Designed to operate for about three years, the project aims to inspire Israel's next generation of space engineers and scientists.

WASHINGTON — National security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday that “all options are always on the table” when asked whether direct military action against Iran would be possible.

His comments come after the U.S. launched airstrikes Saturday on parts of Yemen that are controlled by Houthis, an Iran-backed group that has attacked shipping vessels in response to the war in Gaza.

“All options are always on the table with the president, but Iran needs to hear him loud and clear,” Waltz said in an interview on ABC News' “This Week.” “It is completely unacceptable, and it will be stopped, the level of support that they've been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others.”

President Donald Trump announced the strikes on Saturday, saying in a post to Truth Social that Houthi attacks “on American vessels will not be tolerated.”

“We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective,” Trump added.

Trump also warned Iran in the same post that its support for Houthis “must end immediately.” He told the nation to “beware” of threatening Americans and that “America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!”

The airstrikes on Yemen come as the Trump administration is also trying to end the war in Ukraine by meeting with Russian and Ukrainian officials to determine a path to a possible ceasefire.

Waltz said diplomacy is ongoing, but indicated that it was unrealistic to expect Ukraine would regain all of its territory taken over by Russia.

“We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest, is it realistic?” Waltz said when asked about territory that may be given to Russia despite Russia having launched the war by invading Ukraine.

“Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea?” he asked, arguing that the Biden administration's strategy was “essentially endless warfare in an environment that we're literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months, and could escalate into World War III.”

“We can talk about what's right and wrong, and we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground,” Waltz said.

Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said in an interview on CNN's “State of the Union” that his recent meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin “was positive.” Witkoff has been active in ongoing talks about the future of Russia and Ukraine.

Witkoff said in the same interview that he expects Trump and Putin to have a call sometime this week.

During his presidential campaign, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine in one day or even before being sworn in.

During a “Full Measure” interview taped last week with journalist Sharyl Attkisson, Trump said he “was being a little bit sarcastic when I said that.”

The strikes differ from the Biden administration's, Waltz told ""This Week.""

The U.S. airstrikes that bombarded Yemen on Saturday targeted and ""took out"" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday.

Speaking on ABC's ""This Week,"" Waltz argued to co-anchor Martha Raddatz that these latest strikes differ from the countless strikes the Biden administration launched against the rebel group, which the Trump administration has designated a foreign terrorist organization.

""These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth -- what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,"" Waltz said. ""This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.""

Waltz accused Iran of helping the Houthis attack U.S. warships and global commerce. Some 70% of global commerce is now diverting around South Africa to avoid the Houthis, resulting in higher shipping costs and supply chain issues, Waltz said.

""President Trump has found it unacceptable. What we inherited was -- was a terrible situation, and this is one of what will be a sustained effort to right that wrong and to reopen global commerce,"" Waltz said.

A source told ABC News Saturday that the strikes are not expected to be a single day event. On social media, President Donald Trump warned the Houthis that if their attacks do not stop, ""HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE!""

Trump also issued a warning to Iran, calling on the Islamic Republic to stop supporting the Houthis, and adding: ""Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!""

Here are highlights from Waltz's interview:

""Well, all actions are always on the table with the president. But Iran needs to hear him loud and clear. It is completely unacceptable and it will be stopped. The level of support that they've been providing the Houthis, just like they have Hezbollah, just like they have the militias in Iraq, Hamas and others. The difference here is the Houthis have incredibly sophisticated air defenses, and they also have anti-shipping cruise missiles, drones, sea skimming types of attack drones and other ballistic missiles even. They've launched dozens of attacks on multiple war ships, dozens of attacks, over 175 on global commerce, sank multiple ships. ... We will hold not only the Houthis accountable, but we're going to hold Iran, their backers, accountable as well. And if that means they're targeting ships that they have put in to -- to help their Iranian trainers, IRGC and others, that intelligence, other things that they have put in to help the Houthis attack the global economy, those -- those targets will be on the table, too.""

""What the president has completely -- has repeatedly said is that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one. And that's all aspects of Iran's program. That's the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences. But, either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button. We cannot have a situation that would result in an arms race across the Middle East in terms of nuclear proliferation. ... Iran has been offered a way out of this to make sure that we don't have a world that can be threatened by a radical regime, not only our ally Israel, but the entire world that would be threated with a – with – by a radical regime that could destroy, not only Israel, but its neighbors, and have the capability to hit the United States.""

""A fundamental aspect of the approach here from President Trump is that, you know, this has to be permanent. That's what we continue to hear from the Ukrainians, that, you know, we cannot have a situation where this continues to break down. At the same time, we are engaging with the Russians. What we heard from President Putin was that he will absolutely consider a ceasefire. There are some other thing that he would like to see that President Trump's national security team has -- is considering over the coming days. So, this back and forth diplomacy is -- is ongoing.""

""We have to ask ourselves, is it in our national interest? Is it realistic? We've talked to the Europeans about this, and the Ukrainians. Are we going to drive every Russian off of every inch of Ukrainian soil, including Crimea? And what the strategy of the Biden administration was, was, as long as it takes, as much as it takes, no matter what the timeline is, which is essentially endless warfare, in an environment that we are literally losing hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. And could escalate into World War III. ... We can talk about what's right and wrong. And we also have to talk about the reality of the situation on the ground. And that's what we are doing through diplomacy, through shuttle diplomacy, through proximity talks.""

When British novelist J.B. Priestley visited the Grand Canyon in the 1930s, he described it as ""all of Beethoven's nine symphonies in stone and magic light.""

""If I were an American,"" he wrote, ""I should make my remembrance of it the final test of men, art, and policies … Every member or officer of the federal government ought to remind himself, with triumphant pride, that he is on the staff of the Grand Canyon.""

In February, as part of the Trump Administration's effort to shrink the size of the federal workforce, approximately 1,000 employees were laid off across the Park Service. When the federal government fired some of the Park Service staff who work at the canyon, this was the scene near the South Rim: 

In the weeks since, there have been protests at hundreds of park service sites, from Acadia to Zion.

Jim Landahl worked as a seasonal ranger for years, until he got a promotion to a permanent posting at Grand Canyon six months ago. Then came the termination email. He said it stated that ""we lacked the necessary skills, qualifications, fitness to perform this job. And I didn't take that personally at all, because I knew that was a lie. I knew that was false. Whoever wrote that letter wasn't hiking with me down into the canyon in a hundred-degree heat to do our job."" 

Landahl's work involved restoring habitat disturbed by the reconstruction of the park's failing Transcanyon Waterline, which provides water to lodges and other infrastructure. Since he'd been in this position for less than a year, he was classified as a ""probationary employee.""

""The project is a critical infrastructure project for Grand Canyon,"" said archeologist Leah Gallo. ""And without it, there would be pretty much no Grand Canyon.""

Gallo had only been working on the project for two weeks when she was let go. ""I spent pretty much every dime to move here,"" she said. 

But this past Thursday, two federal judges ruled that the government must reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers across several agencies, finding that the layoffs were carried out under false pretenses – that performance wasn't a factor. 

It's currently unclear if and when Park Service staff might be back on the job.

Mindy Riesenberg is the chief of communications for the Grand Canyon Conservancy, a non-profit group that supports the park. As we enter the busy season, she says she's worried about people having to wait in several-hour-long lines just to get into the park. ""We had almost five million visitors last year at Grand Canyon,"" she said. ""And now I think we're down to about 11 fee collectors for the South Rim, for five million people a year.""

When we visited the canyon last weekend, visitors were waiting up to an hour-and-a-half to enter the park. In New Mexico, Carlsbad Caverns National Park had cancelled all ranger-led tours. Colorado's Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument announced it would be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays due to the staffing cuts.

Cuts also impact ongoing projects visitors might not see, like the Transcanyon Waterline. Riesenberg said, ""That project is going to be held up, because scientists and botanists and arborists who were replanting trees down there for shade, for safety, after that project, and that's all gonna stop. It's gonna hold the project up.""

Chuck Sams, who served as the 19th director of the National Park Service, stepped down in January. He said, ""To me, it looks like there's no rhyme or reason about why these things are taking place.""

During his time as director, Sams said, ""I absolutely felt that we needed more employees. National Park Service needs at least 15% to as much as 25% more staff on the ground in order to fully meet its mandate. It's important that these folks are out there. And now, we've seen a 10% reduction in staff. So it's gonna be detrimental to people's experiences in the parks.""

Asked for comment, the National Park Service's Office of Public Affairs told ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" ""The National Park Service remains steadfast in its commitment to serving the American public and preserving the natural and cultural resources entrusted to our care. However, NPS policy is to not comment on litigation related to personnel matters.""

Meanwhile, a group of current employees known as the ""Resistance Rangers"" has been tracking the cuts, speaking out on behalf of their fired coworkers.

One ranger, who asked that we conceal their identity out of fear of retaliation, told us, ""None of us want to be doing this. We're public land servants. We're civil servants who just want to be doing our job. I cannot separate myself from the mission. I am doing this for the love of public lands. I'm doing this for my nieces and nephews. I'm doing this for the people to come in 150 years.""

The ranger is especially worried about the crush of visitors who will be headed to understaffed parks this spring and summer. ""We were hobbled to begin with, and now our kneecaps are cut off,"" they said. ""In addition to that, we have $12 billion in maintenance deficit. Like, every single national park you ask me about that I've been to, I can point out six or seven high-priority products that need to happen in order to protect the integrity of that place. We just had our highest visitation year ever in history; 331 million people went to parks last year. That is an absurd number of people.""

Americans love their national parks. Last year, a Pew Research Center opinion poll found that, when it comes to federal agencies, the public has the most favorable view of the National Park Service. It ranked highest with Democrats AND Republicans.

Sams said, ""During my service as the National Park Service director, I had never met a member of Congress that didn't love the park that was in their home state. And I generally saw bipartisan support for the National Park Service. Moving forward, there has to be a strong understanding that parks aren't partisan. The flora and fauna, the natural and cultural resources inside of the park don't belong to any political party.""

Fired training specialist Lynda Jones joined the Park Service to serve her country. ""Both my parents are veterans,"" she said. ""They served in the military. And they instilled in me the importance of public service.""

While Thursday's court rulings have reinstated her position at Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (at least temporarily), the Trump administration has appealed – and a larger reduction in force is still possible. 

Which leaves park staff like Jones dealing with an uncertain future, worried about what's to come. ""This is the story of America,"" Jones said, tearing up. ""The story of the people who live here. And it doesn't matter your background or where you're from. These places belong to all of us. And they really are America's best idea.""

Voters are starting 2025 sour on the state of the economy and President Donald Trump's handling of it so far, even as his election to a second term sparked an upswing in positive feelings about the direction of the nation, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Buoyed by jubilant and unified Republicans, who are standing in lockstep with Trump and the expansive agenda he and congressional leaders are pushing in Washington, more registered voters see the U.S. as heading in the right direction than at any point since early 2004, though a majority still say the country is on the wrong track. Trump's approval rating also equals his best-ever mark as president (47%), though again, a majority (51%) disapproves of his performance.

Meanwhile, driven in part by a pessimistic shift among Democrats since Trump's election, just 18% of voters rate the economy as “excellent” or “good” — not as low as the poorest economic marks during the Biden administration, according to CNBC polling from 2022, but within a handful of points, and as low as that mark has been in NBC News polling since 2014. Majorities of voters disapprove of Trump's early job performance on the economy (54% disapprove, 44% approve) and how he's handling inflation and the cost of living (55% disapprove, 42% approve).

It's a new development for Trump, who never previously had a majority against his handling of the economy in a national NBC News poll. Now, he is confronting jittery markets and businesses amid his early moves to put tariffs on U.S. neighbors and other allies. Trump also faces questions from voters about whether he is sufficiently focused on their core issue of costs as he pursues other projects like reshaping the federal bureaucracy.

Overall, the poll reflects an America that remains deeply divided in the months following Trump's 2024 victory, as it was in the months before.

Voters narrowly disapprove of Trump's overall job performance, but the margin is closer than at almost any point during his first term. His personal ratings and the share of Republicans identifying as part of the MAGA movement have grown, reflecting the unity inside his party giving him wide latitude in a GOP-controlled Washington.

In another change from Trump's first term in the White House, the public has come around on his deportation-focused immigration policies, though voters are wary of his handling of other issues, including foreign policy.

Voters like the general idea of the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump-blessed effort to slash government jobs and spending. But they harbor reservations about its rapid-fire execution so far, as well as about billionaire Trump adviser Elon Musk, DOGE's de facto head.

And voters are split evenly on which party they'd like to see win the 2026 midterm elections, even as the Democratic Party faces record-low popularity and fractious divides over how to respond to Trump. (The survey was conducted March 7-11, before Senate Democrats provided a handful of votes to help resolve a government funding fight.)

“While this survey shows a mixed result for Donald Trump, Democrats are the ones in the wilderness right now,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted this survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies. Horwitt called Trump's upside-down numbers among independents “a flashing red light across the survey.”

McInturff noted how Trump has fortified his base over the last year. The political story of the next year, he said, will be whether voter dissatisfaction on the economy or other issues takes hold — “or the strength of the Republican and Trump base has maintained a very competitive election” in 2026, McInturff continued.

Trump's job approval rating (47%) and personal favorable rating (46%), along with the 44% who believe the country is on the right track, are at all-time highs in NBC News polling during his political career.

But they are also far below where previous presidents stood during the “honeymoon period” of new administrations, marking the polarization that has defined the Trump years. Slightly more disapprove of Trump's job performance (51%) and view him personally negatively (49%), and 54% see the country as on the wrong track.

Underscoring the deep partisan divide, Trump has the largest gap of any president in the last 80 years between his approval rating among members of his own party (90%) and his approval rating from the opposing party (4%), according to an analysis of three decades of NBC News polling and earlier data from Gallup.

Among independents, 30% approve and 67% disapprove of Trump's performance in office. A large gender gap still persists, with men approving of Trump's job performance 55%-43%, while women split the other way, 40%-58%.

Vice President JD Vance is viewed positively by 41% of voters and negatively by 47%. That compares unfavorably to the even or positive appraisals of vice presidents at the beginning of the previous three administrations, according to NBC News polls.

When it comes to the issues, Trump fares particularly well on immigration. Fifty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of border security and immigration, while 43% disapprove. A similar share, 56%, say he's bringing the “right kind of change” on the issue, while 25% say he's bringing the wrong change and 18% say he isn't bringing change.

But that's the only one of the five issues tested in the poll — border security and immigration, foreign policy, the economy, inflation and cost of living, and the war between Russia and Ukraine — that sees a majority of American voters approve of how Trump is handling it.

Forty-five percent of voters approve of his handling of foreign policy and 53% disapprove of it, while 42% approve of his handling of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with 55% disapproving.

The split between how voters see his delivery on immigration and on economic issues comes after Trump identified them as the twin pillars of his 2024 victory, telling NBC News' “Meet the Press” in December: “I won on the border and I won on groceries.”

Just 1% rate the economy as “excellent” and 17% as “good,” with 39% calling it “only fair” and 43% rating it “poor.” While Republicans are more likely to have favorable views of the economy than others, majorities across virtually every demographic still view the economy in an unfavorable light.

About one-third (32%) of voters say their family's income is staying about even with the cost of living, but 60% say it's falling behind. Another 7% say their family's income is rising faster than the cost of living.

Asked to gauge their satisfaction about how much Trump is doing to battle inflation, a majority say they aren't satisfied — 46% say they are “not at all satisfied” and another 9% say they are “not too satisfied,” while 20% are “somewhat” satisfied and 23% are “very” satisfied.

The NBC News poll also gauged voters' feelings on what kind of change Trump is bringing as president, with 40% saying he's bringing the right kind of change to inflation and the cost of living, while 30% say he's bringing the wrong change and 28% say he isn't bringing change.

On trade and tariffs, 41% say he's bringing the right change, 38% say the wrong change and 18% say he is not bringing change.

Overall, 46% said Trump is bringing the right kind of change, 30% said he's bringing the wrong kind of change, and 21% said he's not bringing change.

Voters are open, narrowly, to an effort to tackle inefficiencies in government. But concerns about Musk and about how DOGE is executing those cuts could be a public opinion liability for the administration.

Forty-six percent of voters say establishing a Department of Government Efficiency was a good idea, while 40% say it was a bad idea and another 13% do not have an opinion. However, DOGE itself is viewed unfavorably, with 41% holding positive views of the effort and 47% holding negative views.

And Musk is unpopular, with 51% holding negative views of the tech mogul and 39% viewing him positively. Half of voters (49%) say they have positive views about federal workers, while 21% view them negatively and 29% feel neutral about them.

Asked to reflect broadly on DOGE, one-third of voters said Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce spending and the size of the federal government “should continue as much more needs to be done.” Meanwhile, 28% say “it is needed but should slow down to assess the impact.” And another 33% say “it is reckless and should stop now before more damage is done.”

While Trump's standing is largely based on overwhelming support from within his own party, the Democratic Party now sits at its lowest favorable rating in the history of NBC News polling. Just 27% of registered voters view the party positively. That includes just 59% of self-identified Democrats.

Meanwhile, 65% of Democrats say they want Democratic lawmakers to stick to their positions even if this means not being able to get things done in Washington, while 32% want them to compromise with Trump to gain consensus on legislation.

Still, voters remain split as to who they want to control Congress after next year's midterm elections: 48% back Democrats, while 47% back Republicans.

As Trump dominates Washington, 53% of registered voters say Republicans in Congress are too supportive of the president, 6% say they are too critical and 39% say they are dealing with Trump in the right way. By comparison, 50% say congressional Democrats are too critical of Trump, 16% say they are too supportive of him and 30% say they are dealing with him in the right way.

A plurality, 44%, believe the Supreme Court is dealing with Trump in the right way, while 35% believe it's been too supportive and 14% believe it's been too critical.

A near-majority, 49%, say that CEOs of large corporations are too supportive of Trump, 29% believe they are dealing with him correctly and 12% believe they are being too critical.

And when it comes to the news media, 46% of voters say it has been too critical of Trump, 25% say it's been too supportive, and 24% say it's been dealing with Trump the right way.

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from March 7-11 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

The Houthis claimed a retaliatory attack on Sunday.

LONDON -- An Iranian general warned on Sunday of the potential for a ""decisive and devastating"" response to any executed threat, a day after the U.S. conducted strikes on Houthis in Yemen.

Gen. Hossein Salami also denied that Iran had backed the rebel group, which continues to wage a campaign against international ships in the Red Sea and off the Yemeni coast.

""We are not a nation to live in hiding. We are a valid and legitimate system in the world. We announce it if we attack anywhere,"" Salami said in a speech broadcast in Farsi.

The general did not say Iran had been threatened, but that the country would offer a ""decisive and devastating response to any threat"" against it.

Salami's words echoed those of President Donald Trump, who announced on Saturday he had ordered the U.S. military to launch a ""decisive and powerful"" strike against the Houthis in Yemen.

""They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft and drones,"" Trump said. ""We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.""

A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that U.S. air and naval assets hit dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen, including missiles, radars, and drone and air defense systems. The official characterized the attacks as an opening salvo against the Houthis, and it sends a strong message to Iran.

On Sunday, the Houthis claimed a retaliatory attack they said targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier with ""18 ballistic and cruise missiles and a drone."" However, a U.S. official told ABC News this wasn't true. The Houthis said in a statement that it ""will not hesitate to target all American warships in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea in response to the aggression against our country.""

Yemeni health officials said the U.S. campaign had killed some 31 people, along with injuring another 101 people. Many of the wounded were ""children and women,"" the Ministry of Health in Sana'a said on Sunday morning.

National security adviser Mike Waltz told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday morning that the U.S. strikes ""took out"" multiple Houthi leaders.

Waltz said the strikes were more significant than those conducted during former President Joe Biden's time in office, which the national security adviser criticized as ""feckless.""

""This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible,"" Waltz added.

Asked if there was any chance of direct U.S. military action against Iran, Waltz replied, ""All options are always on the table with the president, but Iran needs to hear him loud and clear."" Iranian support for the Houthis, militias in Iraq, Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups ""is completely unacceptable"" and ""will be stopped,"" Waltz said.

Trump has made clear that Iran ""cannot have a nuclear weapon,"" Waltz continued. ""All options are on the table to ensure it does not have one, and that's all aspects of Iran's program. That's the missiles, the weaponization, the enrichment. They can either hand it over and give it up in a way that is verifiable, or they can face a whole series of other consequences.""

""But either way, we cannot have a world with the ayatollahs with their finger on the nuclear button.""

The Crabapple Fire in Gillespie County in central Texas, covering an estimated 8,640 acres, is now 40% contained, according to Texas A&M Forest Service.

High winds blowing through the southern U.S. this weekend have caused thousands of acres of wildfires in the state.

The Crabapple Fire is the second largest in Texas after the Windmill Fire in Roberts County in the north, which covers 23,000 acres and is 65% contained, the service said earlier.

Red flag warnings — which signal critical fire weather conditions — are currently in place over large parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming and South Dakota.

Video posted by NBC News' Georgia affiliate WXIA showed the metal awning of a gas station flipped over by heavy winds on the Villa Rica Highway. 

The legs of the awning, normally anchored into the ground, were hoisted into the sky and toppled upside down on top of the building.

Nearby, power lines and trees had fallen across the road, with emergency vehicles in attendance as staff tried to cut through the debris with chain saws.

A number of roadways in the area are shutdown.

Strong storms capable of producing damaging wind gusts and tornadoes have entered west-central Georgia, according to the National Weather Service.

It said repeated rounds of heavy rainfall could lead to an increased chance of flash flooding.

Power outages across the region have risen as the storm moves east.

More than 76,000 people are suffering power outages in Georgia, according to PowerOutage.us. Tennessee has 53,148 and Mississippi has 37,705.

Videos and photos posted on social media show extensive damage in Cave City, Arkansas, where a storm surveying team found damage consistent with an EF3 tornado.

In one photo, part of a church's roof appears to have been destroyed. A video shows debris, including wood from structures, strewn around parts of the city.

Drone video of Cave City shows damage to multiple homes and businesses from a bird's-eye view.

Another tornado struck eastern Alabama this morning, according to the National Weather Service office in Birmingham, which posted a picture of employees taking shelter.

The twister touched down just northwest of the town of Cusseta, in Chambers County, and was heading toward Huguley — a census-designated place — and  the city of Lanett, the weather service said on X shortly after 12 a.m. local time.

The tornado was confirmed via radar, it said.

In another post a few minutes later, the Birmingham office posted a photo of workers taking cover.

""Our staff took shelter when a tornado-warned storm was approaching our office. (Our break room is our safe room.),"" the post read.

More than 185,000 utility customers were without power tonight in six states affected by the late-winter weather front that fanned flames and produced powerful tornadoes this weekend.

Missouri, the location of multiple tornadoes Friday night into Saturday morning, had the most customers without power, according to PowerOutage.us, at 68,798.

Alabama had 51,393; Georgia, 26,667; Tennessee, 16,451; Illinois, 10,074; and Mississippi, 12,248.

""Crews are currently working to restore power as quickly as possible,"" Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said at a news conference earlier in the day.

While dozens of tornadoes have been reported over the weekend as this deadly storm moves over Alabama and Tennessee today, few have been officially confirmed.

The tornado that struck Cave City, Arkansas, was verified by National Weather Service spotters on the ground, who estimated it reached EF3 strength last night, indicating it produced sustained winds between 136 and 165 mph.

The National Weather Service office for Little Rock, Arkansas, said it has fielded inquiries asking why it's taking so long to verify other tornadoes as some wonder if their communities have been forgotten.

The answer: ""Storm surveys take time.""

The weather service deploys tornado observers on the ground, often on a next-day basis, as their safety amid atmospheric upheaval and its aftermath is an important consideration.

The service trains them via ""storm spotter training"" courses before sending them to communities where tornadoes have been reported. An introductory course takes two hours.

Spotters measure the length and width of a damage path and note specific examples of destruction, such as felled branches, uprooted trees, blown-out windows and flattened structures, which can indicate a tornado's strength on the National Weather Service's Enhanced Fujita Scale, the weather service said.

These eyes and ears on the ground are then tasked with writing a summary that includes GPS locations and estimations of damage and strength, which may require consultation with weather service experts, according to the  agency.

Here's an example of a survey summary — a report usually produced for every tornado analyzed on the ground.

Reports for the cluster of tornadoes this weekend won't be instant, the Little Rock weather service office said today, asking for patience.

""Rest assured we will get to you,"" it said.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves today reported five additional weather-related deaths, bringing the total number of weather-blamed fatalities in the state to six and the storm total across six states to 34.

The Mississippi fatalities included two in Jefferson Davis County and three in Walthall County, the governor said in a statement on Saturday night. Another weather-related death in the state was reported in Covington County.

He also said three more people, including two from Covington County and one from Walthall County, are believed missing. Twenty-nine people sustained weather-related injuries across the state, the governor said.

Reeves declared a state of emergency for all areas of the state affected by the tornado-producing storm front as is moved east today. The move will allow state government agencies to ""discharge their emergency responsibilities,"" according to the governor's proclamation.

He said storm damage was reported in 21 counties since Friday.

""Please pray for those who lost their life, those who are missing and those leading the search efforts, those who are healing, and their families,"" Reeves said.

The National Weather Service office that covers St. Louis and surrounding communities said today it has confirmed three of the multiple tornadoes reported in the region overnight.

A tornado that struck Jefferson County southwest of St. Louis and spun from Hillsboro to Arnold was determined to have EF2 strength on a 1-5 scale used by federal forecasters, the weather service office based in St. Charles said on X.

That would mean it produced sustained winds between 111 and 135 mph.

A second one near Villa Ridge, a small community about 43 miles west of St. Louis, was also determined to have struck at EF2 strength, it said.

A third south of Union, a small city about 50 miles west of St. Louis, was estimated to strike at EF1 strength, the weather service said. That level is defined by sustained winds of 86 to 110 mph.

""We will continue surveying other areas in Missouri and Illinois tomorrow and Monday,"" it said.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt declared a state of emergency today for 12 counties where wildfires boosted by the tumultuous and deadly weather front are ongoing, his office said in a statement.

The declaration allows the state to get resources to local governments more efficiently, it said.

At a news conference, Stitt said at least one person has died as a result of the fires, and at least 293 structures and 170,000 acres have been destroyed. 

""It was just a perfect storm,"" he said. ""We should have a good couple days here to get all the fires out.""

A few firefighters assigned to multiple blazes in Stillwater, a city 65 miles north-northeast of Oklahoma City, were treated for smoke inhalation and dehydration and released, the city's fire chief, Terry Essary, said at a news conference today.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health said 112 people were injured in the fires and extreme weather, with six of them treated for burns.

The Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management said there were 13 fires across the state today that are already approved for Federal Emergency Management Agency recovery grants.

NBC affiliate KFOR of Oklahoma City reported there were more than 130 fires in 44 counties across the state this weekend. 

Exact metrics were unavailable, but it appeared improving weather may be helping firefighters across the state get an upper hand. Evacuees in Stillwater were told they could return to their homes today, according to a statement.

The National Weather Service said a cold front was moving through the region today, helping to decrease temperatures but also pulling another round of wind behind it.

Fire danger was expected to increase again on Monday, the weather service said. Fire weather watches were in place for parts of the state today and would continue through Tuesday, it said.

One person was killed and several others were injured after two tornadoes touched down in Covington County, Mississippi, today, officials said. 

The death brings the total in the severe storm outbreak to 29. 

A tornado touched down in the Hot Coffee community in the northeast part of the county, downing trees and power lines, and damaging multiple structures, the Covington County Emergency Management Agency said. Several minor injuries were reported.

Shortly after, a second tornado hit the town of Seminary in the southwestern part of the county, killing one person. One major injury and several minor injuries were also reported, the agency said.

That tornado also impacted power lines, trees and structures.

Additional details about the death, the injuries and the strength of the tornadoes were not immediately available.

Covington County is about 60 miles southeast of Jackson.

Reporting from Villa Ridge, Mo.

A tornado tore through a neighborhood in Villa Ridge, Missouri, last night, uprooting trees, smashing vehicles and ripping the roofs off of multiple homes. 

National Weather Service surveyor Ben Herzog had been out assessing structural damage in the neighborhood today to estimate wind speeds and classify the storm, which was later determined to be an EF2. 

Joy Azddou and her family barely made it to the basement before the tornado struck their home in Villa Ridge. Their home was the first Herzog assessed for damage. 

Within seconds of reaching safety, the windows shattered, and debris came crashing down around them. 

“We were just crouching down. It felt like the house was coming down on us,” she said, recalling the terrifying moments as she shielded her three children.

Azddou was aware of the tornado warning but assumed it would be nothing more than strong winds or hail.

“We get a lot of tornado warnings in Missouri. We just thought it was another thing — it's springtime,” Azddou said. But when the wind picked up and the power flickered, she knew it was time to act.

“That's when I was like, ‘Let's go, let's go, let's go — everybody to the basement.' And we barely made it down there before the windows blew,” she said.

Now, Azddou says without renters insurance, she doesn't know how they'll start over.

“It feels unreal. We're devastated,” she said. “We have very little to begin with, and we're just scared. We don't know what we're going to do at this point.”

Across the street, another family was also facing a terrifying reality.

Isaac Purnell said he initially dismissed his wife's concerns when she suggested they take cover. Moments later, the tornado ripped through their home as their 1-year-old slept.

“As soon as I saw the roof come off, I felt all the air. The ceiling dropped in, insulation was everywhere, so I just jumped off the steps,” Purnell said. “The whole room door blew off and blew me into the wall. I crawled into my son's room, tipped over his crib, and curled up with him in the corner until the storm passed.” 

The storm has killed 12 people across the state.

Eight people were killed in a crash that involved more than 50 vehicles during a wind-whipped dust storm in Sherman County, Kansas, yesterday, the Kansas Highway Patrol said today.

The fatalities bring the total number of deaths related to a storm system that moved from the southern Plains to Alabama and Tennessee to 28. 

The crashes were reported about 3:22 p.m. yesterday on Interstate 70, near milepost 28 in Sherman County, the Kansas Highway Patrol said in a statement.

Multiple others were injured and hospitalized, the highway patrol said. An exact number of injured people was unavailable.

""A strong weather front with high winds moved into northwest Kansas from Colorado, causing a severe dust storm,"" it said. ""With near zero visibility, traffic began to slow, resulting in multiple crashes.""

“My thoughts are with those affected by this tragic event,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in the statement. “I encourage all motorists to remain vigilant as the potential for further weather events continue today. 

The crashes were under investigation, the highway patrol said.

Those trying to reach missing loved ones believed to be involved in the crashes can call the Kansas Highway Patrol at 785-827-4437. 

The interstate remained closed. Calvin Reed, secretary of the Kansas Department of Transportation, said reopening ""will take time.""

A roiling low-pressure system is associated with dozens of tornado reports, fires in Texas and Oklahoma, and dust clouds that have hampered visibility on the southern side of the system.

After surveying damage from an EF3 tornado in Cave City today, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders warned that recovery could take months.

""It's one thing to see pictures and videos,"" the governor said at a news conference in the city of roughly 6,000 in northeast Arkansas. ""It's a whole other world when you see it up close and personal.""

She continued, ""It's hard to look at this level of devastation and not be heartbroken. I mean, these are people's homes, their businesses, their livelihoods.""

Huckabee Sanders said this morning she spoke to President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who she said had already committed to granting her requests for help.

The storm has been blamed for three deaths in Arkansas and injuries to 20 people, the governor said. Fifty National Guard troops and 40 state police officers have been assigned to supplement the response and secure the region in northeast Arkansas, including Sharp County.

The governor vowed both immediate relief in the form of food and water as well as help with long-term recovery, including repairing and rebuilding storm-ravaged structures. She warned, however, that making the region whole would take time.

""This is something that's going to take days, weeks, months, and we are committed to be there every single step of the way and help as much as possible,"" Huckabee Sanders said.

Cave City is about 130 miles northwest of Memphis, Tennessee.

The National Weather Service said three tornadoes west of Birmingham, Alabama, have been confirmed by radar.

The weather service's office that covers Birmingham said at 4:18 p.m. CT that one of the vortexes formed and crossed near Highway 69 in northeastern Tuscaloosa County and was moving toward the historic settlement of Gorgas, which is about 35 miles northwest of the city.

Then, at 4:30 p.m., it said radar confirmed another, in southern Walker County near Tutwiler Road, between Gorgas and Parrish.

At 4:47 p.m., it said a third was confirmed by radar in Pickens County, near the town of Gordo, about 80 miles west of Birmingham. It was crossing Highway 86 and moving toward Gordo.

In all three cases, the weather service urged residents in the area to seek shelter immediately.

A National Weather Service storm survey team found EF3 tornado damage in Cave City, Arkansas. 

The Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF) is a rating system used to measure wind speeds of tornadoes. An EF3 rating means the tornado had winds of 136 to 165 mph. 

The tornado that impacted Cave City had estimated winds of 165 mph, the very top of the EF3 scale, per the weather service.

Wildfires fueled by high winds in Oklahoma have burned down about a dozen homes in the city of Mannford, about 100 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. 

Ryan Snyder grew up in a home on Birx Drive that is now completely destroyed. His mother had lived in the home since the 1970s and had planned to spend Easter there with her six children and 20 grandchildren.

Holidays had always been a big deal to the Snyder family, Ryan said.

""We just bring a family together, any excuse,"" Snyder said. ""You know, we have impromptu cookouts up here, and you know, it's going to take a while to rebuild, and we just need prayers and everybody rally around us.""

 The community is very tight-knit, ""just like one big family,"" Ryan said.

""It's devastating when you turn around and look down the street at the houses, some still on fire, some just smoldering,"" Ryan said.

More than 20 severe weather reports have been reported today, including four tornadoes in Mississippi and Louisiana.

The risk for more severe weather across the South will continue for the next 10 to 12 hours. As of this afternoon, ""Particularly Dangerous Situation Tornado Watches"" remain in place through 9 p.m. CT for 10 million from Louisiana to Tennessee.

Jackson, Birmingham and Nashville are included in these alerts, with storms capable of producing violent long-track tornadoes, 75 mph wind gusts and tennis ball-sized hail.

Around 108 million people remain under widespread wind, flash flooding and wildfire alerts today from the Great Lakes all the way to the Gulf Coast.

Widespread wind alerts continue today for 79 million throughout the Plains, Great Lakes, mid-South and Gulf Coast. Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Nashville, New Orleans and Mobile are included in these alerts through this evening. Sustained winds will stay between 25 and 35 mph with gusts up to 60 mph possible.

Wind gusts yesterday reached over 80 mph across parts of Oklahoma and Texas, resulting in more than 100 wildfires throughout the two states. Today, 17 million remain under those fire alerts from Nebraska to Texas including San Antonio, Houston and Austin. Wind gusts will technically be lower than yesterday, reaching up to 50 mph. Relative humidity values remain as low as 10%, creating prime conditions for any new or existing fires to rapidly spread. 

Flood alerts continue for 12 million, with heavy rain targeting parts of the Ohio, Tennessee and Mississippi valleys. Rainfall totals through tonight will range from 3 to 6 inches, with higher local amounts possible. Rainfall rates of 2 inches and more per hour will also increase the risk for localized flash flooding.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency today ""in preparation for the severe and potentially damaging weather front"" moving toward the state this evening.

The executive order authorized the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency to mobilize resources, and will expire on Tuesday. 

""This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed,"" Kemp said in a statement. ""Before they retire for the evening, I'm urging everyone to be prepared ahead of time and to remain weather aware as long as this system is in the state.""

Severe weather in the form of tornadoes and damaging winds are forecast for parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama today, according to the National Weather Service.

""There will likely be multiple waves, with thunderstorms ongoing now through the morning and another round expected by mid-morning into the afternoon,"" the weather service said on X. ""Damaging winds (75+ mph), large hail (2”+), and strong tornadoes (EF-2+) all appear likely.""

Cities in the risk zone include Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee; Little Rock, Arkansas; Oxford, Mississippi; and Athens, Alabama.

The storms are expected to move southwest to northeast, and the threat will persist until 8 p.m. tonight, per the weather service.

At least four people were killed in three Texas car crashes due to high winds and low visibility caused by severe weather.

Two crashes involving multiple vehicles on Highway 60 in Parmer County killed two people, according to the Texas Department of Safety. Another fatal crash in Gray County involving multiple vehicles also killed two. 

""Smoke from the wildfire was also a factor, as was the blowing dirt in that crash,"" Texas DPS Sgt. Cindy Barkley said about the Gray County crash.

One person was killed when they drove into smoke from wildfires burning in Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt said today.

The fires have burned around 170,000 acres and destroyed over 290 homes and structures, according to Stitt.

""It was just a perfect storm,"" Stitt said. ""It was the humidity levels went down to kind of record lows below 10%, and then with the winds where they were, it just dried everything out.""

Stitt said he lost his farmhouse, located north of Luther in central Oklahoma, to the fire.

""So really, this kind of stuff hits close to home when those fires come through. There's just not a lot that you can do,"" he said.

Residents living in the line of the fires were evacuated, Stitt said, adding that there were no reports of fatalities from homes.

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has declared a state of emergency in the state after severe thunderstorms and tornadoes left destruction in their wake.

""The weather-related damage includes numerous downed power lines, creating the need for commercial vehicles to haul heavy equipment, oversized loads, transformers, necessary hardware, and other transmission and distribution equipment to line crews for the purpose of restoring power to the citizens of Arkansas,"" the emergency declaration read.

The state of emergency will remain in effect until March 29.

The low-pressure system affecting the southern and northern reaches of the nation's midsection is expected to pushes eastward, promising upheaval into the eastern U.S. through the end of the weekend.

As it moves into the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday, the tornado threat will shift to Virginia and the Carolinas.

On the northern side of the front, including the Upper Midwest and the northern Plains, blizzard conditions were forecast for the weekend, with 8 inches of snow possible in some regions.

The new week was expected to bring even more winter storm action, when at least two more low-pressure systems march eastward, the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center said.

The first of the two would likely form a solid, counterclockwise winter storm, a process the weather service calls cyclogenesis, it said. It will likely bring snow to the interior, including the Midwest and Great Lakes, with a second storm likely to bring a fresh wave of snow, rain and thunderstorms to a stretch of the nation from the Rocky Mountains to the Upper Midwest mid- to late-week ahead of the first day of astronomical spring on Thursday.

Several states throughout the Midwest and South reported tornadoes overnight, with widespread damage and multiple fatalities reported in Missouri. 

A gas station in Villa Ridge, Missouri, appeared significantly damaged, with debris surrounding it, after an apparent tornado hit the area.

Almost 270,000 utility customers across the Midwest and the South are without power as severe storms are expected to continue bombarding the region with tornadoes, widespread winds and even large hail.

As of 10:20 a.m. today, over 268,660 utility customers were without power, including over 138,000 in Missouri, 42,000 in Illinois and 37,000 in Indiana, according to PowerOutages.US. Over 30,000 were without power in Texas and 19,000 in Arkansas.

At least three people were killed after a storm system moved through Arkansas overnight, according to the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM).

Officials said the deaths were all in Independence County, northern Arkansas, but did not include any details regarding how they were killed. An additional 29 people were injured across eight counties, they added.

The number of victims ""are preliminary and subject to change,"" the division said in an update.

So far, 16 counties have reported damage to ADEM, including Independence, Clark, Hot Spring, Nevada and Fulton.

""Most counties are still assessing the full extent of the damage, but reports indicate impacts to homes, businesses and downed power lines and trees,"" the division said.

At least 10 people have been killed in Missouri as a result of severe weather that has been impacting the state since yesterday, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.

Six of the fatalities were in Wayne County, while two were in Ozark County, MSHP said on X. One person was killed in Butler County and another was killed in Jefferson County.

""We urge residents to stay away from debris-filled areas, watch for downed power lines, and follow regional emergency services for localized updates,"" the patrol warned.

The Associated Press

Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. 

“What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,” said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. “And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.”

There were three fatal crashes in the Amarillo area yesterday due to high winds and low visibility, said Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Cindy Barkley. The exact number of deaths in those crashes was not immediately clear.

At least one person died and two others were injured in a crash between three semis and four other vehicles in Palmer County, said Cesar Marquez, city manager and fire chief in Bovina. It was not clear if the crash was included in the three in the Amarillo area.

There was “so much blowing dirt we were getting shocked every time we got near something,” Marquez said.

Parts of northern Texas saw gusts as strong as 62 mph, according to National Weather Service data.

The dust was not the only concern. The same system whipped up wildfires in Texas and Oklahoma on Friday as the low-pressure system moved east.

The largest of the state's six active wildfires, the Windmill Fire in Roberts County, grew from 500 to 18,000 acres in less than a day, according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. The blaze was 50% contained Friday night.

I am compelled to write about the behemoth next door who has suddenly become noncompliant with the rules of the neighbourhood. The grandiose neighbourhood watchman has suddenly decided they will no longer protect us. Not without something in exchange.

So, let's see. Ah, yes, your sovereignty will do just fine.

As I go about my day and in my travels across the land, I try to formulate a plan as to how I am going to write about this crisis we face here in Canada. As often happens to writers, I am at an impasse. Even though I know the subject well enough, I am still faced with writer's block.

Then, as often transpires for me, nature steps in to assist me in my time of need. As I'm driving down a picturesque country road on a sunny late-winter day with snow dominating the landscape as far as the eye can see, from a lone tree in the corner of a farmer's field comes my answer. In a large old maple tree just ahead of me, I spot three figures perched in the branches. As I slow my pace, I begin to decipher the scene before me.

In a large branch in the lower part of the majestic old maple sits a large hawk, looking stern and nonchalant at the same time. Above him, much higher in the branches, sit two large ravens. The ravens are clearly rattled at the hawk's presence in their territory and they heckle the hawk incessantly, like two leather-lunged hockey fans screaming from the upper deck. They are so incensed and agitated by the hawk's presence that they would probably boo its anthem if they could.

Instantly, I get the picture. I pull to the side of the narrow country road and I offer a tobacco pouch for what I have been given. I give my thanks and gratefully make my way home to begin this column.

Whenever we face what is seemingly a new crisis in our world, we will often turn to our cultural teachings to try to make some sense of what it is we're up against. Human history is as cyclical as our journey around the giant glowing ball in the sky.

As sure as the day is long, we do find we humans do tend to be creatures of habit. We repeat old patterns — we will even walk pathways long forgotten, without a hint of remembrance for what took place there.

The Anishinaabek (Ah-nish-ih-naw-beck), Ojibwe people, are no different. And today, as I am given the scene of the hawk (U.S.A./Trump) and the two ravens (Canada and the First Nations), I am once again humbled as I marvel about how much we are given in life, often with the clues dangling before us like fruit for the taking.

As we feel the fiery breath of the monster below us, we all must turn to our teachings for answers.

Long ago, just after the first Anishinaabe was lowered to the earth, the Anishinaabek were amassed along the eastern seaboard of what became Canada and the United States. We were alerted by our prophets to heed the words and teachings of the Seven Grandfathers. In those teachings, it was prophesied we would encounter a great wave coming onto our land. The incursion would change our lives forever and the Anishinaabek were to migrate westward to preserve themselves. Thus began our great migration across Turtle Island and into the Great Lakes region.

Not everyone agreed to leave, and some stayed behind. They placed no belief in the teachings of the Seven Grandfathers. They became the first victims of the great incursion by Europeans onto our land.

Now, this is where this story could devolve into the colonization of First Nations and the irony of how Canada is facing an incursion from a former ally who would choose to disregard any and all agreements they had with them. While all of that is true and not at all dissimilar, it doesn't help the situation right now.

We are in a crisis — together.

The sovereignty of Canada and the sovereignty of First Nations are being threatened. Like the two ravens, we need to unite and protect what we have. Our ancestors moved to protect what we had prior to and during the War of 1812 when the U.S.A. threatened to annex our territory for the first time.

Like our grandfathers and grandmothers before us, our local First Nations chiefs and councils should now be mounting a response and encouraging the Chiefs of Ontario and the Assembly of First Nations to hold an emergency session. Our sovereignty is at stake.

Canada should be including the national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in its first ministers sessions. Each province should liaise with First Nations to arrange a proper response to the threat if needed.

No one is sure where all of this posturing from the U.S.A.'s seemingly unstable leader will leave us. But we'd be better served if we were to be like the ravens in the scene I was sent to view, and at least prepare a response. Simply booing the American national anthem may not be enough to deter these hawks.

Jeff Monague is a former chief of Beausoleil First Nation on Christian Island, former treaty research director with the Anishnabek (Union of Ontario Indians), and veteran of the Canadian Forces. Monague, who taught the Ojibwe language with the Simcoe County District School Board and Georgian College, is currently the manager of Springwater Provincial Park.

WASHINGTON — The Voice of America may not live up to its ambitious name for much longer.

Michael Abramowitz, the director of VOA, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was placed on leave, along with “virtually the entire staff” of 1,300. The announcement comes one day after President Trump signed an executive order to gut VOA's parent agency.

Some of VOA's local-language radio stations have stopped broadcasting news reports and switched over to music to fill the airtime, according to listeners.

Even top editors at VOA have been ordered to stop working, so employees expect the broadcaster's worldwide news coverage to grind to a halt, according to half a dozen sources who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity.

“The Voice of America has been silenced, at least for now,” a veteran correspondent said.

Voice of America is part of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also runs networks like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. Those networks are also on Trump's chopping block, as networks' contracts with the operators have been terminated.

While Trump allies argue that the broadcasters are bloated and outdated, advocates say that by dismantling the networks, the United States is ceding the airwaves to China and other world powers, thereby harming American interests abroad.

The United States has been funding international news and current affairs coverage intended for global audiences for decades. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have supported the attempts to promote accurate news — and democratic values — in places that are saturated by foreign propaganda.

The agency's mission statement, codified in law, is to “inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy.”

But the Trump administration has different expectations. An internal memo earlier this month said the mission is to “clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump Administration around the world.”

Trump appointed conservative media critic Brent Bozell III to run the parent agency and tapped election-denying former TV anchor Kari Lake to run VOA. Bozell's Senate confirmation hearing is months away, with Lake serving as a “senior adviser.” Lake signed some of the emails announcing Saturday's cuts.

Lake tweeted that the dismantling was taking effect because “the president has issued an Executive Order titled Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy.”

Trump's order said affected agencies should stop performing all work that is not statutorily mandated, and do the rest with as few people as possible.

The order was in line with Elon Musk's declaration in February that government-funded international broadcasters should be shut down altogether.

“Nobody listens to them anymore,” Musk posted on X. “It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money.”

Advocates for the outlets strongly disagree, pointing to the broadcasters as a bulwark for democracy. Those voices include Republican lawmakers.

“Gutting Radio Free Asia and other U.S. Agency for Global Media platforms counters the principles of freedom our nation was founded on and cedes leverage to the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea and other regimes,” Rep. Young Kim, a California Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on East Asia and Pacific, told Politico last week.

It is unclear what will happen next to the USAGM's various platforms.

In addition to the employees who were put on leave Saturday, some contractors who were working for VOA were told to hand in their badges.

Other staffers went to VOA offices on Saturday to gather their belongings because they feared being locked out altogether, sources said.

But in a recent memo, before Trump signed his order, Lake made it sound like the broadcasters will continue to exist in some fashion going forward.

“It is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet,” Lake wrote earlier this month. “That means we have an added responsibility to restore their trust while working efficiently and honestly to cover this consequential moment in our nation's history.”

Lake said she would modernize the agency “into something the American people are willing to support.”

Abramowitz said in his Facebook post that “VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard,” but sidelining the staff means that VOA won't be able to carry out its mission.

“That mission is especially critical today,” he wrote, “when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States.”

The American Foreign Service Association released a statement Saturday that it “will mount a vigorous defense of USAGM and the Foreign Service professionals whose expertise is indispensable to its mission.”

Residents pounded by unusually vicious weather across parts of the U.S. surveyed damage Sunday from violent tornadoes, high winds and blinding dust storms that decimated homes and other structures and left at least 35 people dead.

National Weather Service meteorologist Cody Snell said tornado watches remained in effect Sunday morning for portions of the Carolinas, east Georgia and northern Florida. He said the main threat would be damaging winds, but there is the possibility of more tornadoes.

“As we go through the day today, there still is the potential for severe weather from, say, the upper Ohio Valley and western Pennsylvania down through the rest of the mid-Atlantic and Southeast as we have this cold front that's still moving across the country, and it won't clear the East Coast until later on tonight,” Snell said.

The dynamic storm from Friday through Sunday earned an unusual “high risk” designation from weather forecasters. Still, experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

At least three people were killed in central Alabama when multiple tornados swept across the state. Among those killed was an 82-year-old woman who was in a manufactured home that was destroyed by a twister, Dallas County Sheriff Michael L. Granthum said Sunday.

In Troy, Alabama, parks officials said the recreation center where over 200 people had taken shelter would be closed due to damage from overnight storms. No one was injured.

“The Recreation Center has significant damage throughout the building,” the Parks Department said. “We are thankful the Lord provided protection over our community, and over 200 guests at the Recreation Center storm shelter on Saturday night.""

Missouri resident Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing trapped neighbors found five bodies scattered in the debris Friday night outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County. Scattered twisters killed at least a dozen people in the state, authorities said.

“It was a very rough deal last night,” Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home he said they rescued his aunt from through a window of the only room left standing. “It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.""

Authorities were still sifting through massive tornado damage.

On Saturday, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County described the “unrecognizable home” where one man was killed as “just a debris field.”

“The floor was upside down,” he said. “We were walking on walls.”

In Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves announced that six people died in three counties and three more were missing late Saturday.

Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched from their front porch in Tylertown as a massive twister struck an area about half a mile away near Paradise Ranch RV Park.

They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded video of snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles.

“The amount of damage was catastrophic,” Dillon said. “It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over. Everything was destroyed.”

RELATED STORY | Tips for navigating insurance coverage for extreme weather

Paradise Ranch said via Facebook that all staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the RV park itself.

“Homes and everything were destroyed all around it,” she said. “Schools and buildings are just completely gone.”

In Arkansas, officials confirmed three deaths.

Dust storms spurred by the storm system's early high winds claimed almost a dozen lives on Friday. Eight people died in a Kansas highway pileup involving at least 50 vehicles, according to the state highway patrol. Authorities said three people also were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.

More than 130 fires were reported across Oklahoma and nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed, Gov. Kevin Stitt said Saturday.

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 36 people across six states. 

The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Forecasters assigned an unusual ""high risk"" designation to the system, which was also blamed for icy winter weather in northern parts of the country and severe thunderstorms, including on the West Coast, on Sunday.

In all, extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south.

Heavy thunderstorms in the forecast for Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, prompted schedule changes for the 2025 Players Championship, CBS Sports reported. The tournament moved up tee times Sunday and grouped golfers together to ensure the last 18 holes would be completed before the evening.

In Kansas, at least eight people died and numerous injuries were reported Friday after more than 55 vehicles were involved in a crash due to a dust storm.  

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves reported six deaths across three counties as multiple tornadoes swept through the state. At least three others were missing, Reeves said. 

Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12, authorities said. The deaths included a man whose home was ripped apart by a tornado.

""It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field,"" said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. ""The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.""

Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri.

""It was a very rough deal last night,"" Henderson said Saturday, not far from the splintered home from which he said they rescued his aunt through a window of the only room left standing. ""It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night.""

Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe said that first responders, volunteers and faith-based partners ""worked tirelessly"" through the night ""in response to a series of devastating tornadoes and severe storms, and before that, dangerous and damaging fires."" 

In Oklahoma, the governor said one person died on the road, presumably due to smoke.

In Arkansas, officials reported three fatalities in Independence County, and 29 people were reported injured in eight counties in connection to a storm system that moved through the state overnight. Staff from the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management (ADEM) have been called to the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) due to extensive storm damage across the state. 

Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Saturday that she spoke with President Trump after Friday night's tornados in the state. 

""[Trump] said to tell the people of Arkansas he loves them and he and his administration are here to help with whatever we need following last night's tornadoes,"" she said in a post on X.

Further south in Texas, officials said four people died after weather-related fatalities, some during car crashes in the midst of a dust storm.

""It's the worst I've ever seen,"" said Sgt. Cindy Barkley of the state's department of public safety, calling the near-zero visibility a nightmare. ""We couldn't tell that they were all together until the dust kind of settled.""

Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers.

""This is terrible out here,"" said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. ""There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do.""

The severe storm front sparked tornadoes in Alabama as it moved eastward, killing at least two people. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said Sunday that the deaths were confirmed in Plantersville and Winterboro, both in the state's central region. 

Earlier, the weather service issued multiple tornado warnings across Alabama, advising residents to seek shelter Saturday night. In the east Alabama community of Elrod, a CBS News spotter reported that a possible tornado had uprooted trees and damaged at least one home. 

And in Sipsey, Alabama, north of Birmingham, a 911 call center told CBS News that a suspected tornado had caused possible injuries and damaged several homes.

At one point, weather service employees at the agency's Birmingham office were forced to abandon operations and take shelter themselves. 

""We're back. Much thanks to @NWSAtlanta for the help!"" NWS Birmingham wrote on social media. 

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has declared an emergency in anticipation of the storm's continued shift eastward. Early Sunday morning, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency used its social media accounts to repost a National Weather Service tornado watch for parts of southeast Georgia. The watch warned of isolated tornadoes, hail and wind gusts of 50 to 70 miles hour.

On the East Coast, heavy rain could bring flash flooding to some areas on Sunday. 

Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

""What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity,"" said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. ""And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area.""

The Storm Prediction Center uses five categories to warn of expected severe weather, ranging from marginal to high. Its forecast maps are color-coded, with the lowest risk areas in green and the highest shown in magenta.

On Saturday, the area of highest risk includes parts of Mississippi and Alabama.

The ""high risk"" designation is used when severe weather is expected to include ""numerous intense and long-tracked tornadoes"" or thunderstorms producing hurricane-force wind gusts and inflicting widespread damage, according to the agency's product descriptions.

On many days when the ""high risk"" designation was used in recent years, the forecasts became reality.

The weather service said at least five tornadoes were reported in Missouri on Friday, including one in the Saint Louis area. Several buildings were damaged in the storm, including a strip mall in Rolla, Missouri, where a tornado was reported Friday afternoon.

The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.

""Potentially violent"" tornadoes were expected Saturday in parts of the central Gulf Coast and Deep South into the Tennessee Valley, according to the National Weather Service.

The Storm Prediction Center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.

On Saturday, Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in Georgia due to damaging weather expected to move into the state overnight. It is scheduled to expire on Tuesday.

""This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed. Before they retire for the evening, I'm urging everyone to be prepared ahead of time and to remain weather aware as long as this system is in the state.""

Wildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.

A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile to an estimated 32.8 square miles, the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles before its advance was halted in the afternoon. 

In Oklahoma, the National Weather Service said a ""complex of extremely dangerous fires"" was located northeast of Oklahoma City, near Stillwater, and urged some people in the city of about 50,000 to evacuate on Friday evening. Officials issued mandatory evacuation orders via social media that included homes, hotels and a Walmart.

Overall, nearly 150 fires were reported in Oklahoma, Andy James, the state's Forestry Services fire management chief, told local media. The State Patrol said on social media that winds toppled several tractor-trailers. 

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said that 70,000 acres had burned in the state. About 293 homes and structures had been destroyed as of Saturday afternoon — including Stitt's own farmhouse, he said. 

Firefighters had been prepositioned in certain areas, which helps authorities jump on blazes early, James said. Firefighting aircraft were also deployed in some parts of Oklahoma and Texas but were generally unable to fly due to low visibility from smoke and dust, he added.

Officials urged people in some areas of central Missouri's Camden County to evacuate due to wildfires, and the State Highway Patrol warned via social media that they were nearing homes and businesses.

Roughly 120 miles of Interstate 70 in western Kansas were temporarily shut down due to blowing dust and limited visibility.

High winds also knocked out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, according the website poweroutage.us.

The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches were expected, with up to a foot possible.

Winds gusting to 60 mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions.

Television actors Priyanka Chahar Choudhary and Ankit Gupta, who rose to fame with their show Udaariyaan, have long been rumoured to be dating. However, according to Instant Bollywood, the two have now unfollowed each other, leaving fans wondering if they have parted ways.

Priyanka and Ankit participated together in Salman Khan's show Bigg Boss 16. Though they maintained that they were only friends, their chemistry had fans believing otherwise. After the show ended, they were often seen spending time together and sharing affectionate pictures on Instagram. In fact, recent rumours about their marriage were circulating on the internet. Amid this buzz, the portal shared a screenshot showing Ankit and Priyanka unfollowed each other on Instagram.

A post shared by Priyanka Chahar Choudhary (@priyankachaharchoudhary)

Their fans expressed disappointment, with one commenting, ""Oh no! How is this possible? One of my favourite jodis, Priyankit—I thought this relationship would definitely get a name."" Another wrote, ""Impossible, yaar… Aisa nahi ho sakta (this cannot happen)."" One fan remarked, ""Nazar is so real."" Another hopeful comment read, ""They'll come back stronger than ever.""

Although the Udaariyaan stars have unfollowed each other, they have not deleted any images from their time together. However, this has left fans speculating whether they have split up. Neither of them has ever confirmed their relationship, consistently referring to each other as “best friends.”

Ankit and Priyanka first met while filming their show Udaariyaan. Their on-screen chemistry won over fans, making them one of television's most beloved couples. They later entered Salman's reality show Bigg Boss 16, where their cute banter had fans rooting for them. Salman himself was often seen teasing them about their bond in the house. While Ankit was evicted by the housemates, Priyanka finished in third place but remained content with her journey.

In addition to their TV careers, the two have appeared together in several music videos, including Kuch Itnee Haseen, Baar Baar, and more. Priyanka and Ankit are now set to reunite on screen in Sargun Mehta and Ravi Dubey's show Terre Ho Jaayein Hum, which will stream on the YouTube channel Dreamiyata Dramaa.

Hollywood actor Tom Cruise and Ana de Armas are unmistakably head over heels for each other. Following a romantic Valentine's Day, the rumoured couple reunited for their second joint public appearance in London. Also read: Tom Cruise, Ana de Armas step out in London over Valentine's Day week; click selfies with fans

According to People magazine, Tom and Ana were spotted out together in London again. The actors were seen arriving at the London Heliport via helicopter the evening of March 14. Both Tom, 62, and Ana, 36, opted for relaxed, casual attire, exuding a laid-back vibe as they stepped out together.

The Top Gun: Maverick star dressed down in black jeans and a brown button-down shirt, while Ana layered a chic black trench coat over a crisp white tee, paired with jeans and sleek white sneakers.

 

Tom and Ana appeared to be in high spirits, engaging in lively conversation and sharing laughs with the Heliport staff as they went about their day. The rumoured couple was also spotted together at the same heliport on Thursday.

The entertainment portal has reached out to the actors' representative but has not received an immediate response.

Tom and Ana first sparked romance rumours over Valentine's Day weekend last month when they were photographed together for the first time. They were spotted walking in London's Soho neighborhood, with the Deep Water actor carrying bags of takeout from a restaurant. Both stopped to chat and take photographs with fans.

Neither Tom, who has been filming an Alejandro G. Iñárritu movie in England in recent months, nor Ana have commented on the rumours.

After a few days, the actor asked during a stroll in Madrid whether her outing with Tom was personal or work-related. She declined to answer, as seen in a video Spanish news agency Europa Press posted on February 17.

Ana has been previously linked romantically to Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis in 2023 and dated Ben Affleck from 2020 to 2021.

There it was in my inbox, greeting me at lunchtime on the final day of February with the subject line of, “On Sale! Louis C.K. ""Ridiculous Tour,” hovering over a giant photo of the comedian wearing his signature “well, shucks” grin.

The notice came from a Seattle venue best known for being the home of our local ballet and opera companies, a place that generally programs highbrow acts. When Patti LuPone came to the city in 2023 to headline a benefit concert, this venue hosted her. Ditto for John Cleese.

But with a few exceptions, a venue will host whoever and whatever the market demands. C.K., as the email boasts, is a six-time Emmy Award and three-time Grammy Award winner. One of those Grammys was awarded after five women came forward in 2017 to accuse him of sexual misconduct which, funny enough, wasn't mentioned in the email.

To anyone scoffing at this with a “Why would they?” — well, why not? C.K. transformed his accusers' horror at having him masturbate in their presence without their consent not simply into material but, you know, his “thing.” A sexual kink instead of sexual misconduct, a bit of light oopsie-doodle haha.

“I like company. I like to share! I'm good at it, too. If you're good at juggling, you wouldn't do it alone in the dark,” he jokes in 2020's award-winning “Sincerely Louis CK.”

It's all out there, so why wouldn't the theater's PR team be as upfront with it as C.K. continues to be? “Six-time Emmy Award, three-time Grammy Award winner and five-time non-consensual masturbator – that we know of!” Now there's an attention-grabber. Maybe insert a slide whistle sound effect! No reason to hold back. We're well into the age of everything being permissible.

This is not expressly about one entertainer whose upcoming tour is selling out large venues across the country, proving his command over his fandom holds firm. And that is not an argument for his absolution, it's a factual statement on par with saying that shopping at Amazon is convenient and Tesla car batteries tend to explode.

These are apt comparisons. Before Tesla CEO Elon Musk took a buzzsaw to our trust in constitutional checks and balances, people were still buying his cars despite multiple allegations of racist abuse at his plants and fatal accidents related to Tesla's self-driving system failures.

The New York Times exposing Amazon's brutal work culture a decade ago didn't slow its march to becoming a multitrillion-dollar company.

Americans do not let the mistreatment of a few people, whether five, 500 or 5000, get in the way of their comfort or good time.

Last week when Netflix announced its three-special deal with Tony Hinchcliffe, the comic who referred to Puerto Rico as ""a floating island of garbage"" at Donald Trump's pre-election Madison Square Garden rally, my reaction was the same as how I greeted that on-sale email for C.K.'s tour. “Of course.”

Fellow comic Marc Maron already called it days after Hinchcliffe dropped his rally set, as I previously quoted. “Fascism is good for business if you toe the line. Popular podcasts became tribal and divisive years ago,” he wrote. “Now they may be in the position to become part of the media oligarchy under the new anti-democratic government.”

The broader mainstream may have been introduced to Hinchcliffe by way of that Madison Square Garden tight 10, but he was already a star. Hinchcliffe hosts the top live podcast in the world, “Kill Tony,” which is considered a main launching pad for aspiring comedians.

He's also a superstar in Joe Rogan's Comedy Mothership solar system, tied to Rogan's Austin, Texas comedy club and its accompanying cadre of right-leaning headliners.

Netflix is a digital, for-profit venue following the money. According to a report in The Ankler citing Social Blade data, Hinchcliffe gained more than 36,000 new followers on X and 23,763 more on Instagram after the Trump rally.

“It was never my intention to swing an election,” The Ankler quoted him as saying onstage at the Mothership, “but god****t — right place, right time, I guess.”

As people frantically paraphrase Martin Niemöller's famous “First, they came for the socialists” poem in response to the detention and attempted deportation of activist Mahmoud Khalil, some have gotten bogged down in arguing which constituency they came for before Palestinians and campus protesters. Somebody will build that into a bit, I'm sure. 

But here's what we know: people are exhausted with all their anger and demands for justice resulting in nothing, including from figures they expect to do better.

Even Maron is about ready for the world to put a fork in him, addressing his cynicism over boycotts in his March 3 post. “Maybe public perception will change and maybe more angry people will once again believe that civil service in the form of candidacy will manifest,” he wrote. “. . . That's if voting remains a thing. But in the meantime, if you want to go out in the world and shop at actual stores and stop buying Teslas, all the power to you. Whatever gets you through the day.”

Joking about terrible things disempowers them. Joking about vilified people reduces their humanity. ""Everybody READ the 'first they came for' poem,"" posted one Bluesky user, ""And then IGNORED it because they decided who they were coming for was 'content' rather than humans.""

Now, now, you may be saying. If these guys aren't intentionally out to harm anyone, as they often claim, what reason do we have to fuss? Besides the shout-outs they've received from a White House that's dedicated to legislatively and extralegally inflicting maximum harm?

Comics are only out to make money. We would understand that if we only knew them through their podcasts.

Andrew Schulz, another Rogan crewmember, recently released his special “Life” on Netflix. He and his wife's fertility struggle and his entry into fatherhood are the heart of the set. He also finds room to bust out a joke – which kills, by the way – that every newborn baby looks Puerto Rican.

You may wonder what is with these guys knocking around Puerto Rico. One theory, and hear me out, is that the right wing made the island and its residents a safe target to be “othered.” Since many don't realize its Spanish-speaking people are fellow Americans, the ignorant can gleefully lump them in with other so-called immigrant invaders. Go ahead and joke about deporting them, because you can't.

If you don't follow Schulz's podcasts or, say, listen to him lovingly rave about how much New Yorkers love Puerto Rico and its people on Shannon Sharpe's “Club Shay Shay,” you might not know that he's laughing with them, not at them.

The thing is, the average giggler isn't a student of nuance, and even Schulz's avid listeners may not see anything wrong with him and his co-hosts taking casual swipes at marginalized people. It's all with love. Except, maybe, when it comes to the transgender community.

Schulz riffing on his infant resembling a Puerto Rican may be a tad more defensible than Hinchcliffe's bigotry nuke at Madison Square Garden. But Schulz helped a brother out in his recent conversation with Sharpe, explaining that Hinchcliffe was trying to joke about the very real environmental disaster that is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (which we're specifically naming since he did not).

“He was actually referencing, like, an actual climate issue with, like, recycling,” Schulz said, “But still, I think that if he was, like, in New York and working it out at clubs, he'd be like, ‘Oh, they're not going to get this. Let me change this for something else.' I don't think he, like has a personal vendetta, for Puerto Rico.”

Oh. Of course.

Comedy employs equations that decode the American psyche, like the classic “tragedy plus time” math, or a certain comedian's popular “of course, but maybe” bit. For example, of course former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo should have stepped down after he was accused of underreporting thousands of deaths among elderly residents in his state's nursing homes during the opening months of the COVID-19 pandemic to protect his reputation. That was dishonest and wrong.

But maybe that doesn't disqualify him from running for mayor of New York City; how much longer were those sick old people going to live anyway? Would Cuomo be worse or more corrupt than the hilariously bent Eric Adams? Debatable.

Cuomo also faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment, but maybe that's not disqualifying in the age where everything is permissible.

Adams denied the misconduct claims against him — of course! — as did fellow candidate Scott M. Stringer, who the New York Times reports was accused of sexual harassment decades earlier by two women.

Only two? That's not so bad. Besides, we've already established legislatively and recreationally that nobody cares about women's safety or well-being.

If they did, we wouldn't be talking about the real possibility of the Trump administration re-arming Mel Gibson, whose gun ownership rights were stripped away from him in 2011 under a 1996 federal law that prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from owning firearms.  

Gibson pleaded “no contest” to a misdemeanor battery charge for physically assaulting then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva while she was holding their infant daughter. 

But that was such a long time ago, and Gibson has made so many wonderful movies since then. The man directed 2016's “Hacksaw Ridge” and that was nominated for, like, a bunch of Oscars and Golden Globes. What's the worst that could happen if he loses his temper while packing heat?

We joke. We kid! That is pretty much all the energy we can muster to face life right now.

Experts on fascist regimes have been counseling all who will listen that among the first tactics employed by those seeking power is to overwhelm the masses to silence and inaction.

What we hadn't considered is the extent to which a complicit entertainment industry has been softening us up by elevating clowns into sages.

Before the legislative attacks on transgender people came jokes. Lots of jokes. Before that came #MeToo, which was dismantled by the near total lack of accountability for the famous men it ensnared, and jokes.

Helping that along were years' worth of jokes minimizing rape culture, and the racist, sexist yuks that were the hallmark of the ‘90s and aughts' political correctness backlash.

It's better to laugh than to sweat the giant nightmares, like the next coming of Roseanne Barr, or our accelerating slide into a dictatorship under a game show host. As long as misery isn't banging on your doorstep, everything's laughable and nothing matters. And if nothing matters, then anything goes.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

Five new movies opened wide in North American theaters this weekend including a starry spy picture from Steven Soderbergh, an A24 thriller, a Looney Tunes movie and a high concept action-comedy with “The Boys” star Jack Quaid. But the myriad options did not result in box office gold. When final receipts are tallied Monday, it's likely going be the lowest-grossing weekend of the year to date with around $54 million in total ticket sales.

“Novocaine” led the pack with $8.7 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, which was slightly lower than expected. The film starring Quaid as a man who literally can't feel pain was released by Paramount Pictures in 3,365 locations this weekend. The studio also had early access showings the weekend prior, which are included in the total.

The R-rated movie, directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, got generally positive reviews with an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. Exit polls were a bit more tempered with 4/5 on PostTrak and a B CinemaScore. It also made $1.8 million from 19 international territories bringing its total weekend to $10.5 million.

The Bong Joon Ho and Robert Pattinson sci-fi “Mickey 17 "" and the spy pic “Black Bag” were neck and neck for second and third place, both reporting $7.5 million weekends. “Mickey 17"" had the slight edge. It's still playing in 3,807 theaters, was down a steep 60% from its opening. That brings its domestic total to $33.3 million and its global total to $90.5 million against a reported $118 million budget.

“Black Bag,” the well-reviewed Soderbergh film with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender, opened in 2,705 theaters to take third place. Audiences skewed male (56%) and over 35 (59%). The film, released by Focus Features, currently carries a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. It also got a B CinemaScore.

Other new openers included “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,” an animated film starring Porky Pig and Daffy Duck originally intended for the streaming service Max, and the faith based “The Last Supper.” Ketchup Entertainment handled the Looney Tunes theatrical release in 2,827 theaters where it earned $3.2 million. Pinnacle Peak Pictures released “The Last Supper” in 1,575 theaters to $2.8 million in ticket sales. Both came in behind Disney and Marvel's “Captain America: Brave New World,” which earned $5.5 million in its fifth weekend in theaters.

The new A24 movie, “Opus,” opened outside of the top 10 with an estimated $1 million from 1,764 screens. Starring Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich as a legendary pop star who has suddenly reemerged on the scene after decades away, “Opus” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to generally poor reviews. It's the first film from writer-director Mark Anthony Green.

After a strong start to the year in which the box office was up 22%, several slow weekends that haven't surpassed $60 million in total ticket sales have left the domestic box office at a 5% deficit.

“It's a momentum business,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “It'll ratchet up with ‘Snow White' next weekend. And the good news is we probably won't see the 50s again until August.”

Top 10 movies by domestic box office

With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

1. “Novocaine,” $8.7 million.

2. “Mickey 17,” $7.5 million.

3. “Black Bag,” $7.5 million.

4. “Captain America: Brave New World,” $5.5 million.

5. “The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie,” $3.2 million.

6. “The Last Supper,” $2.8 million.

7. “Paddington in Peru,” $2.8 million.

8. “Dog Man,” $2.5 million.

9. “The Monkey,” $2.5 million.

10. “Last Breath,” $2.3 million.

Brenda Song refers to fiancé Macaulay Culkin as ""a very unique human being"" and ""the most famous child actor in the world"" for a few reasons. 

The Suite Life of Zack & Cody alum recently opened up about unique skills her future husband, with whom she shares children Dakota, 3, and Carson, 2, per Page Six, has yet to possess as he approaches his 45th year. 

""I always say Mac is a very unique human being the most famous child actor in the world. He still doesn't know how to drive! I took him out to drive in our neighborhood. I was terrified, let me tell you,"" Song revealed during a recent guest appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show. 

The star, who met Culkin in 2014, also admitted her beau didn't know how to fold laundry until they were dating, a trait which she attributes to his childhood in the spotlight. 

""He lived and grew up in hotels. He had just never really done laundry, and I was shooketh. I've been doing laundry since I was 10 helping my mom. It's funny, teaching him how to do laundry."" The Home Alone actor asked Song to be his wife in 2022, and the rest was history. 

Speaking of the iconic Christmas film, Song revealed that she and Culkin have only watched it together once, and that the actor told her a handful of behind the scenes details as they watched it. 

""I was like stop...STOP! You're ruining it for me. You are ruining it.""

According to Sacnilk, the film earned 7.5 crores and 8 crores on the 29th and 30th day in Hindi and Telugu combined. This means that the total collection of the film in a month has become 567.68 crores. Now, Chhaava has earned 3.8 crores till 4:30 pm today and has made a great collection of 571.48 crores. These figures are not final yet and can witness some rise as well. 

Chhaava moving from top 3 to top 2

Chhaava has secured its third place in the list of top 3 highest collections in Hindi films. The film has secured this place by breaking the record of Animal (Rs 553.87 crores) in the domestic box office collection. Currently, Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan (Rs 640.25 crores) is at the first position in this list and Stree 2 (Rs 597.99 crores) is at the second position. Chhaava still has about two more weeks. Seeing the speed of the film, it seems that the film can break the record of Stree 2 soon. Currently, the film is about 25 crores behind Shraddha Kapoor- Rajkumar Rao's film.

About Chhaava

Made on a budget of 130 crores, this film is based on the life of Sambhaji Maharaj, whose role is played by Vicky Kaushal and his wife's role is played by Rashmika Mandanna.

Known as nature's perfect food — and the only food produced by an insect that humans consume — honey has been around since ancient times.

Honey has earned a reputation not only as a natural sweetener, but also for its medicinal and cosmetic properties. Due to its rarity in earlier days, honey was once an expensive commodity used sparingly and primarily available only to people of wealth — especially when it came to cooking with honey.

Fortunately, honey is no longer in scarce supply. One of its commercial purveyors in south central Pennsylvania is based in Lancaster County's Rapho Township.

The Honeybee Shoppe has been owned and operated by Tim and Kelly Miller since late 2001, when they purchased and moved to a five-acre property that was previously home to beekeepers David and Catherine Wampler.

The Wamplers turned to honey production full-time in 1973 and the Millers have continued using the Wampler's Honey brand name for the numerous honey varieties they purchase from other beekeepers as far away as the western United States.

Honey from the Millers' hives is sold under their Pennsylvania Mountain Wildflower and Lancaster County Spring Blossom labels.

Tim Miller shows off a bottle of his Pennsylvania wildflower raw honey.

For Tim Miller and his wife Kelly, it all started 35 summers ago in rural Kentucky, when Tim was serving as a volunteer construction coordinator for Mennonite Central Committee's Sharing With Appalachian People (SWAP) project. One of the resident staff members invited Tim to accompany him “up the mountain” to check on his two beehives.

Tim was immediately intrigued. Kelly said he called her in Pennsylvania to ask, “Can you go get some books on beekeeping for me?” She headed to a local bookstore, bought three books on the subject and mailed them to him.

Tim was not his family's first beekeeper. On the Millers' dining room wall hangs a prized 1910 photograph showing Tim's great grandfather, Martin Miller, with his assortment of beehives sheltered under open-front sheds. Tim still recalls stumbling upon some of those rickety beehives, stored in an old family woodshed, when he was 10 years old.

The Millers started out small, selling their natural honey and related products from their home. But their business model evolved as sales grew.

Martin Miller, great-grandfather of Tim Miller, stands beside the beehives on his farm circa 1910.

These days their retail sales are done at three area farmer's markets — Root's Country Market in Manheim, Green Dragon Farmers Market in Ephrata and York's New Eastern Market. Their stands do a brisk business, which accounts for about 20% of The Honeybee Shoppe's sales.

The other 80% of the Millers' operation involves wholesaling to 45 family-owned markets and roadside stands in Lancaster and surrounding counties. These locations include nearby Hilltop Acres Farm Market, Manheim; The Country Store, Mount Joy; and Country View Grocery, Annville.

Their honey and honey-related products are the result of a complex series of beekeeping activities needed to provide a steady flow of honey requiring strategic hive locations.

A customer at Green Dragon Farmer's Market looks over the honey and other products sold at The Honeybee Shoppe's stand.

This is no small feat, considering on average, a single honeybee creates just one-twelfth teaspoon of honey during its lifetime — which can be as short as six weeks during the summer, when Tim said, the bees literally work themselves to death.

It all revolves around the hive — defined as an enclosed structure where honeybee species live and raise their young.

Tim favors using Langstroth-style hives. This popular type of vertical hive resembles a chest of drawers, due to its rectangular body that allows stacking the hives to increase bee capacity.

Typically made from wood, these hives hold multiple removable modular frames, which bees use when forming their beeswax to create the honeycomb. Honey, pollen and brood are stored in these cells.

“We tend to be mobile with our bees,” said Tim, which are contained in up to 300 hives. Growers hire Tim seasonally to place hives among settings like orchards and vine crops to facilitate pollination.

Tim Miller checks out a 55-gallon drum of honey in the honey melter's area.

Tim also selectively transports his hives to fields and meadows, which have particular blooms during certain seasons. His bees begin gathering nectar and pollen as early as March, when maples and willows start to bud.

As spring proceeds, he places hives to capitalize on blooming fruit orchards, dandelions and locust trees, including 20 or so locust trees on the Millers' own property. Areas with tulip poplar and clover blooms become the next hive placement targets.

By mid-August, Tim relocates some hives upstate to Tioga County, where his bees gather nectar from late summer blooms like goldenrod and other wildflowers. The various nectars provide different flavor profiles to the resulting honey.

After Pennsylvania's growing season ends, the Millers truck 100 hives to Georgia to winter in the warmer climate. They've been doing this for so long, two of their daughters met and married men from Georgia and now reside there with their families.

Daughter Julia has taken over online sales of the family's various honey products using Etsy and Facebook. She also makes honey lotion, lip balm and salve products, sold online and in Pennsylvania.

Back home, Tim's niece, Holly Miller and a family friend, Megan Fox, help fill jars with honey Tim has collected from his hives and purchased from other beekeepers. It's stored in 55-gallon drums in the Millers' warehouse, sometimes for up to two years.

A barrel of honey sits inside the “honey melter” to prepare its contents for transferring into jars.

These food-grade drums weigh around 640 pounds each, and are eventually hoisted up into the “honey heater.” This custom piece of machinery was made by David Wampler to liquefy the honey from its semi-solid state, enabling it to be packaged for sale in containers ranging from 8 ounces to 60 pounds.

In 2024, the Millers processed 280 drums, or around 180,000 pounds of honey.

As usual, Tim lost over half of his bees since last season, so he is currently replenishing their numbers by splitting his surviving hives. Since he doesn't raise queen bees, he also ordered 150 of them at a cost of $28 to $30 each.

The queens arrive in small packages via overnight mail, which Tim retrieves promptly from the post office. The new queens will be carefully introduced to their hives from inside screened cages, which will eventually be eaten through by her new hive mates.

From left, Megan Fox and Holly Miller dispense honey into jars before adding lids and labels.

Each queen can lay up to 2,000 eggs per day. Those eggs will hatch into larvae, spin a cocoon and emerge as a worm before becoming a drone, worker bee or queen bee.

Not surprisingly, Kelly is a big fan of honey, favoring alfalfa, which she said is very mild-tasting, thus great for baking.

She especially likes using it in sourdough and French breads, as well as in other baked goods, like her peanut butter oatmeal cookies, where honey adds a pleasant moistness. Another family favorite made with honey is Kelly's homemade doughnuts.

Tim advises against refrigerating honey. It will keep almost indefinitely at room temperature, though it may crystallize over time and require heating to liquefy it once again.

Honey Bears line up on shelves while awaiting shipping.

Beekeeping is facing the same tough economy as the rest of agriculture. Apiarists may need to learn how to evolve and diversify in order to successfully adapt. 

Kutik's Everything Bees does everything from selling hives and queens, to operating beekeeping workshops and classes to selling retail honey and bee-related items. 

Hannah Burgess' grandfather had started as Perry Apiaries in the 1950s. In 2010, Burgess created her own honey business, Beekeeper's Daughter.

Manager Brandon Anaya at the new bar at Mo's Burrito's location at 723 S. Neil St. in Champaign.

A local business that serves up Mexican and Salvadoran food has expanded its footprint.

Mo's Burritos' second location at 723 S. Neil St. in Champaign opened in mid-January, according to manager Brandon Anaya. The business also operates another brick-and-mortar restaurant at 705 N. Neil St. and three food trucks.

“We've got a lot of people telling us to go for something bigger,” he said. “Plus, the location where we are right now (at North Neil Street) only serves seven tables. So it usually gets pretty crowded at lunch, and a lot of people usually just leave.”

Anaya said that they plan to eventually close the North Neil Street location once they feel like their customers have migrated to their new space.

“Besides the difference in size of the location, we did also add a lot of new items, both in food and now cocktails as we now have a bar and (will have) a patio too,” he said.

Maple & Yolk in Urbana

The former Urbana Garden Family Restaurant at 810 Killarney St. reopened as Maple & Yolk on March 6, and co-owner Agron Selimi feels people are responding well to the rebrand and remodel.

“I think people are really impressed by the new menu and look,” he said. “We've been getting a lot of compliments for the most part, and it seems like people are leaving happy.”

The restaurant's new hours are 6:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday.

Christ Community CU's future location at 2302 Fox Drive in Champaign.

Christ Community CU has purchased property at 2302 Fox Drive in Champaign and hopes to start holding services at the site in early 2026, pending some renovations, said staff member Craig Coady.

“The building needs to be completely reconfigured and renovated, so that means creating a large worship area, a connection area right when you walk in with a café, spaces and classrooms for kids, and ensuring the space works well for those with disabilities,” he said.

Christ Community CU, which currently meets at the Stephens Family YMCA, has been looking for a permanent location for over five years. Coady said Fox Drive was a good fit because it is “centrally located” and offers enough room for the growing church.

“We hope to be a place where anyone who wants to know who Jesus is and what it means to follow Him would find a sincere welcome and eventually a home,” he said.

Cedar Oak Farms in Paxton, will hold its second season of Farm Dinners from May to October.

“We redefine dining with our farm-fresh approach that captures the essence of Midwest flavor,” said owner and host Teresa Sturm. “Each dish is a masterpiece crafted on-site by our talented chef, featuring seasonal, sustainable, and locally sourced ingredients—many harvested directly from our fields. Our meals are not just about satisfying your hunger; they tell the rich stories of our land and community.”

Troyhann Santos checks the federal government's latest list of counter-tariffs and makes a crushing discovery. Starting immediately, she'll have to pay a 25 per cent tariff on most merchandise coming into her lacrosse equipment store, Lax Shack, in Pickering, Ont.

""To get hit with something like this is terrifying,"" said Santos. ""It's a terrible gut punch.""

Billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are on the line as Canadian businesses grapple with U.S. President Trump's tariffs, the bulk of which are set to take effect on April 2. 

Now, some businesses unaffected by Trump's tariffs are learning that they won't emerge unscathed from the trade war, because goods they import from the U.S. are getting hit with Canada's counter-tariffs. 

The problem is especially concerning for small businesses, which often don't have deep pockets to help them weather the storm. 

Last week, the federal government imposed its first round of 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods, such as many types of food and appliances. 

On Thursday, after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, Canada hit back with more tariffs, this time on $29.8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Targets include U.S. steel, aluminum, some electronics and — unfortunately for Santos — sports equipment.

Almost all of the lacrosse gear she sells, including sticks, balls and nets, is imported from the U.S.

""We have shipments that are coming in on a daily basis, so this will affect us immediately,"" said Santos. ""We're going to have to increase our prices to reflect that 25 per cent increase.""

She's not the only small business caught in the crossfire.

Cluck Clucks, a small but growing fast food chain in the Toronto area, says the counter-tariffs could hurt its expansion plans. 

Each Cluck Clucks requires between six and eight deep fryers to serve up its specialty: fried chicken. 

The fryers, which cost up to $27,000 each are made of steel and shipped from the U.S. Because Canada's counter-tariffs include cooking appliances made of steel, Cluck Clucks believes it will now pay 25 per cent more for each new purchase.

""We're expecting our costs to go up significantly,"" said Raza Hashim, Cluck Clucks' CEO. ""So, overall, just not a good situation for us.""

He adds that Canada doesn't manufacture deep fryers, so he can't solve the problem by switching to a domestic supplier.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says many small businesses may be affected by the counter-tariffs. The federation surveyed 2,500 independent businesses last month and almost half (47 per cent) said they import goods from the U.S.

""They are super concerned,"" said Simon Gaudreault, CFIB's chief economist. ""We're talking here about 25 per cent counter-tariffs that can add a significant cost pressure on businesses. Some of them operate on very thin margins.""

Gaudreault says owners can raise prices to cover the added costs, but doing so could make them less competitive. 

""So they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.""

Affected businesses can apply for financial support from Ottawa, but there are no guarantees they will get it. ""The federal government will only consider [assistance] where it is required to address exceptional and compelling circumstances,"" the Deparment of Finance said in a statement. 

Canada's counter-tariffs hurting small businesses, but most support them

The CFIB poll also revealed something that surprised Gaudreault: Despite concerns over counter-tariffs, three-quarters of businesses surveyed said they support Canada's decision to impose them. 

""I think it comes from a sense that something needs to be done … not to just lie down there, and let's let the U.S. administration do whatever it is that they want,"" said Gaudreault. 

Although Cluck Clucks will now likely face higher costs each time it opens a new location, the restaurant is on the side of counter-tariffs.

""It is for the good of the entire country,"" said Hashim at a Cluck Clucks in Pickering. ""As a citizen, as a naturalized citizen, we will bite the bullet for our adopted country."" 

But back at the lacrosse store, Santos reveals that she's on the fence about the counter-tariffs, after learning that they will affect most goods sold in her store. 

""I want Canada to stand up for themselves and I'm a proud Canadian,"" she said.

""But on the other side of it, these increases in prices also hurt us.""

Fox News host Lara Trump speaks with O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary and Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia about the future of cryptocurrency on ‘My View with Lara Trump.'

Mr. Wonderful is casting a glimmering light on the cryptocurrency industry, arguing it is entering a ""new phase"" under the Trump administration. 

""The reason they're not comfortable with it right now is they've watched the cowboy era of crypto, but all the crypto cowboys are in jail or out of business. So now we're in a new phase. There's a new tone with the government. Trump has put it forward,"" O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary said on ""My View with Lara Trump"" Saturday. 

""They're going to provide regulations to allow this to become integrated with the financial institutions of America. It's going to become a payment system, an investment vehicle. It's going to become part of all the sectors of our economy. We have 11 sectors. Eventually, I believe crypto will be the 12th.""

TRUMP'S CRYPTO CZAR DECRIES GOVERNMENT'S LACK OF BITCOIN ‘LONG-TERM STRATEGY'

President Donald Trump made headlines on the campaign trail last year for embracing the crypto industry as a key issue for the 2024 election. 

During an address at the world's largest bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee in July, Trump vowed for the U.S. to become the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and a ""bitcoin superpower of the world."" 

The now-47th president has made good on many of his crypto promises since taking office in January. 

TRUMP CREATES STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE, OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BE USED IN STOCKPILE

President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week, just a day before the first-of-its-kind crypto summit. 

""A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,"" Trump wrote.

""I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" he added.

Crypto czar David Sacks celebrated the move via a post on X. 

""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,"" he wrote. ""It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government's digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.'"" 

""The big news is that this will be the first administration that's going to say this sector belongs in America. The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it. Other administrations didn't do that, and I think we should celebrate it because I think we shouldn't fall behind on this,"" O'Leary told Fox News host Lara Trump during his interview at Pubkey bitcoin bar in New York City. 

Pubkey co-owner Thomas Pacchia also weighed in on the future of crypto under Trump, noting the leadership under President Biden was ""atrocious.""

""For four years, it was a very aggressive administration. I think the biggest win was just moving on from that and not getting stuck with another 4 or 8 years of that. It was very, very punitive. And there was no conversation. It wasn't something that you could go and talk about with the administration.""

Trump's return to the Oval Office is a ""massive seat change for the industry,"" Pacchia added.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have been embraced by world leaders in recent years, with U.S. president Donald Trump reportedly planning to buy up huge swathes of bitcoin.

The bitcoin price has surged to around $80,000 per bitcoin, up from around $50,000 this time last year, though one legendary trader's prescient bitcoin price prediction has forecast a huge shift has already begun.

Now, as traders scramble to get ahead of countries that could rush to follow the U.S. into bitcoin, a leak has revealed Russia is using crypto to trade with China and India and skirt international sanctions—as the Bank of Russia opens up bitcoin and crypto buying to a “limited circle of Russian investors.”

Oil companies in Russia are using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including ethereum and the stablecoin tether to help convert rubles to China's yuan and India's rupee, it was reported by Reuters, citing anonymous sources.

Bitcoin and crypto are now favored as a means of trade among Russia's oil companies to the extent they would continue to be used even if sanctions were lifted and the U.S. dollar could be used again, according to the report.

Russian oligarchs and billionaires hit by severe financial restrictions following the country's invasion of Ukraine reportedly turned to bitcoin and crypto as far back as 2022.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has announced this week it intends to allow a “limited circle of Russian investors” to buy and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

“In accordance with the instructions of the president of Russia, the Bank of Russia has sent proposals to the government for discussion on regulating investments in cryptocurrencies,” a translated announcement read.

""This is a new status that ... citizens will receive if their investments in securities and deposits exceed 100 million rubles or if their income over the past year was more than 50 million rubles.”

Russia's central bank has gradually softened its opposition to bitcoin and crypto, last year backing a law that allowed businesses to use crypto for international trade.

Russia's growing support for bitcoin and crypto comes as Donald Trump's administration gears up to make bitcoin a strategic reserve asset, freezing the planned sale of bitcoin and crypto the U.S. has seized.

This week, a White House leak has revealed one of Donald Trump's top bitcoin and crypto officials reportedly said the Trump administration wants to acquire as much bitcoin as possible—helping the reverse a bitcoin price sell-off that was triggered by Trump's bitcoin reserve plans falling short of expectations.

In December, a leak revealed Russia lawmakers were pushing for the country to create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to that proposed by Trump.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin had earlier praised bitcoin as an alternative to foreign currency reserves following the seizure of its funds by Western governments in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cryptocurrency+news","Trump's bitcoin reserve a 'digital Fort Knox'","https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250316-trump-s-bitcoin-reserve-a-digital-fort-knox","Sun, 16 Mar 2025 02:27:09 GMT","


London (AFP) –                     The creation of a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" in the United States is further proof of President Donald Trump's support for the cryptocurrency sector.                

Issued on: 16/03/2025 - 03:27Modified: 16/03/2025 - 03:23

Trump earlier this month signed an executive order establishing the reserve, which White House crypto chief David Sacks has likened to ""a digital Fort Knox"", comparing it to the stockpiling of gold bars at the US military base.

Gold is held in reserves by countries worldwide as the metal is seen as a safe-haven asset, protecting against financial instability such as high inflation.

The metal on Friday surpassed $3,000 per ounce for the first time, boosted by an uncertain economic outlook amid Trump's tariffs.

Gold reserves can help also stabilise a country's currency, while bars are used as collateral for loans and transactions.

It is to be funded by about 200,000 bitcoins, worth around $17 billion in total, that have been seized in the United States as a result of civil and criminal cases.

The reserve will be virtually secured for an indefinite time.

Additional bitcoin can be added to the reserve as long as such action is ""budget-neutral"", thus not costing the taxpayer.

 - Announcement fails to impress -

The price of bitcoin initially slid after Trump signed the executive order but has since stabilised.

Analysts have blamed the lack of support on a failure to immediately buy more bitcoin.

Dessislava Aubert, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, told AFP that ""legally"" the US government must return bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack.

According to Aubert, ""a big chunk"" of the bitcoin held by the United States -- estimated at around 198,000 tokens -- would have to be returned to victims of a hack at crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016.

Sector watchers are also waiting to see if other digital tokens will be added to the reserve, which is possible according to the executive order.

Trump has said that bitcoin's nearest rival, ether, along with three other tokens -- XRP, Solana and Cardano -- could be added.

Critics of the US bitcoin reserve point out that, unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are risky assets and have no intrinsic value.

However, Sacks believes that by storing bitcoin over time, the government would protect itself from the cryptocurrency's massive short-term volatility.

Meanwhile, Stephane Ifrah, an investment director at crypto platform Coinhouse, said that bitcoin, like gold, can profit from its rarity thanks to a limited 21 million tokens.

An advantage of the bitcoin reserve is its transparency, since the level of tokens will be known at all times -- unlike the amount of gold placed in Fort Knox.

Additionally, with the bitcoin reserve, ""we're dealing with a rare asset that's much more suited to today's world"", Ifrah told AFP.

Prominent cryptocurrency critic, Molly White, believes the ""true reason"" for the reserve ""is a way to drive interest in the crypto industry"", which could financially benefit investors.

Trump has been accused by some of showing a conflict of interest, having vowed ahead of being elected to make the United States the ""bitcoin and cryptocurrency capital of the world"". 

The Financial Times reported that Trump earned $350 million from launching a meme coin, $TRUMP, to coincide with his inauguration.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Trump family discussed acquiring a possible stake in the Binance platform -- a report denied by the crypto exchange's founder.

Brazil is also considering the creation of a cryptocurrency reserve, an idea recently ruled out by the Swiss central bank.

Governments around the world are partaking in cryptocurrency activity, notably by selling digital assets seized in court cases, as was the case in Germany last year with 50,000 bitcoins.

El Salvador made bitcoin one of its official currencies, reversing the decision this year owing to a lack of take-up by citizens.

Bhutan holds nearly $900 million worth of bitcoin, equivalent to nearly 30 percent of the kingdom's gross domestic product.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against other best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now.

Cryptocurrency stocks are on the move in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump announcing plans for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” The possibility of a cryptocurrency reserve is a significant step toward Trump's goal of making the United States the global center of cryptocurrency.

The United States already possesses several strategic stockpiles, such as medical and military assets. In times of need, the government draws from these unique reserves. To keep the Federal Reserve afloat, the government would probably be actively purchasing and disposing of cryptocurrencies as part of the strategic reserve push.

“This move signals a shift toward active participation in the crypto economy by the U.S. government,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, a digital assets investment management firm. “It has the potential to accelerate institutional adoption, provide greater regulatory clarity, and strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in digital asset innovation.”

Additionally, some Bitcoin holders think that a cryptocurrency reserve may act as an inflation hedge. They contend that at times of global economic crisis, the value of Bitcoin may surpass that of the dollar, citing the currency's declining worth over time. However, cryptocurrencies have shown to be highly volatile during recent geopolitical events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, some experts believe that the US government purchasing Bitcoin could endanger the dollar's standing internationally.

Critics contend that cryptocurrency is a speculative investment and has historically been volatile, while proponents claim that the proceeds may be used to pay down the country's massive debt. Approximately 200,000 Bitcoin tokens are thought to be held in the United States due to illegal seizures. The total value of that exceeds $17 billion. With a reserve, these holdings might be expanded to include three lesser-known cryptocurrencies, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, in addition to Ethereum.

Amid the “crypto strategic reserve” push, cryptocurrency stocks' popularity is growing as investors explore ways of diversifying their investment portfolio beyond traditional asset classes. The stocks stand out partly because they offer crypto exposure without requiring one to own the underlying volatile crypto asset. Additionally, the stocks provide both growth potential and innovation. Many experts regard them as being safer than direct cryptocurrency investments.

To determine the 13 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now, we analyzed the US market for companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Our in-depth analysis focused on firms with solid prospects due to their investments in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. We reviewed ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the hedge fund stakes in them during Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Average Upside Potential as of March 11: 129.41%

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, holding 499,096 BTC as of February. Similarly, it was the best-performing cryptocurrency in 2024, rallying by more than 140%. The impressive run came on the company, delivering solid financial results that were helped by Bitcoin prices rallying to record highs.

On February 5th, MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) revealed its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. While its revenue from subscription services rose 48% to $31.9 million, its reported revenue of $120.7 million was down 3% from the previous year. Revenue from product licenses increased 18.3% year over year to $47.2 million.

MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) also announced plans to raise $42 billion over the next three years. A good chunk of the funds will bolster the company's Bitcoin holdings. It also announced the completion of $20 billion of its $42 billion capital plan, often known as the 21/21 plan. It also updated its annual Bitcoin yield target to 15% for 2025.

Overall, MSTR ranks 5th on our list of best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Key Takeaways:

On March 13th, the State Senate unanimously passed House Bill 701 (HB 701), positioning Kentucky to lead the nation on cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Dubbed the Bill of Rights for Bitcoiners, this landmark piece of legislation is formally titled An Act relating to blockchain digital assets and its focus is on (1) securing an individual's right to self-custody of Bitcoin and (2) implementing fair regulations for digital asset mining operations in the state. The stunning unanimous vote, 37-0, was a strong, bipartisan endorsement of the burgeoning crypto industry and its promise.



HB 701 originated in the Kentucky House of Representatives, where it also received unanimous approval and passed by a 91-0 vote on February 28, 2025. The bill's seamless passage through both legislative chambers reflects the recognition among Kentucky lawmakers that embracing digital asset technologies and the related innovation underpinning them is critical for the state.

Sponsored by Representatives Adam Bowling and T.J. Roberts, HB 701 addresses key concerns of both individual Bitcoin users and businesses operating in the digital asset space:

Self-Custody Guaranteed: The proposal guarantees the right of individuals to utilize and hold their digital assets in self-hosted wallets, giving them ultimate custody of their crypto. Adam said this measure is critical to protect people's financial freedom and prevent government overreach into Bitcoin. This is a victory for Bitcoin supporters who have faith in decentralization and independence.

Mining-Friendly Zoning Ordinances: The most important provision of HB 701 is its prohibition of discriminatory zoning laws targeting the digital asset mining industry. Specifically, the legislation will prohibit governments from imposing zoning changes intended to block or destroy Bitcoin mining activities. This ensures that miners in Kentucky will not face unfair regulatory targeting, Representative T.J. Roberts stated.

Exclusion From Money Transmitter Licensing: In Kentucky, home-based Bitcoin miners and digital asset mining companies are excluded from the requirements of Kentucky's money transmitter law. This eliminates regulatory obstacles and encourages innovation to be a destination in mining.

As HB 701 was up for debate in the Kentucky Senate, Bitcoin experienced a significant recovery from a recent slump to reach $85,301 after dipping to $77,000. This bounce paralleled a wider recovery across the cryptocurrency market as altcoins including Solana, Chainlink and XRP also enjoyed a price rise.

The passage of HB 701 through Kentucky's legislature—despite the volatility of the crypto market—underscores its commitment to fostering a long-term sustainable ecosystem for digital assets in the state. Lawmakers seem to be recognizing that Bitcoin's technology and broader implications go far beyond mere price speculation.

HB 701 in Kentucky could provide a model for enacting similar reconciliation measures in other states as they seek to applicability of rules in the often fuzzy world of crypto. Kentucky is building a more attractive ecosystem for innovation and investment through establishing clear legal frameworks for both Bitcoin self-custody and mining activities.

Most other states are still figuring out how to best regulate cryptocurrencies, and some have been more cautious or even restrictive. The recent assertiveness announced by Kentucky may motivate other states to implement similar progressive policies, creating a more cohesive and supportive regulatory environment for the digital asset industry as a whole.

CEO of Crypto Valley Exchange James Davies noted that the recent crypto recovery seemed connected to macro factors. This indicates that external factors also play a significant role in crypto adoption.

The last step in the journey for HB 701 is the Governor's signature. Once the bill is signed into law by the Governor, it will officially cement Kentucky as one of the most Bitcoin-friendly states in the country. This sends a strong signal to the cryptocurrency industry and could bring another influx of businesses and investors in the state.

Kentucky is poised to become a financial hub due to its proactive regulatory approach and commitment to innovation. The passage of HB 701 is a pivotal step toward that vision.

Key Points

Bitcoin (BTC -0.49%) and XRP (XRP -3.47%) might be a bit safer than some crypto assets, but it isn't as though they're rock solid when things are falling apart. As the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 enter correction territory, investors are starting to worry more about a potential market crash.

And some are pondering which of these two assets would hold up better in a crash and which would be worth buying in the aftermath?

To start, let's take a look at how Bitcoin and XRP performed during the early 2020 coronavirus market crash.

Here's the chart:



Bitcoin Price data by YCharts

As you can see, both assets dumped hard during the crash, along with the rest of the market, which is to be expected.  Then, over the next five years both climbed.



Bitcoin Price data by YCharts

Bitcoin has done slightly better since the 2020 crash, and its price action was generally less volatile than XRP's, which isn't an advantage, except for those who like to sleep more soundly without worrying about the value of their investments.

XRP is a cryptocurrency with value that's derived from its utility as a medium of exchange rather than as a store of value. For it to have value as a medium of exchange, it needs to be actively demanded by its users, who must then transfer the coin between each other, and who must also have a reason to need more of it in the future. Given that its users are financial institutions seeking to avoid incurring currency exchange fees and international money transfer fees, the health and activity level of those financial institutions is a key consideration for the future demand for XRP.

Market crashes tend to coincide with periods of great uncertainty, particularly economic and financial uncertainty. Financial institutions, like most businesses, are loath to make big investments or big strategic plays during such periods. And, on average, that means the odds are good that they won't need to make as many international money transfers. So investors will likely assume that the level of demand for XRP will be lower when uncertainty is highest.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have much value derived from its utility. While it can be a medium of exchange, most investors look to it as a store of value. That makes sense given its supply dynamics, which ensure that there's a smaller and smaller quantity of Bitcoin produced over time, generating scarcity. Scarcity doesn't necessarily create demand, but it ensures that the price level will continue to rise over time so long as there is demand.

Investors might tend to liquidate some of their stores of value during turbulent times so that they have enough fiat currency on hand to cover contingencies, but wise holders of Bitcoin understand that doing so is a compromise, as the odds of the coin being worth more in the long term are quite good thanks to its increasing scarcity. Therefore the odds are also good that holders who sell coins will become buyers once again, perhaps even in advance of the market deciding that the hard times have passed.

No ones knows when the next market crash will happen, but Bitcoin looks like the better market-crash play.

It is possible to imagine the circumstances of a crash being events that create a high probability of a global or localized economic recession, which could last years. Under those conditions, Bitcoin is unlikely to flourish. Still, XRP would almost certainly suffer more, as the very thing that makes it valuable, its usefulness, simply wouldn't be very appealing anymore, as users would be scaling back investments in new financial technologies rather than deepening them.

Furthermore, Bitcoin's supply dynamics will continue grinding onward regardless of whether there's a lot of demand. That means when demand eventually does come back, the new buyers will be competing fiercely, driving prices up. XRP doesn't have any similar mechanic, even if it's a good coin to buy generally.

Don't sweat the possibility of a market crash too much. If you're concerned, just keep some capital on hand so that you're ready to buy.

According to data provided by analytics platform Lookonchain, a Bitcoin whale recently opened a short position of $332 million in Bitcoin with an entry price of $84,040. 

The position was opened with 40X leverage, which means that the trader is borrowing 40 times the initial capital. 

Bitcoin is currently changing hands at $83,945, according to CoinGecko data. The cryptocurrency is down 2.3% over the past week. 

The massive position will get liquidated if the price of the leading cryptocurrency ends up spiking to the $85,000 level. 

The trader in question previously managed to rake in a whopping $16.39 million within a single month on popular decentralized perpetual trading platform Hyperliquid. Notably, all of his eight trades were profitable across two wallets. 

Some X commentators are now predicting that the trader will inevitably get liquidated given how precarious his position is.

""These types of guys will lose it all,"" one social media user said. 

The 40x leverage dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. It would take a mere 2.5% move to wipe out his entire position.

According to data provided by CoinGlass, a total of $94 million worth of crypto has been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with shorts making up the majority of the sum ($49 million). The largest single liquidation took place on Binance ($582,130 with the BTCUSDT pair). Overall, more than 65,000 traders have been liquidated over the aforementioned period of time. The Binance exchange accounts for 38.79% of the total liquidations.

 Analysts split opinions on Bitcoin's next price move, but technical charts look promising for BNB, TON, GT and ATOM. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to break above the 200-day simple moving average ($84,000), but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears. Bitget Research chief analyst Ryan Lee told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin needs to achieve a weekly close above $81,000 to signal resilience. Selling could accelerate if the price plummets below $76,000.

Another cautious voice was that of Markus Thielen, head crypto researcher at 10x Research. Thielen told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin's chart structure “suggests market indecision rather than a straightforward bullish consolidation.” Thielen remains doubtful of a strong price recovery in Bitcoin at the current juncture.

However, Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson has a different view. In an X post, Peterson said that April and October are the two months that generate a large portion of Bitcoin's annual performance. That suggests Bitcoin could rise to a “new all-time high before June.”

Could buyers drive Bitcoin above the short-term overhead resistance levels? If they do, what other top cryptocurrencies may rally in the near term?

The downsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($86,188) suggests that bears are in command, but the positive divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) indicates that the selling pressure is reducing.

If the price turns down from the current level, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to $80,000 and then to $76,606. 

Contrarily, if the price turns up and breaks above the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the markets have rejected the breakdown below the 200-day SMA. The pair could rally to the 50-day SMA ($93,033) and, after that, to $100,000. Buyers may find it difficult to surpass the psychological barrier at $100,000.

The 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart is flattening out, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to drive the pair above the resistance line to gain the upper hand. The pair may climb to $92,810 and then to $95,000.

The downside support is at $80,000 and next at $78,000. If the supports crack, the possibility of a drop below $76,606 increases. 

BNB (BNB) started a recovery from $507 on March 11, which is facing selling at the 50-day SMA ($621).

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($595) is the critical near-term support to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are buying on minor dips. That improves the prospects of a break above the 50-day SMA. The BNB/USDT pair could then rally toward $686.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the bears are fiercely defending the 50-day SMA. The pair may tumble to $550.

The 20-EMA has turned up on the 4-hour chart, and the RSI is in the positive zone, indicating a bullish sentiment. There is resistance at $632, but if buyers overcome it, the pair could jump to $680.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. The pair may dip to the 50-SMA, which is again likely to attract buyers. A break below the 50-SMA will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

Toncoin (TON) rose sharply from $2.35 on March 11 and reached the 50-day SMA ($3.64) on March 16.

TON/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The correction from the 50-day SMA is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($3.15). If that happens, it will signal a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. That increases the possibility of a rally above the 50-day SMA. The TON/USDT pair could climb to $4 and later to $5.

Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may then drop toward $2.50.

TON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows the up move is facing selling at the $3.60 level, but buyers are expected to defend the 20-EMA on declines. If the price turns up sharply from the 20-EMA, the bulls will try to propel the price above $4.15. If they manage to do that, the pair could jump toward $4.67.

Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the bears remain active at higher levels. The pair may drop to the 50-SMA and subsequently to $2.50.

Gate Token (GT) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating indecision between the bulls and the bears.

GT/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($21.06) is flattening out, and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing. If buyers drive the price above the triangle, it will signal the resumption of the upmove. The GT/USDT pair could climb to $24 and eventually to $26.

If the price continues lower and closes below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that the pair may remain inside the triangle for a while. The bears will be back in command on a break below the triangle.

GT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are finding it difficult to maintain the price below the 20-EMA. That suggests demand at lower levels. Buyers will try to strengthen their position by pushing the price above the resistance line. If they do that, the pair could rally toward $24.

Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-SMA, it will signal that the bullish momentum is weakening. The pair may descend to $19 and eventually to the support line.

Cosmos (ATOM) broke above the 20-day EMA ($4.31) on March 15, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.

ATOM/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The RSI has formed a positive divergence, suggesting that the bearish momentum is weakening. The 50-day SMA ($4.73) could act as resistance but is likely to be crossed. A close above $5.15 could open the doors for a rally to $6.50.

The 20-day EMA is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. If this support gives way, it will signal that the bears remain sellers on rallies. That could sink the ATOM/USDT pair to $3.50. 

ATOM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView

The pair started a pullback in the near term, which could reach the 20-EMA. If the price turns up from the 20-EMA, it will signal a positive sentiment where the bulls are buying on dips. That increases the likelihood of a break above $5.15. If that happens, the pair may surge to $5.50 and then to $6.50.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price breaks below the 20-EMA. That could sink the pair to the 50-SMA and later to $3.80.

An analyst revealed on Friday that Bitcoin might suffer a 91% decline from the coin's all-time high of $109,000 per coin in January 2025, suggesting that the most popular cryptocurrency could potentially crash. 

Mike McGlone believes that the firstborn crypto might plummet to a low of $10,000 per coin, reigniting concerns that Bitcoin might experience another deep correction similar to 2011 when Bitcoin dipped by as much as 92%.

BTC To Crash To $10K?

McGlone, a Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, predicted that Bitcoin might be heading to what he described as a devastating collapse, resulting in the crypto sliding to $10,000.

If Bitcoin will plunge to $10,000, it will represent a 90% decrease from BTC's all-time high of $109,000 in January 2025. On the other hand, it will fall by 88% if based on its current price of about $83,000.

Bitcoin Back to $10,000? Peak Leveraged Beta Risks, Rising Gold – #Gold is up about the same amount in 2025 to March 13 — about 15% — that #Bitcoin is down. But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories? About a 6% decline in the S&P 500 could suggest what… pic.twitter.com/aMgL0LANFt



The analyst explained that Bitcoin is more likely to face a significant correction that might push it downward to $10,000. Historically, the firstborn crypto experienced a deep correction in 2011 when the BTC declined to 92% from its high at that time.

Has The Crash Begun? 

In an X post, McGlone suggested Bitcoin's crash to $10,000 may have already started, citing that risk markets are showing signs of overheating while gold rises.

The analyst explained that gold has increased by 1% while Bitcoin went down, saying, “But with Bitcoin at about $80,000, what stops those trajectories?” 

“About a 6% decline in the S&P 500 could suggest what matters. The biggest #ETF launch in history, President Donald Trump's shift to highly volatile and speculative #cryptos, and reelection could prove [a] peak-bubble akin to about 25 years ago,” he added in a post, suggesting that BTC might have reached the peak of a dot-com-style bubble. Rebuttal Of The Analysis 

Many Bitcoin proponents and analysts disagree with McGlone's analysis, with one crypto analyst, David Weisberger countering the evaluation of the Bloomberg analyst, saying his assessment was flawed.

He argued that the scenario in McGlone's analysis is unlikely to happen. “I think none of the above will happen with a chance the stock market crashes, which, of course, would trigger a flood of liquidity.”

Cathie Wood is one of the most vocal bulls on Wall Street when it comes to the potential of the technology sector. She founded ARK Investment Management, which operates several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on investing exclusively in innovative technologies like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and more.

In fact, ARK was one of the first firms to win approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF last year. Wood and her team are extremely bullish on the world's largest cryptocurrency, predicting it could soar 1,660% to $1.48 million per coin by the year 2030. 

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

The crypto currently trades at around $84,000, which is 21% below its record high. If ARK's prediction is right, the recent dip could be a great buying opportunity.

Image source: Getty Images.

Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, which accounts for more than half of the total value of every cryptocurrency in circulation across the industry. If it were a company, it would be the seventh largest in the entire world. 

It's a speculative asset because it doesn't generate any revenue or earnings, nor does it have a legitimate use case in the real world. Therefore, its value is very hard to pin down.

Nevertheless, it has a series of unique qualities that have led investors to believe it's a good store of value, like a digital version of gold.

It's completely decentralized, which means it can't be controlled by any person, company, or government. It also has a capped supply of 21 million coins, which won't be fully mined until around the year 2140, so it offers the perception of scarcity. Lastly, as I touched on earlier, it can be purchased through dozens of ETFs from different issuers, allowing financial advisors and institutional investors to own it in a safe, regulated manner.

Those attributes have paved the way for Bitcoin to march to new record highs recently, despite most other cryptocurrencies failing to break above their best-ever levels from 2021 (or in some cases, even earlier).

In fact, had you bought Bitcoin 10 years ago and held on, you would be sitting on a 29,100% return -- enough to have turned an investment of $10,000 into $2.9 million! It has obliterated every other asset class over the last decade, from stocks to real estate to gold:



Bitcoin price data by YCharts.

In a report issued in 2023, ARK highlighted eight potential factors that could drive Bitcoin higher over the long term, but not all of them make sense, in my opinion. For example, it thinks Bitcoin could become the currency of choice in emerging markets, but even after El Salvador became the first country to adopt it as legal tender in 2021, it appears most consumers still aren't willing to use it (partly because of its volatility). 

Moreover, ARK believes individuals with a high net worth will increasingly own Bitcoin because it's harder for governments to seize than cash and other traditional assets. However, we know the U.S. government alone has successfully confiscated over 200,000 bitcoins, which are worth $17 billion at the current price. So, this particular theory doesn't really hold water. 

With that said, three of ARK's eight catalysts are somewhat plausible:

Setting my opinions aside for a moment, ARK believes Bitcoin could soar as high as $1.48 million per coin by 2030 based on the eight catalysts it outlined. That would give investors a potential return of 1,660% from where it currently trades.

Wood even went a step further at the Bitcoin Investor Day in March 2024. She said it could surpass ARK's bullish forecast and reach $3.8 million instead, based on the idea that ETFs could lay the groundwork for institutional investors to allocate 5% of their assets to the cryptocurrency. If she's right, that implies a potential upside of 4,420%.

If Bitcoin rose to a price of $1.48 million, it would have a fully diluted market capitalization of $31 trillion. In other words, it would be almost 10 times more valuable than Apple, which is currently the world's most valuable company with a $3.2 trillion market cap. It would also be worth more than the output of the entire U.S. economy, which was around $29.7 trillion last year. 

Does that sound realistic for an asset that produces no revenue, no earnings, and has struggled to generate traction as a currency? For me, the answer is no.

Despite Wood's enthusiasm for the potential of ETFs, they have attracted less than $100 billion in inflows so far, which is a mere fraction of Bitcoin's current market cap. Granted, these securities have been available for only one year, but I don't see a catalyst on the horizon that would cause inflows to accelerate from here -- they seem to be slowing down instead.

A more realistic price target might be $942,800 per coin. At that level, Bitcoin's market cap would be $19.8 trillion, which matches the total value of all above-ground gold reserves right now.

I'm not suggesting this will happen, because I believe gold has more intrinsic value than a digital token thanks to its physical state and because it has been accepted as a store of value globally for thousands of years.

However, if Bitcoin does become universally accepted as the digital alternative to gold, that price target still presents investors with an incredible potential return of 1,020% from here.

Samson Mow has long been vocal about his $1 million per Bitcoin BTCUSD valuation and, despite all the recent price perturbations of the major cryptocurrency, is still standing by his words. But as with great power comes great responsibility, every wild prediction comes with a question - when? 

Mow has the answer to this too. In a recent post, the JAN3 CEO finally revealed his timeline for $1 million BTC, and that is 2031. 

But there is a but, as this is the timeline according to Mow's model. Which model, though, is unknown. As the crypto entrepreneur himself declared, his feeling is this year or the next for Bitcoin to hit a seven-figure valuation.

My model says $1M in 2031 but my feeling is it's this year or next.

What does that even mean? 

On the one hand is a structured, model-backed prediction that places Bitcoin's long-awaited explosion somewhere in the 2030s, and on the other, a gut feeling that says it could be much, much sooner. 

If you have followed Bitcoin's story, you know that gut feelings - when coming from people deeply immersed in the space - are sometimes more accurate than models. 

The foundation for this massive price call? Institutional adoption, waning trust in traditional financial systems and Bitcoin's nature as a scarce, globally recognized digital asset. While $1 million per BTC might sound extreme, in percentage terms, it is just a 917% increase from the all-time high. 

Perspective matters 

Bitcoin was scraping the bottom at $15,500 just over two years ago, yet it climbed its way to $109,000. If it has already done something similar before, why assume it cannot do it again? CoinMarketCap"">

Maybe Mow's timeline is on point, maybe it is overly conservative, maybe it is too optimistic. But either way, it forces the question: where is Bitcoin actually heading, and how soon will it get there?

With Bitcoin's BTCUSD recent slowdown, market participants wonder if the price has reached its peak. Historical data, however, provides valuable insights into identifying potential market tops. On-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock shared recent insights that attempted to answer whether the market peak is in, citing historical and stablecoin data.

Is the market peak in? 

When looking at historical halving data, peaks often land 12–18 months post-halving, pointing to mid–late 2025. While institutional flows & regulations may reshape this cycle, it is likely there is more time in the current cycle pic.twitter.com/1YOikAYMyJ

According to IntoTheBlock, when looking at historical halving data, peaks often land 12-18 months post-halving, pointing to mid-to-late 2025. It went on to say that while institutional flows and regulations may reshape this cycle, it is likely there is more time in the current cycle.

Stablecoin data also paints a similar narrative. In a March 14 tweet, IntoTheBlock indicated that stablecoin data might suggest that the market peak might not yet be in. This is as, historically, stablecoin supply peaks align with cycle highs.

In April 2022, supply hit $187 billion — just as the bear market started. Now it is at $219 billion and still rising, suggesting the market likely remains in mid-cycle.

Stablecoins continue to gain ground amid market uncertainty, pushing their combined market cap to around $219 billion this week. This is about $10 billion away from Ethereum's market cap, a strong indicator of rising caution on the market.

Bitcoin price action

Bitcoin continues to face persistent sell pressure, especially from recent buyers. Since January, the crypto asset has seen weak demand and fading accumulation.

Bitcoin fell to a low of $76,555 on March 11, its lowest level since November 2024. That was around a 30% drop from the all-time high of $109,114 set on Jan. 20, 2025. The drop contributed to unprecedented outflows from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and huge liquidations of long positions on cryptocurrency futures markets. Bitcoin options traders were bracing for a dip to $70,000 in late February.

Bitcoin rebounded from this four-month low, with other risky assets bouncing back from the recent turmoil on the global markets. Bitcoin reached a high of $85,301 on Friday before encountering resistance and retreating.

At press time, Bitcoin was down 1.69% in the last 24 hours to $82,864 and 0.67% weekly. Bitcoin is facing current resistance at the daily SMA 200 at $83,984.

Hi, 

Logout

The United States has created a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,"" an initiative that further highlights President Donald Trump's support for the cryptocurrency space. 
 

The reserve, which Trump described as ""a digital Fort Knox,"" was established via an executive order earlier this month. 
 

""Fort Knox"" is the US Army post in Kentucky that stores gold bullion and other valuables.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by some 200,000 bitcoins, worth about $17 billion. These bitcoins have been confiscated in the US as part of civil and criminal prosecutions. 
 

The reserve is meant to be secured indefinitely, with more Bitcoin allowed as long as it doesn't cost taxpayers anything.

Response

While the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve initially caused a dip in Bitcoin's price, it has since stabilized. 
 

Analysts have attributed this lackluster response to the failure of the government to immediately purchase more Bitcoin. 
 

Dessislava Aubert from crypto data provider Kaiko stated that legally, ""the US government must return Bitcoin to all victims identified as suffering from a hack.""

Return

Aubert estimated that a large chunk of the seized Bitcoin, nearly 198,000 tokens, would have to be returned to victims of a hack at crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016. 
 

Observers are also closely watching if other digital tokens will be added to the reserve, as hinted in Trump's executive order.

Criticism

Critics have raised concerns about the US Bitcoin reserve, arguing that unlike gold, cryptocurrencies are risky assets with no intrinsic value. 
 

However, David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, believes that by storing Bitcoin over time, the government would protect itself from the cryptocurrency's massive short-term volatility. 
 

Some experts argue that like gold, Bitcoin can benefit from its rarity due to a limited supply of 21 million tokens.

Global trends

Brazil is also considering creating a cryptocurrency reserve, while Switzerland's central bank recently rejected the idea. 
 

Governments across the globe are actively participating in cryptocurrency, especially by selling court-seized digital assets. 
 

El Salvador made Bitcoin one of its official currencies but reversed the decision this year due to low citizen acceptance. 
 

Meanwhile, Bhutan holds nearly $900 million worth of Bitcoin, nearly 30% of the kingdom's GDP.","{'href': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com', 'title': 'NewsBytes'}"

Bitcoin dropped below $83,000 on Sunday as the crypto market continues its downward trend, yet several altcoins like Ancient8 and Apu Apustaja have turned bullish.

A8 has surged 160% in the past day, trading at $0.259 from a low of $0.09628. This massive price movement follows Bithumb's listing of A8 several months ago. 

The South Korean exchange, one of the largest in Asia, appears to have created a delayed effect as attention turns toward the token.

Market analysts point to three key factors behind this surge: increasing global attention, growing adoption rates, and a combination of strong holders and new market entrants. Beyond these market factors, there have been no major project developments to explain the sudden price jump.

Second on CoinGecko's top gainers list, APU has climbed 85% over the last 24 hours, reaching $0.0002479 from $0.0001325. The meme coin has also been trending on X recently. However, like many meme coins experiencing sudden pumps, there are no fundamental updates or developments behind the price movement.

Third on the list, ROAM Token has seen a 41% increase in the past day, moving from $0.136 to $0.1917.

The DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) project, which focuses on creating an open wireless network through OpenRoaming and eSIM technologies, recently received a shoutout from Solana's (SOL) official X account.

Adding to its surge, ROAM announced it has reached a milestone of 2 million nodes globally, showcasing the growing adoption of its decentralized network infrastructure.

Despite these isolated bright spots, the overall crypto market continues its correction phase. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) drop to $82,471 shows ongoing selling pressure that has affected most major cryptocurrencies. 

At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) has also dropped to the $1,900 level.

An arrest warrant has been issued for Kevin Segal, a self-proclaimed “Bitcoin billionaire” who allegedly failed to appear for a court hearing after a friend posted his $50,000 bond.

Prosecutors accuse Segal of swindling Wyoming businesses out of more than $212,000. The 30-year-old California resident faces up to 141 years in prison if convicted. 

According to a report by The Daily Mail, Segal posed as a wealthy businessman attempting to purchase millions in real estate in the Jackson Hole area while leaving a trail of unpaid bills at luxury resorts and businesses. 

Judge Bill Simpson issued a bench warrant across all 50 states after Segal skipped his Wednesday court appearance and allegedly failed to surrender his passport as ordered.

Jason Irvine, who posted Segal's bond, told Cowboy State Daily he maxed out three credit cards to help what he believed was a friend in need. Irvine claims Segal had promised him “a large Bitcoin payout that equated to half a million dollars” in exchange for posting the bond but disappeared after being released from jail on Feb. 14.

“He explained the situation and was basically denying all the charges written in the newspaper,” Irvine said. “[He] said it was libel and slander; and he didn't intend to defraud anybody. He was locked up in jail, and [said] that's why he couldn't pay anybody off.”

After feeling betrayed, Irvine sent Segal a text message: “You screwed me over, and now I really don't believe anything you say anymore. Irvine is now considering bankruptcy due to the financial damage.

Investigators discovered a pattern of fraudulent activities throughout Wyoming. Segal reportedly stayed at the luxurious Amangani resort with his mother and a friend, allegedly leaving a $2,725.76 bill unpaid.

At Spring Creek Ranch, three cards he used for bills totaling over $22,000 were reported to be fraudulent. It was also reported that he left the Mangy Moose Saloon with an unpaid $3,055.28 tab.

The alleged scams extended to individuals as well. Prosecutors say Segal hired a man to purchase a DJI drone in Colorado with a promise of reimbursement, then wrote a check for $3,281.46 that failed to clear.

In another instance, he sent a delivery man to drive a Dodge back to Los Angeles, promising to pay for return flights that were allegedly never purchased. The men were stranded and forced to buy their own tickets home, with Segal later sending a fake wire transfer screenshot to cover their $3,101 in expenses.

This isn't Segal's first legal trouble. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail show he previously faced a civil lawsuit claiming he falsely claimed to have stocks exceeding $340 million and a successful company to lease a Los Angeles property. 

If caught, Segal will face a substantially increased bond of $750,000 cash-only.
