Troyhann Santos checks the federal government's latest list of counter-tariffs and makes a crushing discovery. Starting immediately, she'll have to pay a 25 per cent tariff on most merchandise coming into her lacrosse equipment store, Lax Shack, in Pickering, Ont.

"To get hit with something like this is terrifying," said Santos. "It's a terrible gut punch."

Billions of dollars and thousands of jobs are on the line as Canadian businesses grapple with U.S. President Trump's tariffs, the bulk of which are set to take effect on April 2. 

Now, some businesses unaffected by Trump's tariffs are learning that they won't emerge unscathed from the trade war, because goods they import from the U.S. are getting hit with Canada's counter-tariffs. 

The problem is especially concerning for small businesses, which often don't have deep pockets to help them weather the storm. 

Last week, the federal government imposed its first round of 25 per cent retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion worth of American goods, such as many types of food and appliances. 

On Thursday, after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, Canada hit back with more tariffs, this time on $29.8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Targets include U.S. steel, aluminum, some electronics and — unfortunately for Santos — sports equipment.

Almost all of the lacrosse gear she sells, including sticks, balls and nets, is imported from the U.S.

"We have shipments that are coming in on a daily basis, so this will affect us immediately," said Santos. "We're going to have to increase our prices to reflect that 25 per cent increase."

She's not the only small business caught in the crossfire.

Cluck Clucks, a small but growing fast food chain in the Toronto area, says the counter-tariffs could hurt its expansion plans. 

Each Cluck Clucks requires between six and eight deep fryers to serve up its specialty: fried chicken. 

The fryers, which cost up to $27,000 each are made of steel and shipped from the U.S. Because Canada's counter-tariffs include cooking appliances made of steel, Cluck Clucks believes it will now pay 25 per cent more for each new purchase.

"We're expecting our costs to go up significantly," said Raza Hashim, Cluck Clucks' CEO. "So, overall, just not a good situation for us."

He adds that Canada doesn't manufacture deep fryers, so he can't solve the problem by switching to a domestic supplier.

The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) says many small businesses may be affected by the counter-tariffs. The federation surveyed 2,500 independent businesses last month and almost half (47 per cent) said they import goods from the U.S.

"They are super concerned," said Simon Gaudreault, CFIB's chief economist. "We're talking here about 25 per cent counter-tariffs that can add a significant cost pressure on businesses. Some of them operate on very thin margins."

Gaudreault says owners can raise prices to cover the added costs, but doing so could make them less competitive. 

"So they're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place."

Affected businesses can apply for financial support from Ottawa, but there are no guarantees they will get it. "The federal government will only consider [assistance] where it is required to address exceptional and compelling circumstances," the Deparment of Finance said in a statement. 

Canada's counter-tariffs hurting small businesses, but most support them

The CFIB poll also revealed something that surprised Gaudreault: Despite concerns over counter-tariffs, three-quarters of businesses surveyed said they support Canada's decision to impose them. 

"I think it comes from a sense that something needs to be done … not to just lie down there, and let's let the U.S. administration do whatever it is that they want," said Gaudreault. 

Although Cluck Clucks will now likely face higher costs each time it opens a new location, the restaurant is on the side of counter-tariffs.

"It is for the good of the entire country," said Hashim at a Cluck Clucks in Pickering. "As a citizen, as a naturalized citizen, we will bite the bullet for our adopted country." 

But back at the lacrosse store, Santos reveals that she's on the fence about the counter-tariffs, after learning that they will affect most goods sold in her store. 

"I want Canada to stand up for themselves and I'm a proud Canadian," she said.

"But on the other side of it, these increases in prices also hurt us."

Ownership of electric vehicles continues to rise in the U.S., with nearly six million battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids currently on the road. Even though that's still a fraction of the overall market and the growth rate of EV sales has slowed, automakers remain invested in the eventual transition away from gasoline, as 2024 sales of traditional internal combustion engine cars fell below 80% for the first time in modern automotive history.

Continued EV sales growth shows that at least for a significant portion of auto consumers, range anxiety is no longer an issue. But it is a persistent fear in the EV market that is getting a new test with the Trump administration looking to slash EV incentives from the federal government.

The majority of EV owners charge up at home, but from city streets and interstate highways to parking garages and airports, the EV industry is concentrated on installing enough chargers in public places to help end range anxiety, while building pure-play charging business models that can stand on their own and turn a profit.

According to the latest figures compiled by Paren AFDC+ Charger Database, there are 68,000 public and private Level 3 (fastest) and Level 2 EV charging stations across the country, each with one or more individual ports, for a total of around 266,000 ports. Installing, operating and servicing the chargers, it's an industry that is a fundamental driver of widescale EV adoption — and right now, it's an industry that is struggling to maintain traction in what has lately become an uncertain and politicized marketplace.

Despite a recent surprise Tesla's sales event at the White House, Trump and his top administration officials — from Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Energy Secretary and former fossil fuels industry CEO Chris Wright — have made it clear that stripping away federal support for EVs is among changes being sought as they prioritize oil and gas in energy policy. Already impacted by the slowdown in EV sales, charging companies are battling a recent freeze on an important federal funding program, while also waiting to see how OEMs are affected by the Trump administration's tariffs and resulting trade wars, particularly involving essential steel and aluminum.

Former President Joe Biden, as part of his signature agenda to combat climate change, set a goal that half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 would be electric, which also meant having an adequate, reliable nationwide charging infrastructure by then. To address the build out, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program was authorized by Congress under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

NEVI earmarked $5 billion in grants, apportioned annually over five years, to states' departments of transportation to deploy a network of 500,000 high-speed EV chargers by 2030, primarily along interstate highways, but also rural roadways and low-income communities. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs. State DOTs are responsible for developing projects and coordinating with site owners and charging companies, which can be an arduous process, markedly different from planning routine infrastructure projects.

A national issue that the funding seeks to address is that while public chargers are relatively plentiful in big cities and suburbs where EV adoption is high — think San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Chicago, Miami and New York — they're lacking in rural and remote communities in places like Montana, Wyoming and upstate New York, where EVs sales are low. That geographic disparity contributes to charging anxiety. Drivers are worried that there aren't enough charging stations outside of metro regions, which accentuates their fears of running out of juice, especially on long trips. And harrowing tales of broken, vandalized or otherwise non-working chargers feed into the trepidations.

According to Paren, four of the five years of NEVI funding, or $3.2 billion, has been approved for all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Yet only $616 million has been awarded by 33 states to 104 applicants for 1,000 charging stations. To date, 60 charging stations with a combined 268 ports have been built, using $33 million of NEVI funds. While the federal government has not released figures, Paren estimates that perhaps less than $25 million has actually been transferred to states to reimburse charging companies for incurred expenses.

Stark evidence of the Trump administration's plans to target EV charging came on Feb. 6, when the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration issued a memo to state DOTs informing them that it was suspending NEVI. The memo stated that FHWA will publish revised NEVI guidelines this spring and solicit public comment before final rules are determined. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy subsequently told Fox Business News that any existing contracts that have been signed "are still going to be funded, but there will be no new funding priorities or projects as we go through a review process."

The NEVI freeze created immediate confusion among state DOTs, especially as to whether the approved funds will indeed be allocated. "We need that to happen, because this program works on a reimbursable basis," said Jim Tymon, executive director of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Many states, he said, "have essentially issued stop work orders, even for existing contracts, because they don't want to be left holding the bag if the feds decide not to reimburse for any work."

Historically, new administrations have set their transportation priorities and shifted them accordingly. Yet amending programs and funding that are authorized in law — including NEVI, for which funding has been delayed — would require an act of Congress. The Trump administration, nonetheless, sidestepped Congress and unilaterally suspended NEVI and its funding formula while it considers new guidelines.

In the interim, if those approved funds are not allocated to states, the courts may end up determining whether the freeze is legal. In a ruling on March 6, a federal judge blocked the president's hold on congressionally approved funds obligated to state agencies and governments, which could conceivably apply to any attempts to renege on NEVI funding.

Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, has a jaundiced view of the motivation behind the NEVI pause. "The administration's plan is not to actually impact the deployment of charging infrastructure," he said. "It's to drive the narrative that we're killing those evil EVs and EV chargers."

For the small sector of EV charging companies, headlined by a trio of publicly owned pure-plays — ChargePoint Holdings, Blink Charging and EVgo — all of the EV uncertainty has been enough to keep shares under considerable pressure, with year-to-date declines of 35% to 50% and two of the three stocks currently trading below $1.

ChargePoint provides infrastructure hardware, software and services to businesses and fleets that operate EV charging networks. Competitors Blink and EVgo own and operate their own chargers and networks, while also supporting third-party operators. All three experienced substantial stock falloffs starting in 2024, and investors are keeping a wary eye on their performance over the coming months.

The rest of the EV charging industry encompasses a diverse array of players, among them privately held startups, a joint venture between eight automotive OEMs known as IONNA, highway truck stop and travel centers like Love's, Kwik Trip and Pilot Flying J, convenience store chains including Wawa, Sheetz and 7-Eleven, and big-box retailers such as Walmart, Target and Costco.  

Nearly half of the NEVI awardees are members of the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, the trade association for more than 250 highway truck stops and travel centers, and SIGMA, which represents fuel marketers. David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs for both groups, is critical of NEVI's "incoherent patchwork, not only of grant requirements, but of regulatory and market backdrops in different states that are wholly untethered to one another." So if the program's pause "is a bona fide effort to turn it into something more market-oriented and consumer-oriented," Fialkov said, "we think that's ultimately better for the market."

McDonald says a look at the industry numbers shows that the reality is, "whatever they attempt to do is probably going to have little to no actual impact on deployment."

In 2025, for example, about 10% of fast-charging ports may be funded through NEVI. McDonald estimated that a total of about 16,000 new fast-charging ports will be added this year. "From a macro perspective, the industry is not dependent on federal funding," he said. At most, he added, "only about 1,500 of those will be NEVI-funded, and maybe even fewer," depending on the breadth of changes to the program.

During an earnings call on March 4, Rick Wilmer, president and CEO of ChargePoint, told analysts that NEVI-related deals represented an "insignificant portion" of its revenue in 2024 and the company did not anticipate NEVI changes would have a material effect on its business.

According to Paren data, ChargePoint has received three NEVI awards totaling $1.75 million.

Separately, Wilmer told CNBC that in the context of NEVI, ChargePoint supports its customers that operate charging stations and sell electricity. "We're very intentional about not doing that, because it would put us in direct competition with them," he said. "We provide the technology and the solutions and help our customers apply for and win NEVI funding. So in the grand scheme of things, NEVI is a very small portion of our business."

ChargePoint reported positive results for the fourth quarter of its FY2025, ended in January, though full-year revenue declined more than 17%, and its stock has fallen roughly 60% over the past year.

The EV charging industry is going through an evolution right now, according to Craig Irwin, an industry analyst at Roth Capital Partners, and companies not dependent on subsidies have better prospects. "The focus on putting credible products out there without subsidy dollars is a winning strategy," he said. "People want chargers in front of their libraries, real estate developments and other public places. The demand is still there."

A spokesperson for EVgo, which sites its public chargers in just such high-use urban and metro areas, said that it has received minimal funding through NEVI. The company generates revenue from the utilization of its charging network and taps into other incentive programs offered by state governments and utility companies, whose programs do not include the same geographic constraints as NEVI.  

In December, EVgo announced the closing of a $1.25 billion guaranteed loan from the U.S. Department of Energy, a financing commitment it has pointed to as a sign of certainty. "This loan ensures we are fully funded to add at least 7,500 [ports at roughly 1,100 charging stations], more than tripling our installed base over the next five years," CEO Badar Khan told analysts during its earnings call earlier this month.

Yet the Trump administration has threatened to find ways to retroactively pull DOE loan funding approved in the last days of the Biden administration, which sprinted to get deals finalized before Trump's inauguration.

EVgo has been growing, reporting fourth-quarter 2024 revenue up 35% year-over-year, and up 60% for the full year. But despite those gains, the company continues to operate at a loss.

Blink says it does not depend much on NEVI to fund its charging infrastructure, relying instead on hardware sales, software subscriptions, charging revenue and corporate partnerships. "The majority of our other funding is within the largest utility companies," said CEO Mike Battaglia. "There are some [state] grants out there, as well, that we take advantage of."

Blink achieved record charging revenue last year, and significantly grew the Blink-owned network, according to its recent Q4 and full year report on March 13. Yet, revenue declined in the fourth quarter and for the full year in comparison to "exceptionally strong equipment sales in 2023," Battaglia said. The company said it expects revenue will pick up in the second half of 2025 and to have a better idea as to when it will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability later in the year.

Then there's the elephant in the room — Tesla, whose sales and stock price have plunged lately following a post-election surge. Tesla is in a unique position, as a manufacturer of both branded EVs and charging stations — and whose CEO Elon Musk has emerged as a central character not just in the sector, but across the entire economic and political landscape.

It has heavily invested in building out its network of superchargers, which are compatible with a growing number of other OEMs' EV models, including GM, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Rivian. And its proprietary NACS charging connector and port is being adopted by other charging companies. Ironically, considering that Musk favors getting rid of EV subsidies, Tesla is the second-largest recipient of NEVI funds, granted more than $41 million for 99 sites. Elon Musk said in the lead-up to the election that any Trump policies that hurt EVs would hurt his competitors more than Tesla, but recently, Tesla and other Musk firms have been lobbying the government, at least on the issue of tariffs.

With so much uncertainty looming over the EV charging industry — plus the shakeout that typically occurs among nascent tech industries — there's bound to be consolidation this year. Several companies have already declared bankruptcy or gone out of business, including the North American affiliates of European utility-owned charging companies, Enel X and EVBox, and Tritium, which runs an EV charging equipment plant in Tennessee and was acquired by an Indian conglomerate after declaring insolvency in 2024.

Depending on the outcome of the NEVI situation, companies that heavily rely on its funds and can't access alternative capital sources may go belly up or partner with other entities. The fate of the public companies remains to be seen, while Tesla spins in its own topsy-turvy orbit. In the meantime, EV adoption does continue to increase, and more chargers will be installed in a growing number of places. It's the pace, and the winners and losers, that are yet to be determined.

Oops, something went wrong

Girls just want to have funds, to paraphrase the Cyndi Lauper tune.

Cary Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and the author of the new book "Women and Wealth," knows all about that.

Her decades of being a sherpa for women in the male-dominated financial services field serves as the backdrop for this book, which is aimed at teaching her colleagues about the psychology behind women's financial mojo and the best ways to attract and retain female clients.

It's also flush with insights and strategies for individual women working to take control of their money lives.

I know firsthand what it's like to sit in front of a male financial adviser who only directed his attention to my husband, leaving me feeling dismissed and unheard. We fired him.

Carbonaro's mission is to help women and their financial advisers align so that doesn't happen to others. I asked her to share some of her strategic insights. Below are excerpts of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Kerry Hannon: Women and financial advisers have had a long history of not getting each other. Is that why you wrote this book?

Cary Carbonaro: The next wave of growth in wealth management is women. That was the basis for writing this book. The industry hasn't done anything for the upcoming wealth shift. Thanks to their longer life expectancies, women will inherit wealth, both from baby boomer parents and spouses. In five years, women are expected to control a significant portion of the trillions in financial wealth that will be transferred. The timing is now.

What are the challenges that women face?

The wage gap with their male counterparts. Longevity — women live longer than men. We spend more money in retirement on healthcare than men. We've got a confidence gap related to managing money. We have time out of the workforce for caregiving. Finally, in general, women are more conservative than men when it comes to investing.

You write that women set themselves up for failure when managing money. In what way?

In my experience, women are emotionally tied to money. Feelings and emotions get wrapped around money with women more than men. They get attached to all kinds of things, houses, and stocks. There's an emotional tie to it where they sometimes can't make a clear decision because their feelings are involved. Guys don't have that issue as much.

How can financial advisers better serve women?

They can work on better communication. Women want to be spoken to in a language that's comfortable to them. The industry is all about male terms. Male advisers talk about beating the S&P 500 and use sports analogies.

That doesn't resonate with many women. Women don't care about beating the S&P 500. Women care about, am I going to be okay? Am I going to run out of money? Are my children going to be okay? Am I going to be a bag lady? Can I go on this vacation? Can I buy a second house? Women want to tie money to life events.

I'm not dumbing it down at all for women. I'm just telling them I'm putting it in life goals rather than dollars and cents and jargon. Totally different.

You also see a role for financial advisers to help women with career building. How so?

I help my female clients in negotiating for themselves as they ask for raises and salaries when they're going for jobs. I coach all of them on that because it's part of wealth-building.

Why aren't there more women advisers?

Women make up only about a quarter of all certified professional advisers, CFPs, or 24,546 out of a total of 103,093.

It is so hard to get women involved. Younger women don't think of it as a career path. Once we do bring them in, it's hard for them to stay. They get burned out. Out of those 23%, very few of those women are rainmakers. There is still cultural bias about women not being as sophisticated about money even as advisers.

More women are the breadwinners in their homes these days. How does this impact their financial outlook?

What's super exciting about this is that the numbers of women breadwinners have been moving up. By 2030, women are finally going to be majority breadwinners in the United States for the first time in history. Mind-blowing, right?

The challenge is having a spouse supporting them. You really need to have a very strong spouse who is OK with you making more money, and who is going to take a secondary role to help with the children and the caregiving and the household.

Another challenge for women breadwinners is how they relate with their friends. Are their friends supportive? Is their family supportive? Or are they taking shots at them because they don't spend more time with the kids, go to PTA meetings, and get involved with fundraisers?

As an adviser, I work with them to learn to be a strong financial person not just making the money but knowing what to do with it once they have it, and balancing that piece with the rest of their life.

What makes you crazy about how women view their financial future?

Many younger women still think someone else will be in charge of their financial future and take care of it for them. I recently gave a presentation at a very elite high school. It was a mixed group of girls and guys. I asked the group of girls how many thought that they were going to be responsible for their own financial future. And maybe 5% of the hands went up.

About 90% of women are going to be responsible at some point in their lives for their finances. They will either be divorced, single, or widowed. I don't want women to get in those situations where they're vulnerable, and they don't know anything, and then they trust the wrong person.

What role does fear play?

Fear has made me a huge saver and investor and better adviser. I have always saved up to 50% of my pay, which is a crazy number. I don't spend what I make. I never have. I never will. I'm now 57, and I'm finally spending, because there's no reason not to spend at this point in my life. I have to turn the spending spigot on, which is really, really hard for me because fear has kept me from spending all these years. I work with many women in the same situation.

If they have turned off the spending spigot for all these years, when I tell them they can turn it on, they're like, what? I don't even know how to do that. It's such a different shift in mindset.

You write about the designer bag lady syndrome? Explain.

Loads of women who make over $200,000 a year still have the bag lady fear. I am one of them. This is really personal to me. We still feel there's a chance that we could be penniless, homeless, and a bag lady. It's a fear — even if it's irrational in some cases, but it's what drove them and me all these years to feather my nest.

What keeps you up at night these days?

What keeps me up at night is that my profession is not changing and is not helping women enough. I want to make a dent in this profession, and I want to change the way women are treated in meetings with their advisers.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump's antitrust enforcers are not backing down from legal fights with Big Tech, even as the administration signals a willingness to take a lighter touch with artificial intelligence.

The administration is pressing ahead with two antitrust lawsuits already taken to trial against Google (GGOG, GOOGL) and prepping for new antitrust trials against Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (APPL).

Trump officials at the Federal Trade Commission are also broadening a probe into Microsoft (MSFT) and its relationship with AI upstart OpenAI while challenging Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard.

"This isn't the Bush administration," Trump's FTC chair Andrew Ferguson told a group of American CEOs on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., referring to one of the weakest US antitrust enforcement periods in modern history.

But Trump is also showing he may take a lighter approach to AI as the US competes with China for world supremacy in that ascendant technology.

In a March 7 filing, Trump's Justice Department argued to a judge that Google should be able to keep its AI investments in companies such as Anthropic even if other parts of its empire are broken up.

"The DOJ action is not just a signal on how the President will treat AI, it is a reaction to, and clear response to, the policy of the president and vice-president," said JD Harriman, former outside patent counsel for Steve Jobs at Apple and a partner with Foundation Law Group.

Boston College Law professor David Olson agreed that the DOJ's decision not to interfere with Google's AI ambitions is evidence of a shift from the Biden era.

"Just from a policy standpoint, I think that it's telling that they might be walking back [AI remedies], specifically," Olson said. "Of all of the things they could have walked back, that was the one they decided."

The tech world is trying to determine how aggressive Trump's antitrust enforcers will be following four years of a Biden administration marked by legal fights with many of Silicon Valley's biggest names.

Trump FTC boss Ferguson made it clear in his speech that his agency wouldn't be backing down. The FTC, he said, would challenge mergers it suspects would harm Americans economically but leave the rest alone.

To that end, the FTC told a judge this week that it was ready to start a trial against Amazon in September.

The FTC also plans to widen its investigation into Microsoft, according to Bloomberg. The probe was first launched by Biden FTC Chair Lina Khan, a key architect of a new movement seeking to expand the legal theories that can give rise to antitrust claims.

By sustaining many of these cases and probes against Big Tech, Trump has parted ways with traditional Republican-style enforcement, said Peter Salib, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

"It's very hard to say what's going on," Salib added.

Antitrust attorney Mark Wagoner noted following Trump's win in November, "I am not necessarily convinced that we're going to go back to what people would call sort of the regular order of Republicans."

"The new Republican Party is very much a populist party," he added. "It's no longer the party of big business."

Salib said Trump's motivation for going after companies like Meta (which owns Facebook) and Google is to curb censorship of conservative content.

"The reason they're treating [tech] this way is so different," Salib said. Under Biden, "big was bad for all kinds of reasons."

But it's clear the administration shares some of the same competition concerns that bothered the Biden administration.

That may come to the fore again next month when FTC is set to face off against social media giant Meta (META) in an antitrust lawsuit brought during Trump's first term in office.

Starting April 14, the parties are scheduled to appear for trial in the federal district court for the District of Columbia. The government seeks to unwind Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.

The government alleges the company leveraged its acquisitions to block rivals from the market for personal social networking services.

This spring, the Justice Department will also be involved in a trial that will determine what happens to Google's $2 trillion empire. That decision is in the hands of federal Judge Amit Mehta, who ruled last August that Google illegally monopolized online markets for "general search" and "general search text.”

The DOJ has stuck to a Biden-era request for a federal judge to break up Alphabet's Google, calling for divestment of its Chrome browser.

But in the same request, the DOJ also stood down on the prior administration's push for Google to sell off its AI investments.

This lighter touch with AI has support from Congress too, according to Harriman, a partner with Foundation Law Group.

In December, he said, a congressional bipartisan task force on AI made it clear in a report that lawmakers would take a "wait and see" attitude on AI regulation.

They expressed concern over China's AI advancements and the industry's potential impact on military strength, noting that the country had secured more AI patent applications, journal publications, and journal citations.

"This gives the President a clear path to drop the pressure on Google to divest, without fear of congressional override or even complaint," Harriman said.

There have been other signs of AI restraint as well. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order issued by President Biden that directed AI developers to apply AI "responsibly,” including by disclosing their safety test results to the government.

Trump instead issued an executive order titled "Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence," which emphasized deregulation in the interest of encouraging American dominance.

The order directed federal advisers in technology and national security to "enhance America's global AI dominance."

At the Paris AI Summit on Feb. 11, Vice President JD Vance then emphasized AI opportunity over safety concerns.

"I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago," Vance said. "I'm here to talk about AI opportunity."

"[T]o restrict its development now would not only unfairly benefit incumbents in the space, it would mean paralyzing one of the most promising technologies we have seen in generations."

Oops, something went wrong

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has entered correction, falling 10% from its February all-time highs as political uncertainty has driven fears over the market outlook. 

"There's been a sentiment shift," Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert told Yahoo Finance. "The sentiment and the client and investor focus has completely swung upside down versus where we started the year."

Entering 2025, the consensus on Wall Street called for the US economy to grow at a healthy pace and lead continued outperformance of the US equity market against the rest of the world. Now, the prevailing market fear is that President Trump's current economic policies — namely tariffs, federal job cuts, and strict immigration — could further slow economic growth. This has prompted several economic research teams to lower their GDP forecasts, some strategists to cut their year-end S&P 500 targets, and stocks around the rest of the world to outperform the US market.

Still, few are calling for an overall lackluster year in US stocks. In a note to clients this week, Yardeni Research cut its 2025 year-end S&P 500 target from 7,000 to 6,400, which represents a roughly 14% increase from current levels. Notably, the forecast didn't come with a projection for lower earnings growth this year. Instead, the Yardeni team is now just assuming the S&P 500 won't return its record-high valuation seen entering the year.

"We still think earnings growth is going to be good," Yardeni Research chief markets strategist Eric Wallerstein told Yahoo Finance. "There hasn't been a lot that's actually fundamentally changed about the economy. It's more so just uncertainty is weighing on [valuation] multiples."

Read more: What is a recession, and how does it impact you?

To Wallerstein's point, while views on the economic outlook have soured, most economists and equity strategists aren't actually calling for a recession. And some have even argued that since the S&P 500 has sold off so far on the growth concerns, the market's rerating may be overdone. BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas Gargi Chaudhuri told Yahoo Finance her team remains "overweight US equities."

"We're not really worried about a recession yet," Gargi Chaudhuri said. "So if there was a concern around recession, the conversation that we would be having would be a little bit different right now. This is just a pullback from some of the price to perfection that we had in the beginning of the year coming into this year, and this is a healthy pullback."

Research from Carson Group chief markets strategist Ryan Detrick shows 10% corrections not only happen quite frequently but often end up being the main event instead of extending to a bear market, defined by a 20% drop from an all-time high.

Detrick's work shows that since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 48 corrections. But only 12 of those corrections have turned into bear markets, meaning 75% of the time, a correction doesn't spiral all the way down to a bear market.

"We do not see a bear market coming," Detrick told Yahoo Finance. "Early in the post-election year, choppiness is normal and that's kind of what's happening."

The swift nature of the recent pullback is also typically a good barometer for how the index bounces out of a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski. In a research note on Friday, Belski highlighted that outside of the pandemic, no correction since World War II that happened as quickly as the current one has led to a bear market.

"These types of corrections that happen this fast go right back up and recover just as fast, if not more," Belski told Yahoo Finance. He added that this makes him "very comfortable" with his 6,700 year-end target for the S&P 500.

"In terms of fundamentals, they're still flashing green, not yellow, not red," Belski said.
