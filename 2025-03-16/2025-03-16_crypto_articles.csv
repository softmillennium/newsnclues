https://finance.yahoo.com,Porsche Penske Targets Historic Triple Crown Triumph at Le Mans,https://autos.yahoo.com/porsche-penske-targets-historic-triple-181400032.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:14:00 GMT","After a perfect start to its IMSA WeatherTech Championship season, the sweepstakes pot keeps growing for Porsche Penske Motorsport and the regular drivers of its No. 7 Porsche 963, Felipe Nasr and Nick Tandy.

Having swept the “36 hours of Florida” with victories in the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, the team and its two drivers have a chance to win endurance racing’s classic slam with a victory at Le Mans in June. Porsche and Penske will try to match Ford’s record of three victories on the trot in the 1966 and 1968 seasons, but Nasr and Tandy will vie to become the first drivers to win the three major endurance races in a single season.

Tandy, co-driving with Nasr and Laurens Vanthoor at Sebring, has already joined nine other drivers who have won the three majors, including Americans Al Holbert and Hurley Haywood. He won Le Mans on board Porsche’s 919 hybrid in 2015 before being paired with Nasr for this year’s IMSA campaign.

The career of Englishman Tandy, who signed on early with Porsche as a factory driver, has been a mixed bag. He has been in the right car for major endurance wins, which includes being paired with Nasr for the 2025 campaign when Porsche decided not to retain Dane Cameron. But Tandy has also experienced tragedy. His older brother Joe ran the racing team where Tandy competed for his first three years of competition. Joe was killed in a traffic accident in 2009 and the team was disbanded.

Engaging, sharp and affable, Tandy has won a lot of fans over the years. At Sebring, the “Bedforeshire Bullet” made the key pass for track position in his final stint, passing the Cadillac V-Series.R of Frederik Vesti entering the high-speed Turn 17, scene of several major incidents over the course of the day. Following that move early in the night, the Action Express Racing Cadillac could not keep up with the leading Porsche.

“The triple crown is probably one of the more historic kind of accomplishments,” said Tandy, who has been recently lauded for winning the 24-hour events for GT3 cars at the Nürburgring and Spa in addition to the overall wins at Daytona and Le Mans in prototypes.

“It's incredible because I never realized how big a thing it would be winning all the four 24 hours. It went global. People talking about it globally.”

Tandy co-drove to victory at the Petit Le Mans in 2015 on board a factory Porsche 911 RSR, an improbable win over the DP prototypes due to the rear-engine car’s better handling in a day-long deluge. Coupled with the overall win at Sebring, where he already had two class wins, he has scored victories in six major endurance races.

The Penske team chose Brazilian Nasr to contest the final stints at both Daytona and Sebring. With victory at the Petit Le Mans as well, the ex-Formula 1 driver is now poised for recognition of his endurance accomplishments, including last year’s win at the Rolex 24.

“After the win in the 24 Hours of Daytona, we spoke between us,” said Nasr. “What a dream it would be to win Sebring if we can. And here we are. It's just hard to sink it in and understand what we just accomplished here. As a team, it was a perfect race today from beginning to the end. I think there was just one time we cycled through the back very early on when I was in the car. After that, we made our way to the front. The team did a perfect execution along the race.”

Porsche Penske swept the top two steps of the podium thanks to gaining speed in the cool of the night, which has been problematic for the team in its first two seasons with its LMDh entries. Matt Campbell, Mathieu Jaminet and Keven Estre co-drove the No. 6 Porsche 963 to second after passing the Action Express entry on a pit stop.

At Le Mans, Nasr and Tandy will drive a third entry alongside Porsche Penske’s two regular World Endurance Championship cars. Pascal Wehrlein is touted to be the third driver, replacing Vanthoor, who will rejoin his regular WEC team. Porsche Penske Motorsport received an automatic third entry from the Automobile Club de l’Ouest for winning last year’s WeatherTech Championship with the No 7 Porsche 963 co-driven by Nasr and Cameron.

The “triple crown” was famously attempted by Ken Miles in 1966, a year when his co-driver Lloyd Ruby was not available for Le Mans due to an injury. But as the movie “Ford vs. Ferrari” depicted, internal Ford politics robbed him of the victory, an outcome corroborated by magazine writers covering the race.

The last team to attempt to win the three majors with the same chassis and drivers in the same season was Riley & Scott and Wayne Taylor, Scott Sharp and Jim Pace. After winning at Daytona and Sebring in 1996, it was a last-minute decision to go to Le Mans and the team suffered various issues with its Aurora V8-powered R&S Mk. III.",yahoo

Whether you’re in the market for a new 2025 model or a beloved classic from years past, there’s no shortage of automakers hoping to trade horsepower, cornering, maneuverability and style for a big chunk of your savings account.

Find Out: These 10 Used Cars Will Last Longer Than an Average New Vehicle

However, before you drop serious money on a sports car, make sure you know which models to avoid. You don’t want to drive home with a high-priced, high-powered bundle of buyer’s remorse.

GOBankingRates spoke with auto industry insiders who cautioned against buying the following sports cars because they cost too much, are unreliable, lack features or have comparable rivals that offer more for less.

Maserati GranTurismo

MSRP: $159,995 to $191,995

Nearly every automotive expert GOBankingRates consulted put the same $174,000 (depending on the model year) vehicle at the top of the list of sports cars you shouldn’t buy. Among them was Erin Kemp, a consumer advocate with Bumper.

“The Maserati GranTurismo is a car that consumers should think twice about before purchasing,” she said. “The GranTurismo catches the eye of many drivers for being stylish and having a compelling performance profile, but owners often have trouble with its reliability.

“Many have reported problems related to its engine and electrical system. When things do go wrong, the repairs are very costly, too. Cars like this aren’t meant to have a bunch of miles on them, so you can run into expensive problems if you use them for everyday driving.”

Lotus Evora

MSRP: $99,150

No one is saying that the Lotus Evora — produced for a little more than a decade ending in 2021 — isn’t an extraordinary machine. In fact, in a bon voyage tribute during its final production year, The Drive called it “the perfectly imperfect sports car.”

It’s just that with a nearly $100,000 starting price, a little less imperfection would be nice.

“The Evora boasts a raw driving experience, but it’s been criticized for reliability issues over the years,” said Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing for CFR Classic, which specializes in international car shipping and relocation.

“Plus, its interior lacks the polish and comfort features found in other sports cars at its price point.”

Be Aware: 7 SUVs To Avoid Buying in 2025

Jaguar F-Type

MSRP: $79,175 to $114,275

Jaguar has long been synonymous with power, performance and style, but the British luxury brand also has developed a reputation for frequent breakdowns. Earned or not, that reputation has followed its lineage to the F-Type.

“The Jaguar F-Type is a beautiful car with a potent engine lineup, but it has been criticized for its reliability,” said 30-year auto industry veteran Frank De Mulder, founder of Classic Car Maintenance. “Some owners have reported electronic and powertrain issues, which can be costly to repair out of warranty.”

With a starting price of just over $79,000, the last thing drivers need are frequent trips to the shop — plus, several rivals make a more compelling case.

“A Porsche 911 or Chevrolet Corvette might offer similar performance with a better reliability track record,” said De Mulder.

Alfa Romeo 4C

MSRP: $68,745 to $139,920

Advertisement Advertisement

Alfa Romeo discontinued the 4C in 2020; and, while it’s still a popular sports car with plenty of loyalists, De Mulder thinks they could do better.

“The Alfa Romeo 4C is a pure driver’s car but comes with significant sacrifices in terms of comfort and convenience,” he said. “It lacks power steering, and its cabin is quite sparse. While it’s a blast on the track, those looking for a sports car to enjoy on all occasions might prefer the Porsche Cayman, which offers thrilling performance without compromising on comfort.”

BMW i8

MSRP: $148,495 to $164,295

Like the Alfa Romeo 4C, 2020 was the final production year for the BMW i8, and similarly, De Mulder thinks some of its competitors make a more convincing case for your dollars.

“The BMW i8 is a plug-in hybrid that offers a glimpse into the future with its futuristic design,” De Mulder said. “However, its performance doesn’t quite live up to its supercar looks, and for the price, there are several other options that offer better performance and a more engaging driving experience, such as the Acura NSX.”

Nissan GT-R

MSRP: $122,985 to $222,985

Advertisement Advertisement

With 565 horsepower, the Nissan GT-R has the power to match its $122,000 estimated starting MSRP. However, at least one industry veteran thinks the lineup has gotten stale.

“The Nissan GT-R, which was once a significant challenge to modern supercars, now feels like one of the most clichéd sports cars on the road,” said Steve May, an automotive expert who founded NumberPlates4You after 25 years in the automotive industry.

“I believe that since Nissan stopped updating the R35 GT-R, the aftermarket scene took over its evolution.”

Car and Driver backs that up with this summation, “R35 generation dates to 2009, interior lacks refinement, seems crude and rude by today’s standards.”

“If I were looking for more bang for my buck,” May said, “I might consider some Porsche models or even yield to a whim and go for a Corvette.”

Porsche Carrera GT

MSRP: $448,400

Like nearly all auto enthusiasts, May appreciates the power, beauty and performance of the Porsche Carrera GT, but he thinks its safety features are insufficient enough to disqualify it from your shortlist.

“In my years in the auto industry, the Porsche Carrera GT stands out as one of the riskiest cars from the brand,” he said. “While its 5.7-liter engine is incredibly powerful, I feel like driving this car feels raw, especially with its mighty V10.

“The Carrera GT might not be the best choice for beginners since it misses out on essential safety features like traction control and ABS. I believe that with such a tight margin for error, even skilled drivers would find this car challenging.”

https://finance.yahoo.com,R34 GT-R and Other JDM Imports Could Be Pricer Due to Trump's Tariffs,https://autos.yahoo.com/r34-gt-r-other-jdm-180000867.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","The JDM car market is small, but it could be affected by potential U.S. tariffs.

Currently, Japanese market trucks are already subject to a 25 percent tariff, but ordinary passenger cars only get a 2.5 percent ding.

Those importing expensive collectibles such as the R34 Nissan GT-R could face tens of thousands in extra costs.

Last month, the leaders of Japan's auto industry met with the Japanese government to discuss concerns about impending economic damage. Those concerns were, of course, about the possibility of incoming U.S. tariffs that will affect cars and parts imported from Canada and Mexico and the likelihood of similar tariffs being placed on Japanese imports. Not on the docket for those automakers—and perhaps an unexpected fallout from the current trade situation—is that used JDM imports may also be impacted.

Japanese Domestic Market cars, the forbidden fruit that never officially made it to U.S. shores, are a drop in the bucket compared with the global auto trade. However, with the likes of the R34-chassis Nissan Skyline GT-R finally aging into importability under the 25-year Department of Transportation rules, we're at the stage where enthusiasts are going to be going after the last of the golden age of bubble-economy Japanese imports. Already, there are warehouses full of GT-Rs, lined up and just waiting for their build date to hit that 25-year mark.

R34 Skylines were never inexpensive, and they've only become more collectible and more expensive as U.S. eligibility grew closer. More than just appealing to JDM enthusiasts, the car's presence in the Fast and Furious movies and the Grand Turismo video games made the GT-R a household name. The special-edition versions are now easily six-figure cars, and slapping an extra 25 percent tariff on top of them is going to hurt.

Also an issue is a possible spike in shipping costs. Japanese manufacturers of new cars are looking to fill up their U.S. supply of foreign manufactured cars before the tariffs go into effect, and that means cargo ships are full. The JDM market is small potatoes compared with the regular market, and increased demand for shipping may price out importers. On the flip side of this, if tariffs end up reducing demand for Japanese-built new cars, JDM imports might become less expensive.

Heritage Images - Getty Images

Currently, the tiny kei trucks you might see running around are already hit with a 25 percent tariff under the well-known “chicken tax” legislation. Generally, these are inexpensive little trucks, so the added cost isn't a particular issue. Most JDM vehicles are currently hit with a 2.5 percent importation tax, and if this balloons, there'll be fewer potential bargains out there.

With a strong U.S. dollar versus a relatively weak Japanese yen, the JDM market has been pretty tempting of late. Things are further helped by a supply glut, as Japan stopped exporting used cars to Russia—a major market for its used cars—sometime around the start of the war in Ukraine.

If the U.S. market for JDM cars dries up, many of them will instead end up in Australia and New Zealand, both of which are already a paradise for JDM cars. In the meantime, if you were saving up for your favorite Japanese-only model that you'd raced so many times in Gran Turismo, it'd be a good idea to put a little extra aside.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Oscar Piastri Credits Learning How to Reverse a Tractor at Jeremy Clarkson's Farm for Race-Saving Move,https://autos.yahoo.com/oscar-piastri-credits-learning-reverse-170400789.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 17:04:00 GMT","Oscar Piastri recovered for a spin that forced him out of race-winning contention at his home Grand Prix to finish ninth, pulling back points after restarting 16th and momentarily being credited as out as the stewards were unsure if he would be able to escape the high wet grass.

Piastri, once he realized that he could not go forward, reversed his way to the service road and drove to the pits with minimal damage.

Last fall, Piastri visited Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson's farm, where he was roasted for taking 40 minutes to back up a tractor.

He joked about this gained experience once the clouds of defeat began to clear. Jack Snape at The Guadian first reported the Aussie's tractor remark.



""I tried to go forwards and couldn’t,"" Piastri said. ""Good thing I spent some time in the off-season trying to learn how to reverse a tractor on Jeremy Clarkson’s farm. I think it came in handy today.""

Piastri was the fastest car on the track multiple times throughout the 57-lap race, but his performance will end up overshadowed by the low-point results. McLaren started with both cars starting on the front row and at one point looked like it would secure the race maximum of 43 points, settled for 27, putting them tied at the top with Mercedes with their third and fifth place finish.

Piastri told F1TV after the race that while he's currently focused on his mistake, he prefers a race that he knows he had a chance to win over one where he lucks onto the podium.

At the moment, it doesn’t really feel like that,"" Pastri responded when asked about the strength of his race outside the spin. ""I would rather feel like I drove a race where I could’ve put myself on the top step than struggling around and finishing on the podium. At the moment, it hurts, but there are a lot of positives to take from it.

Piastri and the rest of the F1 drivers will race again next week in the Chinese Grand Prix.

https://finance.yahoo.com,The best electric cars to buy now – before higher taxation is applied,https://autos.yahoo.com/best-electric-cars-buy-now-170123763.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 17:01:23 GMT","Thinking about buying an electric car costing more than £40,000? Then you had better move fast as delaying your purchase until April could cost you an additional £2,050.

That’s because from 1 April, new taxation rules will render electric cars liable for car tax. Until now, EVs have been taxed at a zero rate, effectively making vehicle excise duty (VED) non-existent for electric car owners.

The new rules mean EV owners will have to pay tax at the alternative fuel rate, currently £180 a year – and all new electric cars registered from 1 April onwards that cost £40,000 or more will incur the premium car surcharge, aka luxury tax. That will translate to an additional hit of £410 annually, from year two to year six, at today’s rates.

Advertisement Advertisement

In an unusual move, that component of the revised VED rules is being applied retrospectively, so even electric cars that are already on UK roads will be hit, even if you buy before 1 April.

But the premium car surcharge will only apply to new vehicles. So if you buy and register a £40,000-plus EV before April, it won’t be liable – saving you £2,050 over the first six years of ownership.

It may also be worth more later on. Over the next few years, many second-hand buyers are likely to seek out nearly-new examples registered before the 1 April deadline, rather than have to stump up for the premium car surcharge – which may result in these pre-rule-change examples being worth slightly more, relatively speaking.

So if you’re toying with the idea of buying one of these models, it makes sense to do so sooner rather than later. Here are some of our favourites.

Hyundai Ioniq 5 Long Range

From £43,400

The most economical of the bunch combines super-fast charging with an airy interior

Hyundai’s sharp-edged Concept 45 design study of 2019 morphed, with surprisingly few changes, into this mid-sized family SUV, which combines super-fast charging with a light, airy and versatile interior along with a comfortable ride. It now has a rear screen wiper – which the first examples lacked – thus eliminating one of the few reasons not to buy one.

Skoda Enyaq 85

From £44,300

The Skoda Enyaq 85’s impressive size makes it a great option for families

The Czech firm’s take on the Volkswagen ID.4 undercuts its platform-mate, yet feels smarter inside. It suffers from the similarly underwhelming touchscreen software, but the Enyaq is quiet, comfortable and immensely spacious, making it an easy-going way of going electric.

Polestar 2

From £44,950

Be sure to stick to the single-motor versions of the Polestar 2 for a smooth ride

Choose your 2 with care – top-spec models have too firm a ride, but stick to the single-motor versions and the ride is fine. What you get is one of the smartest interiors, as well as one of the slickest touchscreens, in any electric car, along with slick handling and beautifully weighted controls. It’s just a shame it isn’t a little more roomy.

Kia EV6

Odd name, but if you’re after an electric saloon, the Seal is worth a look. Especially so if you’re put off EVs by the risk of a battery fire – the Seal’s LFP battery architecture is far less of a fire risk than other battery chemistries. But that isn’t the only reason to choose one; the interior is high quality, with plenty of space. And the Seal is good to drive, for the most part.

The styling might be divisive, but look past that and the i4 is a thoroughly well sorted electric car. Its four-door coupe profile means it’s more svelte than many EVs, and while the i4 isn’t quite as agile as most BMWs, it’s still good to drive. The wide-opening boot lid makes it practical, too.

VW’s large hatchback is geared for comfort and it delivers in spades. Even on rutted roads, the soft suspension damps out most bumps, and there’s a huge amount of space inside. True, it could do with more physical buttons in place of all the touchpads, but on the whole the ID.7 is a class act.

Genesis GV60

The GV60 is about to get a mid-life primp, so look for a deal on the last of these pre-facelift models. You’ll get a comfortable, beautifully finished and spacious electric SUV that’s a little different to the norm – and one that is backed with lots of ownership perks.

Volkswagen ID.Buzz

VW’s large hatchback is a great option for those looking for plenty of space

After decades of teasing us with concept cars, Volkswagen finally released a modern interpretation of its classic Type 2 bus with the ID.Buzz – and never has a people carrier been so cool. With a choice of five or seven seats, loads of space for family adventures and wonderfully flexible seating, it effortlessly defines the electric SUV as a multi-person vehicle.

Kia EV9

From £65,025

The EV9 doesn’t quite offer the same versatility as the seven-seat ID.Buzz, but where it triumphs is in its smooth way of getting down the road. Even the most basic EV9s are pools of calm, with soft suspension and brilliant sound deadening. If you want a large EV that’ll send the family to sleep, this will do the job.

Porsche Macan Electric

Like its stablemate the Taycan, the electric Macan sets new standards for driving enjoyment in an electric car.

$4 Million Pagani Huayra Roadster Backs Into Parked Volkswagen in Minor Mishap

A rare Pagani Huayra Roadster, valued at approximately $4 million, sustained minor damage after reversing into a parked Volkswagen Golf, as captured in a viral social media video.

The incident, which took place in an undisclosed location, shows the high-performance Italian supercar slowly backing up before making contact with the stationary VW, followed by an audible crunch. While details about the extent of the damage remain unclear, reports suggest that the vehicle is protected by paint protection film (PPF), likely minimizing any harm to the ultra-expensive carbon fiber bodywork.

Social media users quickly took notice, with many commenting on the irony of a multi-million-dollar hypercar colliding with a much more common and affordable hatchback. Some enthusiasts also pointed out that this particular Huayra Roadster is believed to be one of the highest-mileage examples in existence, an unusual feat for an exotic car that many owners keep as collectibles.

Under the hood, the Pagani Huayra Roadster is powered by a Mercedes-AMG 6.0-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine, producing 754 horsepower and 738 lb-ft of torque. The powertrain is paired with a seven-speed automated manual transmission, sending power exclusively to the rear wheels. The Roadster variant of the Huayra is a lighter, open-top version of the coupe, featuring intricate aerodynamics and an opulent handcrafted interior.

While the incident is unlikely to have caused any significant mechanical issues, it serves as a reminder that even the world’s most exclusive hypercars are not immune to everyday driving mishaps.

$30 Million Rolls-Royce Boat Tail Spotted in Dubai for the First Time

One of the world’s most exclusive luxury cars, the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail, has made its first public appearance in Dubai. With a staggering price tag of $30 million, this ultra-luxurious, coachbuilt masterpiece is one of only three ever produced. The vehicle spotted in Dubai is registered in Ajman, UAE, adding to the region’s reputation for housing some of the rarest and most expensive automobiles.

First unveiled in 2021, the Rolls-Royce Boat Tail draws inspiration from the brand’s 1932 Boat Tail model, blending classic elegance with contemporary craftsmanship. The vehicle features a distinctive two-tone exterior, a commanding Pantheon grille at the front, and a seamless wraparound windshield. Adding to its bespoke design, the Boat Tail comes with a removable fabric roof, allowing for an open-air grand touring experience.

Inside, the Boat Tail offers a refined and meticulously crafted cabin, showcasing a two-tone leather interior that reflects the opulence associated with the Rolls-Royce marque. However, the most striking feature lies at the rear— a center-hinged decklid that opens to reveal an elaborate hosting suite. This includes a double refrigerator designed to chill champagne to the perfect temperature, along with a set of fine crystal champagne flutes, embodying the pinnacle of automotive luxury.

Powering the Boat Tail is Rolls-Royce’s signature 6.75-liter twin-turbocharged V12 engine, delivering an effortless yet commanding performance befitting its status. The vehicle is entirely hand-built, with each of the three units customized to the specific tastes of its owner, ensuring exclusivity on an unprecedented level.

Pagani Utopia Damaged by Bystander on Delivery Day

A supercar owner’s dream delivery day took an unexpected turn when his brand-new Pagani Utopia suffered damage during a celebratory event. The incident occurred when a car spotter accidentally dropped an umbrella, scratching the front fender of the exquisite hypercar.

The dealership had organized a public event to commemorate the delivery of the Pagani Utopia at the owner’s request. Known for generously sharing his supercar collection with enthusiasts, the owner had invited fans to witness the unveiling. Despite less-than-ideal weather conditions, the event drew a sizable crowd eager to see the rare hypercar in person.

Unfortunately, the excitement was marred by the accident, which left superficial scratches on the Utopia’s exposed carbon-fiber bodywork. The car’s striking teal green finish and silver wheels caught everyone’s attention, but the lack of a paint protection film (PPF) made the vehicle more susceptible to damage. Experts have noted that the scratches appear minor and should be repairable with a simple polish.

The Pagani Utopia is a masterpiece of engineering and design. Its exposed carbon-fiber exterior, coupled with its teal green hue, is a visual marvel. Beneath the hood, the hypercar boasts a 6.0-liter twin-turbo V12 engine, delivering an astounding 864 horsepower at 6000 rpm and 811 lb-ft of torque between 2800 and 5900 rpm. Buyers have the choice of a 7-speed automated manual transmission or a traditional manual gearbox, complete with three pedals for purists.

Despite the unfortunate mishap, the Utopia remains an extraordinary vehicle, representing Pagani’s commitment to craftsmanship and performance. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting such rare and valuable vehicles, even during celebratory moments. Fortunately, the minor damage is unlikely to overshadow the awe-inspiring presence of this remarkable hypercar.

https://finance.yahoo.com,"2007 Subaru WRX STI Limited, Understated Rally Hero on Bring a Trailer",https://autos.yahoo.com/2007-subaru-wrx-sti-limited-150000507.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT","Here's an STI from the era when it was a performance bargain.

Modifications are minimal, which is rare for a WRX.

As a Limited trim and finished in silver, it's more subtle than the typical STI.

Subaru killed off the WRX STI back in 2021, to the lasting grief of many a rally fan. Really though, the car had something of a lingering death, as it had gradually been getting surpassed by the rising tide of performance from the competition. A little over 300 horsepower from a slightly laggy 2.5-liter boxer-four that returns 20 mpg was outdated by the dawn of the 2020s.

Bring a Trailer

Things were different back in the early 2000s. This 2007 STI Limited, up for sale on Bring a Trailer (which, like Car and Driver, is part of Hearst Autos), is one of 800 sold in the U.S. in that year. It was the final hurrah for the GD-chassis car that brought the STI badge to the U.S. in 2004. Back then, this practical four-door Subaru sedan could go toe to toe with a V-8 Mustang in a straight line, then tear up a snowy day sideways, making its driver feel like Colin McRae.

Bring a Trailer

Fond memories indeed. Unfortunately, many of these cars eventually passed to less careful hands and were modified by plenty of would-be Ken Blocks who gymkhana'd their cars into the nearest curb. Attrition levels were as high as the boost levels, and performance Subarus still in factory spec today are the exception rather than the rule.

Bring a Trailer

This example is one of those exceptions. With 40K miles on the odometer, it has only a couple of changes from showroom stock, and those are from Subaru's in-house Subaru Performance Team. This car's cat-back exhaust and air intake were dealer-installed accessories that wouldn't have violated the warranty when new.

The EJ257 flat-four is specific for the U.S. market (Japanese STIs got a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine with around the same power) and in this application made 293 horsepower. Getting that power to the ground in slippery conditions are limited slip front and rear differentials, with a driver-selectable central differential shunting things front to rear. The transmission is a six-speed manual.

Bring a Trailer

The hatchback STI that followed this generation of STI was a much softer car that felt less driver-oriented. It was a better Impreza in terms of everyman comfort, but less of a rally hero. This 2007 STI offers a much rawer driving experience. It's louder and lighter, with heavier steering and a smaller feel. It's what you want your Subaru rally hero to be like.



Being a Limited, there are some pleasant options such as heated leather seats and automatic climate control, but the appeal here is the originality more than luxury. The Limited is also perhaps the most reserved STI variant of its day, with a discreet rear lip spoiler and modest 17-inch wheels. Don't let the subtle looks fool you; it's still a rally hooligan at heart.

Listed as number 51 of the 800 made, this STI has the potential to be a future collectible. Even if Subaru starts building the STI again, it's not going to be able to make them like this anymore.

Having to clean puke out of a car is one of the most unpleasant experiences to deal with. You have the chunks from whatever they ate, the fluid, and then the smell.

The smell can be the worst par of it all, and it can linger if not tackled right away. To avoid that worst-case outcome, it’s best to be prepared and act quickly when sickness happens. Here are the supplies, cleaners, and instructions for cleaning puke out of your car, from the seats to carpets, floor mats and even the headliner (yup, it can get everywhere).

This story is 100% human researched and written based on actual first-person knowledge, extensive experience and expertise on the subject of cars and trucks.

What Should You Do if Your Child Pukes in the Car?

I remember being on our way back from Washington, D.C. when, out of nowhere, our daughter began to vomit. I caught whatever I could in my hand. Yes, I know, gross! Luckily, I had a roll of paper towels and bags in the backseat with us to clean up and catch anything left over. When it was safe, my husband pulled over to the side of the road. This allowed us to better assess the situation and clean a bit more until we got home, where we could do a more thorough cleaning.

If you find yourself in a similar situation while on the road, it’s important to act quickly. If you’re driving, pull over when it’s safe, and then turn off all fans and air conditioning. Open windows for ventilation because fresh air will help your sick child and help air out the car a bit.

Carsickness Supplies To Keep On Hand

Prepping your car for someone to get sick–or for spills or other messes—is key. Keep disposable plastic bags, paper towels, baby wipes and hand sanitizer in the car. If your kids are prone to car sickness, you may want to keep ginger candy, bottled water and Dramamine in the car, too.

When sickness occurs, use paper towels to clean up any chunks. Wipe down the hard surfaces that the vomit may have touched using baby wipes or better, sanitizing wipes.

The real cleaning will begin when you get home.

When preparing to clean vomit out of your car, lay down newspaper or an old sheet beneath the area where you’ll be working. This helps to keep any mess contained. For cleaning the floor mats, start by gently lifting the mat to remove any solids that may have made it through to the carpeted section below. A plastic spatula can be used to scrape off anything stuck to the mat. Use damp towels or rags soaked in soap mixed with warm water to clean off all surfaces thoroughly. And then allow the mats to air dry completely.

Once everything is clean and dry, use an odor-eliminating spray throughout the car’s interior to get rid of any lingering smells.

What Types of Cleaners are Best for Removing Puke Odors?

Credit: The Chemical Guys

Enzyme cleaners, popular as pet-stain removers, are the ideal solution for eliminating both the stain and odor associated with vomit. Enzyme cleaners contain powerful, natural enzymes that seek out organic matter and break it down. This removes puke residue from both surfaces and fabrics.

Unlike bleach or strong chemical solutions, enzyme cleaners are safe to use around children and pets. I like that they don’t leave a heavy scent behind like other harsh cleaning agents do. Enzyme cleaners will even loosen long-set stains from hard-to-reach places like carpets, cracks in car upholstery, floor mats, etc.

To get puke, or other substances, out of the headliner, use a foam cleaner for fabrics. Spray it on, let it sit and wipe it off. It works miracles.

DIY Cleaners Work Well, Too

In addition to enzyme cleaners, there are several other cleaning products that can be used to tackle puke stains. Good Housekeeping recommends white vinegar and baking soda, while laundry detergent, ammonia solution, and diluted bleach are also popular choices.

White vinegar is a great all-purpose cleaner for both surfaces and fabrics – plus it’s cheap and safe to use. Laundry detergent is good for removing liquid messes from car carpets, mats, and other fabrics. Ammonia solution (1 part ammonia to 4 parts water) can be used on non-fabric surfaces like vinyl or plastic. While diluted bleach (1 part bleach to 10 parts water) is highly effective, this should only be used as a last resort when other methods fail because it can stain fabrics and cause skin irritation.

Which Enzyme Cleaners are Best?

Because we have a toddler, it’s important that the cleaning solutions we use are non-toxic. safe on fabrics and carpets, but also effective. Here are some good ones:

Resolve Urine Destroyer -I love how quickly it works. All it takes is a simple spray on the affected area. And then you let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing it off with water or wiping it away with a dry cloth.

Biokleen Bac-Out – It is formulated with natural, live enzymes and essential oils to quickly break down organic compounds such as vomit and other stains.

OxiClean – OxiClean is an all-purpose cleaner that has enzymes to remove odors, dirt, and tough stains.

Nature’s Miracle – Nature’s Miracle produces a variety of enzymatic cleaners designed to safely and effectively remove pet messes from carpets, fabrics, and upholstery.

Cleaning Your Child’s Car Seat

Even if you don’t see any puke in your kid’s car seat, it’s a good idea to clean it out thoroughly after a puking incident. Remove the seat from the car, then remove all the covers and padding and clean according to the manufacturer’s instructions, typically by running through the wash.

Be sure to wipe down all the surfaces of the car seat including in the cracks and crevices, and inspect the underside to make sure it’s clean.

Last, this is a good opportunity to clean your car’s seat, too; chances are if there was any spray or spillage, it made its way into those tight crevices.

Being Prepared is Key to a Puke-Free Car

Kids getting sick in the car can be unpleasant for everyone. It’s all the better if you can avoid having to clean puke out of your car. Be sure to keep an eye out for signs of nausea or discomfort such as dizziness and sweating. Moving items like plastic bags and wipes within the child’s reach can help them to react quickly. And giving them bland food before you get on the road will help ward off sickness, too.

Having to clean puke out of a car and getting rid of the smell may seem impossible, but when done right, no one will ever be the wiser. And those puke-filled road trips will just be another amusing memory to chat about with your kids when they’re grown and dealing with their own little puke-machines in the car.

Regardless of inflationary or economic uncertainty concerns, SUVs comfortably dominate the auto landscape in the U.S.

With ownership costs — initial costs, financing, depreciation, insurance, fuel and assorted parking and ticketing fees — being so expensive, cars are the No. 1 wealth-killer for many drivers, especially those from lower-income households and individuals on fixed incomes.

According to Statista, the SUV market in the U.S. is projected to reach $333 billion this year, but with so many models available, there are some worth every penny and some that should be avoided at all costs.

Advertisement Advertisement

Regarding SUVs you shouldn’t buy, GOBankingRates asked auto expert Chris Pyle, who operates as a full-time virtual mechanic at JustAnswer, and Mike Winter, long-time owner of MDP Diesel & Auto Repair in Jackson, Michigan, and here’s what they had to say about several SUVs/groups of SUVs that aren’t worth buying.

Popular SUVs Mechanics Say Aren’t Worth the Cost

Land Rover Range Rover

Land Rover Discovery

Land Rover’s luxury SUVs get a bad rep when it comes to value for money and reliability. For the experienced Winter, the Range Rover model has too many concerns that make it a bad choice for buyers, citing, “Terrible depreciation and resale value, very high repair costs…electrical issues, coolant issues, turbo issues.”

Pyle picked on a Land Rover too, but for him, it’s the Discovery that should be avoided. “They are expensive to maintain doing just general maintenance and when they fail, the parts and labor are high,” he said.

Toyota 4Runner

According to Pyle, the 4Runner’s problems stem from value and a squandering of the vehicle’s intended usage. “It is a great vehicle inside and outside — a purchase you will not be disappointed with,” he said. “The bad part though, it is designed to be off-road and most [people] do not do that. So, you are paying for features never used. A different and cheaper SUV to stay on the highway is better.”

Volkswagen Taos

Consumer Reports (CR) uses road test scores and predicted reliability for its vehicle analyses, but also relies on customer (subscriber) satisfaction and safety scores. So, its articles should approached with caution. Still, it named the Taos the second-least reliable vehicle for 2024, and Winter agrees. Volkswagen’s five-seat compact SUV may require frequent and expensive repairs. The price is right (expected 2025 MSRP should be around $26,000, per Kelley Blue Book), but is it worth it?

Jeep Cherokee/Wagoneer

Jeep Wrangler/Gladiator

CR listed Jeep’s Grand Cherokee and the Grand Cherokee L among its 10 least-reliable cars for 2024, and Jeep as the worst automaker out of 34 brands. Winter lists “electrical issues, transmission issues and oil consumption” as trouble spots for the Cherokee and believes the Wagoneer is simply “way overpriced, with terrible depreciation,” among many issues.

Regarding the Wrangler and Gladiator, Pyle states, “They do not have the greatest engine longevity. [And] same as the 4Runner, they are designed to be off-road. The problem here is owners do beat them up off-road and then complain about the ride on the interstate. They are loud and sway, and the soft-top roof leaks in the rain.”

Advertisement Advertisement

Hyundai Tucson

Despite its above-average RepairPal reliability ranking, in Winter’s experience, the Tucson is a “ticking time bomb” due to “major engine/transmission issues and a high engine failure rate.” As CoPilot notes, Hyundai has improved its reliability reputation in recent years, so if you’re keen on a Tucson, avoid older model years (2011, 2012, 2015-2017).

Ford Escape EcoBoost

Ford EcoSport

There are noticeable differences in size between Ford’s Escape EcoBoost trim and its EcoSport, both inside and out (the EcoSport is smaller), but, according to Winter, major repairs and durability issues plague both SUVs. Regarding the Escape, “Reliability isn’t good because of coolant issues, carbon buildup and oil consumption,” and the EcoSport is simply a “terrible drive, with major engine issues/failures and high repair costs.”

Full-Size SUVs (Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, Cadillac Escalade)

Pyle mentioned a group of troublesome full-size SUVs to avoid as well; in particular, the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade. “They are big, heavy, not aerodynamic and drink gas,” Pyle said. “They are meant to move the family and tow the camper. Too many [that] own these vehicles rarely have more than four occupants, and never tow anything. You are paying a lot to get a lot, but it’s not what you really need.”

High-End Luxury SUVs (Range Rover Evoque, Mercedes G550/GLS/EQS, Audi RS Q8, Lexus LX, BMW X7)

Pyle took the time to address several luxury SUVs as well. The Range Rover Evoque, Mercedes G550/GLS/EQS, Audi RS Q8, Lexus LX and BMW X7 “are just too expensive,” Pyle stated. “There are lower-priced SUVs just as nice with similar features with a cost tens of thousands less. Plus you do not have the hassle of finding a shop that will actually touch it when it breaks. Purchasing a vehicle over $100K is dumb and for most, that is way too high still.”

https://finance.yahoo.com,Hellcat Hunter: Mercedes-AMG S63 E-Performance Hits the Drag Strip,https://autos.yahoo.com/hellcat-hunter-mercedes-amg-s63-140000177.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","""Man, you're out here eating up Hellcats!"" So says the guy in the Dodge Charger Scat Pack who had the misfortune of lining up twice against the 2024 Mercedes-AMG S63 E-Performance plug-in hybrid at Rockingham Dragway. The big Benz doesn't look like it would be all that quick, especially wearing a gold paint job that prompted me to dub the car ""Champagne Supernova"" on the sign-in tech sheet. (Mercedes calls the hue Kalahari gold metallic, a $1750 option.) It's the kind of color you expect to see in the valet line at Joe's Stone Crab, not in the staging lanes at the Rockingham March Madness takeover, where the predominant exterior aesthetic seemed to be ""vandalized by a graffiti artist, but in a cool way."" The S63 is a sleeper, is what I'm saying.

The S-class doesn't look like it has 791 horsepower and 1055 pound-feet of torque, but there's a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 at the front making 603 horsepower, and there's an electric motor out back contributing another 188 hp. It's like a mullet on both sides of your head: party in the front, party in the back.

The electric motor is hooked to its own two-speed transmission and can generate its peak 188 horsepower for 10-second stints, after which it drops to 94. And 10 seconds, by my seat-of-the-pants reckoning, ought to be just about long enough to see the S63 down the quarter-mile. It feels like a 10-second car off the line. Is it? Let's find out.

Advertisement Advertisement

I've only run one official 10-second quarter-mile, in a Hennessey Hammer Wagon at Darlington. I almost certainly ran one there in the McLaren 765LT too, but the timing equipment malfunctioned on my first run and then traction went away after that. I got close with a Dodge Challenger Hellcat Redeye at Fayetteville, but the best I could wring was an 11.1. Even with the gonzo horsepower of modern muscle- and supercars (and EVs), 10 seconds remains rare air.

Car and Driver

But the S63 feels like it's got the juice. With a wet clutch, all-wheel drive, and launch control, the S63 departs like it's going to pull the front tires off the ground. (It's close, really—Elana Scherr tells me the drag-race term for this is a ""paper-slipper,"" because you could slide a piece of paper under the front end at launch.)

On my first few runs, I can't seem to get launch control going, but the Benz still cracks off runs in the 11.3-second range at 126 mph. That is no joke, but not quite what I'm looking for. I pull to the side in the staging lanes and consult the AMG addendum to the S-class owner's manual, learning that my practiced starting-line calm is actually too chill—you need to hold the brake with your left foot and aggressively stab the accelerator with your right to tell the Benz you'd like some launch control, please. At that point, the V-8 chatters at just below 4000 rpm, and when you pop your foot off the brake, you're on your way to what is surely a sub-3.0-second sprint to 60 mph.

Car and Driver

The first time I make a launch-control pass, I'm on my way back past the bleachers when I hear a spectator exclaim, ""That m---------r's fast!"" After another run, a guy calls out, ""Is that an AMG?"" Yes. ""What've you done to it?"" Nothing. This is just how they build them now.

Advertisement Advertisement

And I sneak into the 11.1 range—11.19 seconds at 125 mph—but that's all it's got. Which, make no mistake, is crazy quick, especially for a car that can do that sort of thing while giving you a hot stone massage and wafting its own signature fragrance from the HVAC vents. The S63 E-Performance is an impressive answer to the question, ""Where does the S-class fit in a G-class world?"" It's stately and menacing all at once, like Nicole Kidman in The Perfect Couple.

The S63 never lost, even dispatching a fearsome regular-cab F-150 powered by what sounded like a supercharged Coyote. A guy in a Jeep Trackhawk challenged me to a run but later decided he wanted to line up against the F-150, so we don't know how that would have turned out, but I suspect my perfect record would've been shattered. The Jeep owner was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with a photo of the Trackhawk, and I asked him, ""Am I about to learn not to run against someone who has a picture of their car on their sweatshirt?"" He laughed in a way that suggested that this was correct.

Although I never broke into the 10s, I think my sense that the S63 is a 10-second car is correct. It has a vulnerability, though. Around 80 mph it feels like there's a flat spot in the power, followed by a 100-shot of nitrous. This happened consistently, at the same place every run, making me wonder if the car thought there was a traction problem or some reason to moderate thrust and then suddenly restore it. Then I realized the likely culprit: I was feeling the shift from the two-speed transmission at the rear axle. So that pause and surge before the eighth-mile is the electric motor hitting its limit, then rejoining the party after the upshift. As Benz's tech material says, ""An electric actuator engages second gear by approximately 87 mph, which corresponds to the electric motor's maximum speed of around 13,500 rpm.""

If I may make a suggestion, perhaps we could tinker with the gear ratios to either extend that shift to, say, 130 mph, or do it sooner, before the electric motor runs out of revs. Because I want to break into the 10s again, and I’ve got a feeling that ol' Champagne Supernova here can do it.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Tested: 2025 Mercedes-AMG S63 E Performance Is Always Fully Loaded,https://autos.yahoo.com/tested-2025-mercedes-amg-s63-140000786.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","From the May/June issue of Car and Driver.

Spend some time in one of America's high-rent districts, and you'll see plenty of Mercedes vehicles sporting AMG badges. Some are genuine AMG models; others may wear an AMG trim package. Their presence is symptomatic of well-heeled shoppers reflexively buying ""loaded"" vehicles even when the expensive performance features offer no benefit to their driving lives. Luxury automakers happily encourage this thinking.

As cynical as this may sound, there is no doubt that the full-on AMG models, such as the Mercedes-AMG S63 E Performance, deliver genuine speed and thrills. In this full-size sedan's case, that starts with 791 total horsepower thanks to a 603-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 paired with a nine-speed automatic, plus a 188-hp electric motor coupled to the rear axle through its own two-speed gearbox. Total system torque is a massive 1055 pound-feet sent to all four wheels.

Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

This is enough thrust to hurl the 5877-pound, 210.1-inch-long sedan to 60 mph in just 2.6 seconds and through the quarter-mile in 10.8 seconds at 129 mph. Floor the accelerator at 50 mph, and the speedometer blows through the century mark in seemingly no time, while you're shoved hard into your seat. In Sport+ mode, the ordinarily crisp shifts are even firmer, and the energized exhaust channels a slightly muffled NASCAR stocker.

The only way to get a big sedan capable of greater thrust is with a high-end Lucid Air, Porsche Taycan, or Tesla Model S. While those EVs as well as the S63 must be in their highest performance modes to deliver maximum acceleration, the EVs are notably more responsive in their lesser modes. That's because when the S63 is in Comfort mode, its V-8 turns off at a stop. When it begins moving again, it does so on electric power alone. That works fine in gentle driving, but if you demand more acceleration, the gas engine has to fire up and build boost before the car surges vigorously.

Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

The S63 perks up considerably in Sport and Sport+. And there's plenty of electric assist from the 10.4-kWh battery, which is large enough to motivate the S63 by electrons alone, albeit only for an EPA-estimated 16 miles. Once that battery is depleted, the car operates as a typical hybrid, occasionally shutting off the engine to maximize efficiency, even on the highway.

If the throttle response is a bit wanting, the S63's chassis fully lives up to its AMG billing. The steering is nicely weighted and provides sharp directional responses. Thanks to virtually imperceptible help from the rear axle, the car feels smaller than it is. The S63's Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires cling to the skidpad at 0.96 g, and the sedan dives into corners eagerly on back roads yet also provides great on-center stability on the highway. Brake feel is also decent, though pedal effort could be higher. Equipped with the optional carbon-ceramic brakes ($8950) on the front axle, the S63 stops from 70 mph in an impressive 161 feet and from 100 mph in 330.



Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

This chassis responsiveness does not come at the expense of comfort, as the S63's well- controlled ride is never harsh. Even when the suspension tightens in Sport and Sport+, the car rides reasonably well. It is an S-class, after all, although you feel and hear tar strips and pavement slabs more than in its less aggressive brethren.

Befitting an S-class, the cabin is large and sumptuous. The front seats are supremely comfortable—once we disabled the active inflatable side bolsters that irritatingly pressed into our ribs at every hint of a corner.

Marc Urbano - Car and Driver

The cavernous rear compartment is elaborately tailored and in our S63 had options totaling $11,000. These included highly adjustable individual rear seats with separate video screens, climate controls, and foldout trays. The right one even has a power-folding leg rest. A private jet could do worse than these seats.

Such a fancy rear cabin seems a bit odd for an AMG model that is presumably driver-focused. And it's also slightly mismatched with only 11 cubic feet of cargo space.

But this yin and yang of explosive performance and maximum luxury does support the ""loaded"" mindset. This S63 E Performance's $187,350 starting price inflated to $229,400 with options. Pretty loaded, we'd say.

https://finance.yahoo.com,Tesla Accused of Gaming Canada’s EV Rebate Program,https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-accused-gaming-canada-ev-140000306.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:00 GMT","Tesla may have taken too big of a slice

Much like the U.S., Canada too has an EV rebate program to encourage more car buyers to go fully electric. The program was so popular that it was set to shut down early, and many car dealerships are claiming Tesla pulled a possibly illegal stunt to take most of the program’s remaining funds, which shut the program down even earlier.

If true, it means Tesla created an unfair advantage to take over half of the CAD 71 million left in the program, leaving many car dealerships unable to get rebates they otherwise would have.

How did Tesla game the system?

In the waning days of the rebate program, it seems Tesla over-reported the number of cars it sold. Across four different Tesla dealerships in Canada, the company claimed it sold over 8,600 vehicles in three days. Since each EV sold earned a $5,000 rebate while the program was active, this resulted in over CAD 43.1 million headed Tesla’s way.

Mathematically, this means Tesla would have been selling 120 cars per hour—yes, two Teslas sold every minute—across all four dealerships, including the hours those Tesla dealerships were closed. That’s two Teslas sold every minute, 24 hours a day, for three straight days.

How Canada’s rebate program works

In Canada, rebates on EVs are dictated by the government and provided by dealerships. The discount is provided at the point of sale, and the Canadian government reimburses car dealerships afterward. Rebate applications must be filled out before the car is delivered.

EVs sold well in Canada this year, and the program was set to be shut down early due to higher-than-normal rebate applications. Car dealers were selling EVs with the understanding that the program would come to a close early, but they were also under the belief that other dealerships were acting in good faith and selling cars normally—not two vehicles per minute, 24 hours a day.

Why car dealerships are upset

“These dealers in good faith gave customers the money for a program that is always refunded,” said Canada Automobile Dealers Association spokesperson Huw Williams. “They shouldn’t be left making a payment on behalf of the Government of Canada.”

“Tesla had a run on the bank. Somehow, Tesla gamed the system.”

Advertisement Advertisement

Essentially, car dealerships knew funds wouldn’t last as long as they’d expected, and with Tesla requesting so many rebates in such a short time, other dealerships could not successfully apply for rebates. It’s believed car dealerships across Canada are out CAD 10 million or more.

Did Tesla cheat?

The National Post claims Tesla sales plummeted 70 percent from December 2024 to January 2025. That, coupled with the suspicious timing of Tesla’s rebate requests - again, just before the program was set to expire - is curious.

If Tesla is being honest, its sales hockey-sticked (pun intended, Canada) at precisely the right time. This sudden and incredible spike in sales also contradicts several reports that Tesla sales were down in Canada during this timeframe.

Final thoughts

Correlation does not always imply causation, but this situation is suspect. It’s not clear if Tesla sold the vehicles to actual people in Canada, supplied a fleet to skirt rebate laws, “sold” its cars to U.S. dealerships just to get a rebate, or something else. We expect Canadian government agents to follow up on all those sales before issuing a CAD 43.1 million check to Tesla.",yahoo

Rivian and Chase have launched a buyback scheme allowing Fisker owners to sell their car to Rivian or trade in toward a new Rivian. The appeal centers around Rivian’s ability to offer higher average buyback and trade-in values than the open market following electric vehicle (EV) maker Fisker’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in June 2024. Fisker owners started receiving notices this week from Hagens Berman law firm explaining the offer, which includes the opportunity to sell to Chase if the Fisker is inoperable and/or unrepairable.

Fisker OceanFisker

Hagens Berman’s notice reads: “These offers will provide three different options: 1) you may sell your vehicle to Rivian for a fixed price; 2) you may trade in your vehicle to Rivian for the same price and receive incentives for the purchase or lease of a Rivian vehicle; or 3) if your vehicle is inoperable or “bricked,” and cannot be repaired, Chase will purchase your vehicle from you at a fixed price. In each case, the fixed price will be equal to the purchase price minus an amount for usage of the vehicle since your purchase,” Carscoops reports.

Several Ocean owners are likely breathing a sigh of relief knowing they can use the offer to help pay off their balance for a vehicle that may not even work. Commonly reported issues with the Ocean include software bugs, inconsistent regenerative braking, and broken key fobs.

Who qualifies for the buyback and trade-in program?

JPMorgan Chase backed Fisker Finance, and participants of the buyback or trade-in program must have purchased their Ocean model through Fisker Finance or be part of Hagens Berman’s class-action lawsuit against Fisker. One Ocean buyer and Redditor received a letter from Fisker Finance, with a Rivian trade-in offer worth $36,454.68. During its release, Fisker’s Ocean started at $41,437 for its base Sport Model, $55,437 for its Ultra trim, $63,937 for the Extreme, and $68,999 for the Ocean One.

Rivian trade-in spotlight

Rivian’s R1T pickup truck starts at $71,700, while the R1S SUV’s base price is $75,900. The R1T and R1S are Rivian’s only two available models. Like Fisker, Rivian is an EV startup, but it has scored more prominent investments than Fisker, such as Amazon, Cox Automotive, and the Volkswagen Group. In essence, Rivian is working to position itself as a more reliable alternative to Fisker and is also releasing more affordable next-generation models relatively soon, including its R2 mid-size SUV and entry-level R3. The R2’s deliveries are expected to begin in the first half of 2026, while the R3 is slated to follow in late 2026 or early 2027.

Final thoughts

Rivian and Chase’s lifeline helps Fisker owners mitigate some, but not all, of the pain associated with spending a lot on a highly problematic SUV made by a manufacturer that has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Even if a Fisker Finance customer places money from a sale toward their Ocean’s balance, the entire vehicle might still not be paid off despite receiving higher average amounts than the open market.

However, Rivian will likely score new fans with their new buyback and trade-in scheme, and support from Fisker Ocean purchasers could prove valuable as Rivian aims to accomplish the nearly impossible task of succeeding as an EV startup.",yahoo

Cutter Hodierne knew the odds were against him. As an independent filmmaker trying to secure funding for ""Cold Wallet,"" a crypto thriller about a heist gone wrong, he faced the usual hurdles—hesitant investors, an unpredictable industry, and a financing system that favored big studios over fresh voices.

“In Hollywood’s centralized model, breaking in is difficult,” he said. “You never know if you met the right person, if your script was overlooked, or if your work is truly considered.”

So instead of taking the traditional route, he turned to the decentralized film industry. Often referred to as Film3, it leverages blockchain technology, community voting, and cryptocurrency to fund movies, and television series. Unlike the traditional Hollywood system, which relies on centralized studios, agents, and intermediaries, Film3 lets filmmakers connect directly with their audiences and financing.

Hodierne put 10 minutes of his film up on the Decentralized Pictures website for review, where a community of producers, writers, investors, and film buffs got a look at his sizzle reel. In exchange for reviewing the clip, they earned $FILM, Decentralized Pictures' token, which the studio says is “fuel for the platform. Users can stake them on their favorite projects, use them to pay others to review their own submissions (as a rewards pool), or simply purchase entry vouchers to pay for application fees for various creative financing rewards.”

One reviewer in particular was especially struck by the clip: “Steven Soderbergh, the king of the heist genre, gave us his blessing,” said Hodierne.

Soderbergh invested in the film, and Decentralized Pictures followed on with a grant, giving ""Cold Wallet"" enough money to make Hodierne’s movie. Now screening as a “Steven Soderbergh Presents” project, the movie is at select theaters and available for rent or purchase on Apple and Amazon Prime Video, and has garnered respectable reviews.

“Hopefully, it connects with viewers,” Hodierne said. “What excites me most is that you can rent and buy it on-chain with crypto—it’s highly appropriate.”

It’s another big step in the journey of the dominant studios in the Film3 movement, Decentralized Pictures and Gala Films, which have more than 60 movies and TV series in the works.

“We're building the studio of the future,” said Decentralized Pictures co-founder Roman Coppola, a member of the Coppola filmmaking family. “At our company, American Zoetrope, and in my dad's work, we value community and a cafe culture where people come together, share ideas, and compare notes.”

Coppola and others pointed out that just as important as community participation is the decentralized funding model that can support filmmakers, particularly those with distinctive voices and meaningful stories to tell, by allowing them to bypass industry hierarchies.

“The term we've been using—DeFiFi, decentralized film finance—represents a shift in film funding,” Stacy Spikes, co-founder of movie subscription platform MoviePass said during an interview with Decrypt at ETH Denver. “Distribution companies will still be needed to push films into the marketplace, but until now, back-end participation wasn’t possible. With smart contracts, it is.”

The idea is already gaining traction. In 2024, Film3 made history when actress Mena Suvari earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for her role in ""RZR,"" a sci-fi series created by David Bianchi’s Exertion3 Films in collaboration with the blockchain-powered streaming platform Gala Film.

Spikes likened the potential of decentralized filmmaking to past independent and genre film movements.

“If you go with the community—particularly black and brown communities or genre films—Web3 is a great place to tap into,” Spikes said. “I feel that people who were hesitant to invest will now be more likely to do so because they know they'll get their money back.”

Hodierne also noted that by eliminating distributors and sales agents, all proceeds go directly to the filmmakers and Decentralized Pictures, allowing them to reinvest in independent artists and future projects.

“As a filmmaker, I’ve seen how centralized and fickle the industry is. This shift is a big deal, especially as streaming platforms pay artists less while struggling themselves,” he said. “It’s an exciting convergence for films, and for 'Cold Wallet,' a crypto thriller, this feels like the perfect first step in opening that door.”",decrypt

Long before hundreds of millions of users made ChatGPT one of the world's most popular apps in mere weeks in 2022, we were talking about the potential for AI to make us healthier, and our lives longer.

In the 1970s, a team at Stanford developed MYCIN, one of the first AI systems designed to aid medical diagnosis. MYCIN used a knowledge base of about 600 rules to identify bacteria causing infections and recommend antibiotics.

Though it outperformed human experts in trials, MYCIN was never used in clinical practice - partly due to ethical and legal concerns around machine-led diagnosis.

Fast forward five decades, and AI is now poised to transform healthcare in ways that seemed like science fiction in the MYCIN era. Today, modern AI can teach itself to spot diseases in medical imaging just as well as a human clinician, and without lots of training data. A Harvard study on AI-assisted cancer diagnosis has shown an accuracy of 96%.

Improving diagnoses

In the UK, an AI system detected 11 signs of breast cancer that were missed by human clinicians. Two separate studies, one from Microsoft and another from Imperial College, found more breast cancer cases than radiologists. Similar results have been seen with AI detection of prostate cancer, skin cancer, and other conditions.

Our access to data has never been greater. As an example, the National Health Service in the UK — Europe's largest employer—together has access to a body of over 65 million patients' worth of digitized data—valued at over £9.6 billion a year ($12.3 billion).

This represents an unprecedented opportunity for AI to recognize patterns and generate insights that could radically improve diagnosis, treatment, and drug discovery.

The ability of AI to detect subtle patterns in vast datasets is one of its greatest strengths in healthcare. These systems can analyze not just medical imaging, but also genomic data, electronic health records, clinical notes, and more — spotting correlations and risk factors that might escape experienced human clinicians.

Some people might feel more comfortable with an AI agent handling their healthcare data than a human not directly involved in their care. But the issue isn’t just about who sees the data—it’s about how portable it becomes.

AI models built outside of trusted healthcare institutions pose new risks. While hospitals may already protect patient data, trusting external AI systems requires more robust privacy protections to prevent misuse and to ensure data stays secure.

Privacy challenges in AI healthcare

It’s worth noting that potential comes with significant privacy and ethical concerns.

Healthcare data is perhaps the most sensitive personal information that exists. It can reveal not just our medical conditions, but our behaviors, habits, and genetic predispositions.

There are valid fears that widespread adoption of AI in healthcare could lead to privacy violations, data breaches, or misuse of intimate personal information.

Even anonymized data isn't automatically safe. Advanced AI models have shown an alarming ability to de-anonymize protected datasets by cross-referencing with other information. There's also the risk of ""model inversion"" attacks, where malicious actors can potentially reconstruct private training data by repeatedly querying an AI model.

These concerns are not hypothetical. They represent real barriers to the adoption of AI in healthcare, potentially holding back life-saving innovations. Patients may be reluctant to share data if they don't trust the privacy safeguards.

While standards and regulations require geographical and demographic diversity in the data that is used to train AI models, sharing data between healthcare institutions requires confidentiality, as the data, besides being highly sensitive, carries the insights of the healthcare institutions around diagnoses and treatments.

This leads to wariness on the part of the institutions in sharing data from regulatory, intellectual property, and misappropriation concerns.

The future of privacy-preserving AI

Fortunately, a new wave of privacy-preserving AI development is emerging to address these challenges. Decentralized AI approaches, like federated learning, allow AI models to be trained on distributed datasets without centralizing sensitive information.

This means hospitals and research institutions can collaborate on AI development without directly sharing patient data.

Other promising techniques include differential privacy, which adds statistical noise to data to protect individual identities, and homomorphic encryption, which allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decrypting it.

Another intriguing development is our Runtime Off-chain Logic (ROFL) framework, which enables AI models to perform computations off-chain while maintaining verifiability. This could allow for more complex AI healthcare applications to tap into external data sources or processing power without compromising privacy or security.

Privacy-preserving technologies are still in their early stages, but they all point towards a future where we can harness the full power of AI in healthcare without sacrificing patient privacy.

We should be aiming for a world where AI can analyze your full medical history, genetic profile, and even real-time health data from wearable devices, while keeping this sensitive information encrypted and secure.

This would allow for highly personalized health insights without any single entity having access to raw patient data.

This vision of privacy-preserving AI in healthcare isn't just about protecting individual rights—though that's certainly important. It's also about unlocking the full potential of AI to improve human health, and in a way that commands the respect of the patients it's treating.

By building systems that patients and healthcare providers can trust, we can encourage greater data sharing and collaboration, leading to more powerful and accurate AI models.

The challenges are significant, but the potential rewards are immense. Privacy-preserving AI could help us detect diseases earlier, develop more effective treatments, and ultimately save countless lives and unlock a wellspring of trust.

It could also help address healthcare disparities by allowing for the development of AI models that are trained on diverse, representative datasets without compromising individual privacy.

As AI models get more advanced, and AI-driven diagnoses get quicker and more accurate, the instinct to use them will become impossible to ignore. The important thing is that we teach them to keep their secrets.

Our weekend roundup serves up the biggest news from the past week, along with a few other tidbits you might have missed. We also showcase a few of our original stories from the week.

Biggest news

Fortnite storyline pumps token: The latest season of the hugely popular battle royale Fortntie surrounds a pickle criminal rapper named Big Dill who is on the run following an alleged crypto rug pull, with a fake news anchor claiming that he had “launched a crypto meme coin called Dill Bits.”

Crypto degens had already clicked onto Dill Bits two weeks prior, after it was added as a new form of in-game currency for high-tier loot in Fortnite, and dropped a real (albeit unofficial) version of it via Solana launchpad Pump.fun. Despite no official ties to the game, the token quickly hit a $4.78 million market cap, but fell to just $145,000 as attention waned.

Following Fortnite’s social media video about Big Dill's crypto shenanigans, the Solana meme coin skyrocketed 4,300% to a market cap of $4.72 million. It has since, however, fallen once again, adding credence to the news anchor's claim that you should never “take financial advice from a pickle.”

Deadrop users get refunds: Upset players of the discontinued extraction shooter Deadrop have started to claim refunds through their banks. Midnight Society, the game studio behind the shooter, had sold early access passes, including $50 NFTs and multiple non-NFT passes priced between $20 and $30. But users claim that they didn’t fully receive the products they paid for.

Those that bought the $25 Tower Key, which allowed users to play early access, claim that they didn’t receive the promised “Season 0 battle pass” that was expected to be delivered alongside the full game. Buyers of the later Drivers Keys passes say that the items were never available to be used in-game, nor were they ever tradable as promised. Decrypt reviewed evidence that users were successfully getting refunds for their purchases after contacting their banks.

Midnight Society co-founder and creative director Quinn DelHoyo told Decrypt last August that it planned to release the full game in fall of 2025. However, the studio struggled following the dismissal of its co-founder, popular streamer Dr. Disrespect (aka Guy Beahm), due to his alleged inappropriate conversations with a minor. In September, it laid off a “significant” portion of its workforce, then completely shut down in January—crushing the hopes of its dedicated fan base.

Sega franchise on Sui: Parasol, a gaming infrastructure subsidiary of Sui network contributor Mysten Labs, announced on Friday that its soon-to-launch trading card game Code of Joker: Evolutions will launch on the Sui blockchain.

The Code of Joker franchise was originally created for arcades in 2013 by iconic video game company Sega, but was later picked up and licensed by Jokers Inc. that is now attempting to revive the series. This time, however, the game has a crypto twist in that players will own in-game cards via NFTs on the Sui blockchain.

It is worth noting that Sega is not developing Code of Joker: Evolutions itself, it is simply licensing the franchise to a Jokers Inc. While Sega has said that it is willing to license its IPs to explore the crypto gaming industry, it also said that its bigger franchises like Sonic the Hedgehog are not up for grabs until this experimental phase is over.

https://decrypt.co,What is Milady? The Edgy Ethereum NFT Community With Vitalik Buterin’s Support,https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-milady-edgy-ethereum-nft-community,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:03 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Originating as an NFT community, Milady and its surrounding ecosystem has become one of the most culturally significant groups in Ethereum and crypto as a whole.

Over the years, notable figures have joined or interacted with the community, including the likes of Elon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

Known for its edgy humor, layers of irony, and cult-like mentality, the Milady community has defied many attempts to decipher what on earth is going on in its self-referential world. At its most broad, the community spans multiple NFT collections, meme coins, global raves, a Minecraft server, and long philosophical texts.

This has led many, including the likes of alt-right political commentator Nicholas Fuentes, to attempt to engage with the community, only to get lost in a maelstrom of memes.

Don’t worry though—over the years, we’ve become experts on the topic. Here’s what you need to know.

What is Milady?

Milady (also referred to as Milady Maker) is an NFT collection created by the Remilia Corporation in August 2021. The profile pictures feature cute Chibi anime style characters with huge glossy eyes, each with an individual “drip” score and grade. It’s believed the Milady character was inspired by Hororo from the anime series ""Bottle Fairy.""

While at its core Milady is a profile picture NFT project, the Milady ethos rejects much of what is to be expected of this sector. For starters, to be a Milady you don’t have to buy an NFT—just change your profile picture on X (formerly known as Twitter), sparking the meme that simply changing your profile picture to a Milady will change your life.

Remilia as an ecosystem also includes a quarterly magazine, other derivative NFT projects like Remilio Babies, a record label, and more. While not technically under the Milady umbrella, much of the Remilia ecosystem overlaps with the Milady NFT community—both through its members and cultural approach.

On top of this, there is a Milady Minecraft game server—called Miladycraft—which acts as a social hub for its community members as well as a thoughtful art piece on the state of modern gaming and society.

In December 2024, the Milady Cult Coin (CULT) launched on Ethereum as the official token for the project—after numerous related tokens were launched but never officially endorsed.

This came after six months after a pre-sale that the project’s leaders and community members trolled as a scam. This was done through spamming “Don’t worry about it” to anyone that asked what was happening, followed by a stream of deep-fried AI-generated memes.

But really, Milady is a mindset and a philosophical outlook on life. Much of the Milady ethos comes from the writings of Charlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia Corporation.

Who is Charlotte Fang?

Charlotte Fang is the pseudonymous founder and CEO of Remilia Corporation, and in turn the leader of the Milady Cult. Fang mostly goes by he/him pronouns, but told Decrypt that she/her can be used depending on the “vibe” that you’re feeling.

A series of blog posts on Mirror.xyz have afforded readers a glimpse into the controversial founder’s philosophical and sociological views.

A foundational concept for Fang and the wider Milady community is “network spirituality,” which broadly refers to the cultural connections embedded through internet memes and references—encouraging the embrace of the digital self.

In another blog post titled “The Cancelled Will Inherit the Earth,” Fang philosophizes on the current state of cancel culture. He argues that there will soon be a time where every person with a notable following will have been canceled in some way, leading to the canceled taking over culture.

As such, Fang argues the case for ""pre-canceling"" yourself, for example, by intentionally saying slurs—he believes this is “punk.” This may explain some of the controversial things that Fang and Milady members have said online. As a result, Fang has become one of the most polarizing founders in crypto—which was further exacerbated by a 2022 controversy.

The Miya controversy

In 2022, the co-founder of DeFi Llama, 0xngmi, exposed Fang as having posted alt-right extremist content under the pseudonym Miya. 0xngmi alleges that under the Miya pseudonym, Fang was posting racist and homophobic content, as well as having inappropriate relationships with minors suffering from eating disorders.

Essays from miya's old blog, discussing a voting ban for black people, homosexuality as a disease, killing jewish people and women as something to be ""tamed"" pic.twitter.com/iMGHGCW8iD — 0xngmi (@0xngmi) May 23, 2022

At first, Fang tried to distance himself from Miya, but eventually caved in and admitted his involvement. In an X post, he said that his real views “hold no room for hate” and that he detests abusers and groomers.

Fang explained in a blog post that he ran the account with other contributors between 2019 to 2020 as a “performative identity,” masquerading as an AI writing from a “post-human” world with a ""schizotheory"" writing style. With this, Fang and the other Miya contributors had a “taste for engaging in problematic content” exploring fringe ideologies until their “logical conclusions as a form of critical satire.""

Thought trying to distance myself would help but not gonna keep pussyfooting around it. Unequivocally, my real views hold no room for hate, and I detest abusers & groomers—trolling about it was juvenile, but in reality I’ve never harmed a fly. — ♡ Charlotte Fang 🪲 Crown Prince ❀ LOVE HEALS 💞 (@CharlotteFang77) May 21, 2022

Miya has now become another pillar of the Milady lore, with cult members embracing the controversy and impact rather than ignoring its relevance. In many ways, the industry-wide cancellation of Fang and the Milady project as a result of the Miya controversy only led Fang's followers to lean further into the Milady philosophy.

“Woke censorship had its run and made for dreadful culture through the late 2010s, but the undercurrent of revolutionary irreverence will always be cooler than normalizing counter-pressure,” Fang wrote in a blog post almost a year later. “Consider how the first thought anyone who hears about Miya being a LITERAL NAZI ANOREXIA CULT LEADER is: Cool.”

Despite the controversy and wider fall of the NFT market, Milady continues to be culturally relevant in the crypto space. In 2023, Tesla founder Elon Musk posted a Milady meme, causing its price to spike. Then in 2025, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin donned a Milady profile picture in what many believed was a vibe shift as he entered “wartime mode.”

Milady is confusing, controversial, and bizarre—but it’s not something you can ignore.",decrypt
https://blockonomi.com,Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Poised to Be the Next Avalanche (AVAX)?,https://blockonomi.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-poised-to-be-the-next-avalanche-avax/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 19:00:10 GMT","As Avalanche (AVAX) trades near $45, remaining a dominant force in DeFi due to its rapid transaction speeds, low fees, and highly scalable smart contracts, many investors are on the lookout for the next blockchain disruptor. Some market analysts now point to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a rising contender.

In Phase 3 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already gained backing from over 5,700 investors and raised $3.4 million. Early participants can still purchase tokens at $0.02, anticipating potential gains up to $0.06 when the token lists. Experts even predict a rally to $4, suggesting that MUTM could soon become a formidable rival to networks like Avalanche.

Avalanche (AVAX): A DeFi Giant Facing New Competitors

Avalanche (AVAX) established itself as a top DeFi platform by combining near-instant finality, low transaction costs, and highly efficient smart contract support. Currently hovering around $45, AVAX continues to draw interest from both developers and market participants in need of scalable blockchain infrastructure. However, with DeFi expanding rapidly, emerging projects—including Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—are stepping up to challenge its status.

Mutuum Finance Presale on the Rise

Investor enthusiasm for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is evident, as more than $3.4 million in funding has flowed in from over 5,700 participants. After surpassing multiple milestones, the token remains priced at $0.02 in Phase 3. However, as momentum builds, the presale price will climb to $0.025—a 25% jump—before eventually reaching a targeted listing price of $0.06.

Mutuum Finance is pioneering a two-pronged lending structure that unites Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Peer-to-Contract (P2C) methodologies:

P2C: Automated liquidity pools set interest rates and streamline capital usage, maximizing returns for lenders and borrowing efficiency.

P2P: Eliminates third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to form direct lending agreements. This framework offers the freedom to choose fixed or variable rates, and all processes are public and verifiable.

By blending the P2C and P2P models, Mutuum Finance unlocks a secure, transparent, and efficient DeFi lending platform appealing to both yield-chasers and risk-conscious investors.

Strategic Development & Community Rewards

Mutuum Finance embraces ongoing growth via token buybacks and staking reward mechanisms built into a long-term economic design. Forthcoming exchange listings are set to broaden user accessibility and boost platform liquidity. To encourage community participation, the project is giving away $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 lucky winners (each receiving $10,000), while a referral program incentivizes existing users to attract new investors.

Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Challenge AVAX

With more than 5,700 investors onboard and $3.4 million raised, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming a prime competitor to Avalanche (AVAX). While it’s priced at just $0.02 in the current presale phase, the token is poised to launch at $0.06—granting a potential 200% profit for early supporters. Analysts project further gains up to $4, thanks to features like a dual-lending model, staking rewards, and buyback strategies. Secured by reliable smart contracts and multi-chain aspirations, Mutuum Finance is setting the stage to redefine decentralized lending.

With strong investor confidence, groundbreaking technology, and a roadmap designed for expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could evolve into the next major DeFi network—potentially following in Avalanche’s (AVAX) successful footsteps. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative project. Secure your place in the presale before prices rise further.

https://blockonomi.com,"The Trader Who Bet Against Ethereum at $4500 Shares His Predictions for ETH’s Potential Price Peaks in 2025—Plus, This Top ERC-20 Altcoin Pick for Explosive Gains!",https://blockonomi.com/the-trader-who-bet-against-ethereum-at-4500-shares-his-predictions-for-eths-potential-price-peaks-in-2025-plus-this-top-erc-20-altcoin-pick-for-explosive-gains/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:07:34 GMT","The Ethereum price prediction for 2025 has drawn a lot of interest, particularly after a trader who shorted Ethereum at $4,500 stated ETH is now poised to reach new price highs in 2025 on the back of growing ecosystem and growing institutional demand.

Although Ethereum continues to be a pillar of the blockchain space, investors are also looking at up-and-coming ERC-20 altcoins with the potential for explosive return. Of these, a promising project stands out for its unique strategy and strong potential for growth.

Ethereum Price Prediction: Can The True Pioneer in Blockchain Innovation Soar In 2025

Ethereum is still the leading smart contract platform for the cryptocurrency market. Current price stability near $1,925 reflects enhanced trust in its long-term prospects.

Such forecasts are based on Ethereum’s ongoing network improvements including scalability work through rollups and layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism.

Ethereum has lost 44% in Q1, under historic selling pressure as its market capitalization drops to 8.5%, the lowest level since 2020. Though it remains the backbone of DeFi, ETH has failed to benefit from the boom in layer-2 scaling solutions, which ride its security without driving its price higher.

Developers are sounding the alarm on increasing Ethereum complexity and governance issues. However, rising staking engagement shows that long-term holders still see potential as they face massive selling over the past three months.

Ethereum price prediction for 2025 is between $3,000 and $4,500 based on market performance and the speed of adoption. Institutional adoption remains a key driver, with companies increasingly incorporating Ethereum-based products into their systems.

As ETH further evolves, it sets a very high standard for other cryptocurrencies trying to match the same levels of adoption and utility.

Remittix: The Next Big ERC-20 Altcoin

Remittix stands as a leading ERC-20 token because it provides an innovative solution for global remittance transactions.

The blockchain technology implementation of Remittix enables users to simplify their cross-border transactions while other cryptocurrencies remain limited to trading speculation or restricted use cases.

By eliminating intermediaries through smart contracts, Remittix offers faster transactions at significantly lower costs while guaranteeing transparency and security.

With its aggressive presale currently taking place, Remittix to date has garnered nearly $13.9 million, a measure of its solid investor conviction and market size. At $0.0734, the price at this stage is a perfect entry point for early movers seeking exposure to high-growth potential.

Remittix presale’s success stems from its robust ecosystem and clear tokenomics. Most of the tokens are held in reserve for community rewards and liquidity pools to create long-term sustainability while focusing on user-driven growth.

Post-launch projections suggest Remittix could achieve considerable levels in a matter of months since its listing on major exchanges. Projections of 13,100% growth within 2025 are forecasted by analysts in light of strategic partnerships with remittance agents and ongoing innovations towards expanding its global reach.

Remittix Is the Best Crypto To Invest In Today

As Ethereum price predictions lead the way in setting the tone for overall market positivity, the time is now to investigate other compelling assets that have the potential to offer strong returns.

There is no better time to look at new ERC-20 projects like Remittix that both offer utility and massive growth potential.

By participating in Remittix’s presale sale, investors get early exposure to a new Defi coin on the cusp of revolutionary success while supporting an endeavor dedicated to remaking global remittance networks. Be a part of Remittix’s presale today and set yourself up for big profits in 2025!

https://blockonomi.com,"Cardano Millionaire Dreams Disappear, Market Eyes Remain Fixed On This Real World Asset Crypto Surging 14X",https://blockonomi.com/cardano-millionaire-dreams-disappear-market-eyes-remain-fixed-on-this-real-world-asset-crypto-surging-14x/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:00:24 GMT","The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, with investors often witnessing sharp rises and drops in value across various tokens. Recently, the Cardano (ADA) community has found itself amidst growing uncertainty. Despite its innovations and strong community backing, ADA has faced significant price declines, leading many to question its long-term viability. Meanwhile, a new player has emerged, capturing the attention of investors seeking fresh opportunities — Coldware (COLD), a cryptocurrency that has surged 14x, positioning itself as a potential leader in real-world asset tokenization.

Coldware (COLD): The Rising Star

Coldware (COLD) is emerging as a game-changer in the world of cryptocurrencies. Unlike Cardano’s focus on general scalability and smart contracts, Coldware is making waves with its real-world asset (RWA) tokenization model. By tokenizing real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and high-value investments, Coldware allows investors to diversify their portfolios in ways that traditional cryptocurrencies cannot offer.

The project has seen a massive surge in value, increasing by 14x in just a short time. This surge is not a random fluctuation; it is backed by Coldware’s technological foundation and its potential to revolutionize the market for tokenized assets. The cryptocurrency community is now watching Coldware with great interest, especially as it continues to attract institutional investors looking for secure, high-growth opportunities.

Cardano’s Struggles: A Community in Turmoil

Cardano (ADA), once hailed as a blockchain with immense potential, has recently faced a series of challenges. The Cardano network, though known for its rigorous academic approach and scalability, is currently experiencing price volatility that has left many investors in doubt. The ADA price has struggled to maintain upward momentum, and this uncertainty has only been compounded by recent governance conflicts and financial cutbacks within the Cardano Foundation.

These struggles have prompted some major players in the crypto space to reconsider their positions. Recently, large investors, who once held millions in ADA, have shifted their focus toward new projects with more promising growth potential. The latest in this wave of investments is Coldware (COLD), a cryptocurrency rapidly gaining traction for its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets.

Why Investors Are Flocking to Coldware

The shift from Cardano to Coldware (COLD) can be attributed to several key factors. First, Coldware’s focus on real-world asset tokenization presents a unique opportunity for investors to participate in a growing market that was previously inaccessible to many. Second, Coldware’s emphasis on scalability and low transaction costs ensures that it remains a viable option for large-scale applications.

Coldware has positioned itself as a practical solution to the real-world limitations of traditional cryptocurrencies. With tokenized assets becoming more popular, Coldware is positioned to capitalize on this trend, making it a highly attractive investment in a space that is quickly gaining momentum.

Cardano’s Future: A Turning Point?

As Coldware continues its rapid ascent, the Cardano community finds itself at a crossroads. Investors who once held Cardano as a promising long-term investment are now reconsidering their positions, seeking out newer, more dynamic projects like Coldware. However, despite these challenges, Cardano remains one of the top blockchain projects by market capitalization, and its focus on sustainability and security means it will continue to play a role in the broader crypto ecosystem.

The outcome of Cardano’s internal debates, particularly around budget cuts and governance issues, will be critical in determining whether the project can regain its momentum and attract back investors who have started to look elsewhere.

Conclusion: Coldware’s Growth Potential

While Cardano faces internal challenges and a decline in market sentiment, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as one of the most promising projects in the cryptocurrency space. With its focus on tokenizing real-world assets and its ability to attract institutional investors, Coldware (COLD) is proving itself as a serious contender for the top spot in the crypto market. As more investors recognize the unique value proposition of Coldware, its 14x growth could be just the beginning of a long-term trend that could reshape the market for tokenized assets.

https://blockonomi.com,Crypto Staking is More Secure: Why Cloud Mining is no Longer Your Best Option for Making Money,https://blockonomi.com/crypto-staking-is-more-secure-why-cloud-mining-is-no-longer-your-best-option-for-making-money/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 15:44:18 GMT","The crypto market is currently showing a massive exodus from energy-intensive methods like cloud mining to better options like crypto staking. This is a clear indication that staking crypto is the way to go driven by its accessibility, security, and eco-friendliness.

With Bitcoin trading sideways and Ethereum dominating the staking space, crypto staking platforms like OnStaking are leading with better solutions for new and seasoned investors. In this post, we’ll look at why staking crypto is better than cloud mining and how the best crypto staking platforms, especially OnStaking are shaping the future of passive income.

Crypto Staking Over Cloud Mining

Cloud mining once captivated crypto enthusiasts with promises of easy money, but its high costs, unpredictable returns, and reliance on centralized providers have made it less appealing to investors.

To capitalize on this, crypto staking offers a more secure and easier way to earn rewards by simply locking up assets to support blockchain networks without the expensive hardware and excessive energy consumption of Cloud Mining. OnStaking has been making staking easier for investors since 2015, earning the trust of over 735,000 users across 70+ blockchain networks while managing $130 million in investments. With secure and automated staking solutions, OnStaking empowers investors to achieve financial growth effortlessly. Here are some of their staking plans:

Staking Plan Investment Amount Duration Daily Earnings Referral Rewards Total Earnings Stake Free Trial $100 1 day $1.00 $0.00 $1.00 Stake Dai $800 5 days $8.00 $4.00 $40.00 Stake Chainlink $1,800 11 days $21.96 $14.40 $241.56 Stake Bitcoin $10,000 20 days $168.00 $100.00 $3,360.00 Stake Solana $95,000 60 days $2,584.00 $2,375.00 $155,040.00

Recommended OnStaking Staking Plans

OnStaking has staking plans for everyone; Stake Dai ($800 for 5 days) gets you $8 daily plus $4 in referral rewards, a total of $40. Perfect for cautious starters.

For mid-tier investors; Stake Chainlink ($1,800 for 11 days) gets you $21.96 daily and $14.40 in referrals, totaling $241.56.

High rollers will love Staking Solana ($95,000 for 60 days), raking in $2,584 daily plus $2,375 in referrals, a staggering $155,040 in total returns.

Why OnStaking Stands Out: Features That Drive Success Crypto Staking

OnStaking is a comprehensive staking platform designed to maximize staking crypto rewards. Here’s a quick summary of its key features:

Automated liquidity staking system takes care of trades 24/7 so your investments work without constant monitoring.

Security is a top priority, established protocols protect your assets while the team guarantees reliability.

Its $100 trial bonus lets you test staking risk-free.

The 5% referral commission provides you with a passive income stream for every friend you invite.

The bounty program rewards community engagement, from sharing posts on X to creating YouTube content, $1-$100 per task.

Staking vs Cloud Mining: A Clear Winner in 2025

Staking is better than cloud mining in many ways. One, Cloud Mining relies on external hardware and fluctuating hash rates which means unpredictable payouts. Staking on the other hand gives you predictable staking crypto rewards directly from the network.

Compared to Cloud Mining, staking is energy efficient—95% less energy consumption— aligning with 2025’s sustainability push where Bitcoin mining alone consumes more energy than some countries.

OnStaking adds to this advantage with its user-friendly app (downloadable for iOS and Android) and a simple sign-up process requiring only email, username, password, and optional referral code.

Unlike cloud mining’s upfront costs and hidden fees, OnStaking’s no-contract risk model means you keep more of your profits, and consensus rewards are automatically sent to your withdrawal address.

Benefits of Choosing OnStaking

5% Referral Commissions: Earn lifetime rewards for inviting others, and boosting your passive income.

$100 Trial Bonus: Try staking without draining your wallet, perfect for newbies.

Bounty Program: Engage with the community and promote the platform to earn up to $100 per task across X, Facebook, Reddit, etc.

24/7 Opportunities: The global team provides 24/7 support and trading precision.

Flexible Staking Options: You can stake popular coins like Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, and many more.

While Dogecoin sits near $0.17 and Cardano hovers around $0.70, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction in DeFi.

Still in Phase 3 of its presale at $0.02, the token will rise to $0.025 once this phase concludes. Since its initial offering, Mutuum Finance has gathered $3.4 million from more than 5,700 holders, and some analysts project an eventual climb to $3 post-launch—making MUTM a potentially game-changing DeFi asset. Here’s why whales are loading up on it before the rally hits.

Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi Lending

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has attracted a growing user base by pioneering a dual-lending structure that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. In the P2C model, stablecoins (such as USDT) are deposited into lending pools, facilitating ETH-backed loans managed by smart contracts. Meanwhile, the P2P component eliminates intermediaries, giving users complete autonomy over their loan agreements. This approach offers robust security, flexibility, and yields of up to 10% for liquidity providers.

Transparency and security rank high on the platform’s agenda, with third-party audits and open-source smart contracts building user confidence. Additionally, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin and a fee-supported buyback mechanism to manage supply and stabilize prices over time. Staking rewards provide further incentives for users to lock in their tokens, increasing both liquidity and investor trust. The result? More than 5,700 participants have already joined, catapulting the presale to $3.4 million.

During Phase 3, participants can acquire MUTM tokens at $0.02—a price set to escalate through an 11-stage process until it finally lists at $0.06, offering an immediate 200% uplift before public trading even begins. Market experts see potential for further gains, projecting a $3 price in 2025. Those who purchase tokens at $0.025 in the next phase secure a 75% profit at the outset, underscoring the high level of investor enthusiasm.

$100,000 Giveaway and Community Expansion

To encourage user adoption and engagement, Mutuum Finance is launching a $100,000 token giveaway—awarding $10,000 in MUTM to 10 lucky winners. Moreover, a referral incentive program rewards users who invite new participants, helping expand the community and increasing platform liquidity.

As crypto whales prepare for a potential Trump market rally, they are stacking up on Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). So far, MUTM has drawn over 5,700 investors and $3.4 million in Phase 3 at $0.02, with a 25% price bump on the horizon. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $3, creating an opportunity for massive returns. Backed by a dual-lending system, staking features, and an upcoming stablecoin, Mutuum Finance is making waves in the DeFi space. Join the presale now and secure your stake before the market takes off.

With its institutional partnerships and focus on changing global payment systems, XRP has the fundamentals that could culminate in strong price appreciation. Recently, the legal optimism after Ripple’s partial triumph over the SEC deepened faith in its future value. However, despite its potential, major investors are beginning to shift their focus elsewhere. While XRP may still deliver gains, a new opportunity in the crypto space is capturing the attention of those looking for bigger and faster returns. That opportunity is Rexas Finance (RXS), a rising star in asset tokenization that is currently in the final stage of its presale.

Why Big Investors Are Looking Beyond XRP: The Success of Rexas Finance’s Presale

The value proposition of XRP was linked to its ability to displace the banking systems by providing speedy and cheap international money transfers. Even though this use case is compelling, XRP has struggled with price appreciation relative to other rapidly appreciating assets in the crypto market. Institutional investors appreciate the long-term promise of XRP but dismiss it due to the lack of market movers that newer projects enjoy. Investors know that the space is always changing, and they are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. The tokenization of assets coupled with DeFi is making more users look at projects like Rexas Finance, which claims to provide an easier and more scalable investment narrative. The strong demand for RXS was showcased in the presale, where over $46 million was raised, and 90.67% of the allocated tokens were sold during Stage 12. This overwhelming investor confidence underscores its potential as the next major blockchain breakthrough, further incentivizing big investors to move their capital from XRP to RXS.

Rexas Finance: The New Frontier in Asset Tokenization and Tokenomics

One primary factor that has most investors shifting their capital from XRP to Rexas Finance is its distinctive strategy when it comes to asset tokenization. While XRP’s focus is primarily on banking-related problem solving, RXS is leading the way in the tokenization of real-world assets, including real estate, art, and other commodities. Rexas Finance enables the ownership of fractional tokens of priceless assets on the blockchain, which blurs the borders of investment possibilities. This level of freedom and esteeming is what conventional finance has always grappled with, but now has a possible answer in blockchain technology. Moreover, Rexas Finance claims to have a tokenomics model carefully crafted for protracted value capture. The complete supply of RXS is capped at 1 billion RXS, with 42.5% allocated for presale, 22.5% for staking, and 15% for liquidity. This effective distribution guarantees strong market stability after launch and motivates value capture from early participants. Due to the increasing migration of conventional assets onto blockchains, RXS is set to benefit from these changes, making RXS more appealing than ageing assets like XRP.

The Timing Advantage: Certik Audit, Giveaway, and RXS Security Measures

A prominent factor influencing why investors are choosing to move away from XRP and towards RXS is time. Although XRP can still hit $10 in the long run, its near-term performance has been quite dull, largely due to continuous market hesitation and regulatory doubts. Conversely, Rexas Finance is at a point in its lifecycle where early investors can earn a lot of profit before it gets listed on exchanges. Rexas is currently in the final phase of its presale, offering RXS at $0.200, whereas the price after launch is $0.250. This is great for investors looking to get in early and ride the wave of value increase at launch. Rexas Finance has worked to position itself as a credible and secure project and, in turn, has been able to attract investor confidence and security, which are critical to any investment decision. The platform has passed smart contract audits held by Certik, one of the most trusted names for security in the crypto world. They are also running a giveaway where 20 participants stand a chance of winning $50,000 each in RXS tokens. This helps increase interest from investors prior to the exchange launch while still rewarding early investors. With these added layers of credibility and incentives, RXS continues to attract high-profile investors looking for a lucrative alternative to XRP.

Conclusion: A Smart Move for Forward-Thinking Investors

Tax regulations and XRP’s fluctuating rate of growth inevitably led many investors to seek profit elsewhere. Nonetheless, Rexas Finance and its groundbreaking asset tokenization have come through. On June 19, 2025, Rexas Finance will go public, and its final presale stage offers retail investors some beneficial price appreciation opportunities. As the investment strays further and further from outdated cryptocurrencies still relying exclusively on XRP’s base value and shifts towards modern, rapidly developing projects, Rexas Finance proves itself as the most significant opportunity in the current marketplace. For crypto investors looking to invest in Rexas Finance, which proves itself as the optimal market asset, the time to purchase RXS is now.

https://blockonomi.com,"Why Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) Holders Are Backing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale—And Why You Should, Too",https://blockonomi.com/why-ethereum-eth-and-chainlink-link-holders-are-backing-mutuum-finance-mutm-presale-and-why-you-should-too/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 03:00:50 GMT","Investors who previously championed Ethereum (ETH)—currently trading near $1,881—and Chainlink (LINK)—around $13—are increasingly turning their attention to the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. With more than 5,700 investors participating at the current Phase 3 price of $0.02, the project has already raised $3.4 million.

A 25% price bump to $0.025 is on the way, fueling a sense of FOMO among buyers eager to lock in early gains. Since the token is expected to list at $0.06, Phase 3 participants could see a 200% return on their initial stake. Further underscoring its credibility, Mutuum Finance is undergoing a CertiK smart contract audit, with results set to be published on the project’s official social channels upon completion.

Presale Gaining Momentum

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding a wave of investor enthusiasm, thanks in part to its accessible DeFi lending framework. During Phase 3 of the presale, tokens are priced at $0.02, but the cost will rise to $0.025 in the next phase. Given the projected listing price of $0.06—and the strong tokenomics supporting it—early adopters could realize a 200% profit. The presale’s success has propelled the platform’s market capitalization above $3.4 million, reflecting widespread interest in solutions that merge lending services with growth opportunities.

The ecosystem’s Buy-and-Distribute mechanism further differentiates MUTM. By buying tokens from the open market and distributing them to stakers at regular intervals, the protocol maintains consistent demand—no small feat in a crypto market often driven by speculation.

Building Trust Through CertiK

In addition to its impressive presale performance, Mutuum Finance is solidifying its credibility through a CertiK audit—widely considered a key step for ensuring robust security. Once the evaluation is finished, the team will release the results on their social media pages, offering investors greater peace of mind as they consider MUTM.

At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s platform is mtToken technology, which accommodates ETH, DAI, and other assets. Depositors receive interest-bearing tokens, earning yields in real time while retaining full control of their capital. Through these liquidity pools, investors can earn varying APYs, and borrowers can use collateral to secure loans—for instance, depositing $7,000 worth of ETH to borrow $5,000 in USDT. This approach maintains stability in the system by effectively managing loan-to-collateral ratios.

A Smarter Option Than Traditional Coins

Mutuum Finance commits to a vision of long-term operational stability—one that resonates with investors searching for enduring value. With the presale quickly moving toward its next price milestone, the chance to buy MUTM at $0.02 may soon pass, particularly as market observers anticipate ongoing price increases.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting a diverse crowd of supporters, including veterans of Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK). Already boasting 5,700+ participants and $3.4 million raised at a Phase 3 price of $0.02 (soon $0.025), investors could see a 200% jump at the official $0.06 listing.

The platform’s automated Buy-and-Distribute function, mtToken framework, and forthcoming CertiK audit reinforce its reputation for security, innovation, and growth. With DeFi adoption on the rise, MUTM offers an appealing route away from traditional lending. Don’t miss the opportunity—join the Mutuum Finance presale now before the next price increase.

https://blockonomi.com,Solana (SOL)’s Trading Volume Rises 28% in 24 Hours—But BinoFi (BINO) Could Redefine Crypto Investing This Year,https://blockonomi.com/solana-sols-trading-volume-rises-28-in-24-hours-but-binofi-bino-could-redefine-crypto-investing-this-year/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:59 GMT","The crypto market is buzzing as Solana (SOL) records a notable 28% increase in trading volume within 24 hours. Renowned for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low costs, Solana has captured the attention of both investors and developers alike.

This surge is a sign of growing momentum, reflecting heightened activity around emerging blockchain projects and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

However, while Solana’s short-term gains are worth noting, the crypto ecosystem thrives on innovation and forward-thinking projects. Enter BinoFi (BINO), a rising star that could not only compete with but also reshape the market as we know it.

Designed to bridge the gaps in modern crypto trading, BinoFi is grabbing headlines as the next big disruptor. Here’s why experts believe this platform could redefine crypto investing in 2025 and beyond.

Solana’s Momentum Signals Market Optimism

The recent spike in Solana’s trading volume underscores its reputation as one of the most promising blockchain networks. Its scalability and energy-efficient Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus have led to a flourishing environment for DeFi apps, NFTs, and Web3 innovations.

Yet, even with Solana’s impressive track record, the crypto market is evolving. Industry players are demanding solutions that not only support individual blockchains but unite the fragmented crypto ecosystem under a single, intuitive umbrella. This is where BinoFi shines.

What Makes BinoFi a Game-Changer?

BinoFi is not just another cryptocurrency exchange. It’s a platform designed to solve the crypto trading challenges that even high-performing ecosystems like Solana face.

By introducing a hybrid CEX/DEX model, BinoFi merges the reliability and speed of centralized exchanges with the decentralization and security of DEXs. But its innovations don’t stop there.

1. Hybrid Trading with Liquidity Aggregation

While many platforms operate either as CEXs or DEXs, BinoFi combines both under one roof. Its Hybrid Liquidity Model integrates centralized order books with decentralized liquidity pools for best-in-class trade execution. Users get the speed of a CEX while benefiting from the security and transparency of a DEX.

2. Revolutionary Cross-Chain Trading

Interoperability is a major pain point for crypto users. Moving assets between blockchains often involves costly bridges and complex routing. BinoFi eliminates this complexity with its native cross-chain trading protocol. Users can seamlessly trade assets across chains like Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more without intermediaries.

3. AI-Enhanced Tools for Smarter Investments

The crypto market is volatile, and staying ahead requires cutting-edge tools. BinoFi introduces AI-powered trading bots that analyze risks, automate strategies, and provide advanced market insights. These tools democratize access to technology once reserved for institutional players.

4. Non-Custodial Security Meets Usability

Security is a critical concern for crypto traders, but many shy away from non-custodial setups due to their complexity. BinoFi’s MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallets offer the best of both worlds. Traders maintain control of their assets without needing to manage sensitive keys, all while enjoying features like gasless transactions and simple recovery processes.

5. A Transparent, Reward-Driven Ecosystem

Unlike traditional crypto platforms, BinoFi offers complete on-chain proof-of-reserves so users can trust the liquidity backing their trades. Through its Trade-to-Earn program, BinoFi incentivizes trading by rewarding users, making it a platform that doesn’t just excel at execution but actively grows its community.

Why Now is the Time for BinoFi

Solana’s rising trading volume reignites optimism about blockchain innovation, but the future belongs to platforms like BinoFi. By combining cutting-edge features with user-focused design, it takes crypto trading into uncharted territory.

As the crypto market becomes increasingly interconnected and competitive, forward-looking investors are turning to projects with the potential to scale and redefine how assets are traded. Whether it’s cross-chain trading, AI-driven tools, or a transparent ecosystem, BinoFi is delivering what the market has been waiting for.
