https://vulture.com,1923 Recap: One Calamity Down,https://www.vulture.com/article/1923-recap-season-2-episode-4-journey-the-rivers-of-iron.html,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 14:00:44 GMT","1923 Journey the Rivers of Iron Season 2 Episode 4 Editor’s Rating 4 stars * * * * « Previous Next « Previous Episode Next Episode » Photo: Lauren Smith/Paramount+

“Journey the Rivers of Iron” is an especially grisly episode of a series that’s never easy on the squeamish. Alex, the most delicate Dutton, is the victim of an aggravated assault. Zane has his head strapped to a block so a jittery doctor can peel back his scalp and drill through his skull. When Lizzie eventually asks for a needle to self-administer her rabies vaccine, I hardly flinched. I’d already seen too much, and yet I hadn’t seen the worst of it. Back in Bozeman, Lindy, one of Donald Whitfield’s sex workers–in–residence, strangles another sex worker that he was keeping as a pet.

Even watching through my fingers, it’s obvious that “Journey the Rivers of Iron” is the best episode of 1923’s second season so far. The Dutton family is diminished, but this week, on the eve of springtime, they’re finally recovering. We’re encouraged to believe that, come thaw, they might even be in a position to throw some punches of their own. Zane is on the mend, and Spencer is only two or three states from the ranch. Lizzie is pregnant, and Alex is en route. If they can just survive what’s left of this brutal winter, they might survive forever.

Of course, the Duttons’ greatest enemy — the world — is mounting another attack, refilling its coffers and amassing troops. Whitfield has a three-step plan for remaking Montana into a winter wonderland for the rich men who live along Chicago’s lakeshore and New Yorkers who mistake the Hudson Valley’s hills for real mountains. Step one: Develop the modern airliner. Step two: Pave a freeway through Paradise Valley at the government’s expense. Step three: Build a resort.

“Americans no longer rely upon their hands for money,” Whitfield explains to a room of nodding investors who are eager to see their lives in Bozeman as covetable. “They use their minds.” This might be the exact moment when this country lost its way, at least according to the laws of Yellowstone. Hands aren’t mere metonyms for the men they belong to; hands are the man. Only Banner Creighton sees the teeny-weeny problem with Whitfield’s proposal, and it’s not the bit about inventing safe and speedy air travel. To build a resort in Paradise Valley, you’ll have to bulldoze Jacob Dutton to the ground — to rip from his leathered hands not just his family’s parcel but their whole way of life.

Whitfield tells Banner to assemble an army of sheepherders who want the same land for grazing in summer, and Banner says he’ll ask the miners, too. On a map, Whitfield identifies an unincorporated part of the state where they can secretly dump the bodies of Dutton men who throw themselves between the ranch and the inevitable march of progress. But can it really be so simple? I’m struggling to believe Montana will ignore the murder of the livestock commissioner and his entire family just because the killers dug the perfect ditch. Or that the Scots will be content to graze their sheep on a ski resort in the low season.

Before he pledges his men to Whitfield, Banner talks it through with Ellie. His wife has remained impressively skeptical of the mining tycoon, but the promise of a future for her family is too much to resist. She wants her son to go to university; she wants her grandsons to inherit a good name. Ellie tells her husband that if he’s going to steal another man’s castle, he can’t leave the prince in any condition to take that castle back. I agree with her cool assessment, and yet you’d really have to squint to mistake Jake Dutton for a prince right now. It’s Whitfield that Banner needs to outwit. If you’re risking your life, do it to become king of the mountain, not prince of the valley.

Because, from what we’ve seen in 1923, being prince of the valley is punishing. Take today as an example. Jake Dutton spends the morning assisting on meatball brain surgery so gruesome that his nephew Jack nearly hurls on several occasions. The patient on the table is the Yellowstone ranch foreman, who only finds himself in this vulnerable position in the first place because powerful men want his boss’s land. Jake watches him wake up mid-surgery, in agony, with a shop-class hand drill burrowed into his head. Somehow, the surgery is successful, but that’s only Jacob Dutton’s morning. “One calamity down,” he says wryly.

In the afternoon, Jacob has to convince his nephew’s wife not to leave him, which is tricky to do because Jack’s fealty to his uncle’s ranch is the main problem in the marriage. I actually thought Jake handled Lizzie well by establishing a third option between staying at the Yellowstone and leaving it forever; Lizzie can just visit home for a bit and return when the mercury rises. We’ll never know if Jake’s plea would have been successful, though, because the doctor confirms that Lizzie is pregnant. That’s why she’s having such an adverse reaction to the rabies vaccine.

After that, Jacob heads to the porch to grab a few quiet minutes with his wife between debacles. They share cute, inexplicable banter about how he doesn’t understand women at all and that’s somehow the bedrock of their marriage. Aunt Cara was negging long before The Pick-Up Artist.

Then, for dinner at the end of a long day, Jake probably has some broth or leftover gruel and thinks about how cold his bones are. Maybe he ruminates on the lien on his house as Cara lies next to him. Or maybe it’s guilt that chases his sleep away. Look what happened to Zane. He feared he would never walk again after the beating he took, and now he’s itching to fight a land war for another man’s family. Maybe it would be better for everyone if Jake just walked away from the Yellowstone. Better for Zane and Alice, who could move to California, where mixed-race marriage is legal. Better for Jack and Lizzie, who could raise their baby in the relative warmth of Boston. Better for doc, who hasn’t been home since before the blizzard because the Duttons make so much trouble.

And all of this? This happened on a relatively quiet day for the aging prince of Paradise Valley.

Things didn’t go nearly so well for the Dutton diaspora beyond Montana state lines. After being robbed and beaten in Grand Central Station, Alex flings herself onto a moving train. She walks down the aisles of the first-class cabins with a black eye while the types of people she used to be friends with gawk. She hasn’t a penny left. The worse news is that she’s sharing a bunk with other people’s children, at least until Boston.

Spencer, meanwhile, continues his run of bad luck that momentarily disguises itself as good luck. For example, it almost seems like good luck when the Fort Worth sheriff offers him a ride to the train station, though it’s quickly revealed to be bad luck when he’s told to sit in the back seat like a perp. (Personally, I was surprised to learn Luca is such a squawker. Wasn’t he raised on omertà?)

It also seems like good luck when the sheriff offers to set Spencer free in exchange for making the booze delivery he had already promised to make, though it’s bad luck when the sheriff later handcuffs him to the steering wheel. (Here, I was confused as to why the police didn’t orchestrate a proper sting operation once Spencer gave them the delivery address. Why just bust down the door with no plan?)

Still, it’s good luck that the sheriff leaves the key in the ignition and that Spencer is able to work himself free. And it’s good luck that the Temperance Society is forcing a tarred prostitute to parade down Main Street at the exact moment Spencer goes on the run because (1) it creates an obstacle for the pursuing sheriff, and (2) it lets Spencer free a prostitute on his way home. You can take a man’s ranch, but not his savior complex. It’s good luck to hop on a train headed west and bad luck to find the car already occupied by hobos that will require killing.

Ultimately, Spencer ends the episode where he started it: walking north from Fort Worth headed home to a place that won’t be home when he arrives. Because there aren’t roads in the Montana that Spencer is from. There’s no river of iron to drop his wife at a nearby station. Just wait until Spencer hears about the ski resort, and the freeway, and the airplanes. About the lien on the land that’s belonged to his family since before Montana was a state.

Teonna, Pete, and Runs His Horse are still in Texas, too. They’re helping ranch hands drive cattle in the only 1923 story line that has any joy or vibrancy to it. It’s not a coincidence that God’s golden light shines brightest on the land in which men are still making their money with their hands. I’ve never seen Texas look prettier than it does when Taylor Sheridan shoots it. But soon, I worry, there won’t be any Texas in Texas either. The fairgrounds where the cowboys stop for lunch are plastered with Wanted posters bearing a sketch of Teonna. America is coming for her, like it came for Paradise Valley.

It’s the cycles of feast and famine that make life on the range so hard and so fulfilling we’re told over and over again across Yellowstone and its spinoffs. In 1923, though, it seems like it’s always famine, and famine’s less fun to watch. This week’s episode offered us longer days and brighter evenings — the promise of story lines reaching fruition. That Spencer will make it home again; that Teonna will cross over into Mexico and find freedom; that Jack and Lizzie will have a baby. Frustratingly, it also warns us against the same longing it conjures. “Spring teases the senses with warm mornings and green buds of new grass and the hope of summer’s bounty,” Elsa Dutton tells us from beyond time, where the Dutton family story is already over or maybe never-ending.

“Then blankets that hope in snow.”",vulture
https://indiewire.com,Tony Gilroy Won’t Release ‘Andor’ Scripts for Fear of AI Training on Them: ‘Why Help the F**king Robots?’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/tony-gilroy-andor-scripts-a-i-1235104165/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 20:00:00 GMT","Though he enjoys building a futuristic world on screen with his hit TV series “Andor,” in real life, writer/director Tony Gilroy is trying to slow the future.

Speaking in a recent interview with Collider, Gilroy expressed his animosity toward the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Hollywood, where many are training their models on screenplays whether they have the rights to them or not. For this reason, Gilroy decided to nix an initial plan to release the scripts for Season 1 as a book, similar to how “Succession” and other shows have.

“I wanted to do it. We put it together. It’s really cool. I’ve seen it, I loved it. AI is the reason we’re not,” said Gilroy. “In the end, it would be 1,500 pages that came directly off this desk. I mean, terribly sadly, it’s just too much of an X-ray and too easily absorbed. Why help the fucking robots anymore than you can? So, it was an ego thing. It was vanity that makes you want to do it, and the downside is real. So, vanity loses.”

In writing the scripts for Season 1 and Season 2, Gilroy had more time than most to put them together. Considering how many feel the show speaks to the rise in fascism currently taking place throughout the world, many believe the show has become adept at channeling real-world conflicts into a sci-fi allegory, but Gilroy doesn’t view his work as capturing the moment.

“No one was working on the show with a newspaper at any point in time. We write so far in advance,” he told Collider. “I’ve said this before: I’ve been a student of history, as an amateur, a dinner table historian all this time, and it’s nothing but revolutions and uprisings and people being swept up into events that they weren’t ready for and people assuming heroic roles that they had never anticipated.”

Showrunner Gilroy isn’t the only writer working on “Andor,” of course. Though most writers’ rooms work together to shape a season of television, Gilroy prefers to let his staff loose to follow their own voices.

“The writers on the show and myself, it’s a pretty fancy bunch of writers, really, in a way. Everybody’s very experienced,” Gilroy said. “We only get together for five or six days in the beginning to talk about the story, and then we kind of go, and they do their thing, and then they go away. But I always have them as a reference to call upon.”

https://indiewire.com,Scarlett Johansson Wants Marvel Fans to Know She Really Is Done: ‘Natasha Is Dead’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/scarlett-johansson-marvel-natasha-is-dead-1235104172/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 18:00:00 GMT","Ever since Robert Downey Jr. announced his heel-flip return to the MCU as iconic villain Doctor Doom, Marvel fans have been clamoring to find out who from the original “Avengers” might be resurrected for the next installments. While it’s unclear who, if anyone, will be joining Downey Jr., one star wants it to be known that her character will remain peaceful in the after-life.

“Natasha is dead. She is dead. She’s dead. Okay?” said Scarlett Johansson in a recent interview with InStyle. Speaking of how Marvel fans refuse to accept her character’s death in “Avengers: Endgame,“ she added, “They just don’t want to believe it. They’re like, ‘But she could come back!’ Look, I think the balance of the entire universe is held in her hand. We’re going to have to let it go. She saved the world. Let her have her hero moment.”

Though her part in the “Avengers” series and her standalone feature “Black Widow” have helped elevate Johansson to superstar status, she’s ready to put this part of her life in the past. Especially considering how much she values her privacy and how being a part of the Marvel machine disrupts that.

“The thing about being a public figure is that the idea of being recognizable and celebrated feels fun, but then you can never stuff it back in the bottle,” Johansson said. “The reality of it is, there’s a massive loss to that, you know? So I think preserving that for as long as possible until it’s someone’s choice, that’s the choice I make as far as my kids go.”

In fact, Johansson has recently decided to step from in front of the camera to behind it. Releasing at some point this year, Johansson’s directorial debut “Eleanor the Great” stars nonagenarian June Squibb and is described as being inspired by indie films of the “mid-80s to the mid-2000s,” such as “Living Out Loud,” “Crossing Delancey,” and “Moonstruck.” Not only did the film give Johansson a chance to take some of the spotlight off herself, but it also satisfied a need to grow and take in new experiences.

“When I would get home from work,” Johansson told InStyle, “and I would say to Colin [Jost], ‘You know, it’s so exciting to be 40 and learn a new thing. Now I know how to make a movie like this. I know how to finish it. The process of sound mixing and coloring and editing’ — I didn’t know that before. And now I know how to do it.”",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,Ed Lachman Calls Out Contemporary Cinematography: ‘Everything’s Mush’,https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/ed-lachman-contemporary-cinematography-everythings-mush-1235104164/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 16:00:00 GMT","Earning his first ASC award for “Maria” last month, it seems cinematographer Ed Lachman now feels emboldened to bemoan current trends in film imagery. Though most movies no longer shoot on traditional film stock, many still seek out the grainy appeal in the final edit, a fact Lachman has come to detest. Still prone to work with film, as he did on Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” he also knows the challenges of processing that film by digital means.

Speaking with fellow DP Roger Deakins during a recent episode of the “Team Deakins” podcast, Lachman explained how he prefers to use “color temperature and gels” in-camera to replicate film when working with digital, but most others only manipulate the image in post.

“This whole idea of shooting wide open, with no depth of field, so everything’s mush in the front or the back, they think that gives them the film look,” said Lachman. “I don’t, I think it looks more digital when they do that. It drives me crazy.”

While Lachman believes many recent films fall into this category, there was one in particular from last year that particularly irked him.

“I don’t want to mention other films, but I will. ‘Babygirl, right?’ You see the wide shot, you see everything, and then every time they go into the medium shots or the close-ups, the background is totally knocked out,” Lachman told Deakins. “So every scene looks the same. It’s like the environment, the architecture is part of the image.”

Deakins went on to echo Lachman’s sentiments and really put the blame on how anamorphic lenses tend to wash out certain elements of an image.

“You want the character to feel they’re in a space, and you want that space to register,” he said. “And I think, yeah, what you’re saying, anamorphic, you’re often isolating the character in a kind of sea of mist.”

Lachman previously spoke to IndieWire’s Jim Hemphill back in November upon the release of “Maria,” where he talked about color in the film and how it was used for both depth and to communicate how the environment reflects the mood of the central character.

“I’ve always used color not purely as a decorative means, but as a psychological means,” Lachman said. “I always think of warm and cool colors, and how they interact. So her apartment has the warmth of a nest, like she’s hiding from the world outside, but then it’s invaded by cooler colors like green. Generally, people don’t like green — they don’t think it looks good on flesh tones.”

Lachman’s work on “Maria” was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 97th Academy Awards, but lost to “The Brutalist,” which shot partially in VistaVision.",indiewire
https://indiewire.com,"Jason Isbell Is Alone Again, Preternaturally, on a Superb Solo Acoustic Tour: Concert Review",https://variety.com/2025/music/concert-reviews/jason-isbell-solo-tour-concert-review-1236338905/,"Sun, 16 Mar 2025 21:02:00 GMT","“I’ve grown tired of traveling alone,” Jason Isbell once sang, in a number that remains a favorite for fans in a lonesome mood. But that’s one of his old songs that means something different today. He’s traveling alone and loving it, at least in the sense that he is hitting the road as a solo artist for a first-time national acoustic tour, reflecting the formal aloneness of his just-released album “Foxes in the Snow.” Or maybe the reflection goes the other way: Isbell has suggested that he was booking the tour dates first last year and the idea of recording a full record with no band was an outgrowth of that impulse. Whichever came first, the chicken or the egg, the album and tour arriving in tandem are making for a terrific chicken-omelette dinner.

Playing a mid-tour show at Oakland’s Calvin Simmons Theatre (a juke joint as high-class as L.A.’s Walt Disney Concert Hall, where he also played this weekend), Isbell mentioned how he is coincidentally sharing a circuit with some musician friends right now, even if they, too, are more or less traveling alone. “I appreciate you guys not going to Sacramento to see Dave and Gil this evening, because I know that Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are basically at the same places that I’m at on this tour,” he told the Oakland crowd. “We’re going back and forth. We were texting before the show because I love them, they’re my favorite, and it struck us that you people love a flat-picked guitar out here. I think it’s because it’s hard to carry a whole bunch of gear when the towns are real far apart. … I have this theory that the guitar is the best instrument of all the instruments. I think it’s because you can carry it with you and still play a full chord,” he noted — throwing in a joke about the challenge of accompanying yourself singing “Wonderwall” on the flute at a party.

Popular on Variety

The most obvious point of reference for the “Foxes in the Snow” album has been Bruce Springsteen’s completely solo “Nebraska,” and it’s apt, as far as thinking about making a virtue out of starkness on the edge of town. One difference is that some Springsteen fans still, to this day, debate whether his record would have worked better as an E Street album and hunger to hear the scrapped band tracks released from the vaults. It’s possible there are some Isbell fans who’ll put their imaginations to work imagining how “Foxes” would have sounded as a band record, too — and possibly we’ll find out if these songs turn up on his next tour with the 400 Unit —but his new album doesn’t work as well as it does just because it’s a mood piece. It’s true that the transparently autobiographical nature of most of the songs, at a time when people are taking an extra interest in Isbell’s personal life, lends itself to the stripped-down format. But unlike the Springsteen record of yore, there is a level of acoustic guitar virtuosity here that is a big part of the appeal.

In other words, Isbell wasn’t lying, or exaggerating, with his half-joking aside about audiences loving a flat-picked guitar. You may think you’re coming for the “divorce album,” or the newly minted love songs, with someone who is as much a master of personal lyricism as Isbell is. But whether you’re as cognizant of his tastefully subtle acoustic guitar shredding as you are of his songwriting, it’s true, instinctively, what they say: Every girl crazy ‘bout a sharp-picked Martin.

Isbell’s solo shows on this tour are coming in at what “Succession” fans might call a “tight 90.” He’s been doing eight of the new album’s 11 songs just about every night (abeit not always the same eight), and then bolstering those with 10 more selections from the catalog… making for a satisfying hour-and-a-half that you might wish was just a little longer, if you harbor the desire, as diehards will, to find out what every band song sounds like in this format. Setlists passed along from previous stops along the way indicate that there’s a real lottery as to which oldies you’ll get on any given night. In Oakland, he opened the show with the rueful rocker “Overseas” and closed the main portion of the set with the tender “Something to Love”; these are songs that don’t even show up in his performances most nights. But Isbell likes playing roulette with key setlist slots that might be set in stone for most other touring acts.

Isbell went into storytelling mode for a bare handful of the songs, albeit not the most personal ones. If one case, he made it crystal-clear he is not always in memoir mode, suggesting that some listeners don’t believe that no matter how obvious the hints. Following “The Life You Chose,” he noted, “A lot of times people think that if you write a song and you say ‘I’ or ‘me,’ then everything in that song happened to you. For that last one, I tried to make it pretty obvious that that’s not me in their song. And still people will ask those questions, and sometimes I just hold up my fingers.” (In other words, “Lost three fingers to a faulty tool / Settled out of court, I’m no one’s fool” may have been a giveaway.)

After singing “Elephant,” his famously harrowing song about being partnered with a woman dying of terminal cancer, he said that “the first time I played that song, people were upset. You know, everybody got really quiet. Nobody clapped or anything.” Finally, he said, “This one guy in the back of the crowd yells out, ‘Play a sad song.'”

Well, after playing “Elephant” at this particular show, Isbell did play a damned sad song, although it’s debatable whether it was sadder than the one that came before. Next up for him was “Gravelweed,” one of several tracks from the new record that seem to deal quite outrightly with a recent divorce that has been a subject of endless fan speculation. Isbell was not about to give this one a spoken introduction or outro, nor did he offer any annotation for the similarly biting “True Believer,” which closed the show. At least when it came to explaining any of the most confessional new material, which tends to come close to being self-explanatory, Isbell was content to let the subjects of his real-life split or subsequent love be the elephants in the room.

But Isbell fans are the type that like to read between the lines anyway, and they weren’t likely to feel like the singer-songwriter was in avoidance mode, not in a show in which he opened with one number about a separation (“Overseas”) and closed the encore portion with another (“True Believer”). It says something about how loaded some of those new songs about his split are — in an album that has been compared not just to “Nebraska,” but to “Blood on the Tracks” — that they are right in competition with “Elephant” and “Live Oak” — an actual murder ballad! — for the title of heaviest song of the night.

This is a mostly light-spirited show, nonetheless, despite those weighty anchor songs. That’s partly due to the jocularity of the handful of stories he tells. And it’s partly due to how “Foxes in the Snow” has several extremely romantic songs, seemingly inspired by new love in Isbell’s life. (As far as the old love songs that have different meanings now, to quote “Gravelweed,” signature song “Cover Me Up” was not on the playlist on this particular night, although “If We Were Vampires” remains a staple.) “Good While It Lasted,” “Ride to Robert’s” and the title track of “Foxes in the Snow” all stood as rare and fresh examples of how Isbell can write a great crush song when he sets his mind to it. Regardless of how much of his personal goings-on you read into these freshly penned numbers, they are ebullient set-lifters that came just in time, deliberately or coincidently, to ensure that his first solo tour doesn’t get bogged down in breakups or missing digits.

There is one moony love song from the new album he did some explaining about … because it’s not about him. Although “Wind Behind the Rain” was identified in some album reviews (including ours) as a lovestruck paean to his new partner, Isbell explained its exegesis here: “My little brother got married a few months ago, and his fiance came up to me and said… ‘Will you write a song for our wedding?’ I said, ‘That is a bold request, so yes, I’ll do it.’ And oh my God… I have played in front of all kinds of folks and not been as nervous as I was standing up for their first dance with a guitar with this song taped to the microphone stand on a piece of notebook paper, wearing a cheap suit.” Isbell has not lacked for songs before that at least carried the romantic intensity of a wedding song, but now he’s got one that doesn’t mention vampirism or staying in bed for a week, so it may move quickly up the list of his nuptials-ready numbers.

Even if you’re a fan of the 400 Unit sound, as presumably every extant devotee of his is, this solo show felt like optimal Isbell, at least in the moment, with the clarity of music and lyrics that the honed-down, zoned-in solo format allowed. It seems unlikely that he’ll stay in this mode indefinitely, though. So one question is, will these new songs translate well to him going electric again? The 8-bill augurs for a favorable outcome, there; the chorus hooks of “Eileen” and “Gravelweed,” especially, are too strong not to be heard loud and clear over the blare of a band. But this probably fleeting solo turn is something fans will remember as good while it lasted, to say the least.

Days before celebrating Ocean’s birthday, Kent confirmed that her and Emmett’s custody battle had been settled.

The Wednesday star revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly published on Friday, March 14, that Iron Man 3 was one of her first roles — but her part was cut from the movie’s final release.

“It was one of the first jobs I ever had,” Ortega said. “They took all my lines out.”

Ortega added that the only part of her that’s visible in the scene is “one leg.”

After Ant-Man star Paul Rudd added that sometimes Marvel likes to lay “breadcrumbs,” Ortega pushed back, “They even took my name away.”

Luckily, being cut from the film hasn’t had a negative impact on Ortega’s career —the second season of her hit series Wednesday is set to debut this year on Netflix, and the actress has already warned fans that they need to be prepared.

Related: Why Jenna Ortega Was 'Confused' by the Success of 'Wednesday' Vlad Cioplea/Netflix Nowadays, Jenna Ortega is known for playing Wednesday Addams — but the massive success of the Netflix series is still sinking in. “I didn’t know what to say or do,” Ortega, 21, told Vanity Fair in a Wednesday, February 21, interview about adjusting to her new level of fame. “I just became very […]

“I kind of want her to be darker,” Ortega told Entertainment Tonight in December 2022. “I want her to get more in the nitty-gritty of things and not play things so safe, because there are a lot of lines about her saving the school and doing whatever, but for me, her main drive with the monster is of a competitiveness. Kind of, ‘Man, how’s this guy doing this?’”

In February 2024, Ortega, who will also serve as a producer on the show’s second season, told Vanity Fair the show will “expand” on the supernatural themes. “I mean, in the first season, we had episodes that really stood out visually, like, the dance episode was a really big one for people, and that setting was very particular and it felt like Prom Night, a little bit, or Carrie,” she said. “Every episode [of season 2] that I’ve read so far is like that.”

She continued: “It just stands out on its own as a very memorable scene or bit or setting, which I think is what I’m most excited for, because to pull that off for eight episodes is, I think, really incredible and really lucky.”

And that’s not all — in January of this year, Ortega told E! News Tim Burton “really had a ball” in terms of the show’s gory content in season 2. “Everything is very graphic, and it’s very exciting and inspiring to work with someone like that who gets you excited about the shots that you’re doing every day,” she said.

Monaghan explained that White, 54, asked if she would go blonde after she booked the gig. Her reaction? “Uh…YES! I’d shave my head for that man!” she wrote.

“Mike wanted the ladies to be ‘a big blonde blob,’” Monaghan continued. “He wanted us to convey the look of sameness — an interchangeable trio of sorts prior to discovering the nuances of each character as the season progresses. Going blonde was wonderful creative inspiration for me but I’d need an epic colorist to make those locks a reality.”

I’m so thankful to her, and her team, because let’s be honest, blondes absolutely do have more fun. 💯👱‍♀️🤸#thewhitelotus #bts #blonde #jaclynlemon #blondeambition.”

Alongside the message, Monaghan shared a series of videos and photos of her hair transformation.

“Hey guys, I’m super excited. I am outside Tracey Cunningham’s salon and I am going blonde for Jaclyn Lemon for The White Lotus,” Monaghan said in a video, referring to her character. “I can’t wait for you guys to meet her. I can’t wait to meet her. Here we go! Super pumped.”

In one image, Monaghan posed for a mirror selfie with Bibb, who was also at the salon, while in another pic the pair smiled at each other as they took a picture in front of a sign for The White Lotus alongside costar Carrie Coon.

In season 3 of The White Lotus, Monaghan’s Jaclyn takes longtime friends Kate (Bibb) and Laurie (Coon) to Thailand for a girls trip.

Garfield, 41, and Barbaro, 41, were spotted outside a grocery store in Malibu, California, according to photos published on Sunday, March 16, by Instagram gossip account DeuxMoi.

Garfield went incognito, sporting a red baseball cap with a pair of sunglasses as he held onto an iced coffee. Barbaro, also donned a hat as she pushed a grocery cart out of the establishment.

While neither actor has publicly addressed their relationship status, news broke in February that they had started seeing one another. (Us Weekly reached out to Garfield and Barbaro’s reps for comment at the time.)

The Tony nominee’s most high-profile relationship began in 2012 after playing the Peter Parker to Emma Stone’s Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man. The pair’s chemistry on set was so strong that it led to a real-life love […]

Garfield and the A Complete Unknown standout were first publicly spotted together at W magazine’s Annual Best Performances Party in January. Weeks later, they were seen watching Jonathan Bailey’s starring turn in Richard III on the West End stage in London.

The We Live in Time star last dated Dr. Kate Tomas, a self-described “professional witch,” for several months in 2024. Tomas announced the breakup in October 2024, noting via Instagram that they called it quits “months ago.”

While Garfield also didn’t address his short-lived romance with Tomas, he has been candid about dating in the public eye.

“How many of those relationships work out?” Garfield said on an October 2024 episode of Chicken Shop Date. “I mean, it’s, like, flash-in-the-pan stuff, usually.”

Throughout his career, Garfield has been romantically linked to stars Shannon Woodward, Susie Abromeit, Aisling Bea, Rita Ora and Alyssa Miller. He also famously dated Emma Stone from 2011 to 2015 after they met on the set of 2012’s The Amazing Spider-Man.

Do you not?” […]

Garfield still remains friendly with Stone, 36, who is now married to Dave McCary.

“We care about each other so much, and that’s a given, that’s kind of this unconditional thing,” Garfield told Vanity Fair in January 2017. “There’s so much love between us and so much respect. … I’m her biggest fan as an artist. So for me, it’s been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress that she is.”

Garfield has further gotten a glimpse at the next phase of life when he played a husband and father in 2024’s We Live in Time opposite Florence Pugh. Speaking to Esquire that year, he admitted he was hesitant to become a dad in real life.

“I’m already a tired guy. I don’t want to be a tired dad,” he quipped. “Particularly bringing new life into the context of my life, there’s a heavy burden there.”",usmagazine

“I unfortunately do not control the internet and cannot wipe this from the internet. I have tried begging the public and my kids’ dad to keep them offline, and I’ve tried legal recourse,” Grimes, 36, claimed via X on Friday, March 14, referencing a comment about attempting to protect her children from false online narratives. “I’ve seen young ppl destroyed by the internet too.”

She added, “The state of my children’s lives being public is of grave concern to me and I think about how to solve this every day. It’s insane to me that there’s no way to deal with this.”

Musk, 53, and Grimes (real name Claire Elise Boucher) share sons X Æ A-Xii, 4, and Techno Mechanicus, 2, as well as daughter Exa Dark Sideræl, 3.

Related: Everything Grimes Has Said About Raising Kids With Elon Musk Elon Musk and Grimes are the first to admit their relationship is unique. “There’s no real word for it,” Grimes (born Claire Elise Boucher) told Vanity Fair in March 2022. “I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we’re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We’re best friends. We see each other […]

After Musk and Grimes split in 2022, the musician condemned the way that son X, in particular, has frequently made public appearances alongside the Tesla founder and President Donald Trump.

“I would hope there was some law that would allow a parent to veto small children from living public lives, but I don’t even trust the law to help me now if I tried to invoke it tbh,” she alleged on Friday. “We are in the Wild West of information content and the dismantling of privacy and it’s very concerning.”

Musk, who is a father of 14, has not publicly responded to Grimes’ accusations. Us Weekly has reached out for comment.

Musk recently brought son X to the White House for an Oval Office visit last month.

“He should not be in public like this. I did not see this, thank (you) for alerting me. But I’m glad he was polite. Sigh,” Grimes later wrote via social media, expressing sadness over her son’s high-profile media appearance.

She also spoke to TIME about the now-viral photos, asking “people to stop posting images of my kid everywhere.”

“I think fame is something you should consent to,” Grimes told the outlet. “Obviously, things will just be what they are. But I would really, really appreciate that. I can only ask, so I’m just asking.”

Grimes, for her part, seldom posts about her children on social media.

“Whatever is going on with family stuff, I just feel like kids need to stay out of it, and X is just out there,” the singer previously told Vanity Fair in a March 2022 profile. “I mean, I think [Elon] is really seeing him as a protégé and bringing him to everything and stuff.

The Bachelor Nation star also suggested to Us that the long leopard dress is perfect for any girl’s night out. “You’re turning heads, but it’s not about the guys that night. You’re about having fun with your girls,” she explained.

Kirkconnell also thought that some of her other dresses, including a sheer white lace off-the-shoulder getup, would make a good outfit for a Bachelor in Paradise rose ceremony, which is set to return to the small screens this year. “I can so picture [it] as a beach look,” she told Us, noting the black strapless floral number would be a wow-worthy moment too. “That’s a great beach moment.”

As for herself, Kirkconnell told Us she isn’t planning to find love on the sandy beaches of Mexico this summer. “I don’t know if I’m able to date someone within the franchise again,” she candidly said. “I don’t know if I can do that again.”

While she might not be returning to the Bachelor Nation, Kirkconnell is still getting inspo from her line for potential first dates.

“I would say if it’s during the day or a more casual date, we have a really fun tube dress, with a lot of fun flowers,” she suggested. “For night, I think I’d either have to pick one of the little black dresses or maybe a fun green moment for a fun pop of color. They’re still sexy, but they’re more romantic and elegant.”

Who Is the Most Stylish Female Star of All Time?

When it comes to celebrities wearing her line, Kirkconnell would be thrilled to see Keke Palmer or Zendaya slaying in the collection.

“I think my favorite person for fashion is Zendaya, who I’ve been obsessed with lately,” Kirkconnell gushed, noting that she also thought the leopard-print mini and maxi dresses are right up Palmer’s alley.

As for her own closet, Kirkconnell is looking for “staples” that she can wear again “in 10 years.” One of her favorite trends — which are having a major moment this spring — is cowgirl boots, which Kirkconnell could see pairing well with any of her Showpo dresses. “I love a cowboy look because it’s casual and comfortable,” she said. “They’re not heels, you’re not walking around stilettos. But I still feel like they give fashion.”

“☀️ #SpringBreak #UsTime #StillGotIt 💪🏼,” Hudson, 24, wrote via Instagram on Saturday, March 15, sharing images of the couple in Jupiter Beach, Florida.

During the beach excursion, Hudson turned to Belichick, 72, for assistance as she attempted a handful of acrobatic yoga poses. For one, Belichick laid on his back, extending his feet up into the hair. Hudson, for her part, laid atop his parallel feet as they held hands. During a second pose, she lifted her arms back behind her shoulders to mimic a “Superman” position.

Belichick’s athleticism floored Hudson’s Instagram followers.

“That’s a 6x Super Bowl champion,” one social media user wrote of Belichick in the comments section.

Another added, “You got coach doing anything. Love this sista!”

A third fan, meanwhile, replied, “He is enjoying life with you!”

Hudson, a former cheerleader, and Belichick have been together since October 2024. They initially met three years earlier during a commercial airline flight while Hudson was still in college. Hudson and Belichick later made their red carpet debut at the American Museum of Natural History’s annual gala in December 2024.

“The evening was saturated with all of my favorite things: friendship, education, philanthropy, glamour, beet salad, Billy, dance-worthy music, ornithological & oceanic exhibits,” Hudson gushed via Instagram at the time. “We created so many great memories together while supporting a great cause; my heart is filled to the brim!!!”

“Let’s take a deeper dive into the hot topic of the day: LOVE’… ‘What constitutes love?’ or ‘What makes someone worthy of loving?’ are questions that require a deep analysis and could possibly enable one to understand the romances that they may not understand nor relate to,” Hudson wrote via Instagram last month. “With such a limited character count.”

She added, “The ways in which we develop our biological preferences are deeply personal in which we owe no justification nor explanation. Love does not discriminate against sex, skin color, religion, age or ability. Love does not fluctuate along with someone’s body weight. Love does not lie within a perfect complexion. Love is not as deep as one’s pockets. Love does not look the same every time you see it.”

Hudson further noted at the time that it’s “never OK to harass or abuse a person based upon who they love.”",usmagazine

Maybe even better,” Vitale, 85, said at the Saturday, March 15, ACC Championship game. “I hope and pray my doctor really helps me with my voice. …I have to listen to my doctor right now. He told me, voice rest right after this game for a week.”

Vitale gave a shout-out to his fans and the people who have supported him, including ESPN for “tolerating and putting up with me in terms of my issues I’ve had.”

“It’s been a miracle, really. To sit here with you guys. I can’t tell you how much it meant to me. It’s been unbelievable,” Vitale said through tears, per ESPN. “Tough three years, those four cancer battles. I don’t wish on anybody. Cancer sucks.”

He continued, “I’ll tell you this, anybody battling cancer, please listen, think positive always, and have faith and believe that if you’re out there, a person that knows somebody who has cancer, send them a text message, send them a phone call, make a phone call. The bottom line is it means so much. I know it meant a lot to me in my darkest moment when I was in the hospital doing chemo and had a bad dad day. Man, it was a tough, tough time. I had to stay overnight and my family left.”

Vitale recalled “crying like crazy” before a nurse came in and “cheered” him up. He recalled having “messages from all over the country” on his phone.

The actress welcomed daughter Ava with her ex-husband, Ryan Phillippe, in 1999, and the little one became a big sister four years later when son Deacon arrived. Following the Cruel Intentions costars’ 2006 split, Witherspoon wed Jim Toth […]

Witherspoon said the moment filled her heart “with the deepest joy” that her son learned that message from her.

“It just meant so much to me that my kids know that it’s OK to be different and that it can actually end up being your superpower,” she said.

Witherspoon is mom to daughter Ava, 25, and son Deacon, 21, whom she welcomed with ex-husband Ryan Phillippe. She also shares son Tennessee, 12, with ex-husband Jim Toth. (Witherspoon and Phillippe, 50, split in 2006 after seven years of marriage while the Big Little Lies actress and Toth, 54, called it quits in March 2023 more than a decade after tying the knot.)

The Morning Show star has shared a close bond with her kids through the years, bringing Deacon as her plus one to the August 2024 premiere of Blink Twice — and meeting up with Ava inside the event. Months later, Witherspoon brought Deacon as her date to the WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards in October 2024.

While exclusively speaking with Us Weekly at the event, Witherspoon gushed about “the thing that makes [her] happy.” She told Us, “My kids and my company and really it’s having Deacon here tonight. That is so fun for me, and I hope [for] him too!”",usmagazine

Local news reports in the Dominican Republic claim a white netted sarong was found draped over a beach chair and a pair of beige flip-flops were discovered next to the leg of a beach chair and are believed to belong to 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki.

According to reports, the beachwear has a resemblance to the outfit Sudiksha was wearing the day she disappeared.

Konanki -- a resident of Virginia -- was last seen on surveillance video with 24-year-old Joshua Riibe who is considered a ""person of interest"" in Konanki’s disappearance. The two were seen walking with friends toward the beach around 4:15 AM Thursday, March 6 ... before she vanished around 4:50 AM, according to investigators.

Riibe has been ""interviewed at length,"" but authorities tell us for now, this remains a missing-person case, not a criminal one. As of now, Riibe has not been accused of any crime in connection to her disappearance.

Local authorities have speculated Sudiksha may have left the clothes on the beach chair before she jumped into the waters and possibly drowned.",tmz

After their photo sesh, Gal, Rachel and the others strolled into the theater to watch the flick, which has been dogged by controversy. As a result, Saturday's premiere was scaled down to avoid more bad press.

One problem centered around rumors Gal and Rachel didn't get along on set because of their opposing views on the Israel-Hamas war.

Another issue bubbled up when Disney -- Snow White's production company -- decided to cut out the iconic seven dwarfs, replacing them with computer-generated imagery instead of casting little people, which didn't go over well with fans.
