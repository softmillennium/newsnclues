“There is warmth, strength, gentleness, humor, generosity, encouragement, loyalty, and magic to @donatella_versace that I feel so lucky to have experienced from this boss and icon,” Hadid continued. “To say her support for me, 10 years ago, changed the course of my career would be an understatement.” Hadid added that Donatella “was the first person to put me on a big, high fashion runway — then put me in the campaign that season,” saying, “Looking back at each memory since- more fittings, shoots, shows, carpets, campaigns, and dinners at Donatella’s than I can include^.. I’m reminded how her belief in me a decade ago made me see myself in ways I hadn’t before.” It was announced by Versace’s U.S. owner Capri Holdings on Thursday, March 13, that Donatella would step down as chief creative officer for the role of chief brand ambassador. While Hadid’s meteoric rise to the top of the fashion industry may seem like it happened overnight, she actually started working when she was just two years old, after being discovered by Guess’ Paul Maricano. After taking a break from the modeling industry, she returned in 2012 to […] “Championing the next generation of designers has always been important to me,” Donatella said via Instagram on Thursday. “I am thrilled that Dario Vitale will be joining us and excited to see Versace through new eyes. I want to thank my incredible design team and all the employees at Versace that I had the privilege of working with for over three decades.” She added, “In my new role as Chief Brand Ambassador, I will remain Versace’s most passionate supporter.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://variety.com/2025/music/concert-reviews/jason-isbell-solo-tour-concert-review-1236338905/'>Jason Isbell Is Alone Again, Preternaturally, on a Superb Solo Acoustic Tour: Concert Review</a></h2><b>Source:</b> indiewire&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 21:02:00 <p>
Playing a mid-tour show at Oakland’s Calvin Simmons Theatre (a juke joint as high-class as L.A.’s Walt Disney Concert Hall, where he also played this weekend), Isbell mentioned how he is coincidentally sharing a circuit with some musician friends right now, even if they, too, are more or less traveling alone. “I appreciate you guys not going to Sacramento to see Dave and Gil this evening, because I know that Gillian Welch and David Rawlings are basically at the same places that I’m at on this tour,” he told the Oakland crowd. We were texting before the show because I love them, they’re my favorite, and it struck us that you people love a flat-picked guitar out here. One difference is that some Springsteen fans still, to this day, debate whether his record would have worked better as an E Street album and hunger to hear the scrapped band tracks released from the vaults. It’s possible there are some Isbell fans who’ll put their imaginations to work imagining how “Foxes” would have sounded as a band record, too — and possibly we’ll find out if these songs turn up on his next tour with the 400 Unit —but his new album doesn’t work as well as it does just because it’s a mood piece. In other words, Isbell wasn’t lying, or exaggerating, with his half-joking aside about audiences loving a flat-picked guitar. You may think you’re coming for the “divorce album,” or the newly minted love songs, with someone who is as much a master of personal lyricism as Isbell is. But whether you’re as cognizant of his tastefully subtle acoustic guitar shredding as you are of his songwriting, it’s true, instinctively, what they say: Every girl crazy ‘bout a sharp-picked Martin. Isbell’s solo shows on this tour are coming in at what “Succession” fans might call a “tight 90.” He’s been doing eight of the new album’s 11 songs just about every night (abeit not always the same eight), and then bolstering those with 10 more selections from the catalog… making for a satisfying hour-and-a-half that you might wish was just a little longer, if you harbor the desire, as diehards will, to find out what every band song sounds like in this format. But Isbell likes playing roulette with key setlist slots that might be set in stone for most other touring acts. If one case, he made it crystal-clear he is not always in memoir mode, suggesting that some listeners don’t believe that no matter how obvious the hints. And still people will ask those questions, and sometimes I just hold up my fingers.” (In other words, “Lost three fingers to a faulty tool / Settled out of court, I’m no one’s fool” may have been a giveaway.) After singing “Elephant,” his famously harrowing song about being partnered with a woman dying of terminal cancer, he said that “the first time I played that song, people were upset. Well, after playing “Elephant” at this particular show, Isbell did play a damned sad song, although it’s debatable whether it was sadder than the one that came before. Next up for him was “Gravelweed,” one of several tracks from the new record that seem to deal quite outrightly with a recent divorce that has been a subject of endless fan speculation. Isbell was not about to give this one a spoken introduction or outro, nor did he offer any annotation for the similarly biting “True Believer,” which closed the show. It says something about how loaded some of those new songs about his split are — in an album that has been compared not just to “Nebraska,” but to “Blood on the Tracks” — that they are right in competition with “Elephant” and “Live Oak” — an actual murder ballad! This is a mostly light-spirited show, nonetheless, despite those weighty anchor songs. (As far as the old love songs that have different meanings now, to quote “Gravelweed,” signature song “Cover Me Up” was not on the playlist on this particular night, although “If We Were Vampires” remains a staple.) “Good While It Lasted,” “Ride to Robert’s” and the title track of “Foxes in the Snow” all stood as rare and fresh examples of how Isbell can write a great crush song when he sets his mind to it. Regardless of how much of his personal goings-on you read into these freshly penned numbers, they are ebullient set-lifters that came just in time, deliberately or coincidently, to ensure that his first solo tour doesn’t get bogged down in breakups or missing digits. Although “Wind Behind the Rain” was identified in some album reviews (including ours) as a lovestruck paean to his new partner, Isbell explained its exegesis here: “My little brother got married a few months ago, and his fiance came up to me and said… ‘Will you write a song for our wedding?’ I said, ‘That is a bold request, so yes, I’ll do it.’ And oh my God… I have played in front of all kinds of folks and not been as nervous as I was standing up for their first dance with a guitar with this song taped to the microphone stand on a piece of notebook paper, wearing a cheap suit.” Isbell has not lacked for songs before that at least carried the romantic intensity of a wedding song, but now he’s got one that doesn’t mention vampirism or staying in bed for a week, so it may move quickly up the list of his nuptials-ready numbers. It seems unlikely that he’ll stay in this mode indefinitely, though. So one question is, will these new songs translate well to him going electric again? But this probably fleeting solo turn is something fans will remember as good while it lasted, to say the least.

The Wednesday star revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly published on Friday, March 14, that Iron Man 3 was one of her first roles — but her part was cut from the movie’s final release. “It was one of the first jobs I ever had,” Ortega said. After Ant-Man star Paul Rudd added that sometimes Marvel likes to lay “breadcrumbs,” Ortega pushed back, “They even took my name away.” Luckily, being cut from the film hasn’t had a negative impact on Ortega’s career —the second season of her hit series Wednesday is set to debut this year on Netflix, and the actress has already warned fans that they need to be prepared. “I kind of want her to be darker,” Ortega told Entertainment Tonight in December 2022. “I want her to get more in the nitty-gritty of things and not play things so safe, because there are a lot of lines about her saving the school and doing whatever, but for me, her main drive with the monster is of a competitiveness. “I mean, in the first season, we had episodes that really stood out visually, like, the dance episode was a really big one for people, and that setting was very particular and it felt like Prom Night, a little bit, or Carrie,” she said. And that’s not all — in January of this year, Ortega told E! “Everything is very graphic, and it’s very exciting and inspiring to work with someone like that who gets you excited about the shots that you’re doing every day,” she said. The second season of Wednesday will also feature a guest star – none other than Lady Gaga, whose song “Bloody Mary” was used in several TikTok videos celebrating the first season.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Though he enjoys building a futuristic world on screen with his hit TV series “Andor,” in real life, writer/director Tony Gilroy is trying to slow the future. Speaking in a recent interview with Collider, Gilroy expressed his animosity toward the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Hollywood, where many are training their models on screenplays whether they have the rights to them or not. AI is the reason we’re not,” said Gilroy. “In the end, it would be 1,500 pages that came directly off this desk. Why help the fucking robots anymore than you can? “No one was working on the show with a newspaper at any point in time. We write so far in advance,” he told Collider. “I’ve said this before: I’ve been a student of history, as an amateur, a dinner table historian all this time, and it’s nothing but revolutions and uprisings and people being swept up into events that they weren’t ready for and people assuming heroic roles that they had never anticipated.” Showrunner Gilroy isn’t the only writer working on “Andor,” of course. “The writers on the show and myself, it’s a pretty fancy bunch of writers, really, in a way. “We only get together for five or six days in the beginning to talk about the story, and then we kind of go, and they do their thing, and then they go away.

While cheering on the University of North Carolina’s basketball team at the Dean Smith Center on Saturday, January 25, Hudson, 24, seemingly went pantless when she wore an oversized gray sweater and white knee-high boots. Hudson, meanwhile, hasn’t been one to shy away from clapping back at any internet haters. “Let’s take a deeper dive into the hot topic of the day: LOVE’… ‘What constitutes love?’ or ‘What makes someone worthy of loving?’ are questions that require a deep analysis and could possibly enable one to understand the romances that they may not understand nor relate to,” Hudson wrote via Instagram last month. Love does not discriminate against sex, skin color, religion, age or ability. Hudson further noted at the time that it’s “never OK to harass or abuse a person based upon who they love.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ever since Robert Downey Jr. announced his heel-flip return to the MCU as iconic villain Doctor Doom, Marvel fans have been clamoring to find out who from the original “Avengers” might be resurrected for the next installments.

They’re like, ‘But she could come back!’ Look, I think the balance of the entire universe is held in her hand.

Earning his first ASC award for “Maria” last month, it seems cinematographer Ed Lachman now feels emboldened to bemoan current trends in film imagery. Though most movies no longer shoot on traditional film stock, many still seek out the grainy appeal in the final edit, a fact Lachman has come to detest. Still prone to work with film, as he did on Pablo Larraín’s “Maria,” he also knows the challenges of processing that film by digital means. Speaking with fellow DP Roger Deakins during a recent episode of the “Team Deakins” podcast, Lachman explained how he prefers to use “color temperature and gels” in-camera to replicate film when working with digital, but most others only manipulate the image in post. While Lachman believes many recent films fall into this category, there was one in particular from last year that particularly irked him. Deakins went on to echo Lachman’s sentiments and really put the blame on how anamorphic lenses tend to wash out certain elements of an image. “You want the character to feel they’re in a space, and you want that space to register,” he said. “And I think, yeah, what you’re saying, anamorphic, you’re often isolating the character in a kind of sea of mist.” So her apartment has the warmth of a nest, like she’s hiding from the world outside, but then it’s invaded by cooler colors like green. Lachman’s work on “Maria” was nominated for Best Cinematography at the 97th Academy Awards, but lost to “The Brutalist,” which shot partially in VistaVision.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.vulture.com/article/1923-recap-season-2-episode-4-journey-the-rivers-of-iron.html'>1923 Recap: One Calamity Down</a></h2><b>Source:</b> vulture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-16 14:00:44 <p>
“Journey the Rivers of Iron” is an especially grisly episode of a series that’s never easy on the squeamish. When Lizzie eventually asks for a needle to self-administer her rabies vaccine, I hardly flinched. Back in Bozeman, Lindy, one of Donald Whitfield’s sex workers–in–residence, strangles another sex worker that he was keeping as a pet. Even watching through my fingers, it’s obvious that “Journey the Rivers of Iron” is the best episode of 1923’s second season so far. We’re encouraged to believe that, come thaw, they might even be in a position to throw some punches of their own. Whitfield has a three-step plan for remaking Montana into a winter wonderland for the rich men who live along Chicago’s lakeshore and New Yorkers who mistake the Hudson Valley’s hills for real mountains. Step two: Pave a freeway through Paradise Valley at the government’s expense. “Americans no longer rely upon their hands for money,” Whitfield explains to a room of nodding investors who are eager to see their lives in Bozeman as covetable. “They use their minds.” This might be the exact moment when this country lost its way, at least according to the laws of Yellowstone. Only Banner Creighton sees the teeny-weeny problem with Whitfield’s proposal, and it’s not the bit about inventing safe and speedy air travel. Whitfield tells Banner to assemble an army of sheepherders who want the same land for grazing in summer, and Banner says he’ll ask the miners, too. Before he pledges his men to Whitfield, Banner talks it through with Ellie. His wife has remained impressively skeptical of the mining tycoon, but the promise of a future for her family is too much to resist. Ellie tells her husband that if he’s going to steal another man’s castle, he can’t leave the prince in any condition to take that castle back. I agree with her cool assessment, and yet you’d really have to squint to mistake Jake Dutton for a prince right now. It’s Whitfield that Banner needs to outwit. If you’re risking your life, do it to become king of the mountain, not prince of the valley. Because, from what we’ve seen in 1923, being prince of the valley is punishing. Jake Dutton spends the morning assisting on meatball brain surgery so gruesome that his nephew Jack nearly hurls on several occasions. Jake watches him wake up mid-surgery, in agony, with a shop-class hand drill burrowed into his head. I actually thought Jake handled Lizzie well by establishing a third option between staying at the Yellowstone and leaving it forever; Lizzie can just visit home for a bit and return when the mercury rises. We’ll never know if Jake’s plea would have been successful, though, because the doctor confirms that Lizzie is pregnant. They share cute, inexplicable banter about how he doesn’t understand women at all and that’s somehow the bedrock of their marriage. Aunt Cara was negging long before The Pick-Up Artist. Then, for dinner at the end of a long day, Jake probably has some broth or leftover gruel and thinks about how cold his bones are. Or maybe it’s guilt that chases his sleep away. Maybe it would be better for everyone if Jake just walked away from the Yellowstone. Better for Zane and Alice, who could move to California, where mixed-race marriage is legal. Better for Jack and Lizzie, who could raise their baby in the relative warmth of Boston. This happened on a relatively quiet day for the aging prince of Paradise Valley. Things didn’t go nearly so well for the Dutton diaspora beyond Montana state lines. After being robbed and beaten in Grand Central Station, Alex flings herself onto a moving train. For example, it almost seems like good luck when the Fort Worth sheriff offers him a ride to the train station, though it’s quickly revealed to be bad luck when he’s told to sit in the back seat like a perp. (Personally, I was surprised to learn Luca is such a squawker. (Here, I was confused as to why the police didn’t orchestrate a proper sting operation once Spencer gave them the delivery address. Why just bust down the door with no plan?) And it’s good luck that the Temperance Society is forcing a tarred prostitute to parade down Main Street at the exact moment Spencer goes on the run because (1) it creates an obstacle for the pursuing sheriff, and (2) it lets Spencer free a prostitute on his way home. You can take a man’s ranch, but not his savior complex. It’s good luck to hop on a train headed west and bad luck to find the car already occupied by hobos that will require killing. Ultimately, Spencer ends the episode where he started it: walking north from Fort Worth headed home to a place that won’t be home when he arrives. Because there aren’t roads in the Montana that Spencer is from. There’s no river of iron to drop his wife at a nearby station. Teonna, Pete, and Runs His Horse are still in Texas, too. They’re helping ranch hands drive cattle in the only 1923 story line that has any joy or vibrancy to it. It’s not a coincidence that God’s golden light shines brightest on the land in which men are still making their money with their hands. This week’s episode offered us longer days and brighter evenings — the promise of story lines reaching fruition. “Spring teases the senses with warm mornings and green buds of new grass and the hope of summer’s bounty,” Elsa Dutton tells us from beyond time, where the Dutton family story is already over or maybe never-ending.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Kristin Cavallari is super close to selling her Nashville area home ... 'cause TMZ has learned she's secured a buyer. Real estate sources tell us ... the "Lets Be Honest" podcast host's $8.9 million home in Franklin, TN is currently under contract as of Friday. We broke the story ... Kristin listed the 4-bedroom, 5-bathroom farmhouse in June of last year. She scooped up the property for over $3 million following her 2020 split from her ex-husband Jay Cutler. In 2022, Kristin revealed the property underwent an 18 month long renovation after she moved in. She said at the time ... "I did a lot of work. The house boasts 6,799 square feet of living space and 28 acres of total land. The kitchen features state-of-the-art appliances, and the basement is basically a wellness retreat. There's also a pool, greenhouse and beehives that come with the property. In January she slashed $950K off the property from its original $11 million asking price which she established in June 2024.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

GRAPHIC WARNING! Do not watch while eating breakfast.

New York City is well known for its large rat population ... and most people who live there run away from them — but that's not the case with one man, who actually enjoys FEASTING on them.

A stunned NYC woman can’t believe her eyes as she watches a man casually munch on a dead rat, exclaiming in disbelief, “This is fucking unbelievable. Look at this sh*t.” 🇺🇸🐁 pic.twitter.com/HE7s4xuvRu — Global Dissident (@GlobalDiss) March 15, 2025 @GlobalDiss

Yep, you read it right ... check out this disgusting video of the dude — all bundled up — performing an amateur autopsy on the carcass of the dead rodent, while sitting on the sidewalk in The Bronx.

An eyewitness shot the footage Saturday, and she does a play-by-play as the man dissects the rat in front of passers-by before EATING a portion of it.

In fact, when the guy raises the rodent to his mouth and sinks his teeth into it — the witness gasps in horror. Gross!</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson popped the question to his longtime girlfriend, Jilly Anais, over the weekend ... and she said YES!!

The couple of nearly six years shared snaps from the special moment on Instagram ... and they couldn't be happier as they showed off Anais' new accessory -- a massive diamond ring.

Watson got down on one knee at the beach ... and the rock came with a bunch of red roses, too -- which Anais proudly displayed for her followers.

Watson and Anais first went public with their relationship in 2019 ... and have been inseparable ever since.

Anais stuck by his side through his well-documented massage therapy scandal ... which stems from more than 20 women accusing the quarterback of sexual misconduct.

Watson was ultimately handed a lengthy suspension and fine as the result of an NFL investigation ... and the majority of lawsuits filed against him have ended in settlements.

Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.

Watson's future on the gridiron is a major question mark at the moment ... as it was announced earlier this year he reinjured the Achilles tear he suffered against the Cincinnati Bengals in October of last season, meaning he will be sidelined for the majority -- if not all -- of 2025.

The Browns have since shown interest in bringing in new talent under center ... and Watson's days in the Orange and Brown could very well be over after joining the team on an eye-popping five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed deal in 2022.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Bill Belichick's always about supporting his team ... and, it seems he's taking that quite literally in his relationship -- holding up his girlfriend Jordon Hudson in an impressive acrobatic maneuver on the beach.

Hudson shared several photos from an idyllic beach location with the Super Bowl-winning coach ... and, ya gotta see them for yourself -- Bill's got her high up in the air on his feet.

The former cheerleader hits a series of different poses ... showing a ton of trust in her partner by throwing out her hands in a Superman-like pose in one while she uses his hands for support and contorts her body into a 90-degree angle in another.

JH captioned the post, "☀️ #SpringBreak #UsTime #StillGotIt 💪🏼" ... translation, Bill isn't in full coach mode yet -- and, the couple's still enjoying quality time in their relationship.

The reality television star shared several clips to her Instagram story late Saturday night and early Sunday morning ... and, she kicks off the vids by saying she's going out and having fun as a coping mechanism.

Take a listen for yourself ... but, basically, Teddi says everyone has to find their own "new normal" -- and do whatever makes them happy. She gets really emotional while speaking to the camera too, sniffling back tears in the clip.

Gal Gadot and Rachel Zegler were all smiles at Saturday night's premiere of "Snow White" in Hollywood — despite all the negative press surrounding the film remake.

The actresses stood side by side on the red carpet at El Capitan Theatre — and they could not have looked happier posing for pics alongside the movie's producer Marc Platt, director Marc Webb and songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

Gal, who plays the Evil Queen, looked amazing in her black lace dress. Rachel, who portrays Snow White, exuded elegance in her peach gown with a matching corset.

After their photo sesh, Gal, Rachel and the others strolled into the theater to watch the flick, which has been dogged by controversy. As a result, Saturday's premiere was scaled down to avoid more bad press.

One problem centered around rumors Gal and Rachel didn't get along on set because of their opposing views on the Israel-Hamas war.

Another issue bubbled up when Disney -- Snow White's production company -- decided to cut out the iconic seven dwarfs, replacing them with computer-generated imagery instead of casting little people, which didn't go over well with fans.

The clothing belonging to the missing University of Pittsburgh college student was reportedly located at the beach where she went missing over a week ago.

Local news reports in the Dominican Republic claim a white netted sarong was found draped over a beach chair and a pair of beige flip-flops were discovered next to the leg of a beach chair and are believed to belong to 20-year-old Sudiksha Konanki.

According to reports, the beachwear has a resemblance to the outfit Sudiksha was wearing the day she disappeared.

Konanki -- a resident of Virginia -- was last seen on surveillance video with 24-year-old Joshua Riibe who is considered a "person of interest" in Konanki’s disappearance. The two were seen walking with friends toward the beach around 4:15 AM Thursday, March 6 ... before she vanished around 4:50 AM, according to investigators.

Riibe has been "interviewed at length," but authorities tell us for now, this remains a missing-person case, not a criminal one. As of now, Riibe has not been accused of any crime in connection to her disappearance.

Local authorities have speculated Sudiksha may have left the clothes on the beach chair before she jumped into the waters and possibly drowned.</p></b><br/><br/></div>
