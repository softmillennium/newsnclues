                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Monday announced it has appointed Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman. Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April but resigned in December, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In her new role, Meta said Powell McCormick will serve as a member of the company's management team and will help guide its strategy and execution. "Dina's experience at the highest levels of global finance, combined with her deep relationships around the world, makes her uniquely suited to help Meta manage this next phase of growth as the company's President and Vice Chairman," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. Prior to joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump, and she served under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in President George W. Bush's administration. Powell McCormick marks the second former member of the Trump administration that Meta has hired in recent weeks. The company said earlier this month that it has hired a new chief legal officer, Curtis Joseph Mahoney, who previously served as a deputy U.S. trade representative during Trump's first term. "Congratulations to DINA POWELL MCCORMICK, WHO HAS JUST BEEN NAMED THE NEW PRESIDENT OF META. She is a fantastic, and very talented, person, who served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction!," Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday. Powell McCormick also spent 16 years in senior leadership roles at Goldman Sachs, and most recently acted as an executive at BDT & MSD Partners.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A rising number of supply chain managers say that President Donald Trump's tariffs and associated costs are leading to layoffs and a lower confidence about investments needed to grow their businesses. Double the percentage of supply chain managers (32%) are reporting layoffs as compared to April (16%), according to a new survey conducted by the Association for Supply Chain Management and CNBC. "Tariffs just don't hit the balance sheet. They hit the people," said Abe Eshkenazi, CEO of ASCM. "We're seeing layoffs because of companies trying to manage their cost structure. If you don't have the necessary resources and the capabilities and knowledge of talented staff, it will have a long-term impact." While the national unemployment rate has only ticked higher rather than spiked since April when Trump's broad tariffs were first introduced, job growth last year was at its lowest outside of a recession since the early 2000s, according to the December jobs report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What some are calling a "hiring recession" is typified by rising long-term unemployment and anemic job creation, which has stalled since April. Thirty-four percent of those respondents cited an increase in costs greater than 15%. "Investing is impacted because you have shorter planning cycles and time horizons, which make it harder for organizations to plan. The survey of supply chain managers in sectors across the economy was conducted between Dec. 15, 2025 and Jan. 7, 2026 across over 220 respondents. Businesses, both large and small, have told CNBC that even if court-ordered refunds recoup some of the costs resulting from Trump's trade policy, they cannot make up for time lost due to a decrease in productivity from the added administrative hours needed to file paperwork for the expansive tariffs. "Navigating the tariffs is an administrative burden," Eshkenazi said. "We're spending a huge amount of time tracking rule changes, validating a lot of the codes, and trying to find the most effective way to operate in the short term without a long-term plan." In addition to the time-consuming paperwork, business owners tell CNBC some of the costs related to tariffs would not be covered by refunds. Baby products company Lalo, which paid limited tariffs before the tariffs Trump issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was required by U.S. Customs to put up collateral to secure customs bonds as a guarantee the company can pay the tariff bill. "We never had to do that before," said Michael Wieder, co-founder of Lalo. "This was on top of the millions we paid in tariffs. These capital challenges are not unusual, according to Eshkenazi. "So if duties and taxes go up, the customs bond goes up as well," said Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers. This is why funds stay tied up," Mullins said. Normally, funds are held for 314 days by Customs until the duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive government sign off. "I could be using that money to grow my business or even have it in an account that was accruing interest. This is taking money away from small businesses to use as working capital and sell more product. Business owners have previously told CNBC that it is unrealistic to think they will be made whole even if they are refunded tariffs by a Supreme Court decision, with many saying they are also on the hook for high-interest predatory loans taken out to pay the tariffs. Eshkenazi said members of his association are telling him the money they are spending on tariffs and associated costs is just a tax dragging down their supply chain. "You can't resource and requalify staff overnight," he said. "This isn't just about resilience and reacting to the court ruling. It's about having certainty in the U.S. economy, and what kind of pricing models they can plan on." Over half (56%) are concerned about a recession, yet it is roughly a third of those respondents that have a neutral or negative view of the economy, causing what the ASCM says is a "fuzzy and uncertain picture of the U.S. economy. Among the 56 percent of ASCM members that fear a recession, two-thirds think it may begin in the second quarter. "That is not good for companies looking to make investments," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump will face an important obstacle — from within his own party — as he seeks to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Sunday he will block any Trump appointees to the central bank, including for the new chair, in light of revelations over the weekend that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential perjury charges. "If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question," Tillis said in a statement. "I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved," he added. That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate. Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the "one big beautiful bill" spending package last year. Powell's position isn't the only one at stake. Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson. However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell "a dangerous man" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a "sock puppet" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates. "Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair," Warren said in a statement. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.

As someone who's committed to their skincare routine, I should write about this story on the latest men's beauty trend. But as a Michigan native, I'd be remiss not to mention GM's new headquarters in Detroit. The stock market is coming off a winning week. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced last night that he was under criminal investigation tied to the central bank's building renovations. But there's another notable sector event taking place this month: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's 20th year in the role. As CNBC's Hugh Son reports, some are wondering if JPMorgan Chase's era of dominance will conclude when the executive departs. It's unclear exactly when Dimon plans to step down, but the succession timeline is of particular interest as the CEO nears his 70th birthday. JPMorgan helps kickstart earnings season tomorrow, followed by peers including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs later in the week. Bank stocks plunged in premarket trading today after Trump said there should be a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year. Gemini, Google's artificial intelligence assistant, will help shoppers discover and purchase products from the retailer and its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, the companies announced yesterday. Google also launched the Universal Commerce Protocol yesterday, which the tech giant hopes will become an industry standard among shopping agents looking for and purchasing products. This week, Boeing is expected to report its highest airplane delivery volume for 2025 since 2018. As CNBC's Leslie Josephs points out, it's a symbol of the plane builder's turnaround efforts following years of reputation-marring safety crises. Looking ahead, Boeing is planning to ramp up production of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliners. Such increases can help the company swing back to profitability like Wall Street expects this year. Speaking of air travel, Allegiant said yesterday that it was acquiring rival budget carrier Sun Country in a $1.5 billion deal comprised of cash and stock. This agreement comes as value-focused airlines have grappled with surging costs stemming from the pandemic. The blockbuster GLP-1 market has been centered around weekly injections. But as CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino reports, obesity pills can bring the industry into its next chapter in 2026. Patients have begun receiving the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk to take daily. Rival Eli Lilly is expected to have a similar product winning regulatory approval within months. The pills aren't expected to offer more weight loss. But they can be seen as a simpler and possibly more affordable alternative to the shots, in turn expanding the market. Pills can entice new patients who were potentially deterred by needles, or those who did not see losing weight as a high enough priority to get a weekly shot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some retailers provided early holiday results on Monday that showed the crucial shopping season was solid, but didn't blow away expectations. Lululemon, which is preparing for a new CEO and staring down a proxy battle with its founder, said in a release it expects its holiday quarter to be "toward the high end" of its previously released guidance. Shoe maker Birkenstock and thrift store Savers Value Village also released lackluster early holiday results, while Abercrombie & Fitch cut the high end of its guidance. It made no changes to its previous guidance for gross margin, effective tax rate and selling, general and administrative expenses. "We remain focused on executing our action plan to drive improvement in our U.S. business and look forward to the opportunities in front of us," finance chief Meghan Frank said in a statement. When announcing last quarter's earnings on Dec. 11, outgoing CEO Calvin McDonald said the company was "encouraged" by its early holiday performance but acknowledged wide discounting had driven demand during the Thanksgiving holiday period. Like other higher-end brands, Lululemon has historically been very selective with discounts, but it has used them more liberally in recent quarters to offload old merchandise and styles that weren't resonating with shoppers. During its fiscal third quarter, margins fell by 2.9 percentage points, due primarily to higher tariffs and the bigger markdowns, it said at the time. Abercrombie & Fitch shares dropped more than 18% in morning trading after the retailer cut the high end of its guidance despite posting what it called "record" quarter-to-date sales. It's now expecting full-year sales to grow "at least 6%," down from a prior range of between 6% and 7%. It anticipates its operating margin, a closely watched metric on Wall Street, will be around 13%, compared to a previously expected range of between 13% and 13.5%. "Our team remained on offense across product, voice, and experience, resulting in record quarter-to-date net sales through fiscal December, aligned with our expectations," CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. "Importantly, we delivered balanced growth across our regions, brands, and channels." Birkenstock, which didn't provide specific holiday-quarter guidance last year, said it expects sales in the quarter ended Dec. 31 to grow 11% to €402 million ($470 million). Savers Value Village saw sales grow 8.4% during its holiday quarter, with comparable sales up 5.4%, excluding the impact of an extra week the company had in its calendar. Despite relatively strong growth, the company only reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 adjusted net income and EBITDA outlooks. On the other side of the aisle, American Eagle said its holiday quarter was far better than expected, with quarter-to-date comparable sales through Jan. 3 "up in the high single digits" and sales trends positive across brands and channels. Comparable sales at its namesake banner grew by a low single digit percentage, while comps at its intimates line Aerie were up "in the low twenties." "Momentum continued in the fourth quarter with record December sales fueled by the power of our brands, with particularly strong growth at Aerie and Offline and sequential growth at American Eagle," CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. "Our customers embraced new product collections and responded to our latest marketing initiatives, with strength continuing in the post-holiday period." Even so, the company's stock dropped 9% on Monday. "We are incredibly pleased with our holiday performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategies we have been executing this year. With our maniacal focus on the customer: the kid and the kid in all of us, we offered amazing, trend-right products at exceptional value and began to create a better-connected customer journey," CEO Winnie Park said in a news release. "In combination with tight-knit collaboration and alignment throughout the company, we drove strong, broad-based results." The company is now expecting fiscal fourth quarter sales to be around $1.71 billion, up from a previous range of between $1.58 billion and $1.61 billion, as it roughly doubled its comparable sales outlook to 14%, up from between 6% and 8%. Five Below expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.95 and $4, up from a prior range of between $3.36 to $3.54 per share. The company's shares slid about 1% in morning trading. There will continue to be standouts with strong growth, but across the board, Wall Street largely anticipates results will be solid without massive, widespread gains in consumer spending. The National Retail Federation previously forecasted retail sales in November and December would rise between 3.7% and 4.2% compared to 2024. That's solid growth, but when higher prices from tariffs are taken into account, some analysts expect volume growth to be largely flat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is testing the U.S. central bank's independence again and reinforcing the view among global investors that they need to diversify away from U.S. assets. "That's what seems to be transpiring this morning," Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday. Donald Trump has previously accused Powell of being too slow to cut rates, which continue to weigh on consumers, particularly in accessing housing. Lafargue called the probe "a surprising move," given that a new Fed chair will be announced in May when Powell's chairmanship of the Fed is due to conclude. Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North American macro strategy at Standard Chartered, said the probe was Trump trying to intimidate Powell with "the Maduro option": a warning that he could be removed by other means, referring to how the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was seized in a U.S. military strike last weekend. "The issue is the speed with which Trump is trying to do it," Englander told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday. "Obviously, he has the midterms right in front of him. He wants to get interest rates down. I think he's trying to intimidate the Fed — either by giving Powell the Maduro option of retiring and this all goes away, or by trying to get him off. "Unlike with Lisa Cook, this time there's an actual accusation, as opposed to just stuff you're throwing into the air." It again places central bank independence — a key issue for investors throughout Trump's tenure — in the spotlight, with attention turning to the U.S. 10-year yield and the potential for a broader drag on risk appetite into 2026. "I think it will bring forth that sentiment that investors need to diversify away from U.S. assets," Lafargue observed. Nabil Milali, multi-asset and overlay portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, said the president's strategy is "paradoxically counterproductive." "By questioning the Fed's independence, he is fueling upward pressure on rates, particularly at the long end of the curve, which we continue to avoid in our allocation," Milali told CNBC in an email. Looking to where investors may tilt their portfolios, Lafargue pinpointed China as "an increasingly popular trade," highlighting the country as a continued beneficiary of the AI narrative. While investors are less optimistic about the eurozone, there are pockets of opportunities — particularly around Germany's infrastructure and defense stimulus, said Lafargue, adding there may be a rebound in healthcare, material and energy in the U.K. While he said tensions between Trump and the Fed were "not a new narrative," he added investors needed to understand "how quickly this thing can play out." Milali said the latest spat raises the risk that Powell's successor "will have little credibility in the eyes of investors", and will ultimately be subject to President Trump's directives. — CNBC's Tasmin Lockwood contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Wall Street's top bankers huddled in New York last month, preparing to convince Elon Musk's SpaceX that they should be chosen to lead its upcoming IPO, one firm wasn't letting its star advisor miss the bake-off. Among the squad of JPMorgan Chase investment bankers flying 2,500 miles west to California to pitch SpaceX was the lender's boss, billionaire CEO Jamie Dimon, people with knowledge of the trip told CNBC. The morning after that pitch meeting, on Dec. 19, Dimon was already back in his customary early Friday perch: sitting in his bank's New York lobby, taking meetings in full view of the thousands of employees streaming through the building's turnstiles. Dimon marks his 20th anniversary as CEO this month and remains deeply involved across the sprawling businesses of JPMorgan, a giant across Wall Street and Main Street with $4.6 trillion in assets. Which makes the inevitable questions surrounding Dimon's tenure loom large as he approaches 70 years of age. In 2024, for the first time, he acknowledged that window was shrinking. Will JPMorgan's era of dominance be over when Dimon exits as CEO? "Given his track record, anybody else would be a downgrade," said Ben Mackovak, a bank board member and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partners. "I'm sure somebody else could grow into the role and surprise people," Mackovak said. "But on day one, no one is going to be as qualified to run that bank as Jamie." In two decades, Dimon took a middle-of-the-pack American lender and, with his unique combination of judgment, paranoia, attention to detail and scope of vision, created a juggernaut of finance that the world hadn't seen before. During calm times, he invested aggressively for the future, and during periods of tumult, like 2008 and 2023, he avoided pitfalls that consumed other banks, allowing him to snap up three failed institutions. The firm reports full-year 2025 results on Tuesday. Now, at a market cap of roughly $900 billion, JPMorgan is worth nearly as much as the next three largest U.S. banks combined: Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Besides running JPMorgan, Dimon has taken on an outsized role in global finance as a top voice explaining market gyrations or emerging risks and influencing regulators amid policy shifts. It was Dimon's recession warning on a Fox News segment in April that helped convince President Donald Trump to pivot on his trade policy, igniting a historic relief rally. The question of who could take over for Dimon — who was already a cancer survivor when he nearly died in 2020 from a ruptured aorta — has been openly discussed among investors for more than a decade. To investors, his most likely successor is currently Marianne Lake, head of the firm's giant consumer bank and former CFO of the company, followed by Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, the co-heads of the firm's commercial and investment bank. "If investors were to do a straw poll today, they'd probably pick Marianne," said Truist bank analyst Brian Foran. "The running joke is that she's a human supercomputer when it comes to banking," Foran said. Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo hypothesized that JPMorgan stock could immediately drop 5% if Dimon were to suddenly exit, regardless of the named replacement. It's a somewhat common occurrence on Wall Street for companies with iconic CEOs: The stock premium shrinks, at least for a period, when their longtime leaders announce their departures. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway shares trailed the S&P 500 last year after Warren Buffett said he was stepping down as CEO. When asked about CEO succession, JPMorgan executives say that Dimon is as plugged in as ever, and unlikely to step down soon. Depending on how long he sticks around, that means it's not necessarily his current direct reports like Lake, Petno and Rohrbaugh who are in line, but more junior executives now being groomed and evaluated for leadership roles, they told CNBC. "There's a lot of work going into imagining that day without him," said a JPMorgan executive who asked not to be named speaking about his boss. "If he stays until he's 85, it's not his direct reports that are going to be next in line, its maybe one or two levels down from today." I think there's combinations of people that together can create the same outcome." The CEO of a commercial bank and former JPMorgan executive, who described Dimon as a mentor, also said he didn't think Dimon would step down soon. His friends are all people from work. Still, beyond the day-to-day management of a company with 318,000 employees, Dimon seems intent on setting up JPMorgan for a future without him. In recent months, Dimon oversaw the completion of the bank's new $3 billion headquarters in midtown Manhattan and announced a $1.5 trillion initiative to bolster industries crucial to U.S. interests. And, perhaps most crucially, he continues to instill his values into the firm's management team. Last year, at a conference for JPMorgan's top 400 executives, Dimon rattled off a list of once-great companies that died though mismanagement. Finance is especially prone to this threat, because of the temptation to manipulate numbers for short-term gain, he said. Bear Stearns failed, Lehman failed, I'm here because Bank One screwed up a bunch of businesses," Dimon said, referring to a predecessor firm to JPMorgan. A lot of it is dishonest numbers. "These are the cancers that kill companies." Nobody knows when Dimon's last day as CEO will come, except to know that it is approaching. After adjusting his standard 5-year retirement answer to hint at a sooner departure, Dimon hasn't advanced that clock any further. "As great as he is, he can't do this forever," said Barclays banking analyst Jason Goldberg. — CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to sideline Exxon Mobil from Venezuela's energy market, saying he didn't like their response to his calls for oil companies to quickly reenter the South American country. You know we have so many that want it. I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday. His comments come shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is "uninvestable" in its current state. An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Exxon were down less than 1% in morning trading Monday. Speaking alongside several other American oil executives on Friday, Woods said Exxon would need to see "some pretty significant changes" if it was to reenter the country for a third time. Venezuela seized Exxon's and ConocoPhillips' assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases. Woods said the company would need to see changes to commercial frameworks, the legal system and hydrocarbon laws, alongside what he described as "durable" investment protections. "We're confident that with this administration and President Trump working hand‑in‑hand with the Venezuelan government that those changes can be put in place," Woods said. He added that Exxon was prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets. Trump has been pushing for U.S. oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela's energy sector, pledging to support them with government security assistance. The call follows an audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3 to depose Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Asked by a reporter for clarity on the type of backstops and security guarantees that would be provided to oil companies, Trump did not provide specific details. "We are going to have guarantees," Trump said. U.S. oil firms acknowledged that Venezuela, which boasts the world's largest oil reserves, represents an intriguing opportunity but some have expressed caution about rushing to reenter. Chevron is currently the only major American oil firm still operating in Venezuela. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold hit a fresh record high on Monday, extending a blistering rally as investors piled into havens amid a swirl of geopolitical and policy shocks in recent days. Spot gold advanced 2% to hit over $4,600 an ounce for the first time, before paring gains slightly, data from LSEG showed. Prices have risen around 6% this year alone so far. An investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and speculation over whether it could hasten a leadership change at the Fed has added a fresh layer of policy risk: "Especially if it results in him stepping down and then leaving the Fed earlier than scheduled and is replaced by someone more in favor of rate cuts," said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills. Federal prosecutors are examining a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters and Powell's testimony to Congress, Powell said Sunday night. The Fed Chair added that the investigation stems from President Donald Trump's long-running frustration with the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates as aggressively or as quickly as he has urged. Lower interest rates tend to lift gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding a metal that pays no yield. Latest flashpoints involving Iran and Venezuela also further catalyzed gold's appeal as a safe haven. Tensions with Iran have resurfaced after Washington signaled it is weighing options to respond to unrest in the country. "They all add to the narrative of heightened geopolitical uncertainty that led us to pick gold as one of highest conviction asset classes this year," said Rajat Bhattacharya, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered. While the U.S. action in Venezuela has appeared to reach a relatively swift resolution, the episode still highlights the persistence of geopolitical uncertainty and the risk of flare-ups across multiple regions, Bank of Singapore's Eli Lee similarly echoed. In such an environment, Lee expects gold prices to see further support amid an ongoing backdrop of geopolitical unpredictability. Beyond geopolitics, the structural case for gold remains intact, the bank added, as investors reassess portfolio allocations following years of sanctions, geopolitical fragmentation and fiscal-monetary complexity. HSBC said trading momentum could carry prices to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, even as volatility remains elevated and pullbacks may become more frequent. The London-headquartered bank attributed the rally to a combination of safe-haven demand, a weaker U.S. dollar and policy uncertainty, noting that its FX strategists expect the greenback to remain soft in 2026. "Mounting fiscal deficits in the U.S. and other nations are encouraging gold demand and may be a key factor going forward," the bank said. Central banks are also expected to remain strong buyers this year as they diversify away from the dollar, although HSBC cautioned that purchases may fall below the peaks seen between 2022 and 2024 due to high prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today Iran now appears to be next on President Donald Trump's list, after Venezuela and Greenland. What began as demonstrations over a sharp jump in inflation has evolved into nationwide, anti-government unrest. More than 500 people have been killed as Iran's government moved aggressively to suppress dissent, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Trump weighed in Friday with a Truth Social post declaring that "the United States of America will come to their rescue," referring to the protestors. White House officials have since outlined potential options for him, with briefings scheduled this week on possible responses that could include military, cyber and economic measures, according to MS Now and other media outlets. Iran is not only a major oil producer, but also wields influence over the Strait of Hormuz, a vital artery for global crude. Disruption there would almost certainly ripple through energy markets. "The complete closure of the Strait that can result in a $10 to $20 per barrel spike," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Analysts caution that Iran presents far greater risks than previous U.S. targets. "Iran is far more capable of retaliating against the U.S., especially by attacking regional energy infrastructure," said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research. "In the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," Qalibaf said, according to a Reuters report. Here's what a U.S. intervention in Iran could look like. Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation of Powell, focused on the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters, he said on Sunday evening, adding that it's the result of the Fed's refusal to cut rates as quickly as Trump has demanded. Cuba will not receive Venezuelan oil, Trump says. Separately, Trump on Friday signed an executive order aimed at blocking the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts. Closing highs for the S&P 500 and Dow. Major U.S. indexes climbed on Friday and posted a winning week. On Monday, Asia-Pacific markets were mostly higher, while oil prices ticked up and spot gold prices hit an all-time high. One sector of China's economy is starting to show spending trends, and stock analysts are picking out the names they expect to be winners. China's AI and robotics push isn't enough to kickstart its economy, leaving growth more exposed to trade risks From 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday. While Beijing has prioritized high-tech development, it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels not seen since 2009, according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump is readying for a likely intervention in Iran, as the country cracks down on protestors, with several hundreds reportedly killed and internet access cut off. The options being presented to Trump range from targeted strikes inside Iran to offensive cyber attacks, Politico also reported, citing an unnamed official familiar with the ongoing development. "If the U.S. decides it needs to act to protect personnel or assets, or to protect energy flows, then it has a range of tools, from cyber and sabotage, to drones and missile strikes from air and sea," said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research. The unrest in Iran, which started in late December over soaring prices and the collapse of Iran's currency, has intensified and morphed into wider antigovernment protests that threaten the Islamic regime. Tehran has over the weekend stepped up action against protestors, with more the 500 people killed,  according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iran has warned the U.S. and Israel against any intervention, with President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday, blaming them for fueling the unrest. "Iran is far more capable of retaliating against the U.S., especially by attacking regional energy infrastructure," Gertken said, adding that the Trump administration was "not necessarily eager to destroy the regime" unless it deteriorates "so significantly that the U.S. finds it cannot pass up the opportunity to intervene to force a change of regime." Trump's administration's playbook often "changes day by day," but his threats still carry weight as Iran has long been on his agenda and the unrest swells into the "deepest and most widespread protest" in years that the regime does not have under control, Dan Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global, told CNBC's "Access Middle East." Trump has openly backed Iranian protestors and telegraphed his interest in intervening several times on his Truth Social platform, saying that the U.S. would come to the "rescue" of Iranians if the authorities there continued to kill protesters. "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. Trump said in a social media post Saturday. The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options," Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. Trump is also considering non-kinetic measures including cyber and covert action, according to Politico, noting the U.S. President was not expected to send American forces into the country and there has been no major movement of U.S. military assets. The U.S. is looking at restoring internet communications in Iran as its leaders have cut off internet and phone services in the country. "We may get the internet going, if that's possible," Trump told reporters. Iran has reportedly jammed Musk's Starlink during the latest protests. Even if the U.S. administration considers a "symbolic" kinetic strike, it could trigger a "much broader escalation," said Danny Citrinowicz, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies. "Given the absence of leadership in the opposition, such a strike may achieve an operational success but not a strategic one," he added. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Iranian Parliament speaker, warned during a session broadcast live by state television that Israel and "all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets" if the U.S. attacks Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last Friday that Iran's government will "not back down" amid the protests. The unrest comes as the Islamic republic has been increasingly vulnerable with leaders facing mounting internal and domestic strains and a population growing angrier over a deepening economic crisis. Its official currency rial has lost half of its value over the past year, plunging to record-lows of about 1 million rials per U.S. dollar, according to LSEG data. "These protests, whatever the outcome, will further damage an already fractured legitimacy for a state system that is at the end of its life," said Sanam Vakil, director of Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. — CNBC's Dan Murphy contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Strait of Hormuz is once again back in focus as a possible U.S. intervention in Iran raises the risk of Tehran disrupting one of the world's most critical energy chokepoints. U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a range of options against Iran, according to multiple media reports on Sunday, as it cracks down on domestic protests. Industry experts cautioned that a military confrontation could provoke Iran to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that that connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea and through which nearly a third of the world's seaborne crude flows. "A disruption through the Strait of Hormuz could cause a global oil and gas crisis" especially when considering the "desperate and ill advised lengths the current Iranian regime may go to" should they find themselves increasingly backed into a corner with their power and lives at stake, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Marquee. As Iran's production and exports are far larger than Venezuela's, the global market would inevitably feel stronger ripple effects, said Muyu Xu, senior crude analyst at Kpler, adding that Chinese refiners could be forced to seek alternatives. Unlike Venezuela, any military action involving Iran carries "materially higher risks" given the volume of crude and refined product supply and transit exposure, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, who sees a 70% likelihood of selective U.S. strikes on Iran.In an extreme escalation scenario, where tankers are unable to pass or energy infrastructure is damaged, oil prices could surge by double digits, said analysts. "The fear of a closure will cause the price of oil to rise a few dollars per barrel, but it is the complete closure of the Strait that can result in a $10 to $20 per barrel spike," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. Kavonic sees an "immediate oil price spike" in the wake of any U.S. attack on Iran, but that will soften on any sign of the disruption being temporary. Most analysts stress that any catastrophic outcomes still remain low-probability events. Even in a scenario where Iran attempts a temporary disruption, such as harassing tankers or briefly blocking transit, the physical impact on supply would be limited. Kpler estimates the oil market is currently tilting toward oversupply, with roughly 2.5 million barrels per day of excess supply in January and over 3 million barrels per day in February and March. Additionally, any closure will likely be met with a show of force by the U.S. and allies to restore flows again, Kavonic said. Still, experts cautioned against drawing direct parallels between Iran and Venezuela, where the Trump administration used sanctions, seizures to exert pressure on the Venezuelan regime, before capturing President Nicolás Maduro. It would be very difficult for the U.S. to adopt a strategy toward Iran similar to Venezuela, because Iran is far from U.S. soil and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East is a lot more complex than in Latin America, Xu said. "Plus, Trump's priority right now appears to be consolidating U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere." Lipow echoed that view, saying a Venezuela-style playbook in Iran is more likely to involve sanctions and enforcement rather than military occupation or attacks on infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold hit a record above $4,600 per ounce on Monday and silver reached a fresh peak as investors piled into safe-haven assets after uncertainty deepened over a Trump administration criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Spot gold was up 2.5% at $4,620.56 per ounce, after earlier hitting a record high of $4,627.27. U.S. gold futures for February delivery gained 2.9% to $4,631.30. "Elevated uncertainty plays directly into the gold market, (and) every week we seem to have another area of uncertainty added," said Michael Haigh, global head of commodities research at Societe Generale. Gold surged more than 64% last year, its best performance since 1979, while silver logged its strongest year on record with a 146.8% gain. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has intensified pressure on the Fed, threatening to indict Chair Jerome Powell over his comments on a building renovation project, an act Powell called a "pretext" to gain control over rate cuts Trump seeks. The Trump administration is expected to interview BlackRock's Rick Rieder as a potential candidate to succeed him, Fox News reported. The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its January 27–28 meeting, after cutting them by 75 basis points last year. However, markets are still pricing in two further rate cuts later this year, boosting appetite for non-yielding assets like gold. Geopolitical tensions also remained elevated as Trump weighed potential responses to a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran, following his removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and floating the idea of acquiring Greenland. Spot silver hit an all-time high of $85.75, and was later up 6.9% at $85.437 per ounce. Gold and silver "go together", said Ned Naylor-Leyland, gold and silver fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management, but "when silver captures flow, (it) really runs because it's a smaller channel and it's more sensitive to the flows in and out".
