                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pope Leo XIV has met with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the Vatican. Machado is touring Europe and the United States after escaping Venezuela in early 2025. Pope Leo, the first American pontiff, calls for Venezuela to remain independent following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces.

Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gestures to supporters during a protest against President Nicolas Maduro the day before his inauguration for a third term, in Caracas, Venezuela, Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV met with Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado in a private audience at the Vatican on Monday, during which the Venezuelan leader asked him to intercede for the release of hundreds of political prisoners held in the Latin American country. “Today I had the blessing and honor of being able to share with His Holiness and express our gratitude for his continued support of what is happening in our country,” Machado said in a statement following the meeting. “I also conveyed to him the strength of the Venezuelan people who remain steadfast and in prayer for the freedom of Venezuela, and I asked him to intercede for all Venezuelans who remain kidnapped and disappeared,” she added. Machado also held talks with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, who was Nuncio in Venezuela from 2009 to 2013. Pope Leo has called for Venezuela to remain an independent country after U.S. forces captured former President Nicolás Maduro in his compound in Caracas and took him to New York to face federal charges of drug-trafficking. Venezuela's opposition, backed by consecutive Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S., had vowed for years to immediately replace Maduro with one of their own and restore democracy to the oil-rich country. But U.S. President Donald Trump delivered them a heavy blow by allowing Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to assume control. Meanwhile, most opposition leaders, including Machado, are in exile or prison. After winning the 2025 Nobel Prize for Peace, Machado said she'd like to give it to or share with Trump. Trump has coveted and openly campaigned for winning the Nobel Prize himself since his return to office in January 2025. “The decision is final and stands for all time,” it said in a short statement last week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This photo combination shows Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola, Oct. 10, 2024, in Anchorage, Alaska and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, Feb. 8, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington. JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola said Monday that she would challenge Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan in this year's midterm elections, vowing to shake up the establishment to make life more affordable for Alaskans. “Life is difficult here, and we know that we have to take care of each other,” Peltola said in a video announcement. Peltola, who is Yup'ik, was the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress. She won special and regular elections in 2022, defeating a field that included Republican former Gov. Peltola's time in Congress was marked by tragedy. Peltola focused on local concerns in her announcement, saying Alaska's future depends on fixing the “rigged system in D.C. that's shutting down Alaska, while politicians feather their own nests.” She said the salmon and migratory birds that once filled the freezers of Alaska Native subsistence hunters are now harder to find, forcing families who live far from the state's limited road system to rely on grocery stores for pricey staples, driven up by high transportation costs. “It's not just that politicians in D.C. don't care that we're paying $17 for a gallon of milk in rural Alaska,” she said. They're more focused on their stock portfolios than our bank accounts.” Although Democrats are hopeful about picking up seats in this year's midterms, Alaska could prove to be difficult political terrain. “Alaskans saw through her empty promises then showed her the door, and she'll lose to Dan Sullivan who fights for Alaskans every day,” RNC spokesperson Nick Poche said in a statement. “Senator Sullivan has spent years delivering real results for Alaska: historic investments in our state's health care, major funding for our Coast Guard, helping protect those who can't protect themselves and policies that are finally unleashing Alaska's energy potential,” his campaign spokesperson, Nate Adams, said in an email to The Associated Press. Alaskans deserve a senator with a proven record of getting things done, and the contrast couldn't be clearer in this race.” Peltola has long touted her ability to work across party lines, such as supporting the large Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope. She angered some Democrats in 2024 when she refused to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race won by Trump. Peltola said Alaska's Republican congressional delegation used to ignore partisanship and do what was right for the state, such as backing public media and disaster relief, and even invoked Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens. “It's about time Alaskans teach the rest of the country what Alaska First and, really, America First looks like,” Peltola said. Alaska has open primaries and ranked choice voting in general elections.</p>

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'Saturday in America' to weigh in on the fight for fairness in women's sports as the Supreme Court is set to hear cases involving transgender athletes. With the U.S. Supreme Court set to rule on two cases focused on the issue of biological males in women's sports, hundreds of prominent figures in sports and politics have publicly taken a side. At least 77 amicus briefs have been filed for the upcoming court review, some in support of the trans athlete plaintiffs and some in support of the "save women's sports" defendants. Famed athletes, coaches, U.S. lawmakers and other state and federal government officials have signed onto those briefs, declaring their allegiance in the historic legal battle. Here's a breakdown of who is on which side: (Left) Former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines speaks during a campaign rally for Republican presidential nominee former U.S. President Donald Trump at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23, 2024. Top Democrat lawmakers who signed an amicus brief to support trans athletes in an upcoming Supreme Court review include Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Sen. Alex Padilla, Sen. Adam Schiff, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Alexadria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Hakeen Jeffries, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Pete Aguilar and Rep. Jasmine Crockett. Idaho and West Virginia are among almost 30 states with laws preventing transgender students who identify as female from competing on girls' sports teams sponsored by public schools and colleges. Both trans athletes are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The justices will examine whether the landmark federal law, Title IX forbidding sex discrimination in education, applies in these inclusion cases. Idaho in 2020 became the first state to pass such restrictions with the Fairness in Women's Sports Act. "Idaho's women and girls deserve an equal playing field," said Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador, who is expected to argue the case in Tuesday's public session. "For too long, activists have worked to sideline women and girls in their own sports." Lawyers will tell the high court there are inherent physical differences between females and males, and these legislative acts would ensure those they call "male" or "boy" students cannot compete on girls' sports teams involving competitive skill or contact. But LGBTQ+ rights supporters say such laws and labels are clearly discriminatory and were never a big issue until some states sought to politicize them. Meanwhile, two West Virginia female students and their families came forward with the allegations against one of the trans plaintiffs ahead of oral arguments for the case next week. Bridgeport High School female student Adaleia Cross, who is a former track and field teammate of the trans athlete when the two were at Bridgeport Middle School, alleges the trans athlete made comments to her that constituted sexual harassment in the girls' locker room. Cross, who is one year older than the trans athlete, said she quit the track and field team at Bridgeport High School last year as a sophomore to avoid sharing a locker room again with the trans athlete once that athlete reached high school. Cross' mother, Abby, told Fox News Digital what the trans athlete allegedly said to her daughter when they shared the girls' locker room during the 2022-23 school year. Abby Cross alleged that the trans athlete made extremely graphic and vulgar sexual threats to her daughter and other girls on the team. "Our client and her mother deny these allegations and the school district investigated the allegations reported to the school by A.C. and found them to be unsubstantiated. We remain committed to defending the rights of all students under Title IX, including the right to a safe and inclusive learning environment free from harassment and discrimination," read an ACLU statement provided to Fox News Digital. "Our client has sworn under oath and under penalty of perjury in numerous cases about the events that took place between her and the male athlete. As a result of the situation, [Cross] had to step away from the sport she loved entirely and sacrifice a key element of her school experience to protect herself," read an ADF statement provided to Fox News Digital. Former Lincoln Middle School girls' track and field runner Emmy Salerno alleges the trans athlete used "intimidation tactics" against her after Salerno refused to compete against the trans athlete during an event in the 2024 spring season. "After we stepped out, it was an immediate personality change. He just wanted to stare at me, and just stare down," Salerno told Fox News Digital. Salerno said there was an incident where the trans athlete followed her while they were at a local basketball game, making intimidating stares, and Salerno was concerned the trans athlete would try to "fight" her. "At the basketball game when he just followed me everywhere, I kind of felt like, ‘Is he going to try to fight me?'"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the start of a meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, Oct. 31, 2025. BEIJING (AP) — A leader of the Canadian government is visiting China this week for the first time in nearly a decade, a bid to rebuild his country's fractured relations with the world's second-largest economy — and reduce Canada's dependence on the United States, its neighbor and until recently one of its most supportive and unswerving allies. 1 economy and long the largest trading partner for Canada by far. “We're forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner.” He will be in China until Saturday, then visit Qatar before attending the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. Trump's tariffs have pushed both Canada and China to look for opportunities to strengthen international cooperation, said Zhu Feng, the dean of the School of International Studies at China's Nanjing University. “Carney's visit does reflect the new space for further development in China-Canadian relations under the current U.S. trade protectionism,” he said. Carney has been in office less than a year, succeeding Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister for nearly a decade. Australian Premier Anthony Albanese has reset ties since his Labor Party came to power in 2022. Relations had deteriorated under the previous conservative government, leading to Chinese trade restrictions on wine, beef, coal and other Australian exports. Unwinding those restrictions took about 18 months, culminating with the lifting of a Chinese ban on Australian lobsters in late 2024. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to repair ties with China since his Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024. He is reportedly planning a visit to China, though the government has not confirmed that. The two governments have differences, with Starmer raising the case of former Hong Kong media magnate Jimmy Lai, a British citizen, in talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late 2024 in Brazil. In Canada, Trump's threats have raised questions about the country's longstanding relationship with its much more powerful neighbor. While they were imprisoned, Meng was under house arrest in Vancouver, a Canadian city home to a sizable Chinese population. All three were released under a deal reached in 2021. More recently, Canada followed the U.S. in imposing a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum from China. China, which is Canada's second-largest trading partner after the U.S., has hit back with tariffs on Canadian exports including canola, seafood and pork. An editorial in China's state-run Global Times newspaper welcomed Carney's visit as a new starting point and called on Canada to lift “unreasonable tariff restrictions” and advance more pragmatic cooperation. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that China looks forward to Carney's visit as an opportunity to “consolidate the momentum of improvement in China-Canada relations.” Carney met Xi in late October in South Korea, where both were attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. He has also tried to mend ties with India, where relations deteriorated in 2024 after the Trudeau government accused India of being involved in the 2023 killing of a Sikh activist in Canada. The fallout led to tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats, disruption of visa services, reduced consular staffing and a freeze on trade talks. Since then, both sides have restored some consular services and resumed diplomatic contacts. In November, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said the two countries would move quickly to advance a trade deal, noting the government's new foreign policy in response to Trump's trade war. Carney is also expected to visit India later this year.</p>

CHICAGO - The ex-husband of an Ohio dentist's wife, killed in a double murder, is expected in an Illinois courtroom Monday afternoon as extradition proceedings are expected to begin. Michael David McKee, 39, was arrested after allegedly killing a couple in Columbus, Ohio, police and court records show. Police responded to a home in Columbus' Weinland Park neighborhood around 10 a.m. Dec. 30 and found Spencer Tepe, 37, and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. McKee was booked at the Winnebago County Sheriff's Office in Illinois just before noon Saturday, jail records show. Court records in Ohio show Monique filed for divorce in 2017 after getting married to McKee on August 22, 2015. McKee has lived in various states, including Virginia, Nevada and Illinois, since 2020, according to public records. Ohio dentist Dr. Spencer Tepe and his wife, Monique Tepe, were shot and killed inside their home in Columbus, Ohio, on Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2025. Monique's ex-husband, Michael David McKee, right, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder. Charging documents indicate police were able to identify McKee by linking him to a car that arrived in the Tepes' neighborhood shortly before the murders and left just after the homicide. The car was then located in Rockford, Illinois, and police found evidence it belonged to McKee. Spencer and Monique Tepe pictured on their wedding day. Prior to McKee's arrest, Columbus police released surveillance video showing a "person of interest" walking in the alley near the Tepes' house in the early morning hours of Dec. 30. A man could be seen walking slowly in what appeared to be a dark coat and light-colored pants. Spencer and Monique Tepe were found dead on Dec. 30 at around 10:00 a.m., when a friend went to the couple's house and told a 911 operator that he could see a body inside. Spencer and Monique Tepe were preparing to celebrate their five-year wedding anniversary. "Our friend wasn't answering his phone. We just came here, and he appears dead. I can't get closer to see more than that." The couple was killed one month short of celebrating their five-year wedding anniversary, Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX.

The alleged assassination plots tied to Luigi Mangione and Tyler Robinson were chillingly deliberate, prosecutors say, yet both cases stumbled over the same unexpected hurdle — U.S. law doesn't offer a clear path to the top penalty when there is a political motive, but the victim doesn't come from a protected category. Mangione, 27, is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024. He allegedly wrote political messages on shell casings recovered from the scene. Months later, Robinson, 22, was accused of sniping Charlie Kirk as he spoke to a crowd at Utah Valley University in September, and, in an alleged copycat twist, also left behind casings with messages engraved in them. Thompson, 50, and Kirk, 31, were both married fathers of two. Both of their murders have an alleged political motive. Luigi Mangione, left, and Tyler Robinson, right, are both accused of separate politically motivated assassinations that targeted UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had charged Mangione with terrorism enhancements in order to justify a first-degree murder charge under state law, which could have been punished with a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge threw that charge out, and Mangione faces a second-degree murder charge, which has a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole remaining. While New York has a state-level terror charge, Utah doesn't. "Interestingly, had [Robinson] been charged in federal court, it would've been a terrorist act, committing an act of political terror — but in the state system they don't have that same statute in charge, so they brought the murder case," said Greg Rogers, a UVU professor and former FBI agent. "It wasn't that they didn't believe they could prove a terrorism case in that matter, it was just that it was gonna be charged in state court rather than federal." UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot in the back outside a Manhattan hotel in December 2024, on the morning of a planned shareholder conference. The New York judge overseeing Mangione's case "made a grievous error," he told Fox News Digital. "Terrorism statutes are, and this isn't an oversimplification, if you commit a homicide in furtherance of a political motive, which he allegedly did, that satisfies that statute." "You essentially have a confession in the terrorism case, and in the homicide case you have it on video," he said. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk speaks during Turning Point Action's The Believers Summit 2024 ahead of Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump's presentation, in West Palm Beach, Florida, on July 26, 2024. He cited the alleged journals Mangione kept, which referenced the plot and a potential motive as a condemnation of the U.S. health insurance industry — and also Mangione's fervent supporters, who have showed up to his court hearings dressed up in green as a reference to the Luigi character from "Super Mario Bros." In Utah, in order to seek the death penalty, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray's office charged Robinson with aggravated murder, alleging that he knowingly created a great risk of death to people in the crowd in addition to Kirk's slaying. Luigi Mangione shouts while officers restrain him as he arrives for his extradition hearing at Blair County Courthouse in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Dec. 10, 2024. (David Dee Delgado for Fox News Digital) But legal experts say that only a single shot was fired, which the defense is likely to use to challenge that aspect of the case. "The death penalty was essentially outlawed back in 1972 when the Supreme Court thought that it was being applied arbitrarily," said Matt Mangino, a former district attorney of Lawrence County in Pennsylvania who wrote a book on capital punishment, "The Executioner's Toll, 2010." To do that, he said, states implemented "bifurcated trials," where jurors decide on life or death after a conviction, and by creating the system of aggravating factors. While the laws vary between states, aggravators often include targeting police officers, politicians, witnesses or young children. In Idaho, the aggravator prosecutors wanted to use against Bryan Kohberger was that he killed multiple people — but he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty. Business leaders, like Thompson, or political figures who aren't office holders, like Kirk, don't meet those criteria, even if there's an alleged political motive, he said. People run after shots were fired during an appearance by Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10, 2025 in Orem, Utah. Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was speaking at his "American Comeback Tour" when he was shot in the neck and killed. Does assassination mean that you've murdered somebody for some political purpose?" "How do you define someone who doesn't fit into those specific categories that is outspoken about LGBT issues or is outspoken about immigration, how do you evaluate that?" "I mean how famous do you have to be?" Kirk was famous as a media personality and political commentator who founded Turning Point USA. Thompson was not a household name before his murder. Without a clear definition for the crime of assassination, he said, prosecutors are left stretching existing laws — and risking reversals. "I think you also open the door to the defense coming after you and saying, wait a second, why is my guy getting the death penalty under the aggravated circumstances of assassination when other people who are killed because they're politically motivated aren't getting it?" "It opens the door on both ends, both to victims' families feeling as though they are not getting justice and defendants feeling as if they are being overcharged." Mangione could still face the potential death penalty if he is convicted of pending federal charges related to Thompson's slaying.

The U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has ignited sharp debate in Washington and abroad over whether the move undermines international norms — or delivers a deliberate deterrent message to rivals like China and Russia. Critics argue that seizing the leader of a sovereign nation risks setting a dangerous precedent — one that adversaries could cite to justify their own military actions beyond their borders. "My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan," Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said in a statement. "What will we say now if Putin tries to capture Zelenskyy?" Others counter that such norms have never constrained Moscow or Beijing, and that deterrence is shaped less by legal arguments than by demonstrations of power, speed and capability. The U.S. operation to capture Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro has ignited a sharp debate in Washington and abroad: whether the show of American reach deters rivals like Russia and China or risks giving them cover to justify their own moves beyond their borders. "I don't think Putin or Xi ever doubted that power overrides sovereignty," said Pedro Garmendia, a Washington-based geopolitical risk analyst. Cuban officials acknowledged the loss of multiple military and intelligence personnel deployed in Venezuela, while Venezuelan authorities confirmed heavy casualties among elite security units. Independent estimates place the total death toll — security forces and civilians combined — at several dozen. Trump argued the level of force reflected the reality of penetrating a defended capital and preventing Maduro from escaping or rallying loyalist units. Garmendia noted that Venezuela was no marginal partner for U.S. adversaries. "Having the leader of that regime captured and taken into U.S. custody so suddenly — especially when a Chinese special envoy had just met with Maduro hours before — is frankly embarrassing to both countries." "My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan," Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said in a statement. Beyond casualties, the operation sent a second signal through its execution: speed, precision and deep preparation. U.S. special operations forces spent months rehearsing the raid, including training on a full-scale replica of Maduro's compound. CIA officers built a detailed picture of Maduro's daily routines — tracking when he slept, where he traveled, how his security rotated and which locations offered the narrowest escape routes. That intelligence allowed planners to identify a precise window when Maduro was most vulnerable. Airspace suppression, rapid insertion and coordinated ground movement unfolded in minutes, denying Venezuelan and allied forces time to respond effectively. Trump later pointed to that preparation as evidence the operation was deliberate rather than impulsive, arguing that speed and overwhelming force were essential to prevent Maduro from slipping away or turning the operation into a prolonged firefight. Former FBI counterintelligence operative Eric O'Neill said those details are likely to matter more to Beijing and Moscow than legal debates at the United Nations. "At least while Trump is in office, it's going to look a lot like deterrence to China and Russia," O'Neill said. "They didn't even get a chance to blink before Maduro was gone." O'Neill added that the execution underscored a broader message. "That sends a strong signal that the United States can find its adversaries anywhere in the world," he said, arguing rivals already inclined to violate international norms are unlikely to be emboldened by an action they lack the capability to replicate. The final deterrent signal lies in experience: the institutional ability to plan and execute complex, intelligence-driven operations built on decades of counterterrorism and special operations campaigns. U.S. officials point to the seamless integration of intelligence collection, rehearsal, logistics and kinetic force as evidence of a mature operational system that can be activated with little warning — an advantage adversaries must assume exists even when they cannot see it. The criticism comes as Beijing has intensified military pressure on Taiwan, including near-daily air incursions and large-scale exercises meant to signal its own willingness to use force. Beijing said it was "deeply shocked" by the action, with the foreign ministry condemning what it called the U.S.'s "blatant use of force against a sovereign state and its action against its president." Russia likewise denounced the U.S. operation at the United Nations as a violation of sovereignty and international law, even as it continues its war in Ukraine while rejecting international legal judgments and condemnation. For U.S. strategists, that contrast reinforces the intended message: adversaries may invoke international law rhetorically, but what shapes their calculations is demonstrated capability — especially when paired with the experience to plan, rehearse and execute without warning.

Joseph Hernandez, a Cuban immigrant and N.Y. comptroller candidate, shares his family's experience fleeing communist Cuba and discusses the country's uncertain future after Maduro's capture, emphasizing its oil dependency on Venezuela. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez declared Sunday that the island nation would defend itself "to the last drop of blood," responding to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to strike a deal with Washington. President Trump had spoken about Cuba in a Truth Social post earlier in the day, urging that "they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE." "Those who blame the Revolution for the severe economic shortages we suffer should hold their tongues out of shame. "#Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. Cuba does not aggress; it is aggressed upon by the United States for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood," he wrote in another post, according to the translation. Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel gestures during the BRICS summit second plenary session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on July 6, 2025. U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba, responded to the foreign figure's post. You don't have much time left," he declared, according to the translation of his post, also written in Spanish. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla, speaks during the Congressional Hispanic Conference press conference in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, March 25, 2025. Trump declared in a Truth Social post on Sunday, "Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE! Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last weeks U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," he warned. "I was born in Cuba & forced from home shortly after the Communist takeover. Today, I represent my community in Congress. Thank you, President Trump, first Venezuela & next is Cuba. Our hemisphere must be the hemisphere of liberty," the lawmaker wrote in a post on X. Alex Nitzberg is a writer for Fox News Digital.

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP) The Golden Globes had some predictable stuff, like “One Battle After Another” and “Adolescence” cleaning up and host Nikki Glaser making fun of the age of Leonardo DiCaprio's partners. But there were also some sweet moments, like when “Adolescence” star Erin Doherty, who played a child therapist, won the trophy for best female actor in a supporting role on television — and thanked therapists. There were some weird moments, too, like when Rose Byrne explained why her partner and fellow actor Bobby Cannavale wasn't there to see her win: He was at a reptile expo in New Jersey because the family was getting a bearded dragon. A sweet occasion was when “Pluribus” star Rhea Seehorn, onstage to accept her acting award for a TV drama, first told presenter Queen Latifah that she met her 20 years ago while she was between jobs and the rapper-actor was “so nice.” Other moments included a Golden embrace of Brazilian filmmaking, Seth Rogen having deja vu, Amy Poehler dunking on NPR and “KPop Demon Hunters” singer-songwriter Ejae encouraging viewers to keep striving. Wagner Moura won the Golden Globe for lead actor in a movie drama, becoming the second Brazilian to take home a Globes acting prize after Fernanda Torres' win last year for “I'm Still Here.” Moura in “The Secret Agent” plays a former professor forced into hiding while trying to protect his young son during Brazil's military dictatorship of the 1970s. “‘The Secret Agent' is a film about memory — or the lack of memory — and generational trauma,” Moura said in his acceptance speech. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.” Moura is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in Netflix's “Narcos,” which ran from 2015 to 2017 and earned him a Golden Globe nomination in 2016. Last year, Brazil earned its first Oscar win in the international film category for “I'm Still Here.” Seth Rogen won his first Golden Globe only months after his showbiz satire “The Studio” set an entire episode at the same awards ceremony. We just pretended to do this and now it is happening!” Rogen said, cradling his trophy. In his actual winning speech, Rogen thanked his fellow nominees, calling out “Only Murders in the Building” duo Steve Martin and Martin Short. “Good Hang with Amy Poehler” won the inaugural best podcast award and the host had a joke about her rivals at National Public Radio. I have great respect for this form,” Poehler said. Poehler's show beat out “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,” “Call Her Daddy,” “The Mel Robbins Podcast,” “SmartLess” and “Up First,” from NPR. (She also beat her ex-husband Will Arnett, part of “SmartLess.”) “Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters ” won the Globe for best original song and one of its songwriters had a lesson to others struggling to be heard. I was rejected, and disappointed that my voice wasn't good enough,” said co-singer Ejae, who also co-wrote the track with Mark Sonnenblick and Lee Hee-joon. The possibility seems remote right now, but hope is a beautiful thing,” he added.

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP) LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nikki Glaser went hard then eased up in her monologue to open Sunday's Golden Globes. “There are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” she said. She segued into mocking the recent woes at CBS News and its killing of a critical “60 Minutes” story about the Trump Administration sending immigrants to a prison in El Salvador. “The award for most editing goes to CBS News,” she said. Glaser also told the AP she was struggling to find a joke about Julia Roberts, saying she was so beloved and respected that nothing Glaser tried with her comedy club test audiences was landing. She found a way to come at it sideways. “Just like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts,” she said, and got the big laugh she was looking for. She was quickly rehired after getting strong reviews in her first outing last year. She's been kinder on the Globes, but her jokes still had some bite. She made the obligatory joke about Leonardo DiCaprio dating young women. You've won three Golden Globes and an Oscar,” she said. She then went meta and apologized for being so obvious. Like, there's nothing else, like open up!” she said, getting a bigger laugh than she did for the first joke, especially from DiCaprio himself. She focused on the lean frame of Timothée Chalamet in her inevitable joke about the nominee — and later winner — for “Marty Supreme,” calling him “the first actor in history to have to put on muscle for a movie about ping pong. “To my right are the tables for ‘Hamnet,' ‘All Her Fault' and ‘Bugonia,'” she said, “an area we're calling ‘traumatized woman alley.' We'll never find out where ‘traumatized men alley' is because they're not allowed to tell us.” Like last year when she merged “Wicked” and “Conclave” into the aborted gag song “Popeular,” she started at one point to sing a deliberately hacky song. This time she pretended to accidentally say “K-Pong Demon Hunters” before shedding her dress to show athletic wear underneath, grabbing a ping pong paddle-shaped microphone and merging “Marty Supreme” with “KPop Demon Hunters” to the tune of the latter's best original song winner “Golden.” “Marty” co-star Fran Drescher soon stepped out to cut Glaser off, saying in her famous nasal rasp, “You have to stop singing, your voice is so annoying.” But Glaser was also on the receiving end of one joke, from Judd Apatow, who told a story before presenting best director. “Nikki Glaser used to be our babysitter,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said on Sunday night that he is considering “very strong options” for a U.S. military response to Iran‘s violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters. We'll make a determination,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. Trump also revealed that Iran has reached out about negotiating a possible nuclear deal after Trump withdrew the United States from the previous one during his first term. But he stressed that the U.S. “may have to act before a meeting,” adding that the regime is “starting” to cross his red line, where he previously vowed U.S. intervention if it killed protesters. There seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed. The president added that he is receiving “hourly” reports on the situation, which is worsening. Multiple U.S.-based human rights groups have indicated that the death toll from the protests is now over 500, just two weeks after they began in late December 2025. Arrests also number in the tens of thousands. Iran has previously threatened preemptive strikes on nearby U.S. bases if Trump were to green light a military response. Trump warned on Sunday that if that were to happen, the U.S. “will hit them harder than they imagine.”</p>

Powell said it was a consequence of broader “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration. Trump has even said he should have a say in rate decisions. It shows that whoever Trump selects to replace Powell at the conclusion of his term in May will face continuing pressure from the administration to lower interest rates. It guarantees policymakers will think of the long-term ramifications of setting monetary policy – and not short-term political whims – when steering the economy. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied knowledge of the investigation, saying, “I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.” Trump and his allies have repeatedly slammed Powell over the past year for not cutting interest rates to the president's liking. The Fed in the second half of last year lowered rates three times in row, though officials have recently said they're unlikely to lower rates again for a while. Trump's pressure campaign has included a barrage of personal insults at Powell, evolving into threats to fire the Fed chair. However, Powell has maintained that Trump does not have the authority to fire him. Later in the year Trump targeted Fed Governor Lisa Cook, appointed by then-President Joe Biden. The president and his allies accused Cook of mortgage fraud. Trump cited the allegations when he fired her in August, although Cook has not been charged criminally. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments later this month on whether Trump can terminate Cook. The Fed's renovation has also been a source of ongoing controversy. Powell testified before Congress in June, saying the renovation was a collaboration with various agencies and that costs had changed over time. Trump has threatened to sue Powell over the renovation. Last month, the president said he was considering “a suit against Powell for incompetence.” Trump allies such as Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought have claimed the project was mismanaged. But the Fed says the upgrades to its decades-old buildings were necessary, including removing asbestos and upgrading electrical and ventilation systems. The federal probe comes as Trump prepares to announce his pick for Powell's replacement once his term ends in May. Trump has hinted that the next Fed chair might be National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, though he has also recently interviewed Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, and is expected to interview BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder. Trump has said he will announce his pick “early” this year. After the federal probe became public late Sunday, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a post on X that he will “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed—including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy—until this legal matter is fully resolved.” Tillis is not seeking re-election. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed that in a statement Sunday: “The Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, also criticized the move, saying in a statement: “Trump's assault on the Fed's independence continues, threatening the strength and stability of our economy.” “This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,” Schumer said in a statement. “We are stunned by this deeply disturbing development which came out of the blue after a period in which tensions between Trump and the Fed seemed to be contained,” wrote Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, in a note.
