                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sharing a collection of compelling UFO photographs capturing unexplained aerial phenomena from around the world. From glowing orbs to mysterious craft, these images spark curiosity and debate. Some show strange lights in the sky, while others capture more defined shapes that defy explanation. Take a look and decide for yourself,  are these signs of extraterrestrial activity, or can they be explained by natural phenomena? When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and debated cases: Credibility: The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and there's a documentary on YouTube detailing the children's consistent testimonies. Quotes: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Credibility: The pilot's career was ended for speaking out, adding weight to his testimony. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well." Description: Military personnel at a US Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in the forest. Credibility: Multiple military witnesses, including a base commander, provided consistent accounts. Quotes: "I was right under The Phoenix Lights, in fact I saw it mostly horizontally as I was on a hill and it was very low in the sky." Description: US Navy pilots encountered a "tic tac" shaped UFO that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability. Credibility: The incident was captured on FLIR footage and corroborated by multiple pilot testimonies. Credibility: Radar tracking and multiple military witnesses provide strong evidence. Quotes: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO." Description: Multiple witnesses in Nova Scotia, Canada, saw a large object crash into the water, followed by a military investigation. Description: A supposed crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico, which the government claimed was a weather balloon. Credibility: Numerous eyewitness testimonies and the military's initial response suggest something more than a balloon. Description: Multiple UFOs were tracked on radar and seen by pilots and ground personnel over the nation's capital. Credibility: The incident was confirmed by radar and multiple credible witnesses. While these sightings are among the most compelling, they still generate significant debate and skepticism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A home-grown, independent supernatural thriller that got a second life thanks in part to “Mystery Science Theater 3000” is about to claw its way into Mobile's Crescent Theater. Fighting Owl Films recently released a trailer for “Demon Squad: Tooth and Claw” that features plenty of Mobile scenery. “Demon Squad” is an ultra-low-budget supernatural noir filmed in Mobile: In it, Khristian Fulmer plays detective Nick Moon, who investigates a spooky threat with the help of a skeptical assistant (Erin Lilley) and a femme fatale (Leah Christine Johnson). Initially released in 2019, “Demon Squad” got an unexpected round of exposure when the makers of the long-running sci-fi franchise made it a pick for their 13th season. That meant that in summer 2022, the flick would undergo a satirical vivisection by MST3K's host characters, but also that it would be seen by a huge group of new viewers. That exposure, in turn, helped a crowdfunding effort to underwrite a sequel, with $30,000 in pledges. By spring 2024, core members of the Fighting Owl crew – including director and co-writer Thomas Smith, co-writer and actress Erin Lilley Smith, Fulmer and director of photography Kris Skoda – were at work filming “Tooth and Claw” in places like the Mobile Carnival Museum. Accompanying information says that a bloodthirsty werewolf is on the loose, but as Moon investigates the killings he uncovers a dangerous conspiracy. In a November Facebook post, Fighting Owl Films notified fans that post-production work was finished and that distribution “is being figure out.” No release plans have been revealed, but the original score has been released. In early December, Fighting Owl notified Kickstarter.com backers that they could access digital downloads. “Demon Squad: Tooth and Claw” will be shown at 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 27, at the Crescent Theater, 208 Dauphin St. Advance tickets can be ordered online and are $15, or $20.51 including fees and taxes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Von Däniken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book, “Chariots of the Gods?,” in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids. The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when, thanks to conventional science, humans were about to take their first steps on the Moon. “Chariots of the Gods?” was followed by more than two dozen similar books, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence. Public broadcaster SRF reported that Von Däniken's books had sold  almost 70 million copies in more than 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read Swiss authors. While Von Däniken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin. After leaving school in 1954, Von Däniken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars. By the time he left prison, “Chariots of the Gods?” was earning Von Däniken a fortune and a second book, “Gods from Outer Space,” was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover. “Chariots of the Gods?” was made into a film in 1970 and was a huge box-office success, especially at drive-ins in the United States. It also received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature, despite criticism of its pseudoscience and largely unsubstantiated claims about “ancient astronauts.” Throughout the 1970s, Von Däniken undertook countless field trips to Egypt, India, and above all, Latin America, whose ancient cultures held a particular fascination for the amateur archaeologist. No amount of criticism dissuaded him and his fans from believing that Earth has been visited repeatedly by beings from Outer Space, and will be again in the future. A researcher who studied fingernail growth and a group that explored whether painting zebra-like stripes on cows reduced fly bites are among the winners of this year's Ig Nobels. Even when confronted with fabricated evidence in a British television documentary — supposedly ancient pots were shown to be almost new — Von Däniken insisted that, minor discrepancies aside, his theories were essentially sound. In 1985, Von Däniken wrote “Neue Erinnerungen an die Zukunft” — “New Memories of the Future” — ostensibly to address his many critics: “I have admitted [my mistakes], but not one of the foundations of my theories has yet been brought down.” Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, Von Däniken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including “In Search of …” and “The X-Files,” which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries, as well as the long-running cable series “Ancient Aliens.” Von Däniken's last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest. Erich von Däniken is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elisabeth Skaja; a daughter, Cornelia; and two grandchildren.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chris Bledsoe has quite the story to tell. He's become a best-selling author on Amazon for his book titled "UFO of God." He's become well known in the paranormal and spiritual community. It all started for Chris in 2007, when he was on a fishing trip along the Cape Fear River with his son and some colleagues. He witnessed multiple orbs and experienced loss of time. He's been experiencing a strange phenomenon ever since. Chris Bledsoe has also been featured on News Nation episodes with Russ Coulthart, the Shawn Ryan show, and many others. It's a weekend event where attendees can learn techniques aimed at facilitating communication and connection with non-physical entities "beyond the veil." Chris will be doing skywatch all three nights of the event. Sometimes hundreds of orbs appear in the sky, often changing colors or flashing. The Contact Modalities event takes place May 1- 3rd in Devan, Wisconsin. Tickets and more information are available online at contactmodalitiesxpo.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Netflix goliath may have finally reached its conclusion, but there are still plenty of similarly addictive series out there to binge your way through The Duffer Brothers' '80s-based sci-fi epic, which made household names of its cast including Millie Bobby Brown and Natalia Dyer, came to its hotly anticipated conclusion earlier this month. While the two hour finale received mixed reviews (and has even prompted conspiracy theories that there may be a ‘secret' new episode on the way from Netflix), the powerhouse performances from its actors, in addition to the rich mystery and mythology that propelled the plot forward, has resulted in Stranger Things' end leaving a distinct and gaping hole in our bingeing schedules. While these series may not have reached the same universal heights of success as Stranger Things did, they are no less compelling – you may well find your new favourite series to spool through during these bleak winter evenings… Another series based on a comic book (written by none other than rockstar Gerard Way from emo godfathers My Chemical Romance), The Umbrella Academy is an offbeat treat for those who enjoy mind-mangling plots and glib, snappy dialogue. The series is set in an alternative universe where 43 children are born simultaneously to women who had previously shown no signs of being pregnant until their labour began. Seven are adopted by an eccentric billionaire who decides to use mould them into the ultimate superhero team after discovering they have powers. Initially a huge hit for Netflix, the first season attracted more than 45 million viewers (likely aided by its impressive cast, including Elliot Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan) – but its final season attracted more mixed reviews. Feeling increasingly abandoned by her best friend Dina, who now has a perfectly punchable jock boyfriend, and distant from her aloof mother who has started working more shifts to make ends meet, Sydney is understandably a tornado of emotions with no real outlet. That is, until her emotional turmoil spills over and manifests as telekinetic powers (comparisons to Stranger Things' Eleven are invited). While I Am Not Okay With This doesn't reach the same dark depths tonally as the earlier series of Stranger Things, nor does it feature any of the epic battles with supernatural abominations of the latter seasons, it's slightly more adult when it comes to handling difficult themes such as grief and identity. The series is sadly only a tight seven episodes – I Am Not Okay With This was tragically a victim of the pandemic, and shelved after its 2020 release due to budgeting constraints. It's a real shame; it had all the potential to be Stranger Things' natural successor, but is still well worth a watch. While Stranger Things had huge success, quickly becoming one of the world's most popular TV series (and rightly so), some criticism of the series is that its tone (particularly in the later series) becomes too childlike and Marvel-esque. In typical Lynchian style, Palmer's death is an infinitely deep mystery that only gets stranger as the series progresses, with the grief of this small town spiderwebbing beyond its picket-fence borders. Brit Marling plays Prarie Johnson, a blind young woman who returns after missing for seven years with scars on her back and her sight restored. Now calling herself ‘the OA' (which stands of ‘Original Angel', Prarie tells four high school students and a teacher that she was actually captured by a scientist and subjected to study near death experiences as a bid to study other dimensions (though, thankfully, none as terrifying as The Upside Down). While some of the lines of dialogue are cringe-inducing, The OA is a hugely ambitious and deeply fascinating premise exploring ethics, consciousness and alternative realties. That doesn't mean it should be disregarded; the series has a cult following (some of which who are still desperately campaigning for the show to be revived). Dual narratives are at the heart of this horror series that deserved far more fanfare when it was first released on Netflix in 2022. In the present-day, film archivist Dan Turner has been hired by unsettling businessman Virgil Davenport to restore some fire-damaged videotapes from 1994. Melody's story is told to the audience through Blair Witch Project-style found footage, giving Archive 81 a distinctly creepy tone. Dan, who must work from an isolated compound in order to earn his substantial fee, quickly sees parallels between himself and Melody – and quickly descends into obsession with her story. The pacy eight-part series offers viewers lashings of supernatural intrigue, complex conspiracies and plenty of jump-scares that will leave even the hardiest of hearts racing – the Mind Flayer has nothing on what lurks within Archive 81. Receiving critical praise upon its release in 2021, those who are yet to sink their teeth into Yellowjackets are set to be enthralled. The series follows the headstrong teenagers of Wiskayok High School female football team, who find themselves stranded following a plane crash in 1996. The opening scenes set Yellowjacket's brazen and ferocious tone; viewers see a wintry landscape stained with blood, a body impaled and the primal screams of girls adorning animal skins. The much-anticipated fourth and final season is set to hit screens later this year. With echoes of Stranger Things in its teenage cast and a period setting (the series is set in the 1990s and wants you to be aware of this), The Midnight Club is based in a hospice of terminally ill young people who come together at night to tell each other horror stories. It's an unusual (but perfectly watchable) combination of a Black Mirror-style anthology, and bleak teen drama.

It is a common situation: At a family party, an uncle or cousin starts talking about some wild conspiracy theory they picked up on an online chat group. Other family members roll their eyes, thinking, “Not again!” and a heated discussion commences. Psychological research has shown again and again that believing in conspiracy theories that are clearly not backed up by facts can do a lot of damage to relationships with family members and friends. This can go to the point where the person believing in conspiracy theories is simply not invited to future family meetings or parties. What is, however, largely unclear from a scientific point of view is to what extent believing in conspiracy theories can hurt the development of new relationships. For example, when online dating, posting conspiracy theories may drive away most people, but may also attract other people who share a belief in conspiracy theories. A new study entitled “Conspiracy Theories and Online Dating: It's a (Mis)match!”, just published in the scientific journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, focused on investigating the consequences of positing conspiracy theories on online dating profiles (Green and co-workers, 2026). In the first experiment (Experiment 1a and 1b), volunteers viewed online dating profiles that included beliefs supporting conspiracy theories or contradicting them, or that did not mention conspiracy theories at all (control group). The volunteers were also asked to rate the holders of the fake dating profiles across a number of psychological variables, including honesty, trustworthiness, sociability, intelligence, kindness, friendliness, respectability, and uniqueness. In Experiment 2, volunteers viewed online dating profiles that included beliefs supporting conspiracy theories that were more or less plausible or did not mention conspiracy theories at all (control group). They were shown fake profiles that included beliefs in various conspiracy theories or did not mention conspiracy theories at all. The results of Experiment 1a and 1b showed that people were less interested in dating other people who believed in conspiracy theories in comparison to people who did not believe in conspiracy theories or did not mention conspiracy theories at all. People who believed in conspiracy theories were rated as more unique, but less honest, trustworthy, sociable, intelligent, kind, friendly, and respected. In Experiment 3, analyses of volunteers' swiping behavior showed that, compared to a profile with no conspiracy theories, most profiles including conspiracy theories were less likely to be rated positively. The results of the study were clear: Across all three experiments, posting conspiracy theories in an online dating profile had a strong negative effect on dating success. Thus, it is a bad idea to post about conspiracy theories on online dating platforms. Conspiracy Theories and Online Dating: It's a (Mis)match!

Lesner Cardenas studied to become a firefighter before his disappearance in May, 2025 Police reported that following the crash, Cardenas went to his apartment on Trudie Trail in Redding. Despite efforts by the Siskiyou County Search and Rescue team, Cardenas remains missing. Brian Kyncy, whose son was friends with Cardenas, shared insights into his disappearance. Lesner Cardenas (right) studied firefighting at Shasta College. He was also a wrestler at Simpson University. Kyncy said Cardenas was on a student visa from Honduras and described him as very naive. He speculated that Cardenas may have fled due to confusion or fear of deportation after the crash. In our minds, it's one of two things. Lesner Cardenas was studying in Redding at the time of his disappearance. His friend said he was on a student visa from Honduras. Kyncy fears that Cardenas may have died on the mountain. Tragically, since Cardenas disappeared, his mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and passed away two months ago,  without knowing what happened to her son. Kyncy said he wanted Cardenas to know that he is not in trouble with the law and immigration is not looking for him. He is listed as a missing person on the California Department of Justice website. Anyone with information is urged to call the Redding Police Department at (530) 225-4200. Kelli Saam is an anchor for Action News Now and rejoined the team in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>High school can be challenging enough, never mind having to attend classes you hate in the afterlife. But if you've been on the lookout for a great new show to binge, and could do with a teen-drama-meets-supernatural combo, you'll want to check out "School Spirits" on Paramount+. Fans of Netflix's "Cobra Kai" series will recognize the main talent, Peyton List, who stars as Maddie Nears, a teen who wakes up one day as a ghost. Funny enough, she has zero recollection of how she actually died, unlike all the other students at Split River High School who have passed on. Taking matters into her own hands, Maddie begins investigating her mysterious death with the help of some fellow ghosts — and a handful of friends that haven't kicked the bucket yet. Additional cast members include Kristian Ventura, Milo Manheim, and Spencer McPherson, among other players. The series puts Peyton's acting chops on full display, as she's forced to contend with her supernatural fate. Combining drama and thriller elements with a touch of comedy, "School Spirits" is the kind of show that wears multiple genre hats and manages to get each one to fit nicely — for the most part. Delivering a positive review for Variety, critic Daniel D'Addario said, "Without losing sight of the sorrow of Maddie's story, 'School Spirits' manages to be surprisingly sparky and fun—proof positive that there are new stories to tell about the institution no one would ever want to be stuck in for their entire afterlife."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Diana Ross met with new producers to begin work on her 11th studio album, the Motown legend knew it was time for a change. She released Diana in 1980, and the album's first single, “Upside Down”, gave new life to one of pop music's biggest stars. The idea for the song began with Ross explaining to Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards that she wanted a reinvention. Blending R&B and disco, “Upside Down” transformed her solo career. And 45 years later, it delivers yet another comeback. This time, via the sci-fi Netflix series, Stranger Things. Rodgers said the title came from Ross. “She said that she just wanted to turn her whole career upside down, and that was in our notes. But we thought that it would be more powerful in a romantic setting, so we wrote ‘Upside down, boy you turn me.' I said upside down, you're turning meYou're giving love instinctivelyRound and round, you're turning me. Though Ross is smitten in “Upside Down”, she's aware her partner isn't faithful. But this is 1980, and she's not asking her partner to “think it over.” Instead, his charm and appeal are worth the price of cheating. Instinctively, you give to me the love that I needI cherish the moments with youRespectfully, I say to theeI'm aware that you're cheatingWhen no one makes me feel like you do. Ross's hit shares its name with the alternate dimension in Stranger Things. In the series, scientists at the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana, a fictional town, conduct research for the U.S. Department of Energy. But one doesn't need to experience the paranormal to feel a groove this deep. I know you got charm and appealYou always play the fieldI'm crazy to think you're all mineAs long as the sun continues to shineThere's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line.

A new analysis of data from the "Big Ear" telescope showed a peak signal density of over 250 Janskys and refined its frequency. The legendary radio signal from deep space, recorded almost 50 years ago, turned out to be significantly stronger than previously thought. A new digital analysis of 75,000 pages of archived data from the "Big Ear" telescope allowed scientists to recalculate the intensity of the burst and refine its characteristics. This is reported by Indian Defense Review, writes UNN. A research team led by Abel Mendez from the University of Puerto Rico carried out monumental work to digitize the 1977 paper printouts. Thanks to modern computational methods, it was established that the peak signal density exceeded 250 Jansky.
