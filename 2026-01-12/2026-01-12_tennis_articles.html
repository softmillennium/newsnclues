                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Belinda Bencic was named the United Cup's most valuable player, finishing with a 9-1 record and a perfect 5-0 record in singles. Swiss captain Stan Wawrinka often said it was "Belinda's World," and Bencic could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season. SYDNEY, Australia -- It all started after Switzerland's opening United Cup 3-0 win against France on Jan. 3 in Perth. Belinda Bencic had just defeated Leolia Jeanjan in singles and then secured the sweep of the French alongside Jakub Paul in mixed doubles. Asked for his initial thoughts, captain Stan Wawrinka uttered the following: Across Perth and Sydney, it was quite literally ‘Belinda's World,' as the Swiss No. Bencic finished with a 9-1 record (5-0 in singles), recorded two top 10 wins and reentered the top 10 in the PIF WTA Rankings as she guided Switzerland to their first United Cup final. She could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season ahead of next week's Australian Open. “[It's a] big confidence-booster,” Bencic said in her team's press conference. “Also super happy to be in the top 10 now. I think it's been a huge goal, maybe a huge ride after the whole comeback, to come back and prove this to myself, that it's possible. A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) Compared to a year ago, it's remarkable how quickly Bencic returned to a high-intensity level of play after her pregnancy and subsequent maternity leave. 487 and suffered a double breadstick loss to Jasmine Paolini. By year's end, after claiming her ninth and 10th WTA Tour titles in Abu Dhabi and Tokyo, she propelled to No. At the United Cup, Bencic was a dominant force, avenging that defeat to Paolini with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the then-No. “Well, [we're] living in Belinda's world again,” Wawrinka opened the post-tie press conference with a grin. “She's showing us why we're here again.” At this point, the phrase became an embodiment of the Swiss team, so much that Wawrinka even received a graphic t-shirt with a “Belinda's World” design at a team trip to Kings Park and Botanical Garden in Perth. After Wawrinka didn't wear it during Bencic's straight sets win over Solana Sierra in the quarterfinals, Bencic made it known her expectations for the captain to sport it during her singles matches in Sydney. I mean, how do you treat a gift like that," Bencic jokingly asked. I will be wearing it in Sydney when she's playing. No pressure, but now you have to keep playing that good." A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis) As Wawrinka kept is word, and Bencic delivered the two grittiest and hard-fought wins of her United Cup. The effort would not be enough to bring the title to Switzerland, which Bencic said was "bittersweet," but it rightly solidified any doubts of who the MVP trophy would be awarded to. At the trophy presentation, a selfless Bencic -- as she always is -- centered her MVP speech on congratulating Poland and thanking her Swiss compatriots. "It was something really special that we [had] together, especially because of one person, Belinda," Wawrinka said. Belinda Bencic was named the United Cup's most valuable player, finishing with a 9-1 record and a perfect 5-0 record in singles. Swiss captain Stan Wawrinka often said it was "Belinda's World," and Bencic could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season.</p>

The pressure Elina Svitolina felt to win Sunday's final at the ASB Classic came from a familiar source -- her husband, Gael Monfils. “This was very special,” the top-seeded Svitolina acknowledged after defeating No. “My husband won the title here last year. He said, 'If you don't win this year, I don't know what to say.'" Later, in a conversation with wtatennis.com, Svitolina elaborated. “Before the tournament, he told me it would be amazing if we both won the same tournament,” she said, laughing. “He was not sure if this ever happened before. It really motivated me but also [created] a little bit of pressure. For a week at least, husband and wife are both reigning champions in Auckland. 64, plays Fabian Marozsan in a first-round match. Monfils, 39, says he's playing his last season. Svitolina and Monfils were already professional tennis' power couple, but this one puts them in the history books. More than a half century ago, Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors won the 1974 Wimbledon titles. They danced at the Champions' Dinner -- but they were merely engaged at the time. On Sunday, Svitolina took the first set in 32 minutes but needed more than twice that time to emerge from the second against a determined Wang. Svitolina finished with seven aces and three double faults, winning 74 percent of her first serves. In the crucial tiebreak, her last three serves were all unreturnable. Staying tough, fighting for every single point, yeah, kept me in the match.” The ultimate difference in this WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz matchup? Svitolina saved all four of the break points she faced. This one was sweet for Svitolina, who lost the 2024 final here to Coco Gauff. This was Svitolina's third title since giving birth -- and her first outside France, following Strasbourg in 2023 and 2025 Rouen. She hasn't been ranked in the Top 10 since becoming a mother (2021) but is on the cusp again. Svitolina is one of five players aged or more, but only Jessica Pegula is older. Congratulations on winning your 19th WTA Tour title … in your mind, what was the difference today? For me, it was all about trying to find the little opportunities and to take them. You have won nine of 10 matches in Auckland ... what is it about New Zealand that agrees with your game? The conditions, of course, can be sometimes tricky. But it's for both players, and you just have to put your head down and get back to work. I love playing here because of the crowd. Doesn't matter if you play the first match or very late, they are supporting, they are into tennis and very respectful. Your daughter Skai … at three years old is she old enough to understand what her mother does for a living? To be fair, we never bring her on site. But she knows that daddy and mommy sometimes have to play tennis. It's great to see here grow up so quick. Of course, I'm very sad for those losses. It gives lots of confidence going into the final. I always try to be extremely focused on those finals. I know they can be up and down. You might not be playing your best tennis because pressure is playing a big role in it. I try to keep my calm, try to do what I can, yeah, keep fighting, find the small opportunities -- and take them. 12 … what are your goals and expectations for 2026? This is the main goal for this year because for the three seasons I had after pregnancy, three of them I didn't finish well. Two of them were because of my foot -- I had to have surgery -- then last year I was mentally drained, had no energy to continue. I think it's really important, those two aspects. I really count a lot on my fighting spirit and of course my fitness and strength. When they are good, I can challenge any player. You made the quarterfinals at the Australian Open last year at the age of 30 -- how excited are you for this year's event in Melbourne? Melbourne's conditions are a bit different, but for me, it's a great week with lots of tough matches. Just happy to leave New Zealand with the trophy. 12 in the world, Elina Svitolina credits a refreshed mental approach and the support of her husband for her flawless run to the ASB Classic trophy.</p>
