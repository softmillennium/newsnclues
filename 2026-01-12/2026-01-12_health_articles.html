                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Young adults today are digital natives-naturally fluent with devices and online platforms-so some of their most effective behavioral-health interventions will likely arrive in their pockets via text, app, or other mobile medium. Now, new research shows that such interventions for alcohol and cannabis use among young adults show potential to reduce harms, according to three reports in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. These data collected from daily or "ecological momentary assessments" can then be used in mobile-health interventions to help support behavior change and addiction prevention-as highlighted in these studies. Our motivation was to show how daily and ecological momentary assessment data can be used creatively with individuals reporting on their experiences up to several times a day over a certain time period." "Placing these three research articles together makes clear that similar data can be incorporated into different types of interventions in unique ways," adds Fairlie. In one study, Traci M. Kennedy, of the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues, studied a mobile-health intervention specifically tailored toward young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at high risk for heavy drinking. Based on their responses, participants got tailored feedback to improve self-awareness and reduce alcohol intake. In a second article, investigators led by Melissa A. Lewis of the University of Texas at Arlington describe the development of a web-based intervention-followed by text messages delivered three times a week for eight weeks-for young adults at risk for alcohol and cannabis use. Their study demonstrated that understanding people's motivations and barriers regarding substance use through their responses can help investigators tailor messages about "protective behavioral strategies" (that is, strategies to moderate use and reduce risk) to reduce harms. Participants completed multiple daily surveys over 17 days before receiving a one-time personalized feedback intervention based on their aggregated data, designed to allow them to better recognize triggers for their use. "Together, they illustrate multiple pathways to meaningful personalization and reinforce the idea that ecological momentary assessment is a flexible tool rather than a fixed approach. It was encouraging to see that adaptability across studies." Ultimately, concludes Fairlie, "There are many ways to translate daily and ecological momentary assessment data into personalized intervention content, which is important for advancing innovation while still grounding the work in strong methodology." Fairlie notes that, as this type of research progresses, we can look forward to more novel and creative digital interventions tailored to support healthier choices and behaviors among different at-risk, young-adult groups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Nature Communications, reveals how rhythmic brain waves known as alpha oscillations help us distinguish between our own body and the external world. The findings offer new insights into how the brain integrates sensory signals to create a coherent sense of bodily self. What makes you feel that your hand is yours? It might seem obvious, but the brain's ability to tell self from non-self is a complex process. Using a combination of behavioral experiments, brain recordings (EEG), brain stimulation, and computational modelling with a total of 106 participants, researchers from Karolinska Institutet investigated how the brain combines visual and tactile signals to create the feeling that a body part belongs to oneself – a phenomenon known as the sense of body ownership. We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied. Mariano D'Angelo, lead author, researcher at the Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet But when the timing was off, that feeling faded. The study found that individuals with faster alpha frequencies were more sensitive to timing differences between the seen and felt touches. They noted smaller timing differences, as if their brains operated at higher temporal resolution, resulting in a more precise sense of body ownership. In contrast, slower alpha frequencies were linked to a broader 'temporal binding window,' causing the brain to treat more asynchronous visual and tactile signals as if they occurred together. This reduced temporal precision made it harder to separate self-related sensations from external ones, weakening the distinction between body and world. To test whether alpha frequency directly causes these perceptual effects, the researchers used non-invasive electrical brain stimulation to slightly speed up or slow down participants' alpha waves. The results showed that adjusting the alpha frequency in this way also changed how precisely people experienced body ownership and how precisely they perceived visual and tactile stimuli as simultaneous. Computational models showed that alpha frequency influences how precisely the brain judges the timing of sensory signals, meaning that these brain waves regulate the temporal precision of perception and thereby help shape our sense of bodily self. "This can contribute to the development of better prosthetic limbs and more realistic virtual reality experiences." Parietal alpha frequency shapes own-body perception by modulating the temporal integration of bodily signals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A previously unknown mechanism that makes it possible for aggressive so-called triple-negative breast cancer to fine-tune its production of proteins has been discovered by researchers at Umeå University, Sweden. The discovery increases our understanding of how tumors grow and adapt, and it opens up for research into new future treatments. "We have found a critical control point that, when disturbed, can tip the balance against cancer," says Francesca Aguilo, associate professor at the Department of Molecular Biology at Umeå University and who has led the current study. All cells in the body use ribosomes, small molecular factories, to translate genetic information from RNA into proteins. Ribosomes are complex structures made up of ribosomal RNA and proteins, and they have built-in control systems that ensure that everything works as it should. When these systems are disrupted, diseases such as cancer can occur. Ribosomal RNA is rich in chemical modifications that help the ribosome function optimally. The new study shows that fibrillarin plays a key role in how ribosomes are built and which proteins are made. When fibrillarin is missing, RPS28 also disappears, leading to a mixture of different ribosome types - so-called ribosomal heterogeneity. This imbalance affects which proteins are produced and can drive the development of cancer. Cancer is not only about mutated genes, but also about how cells control the amount and type of proteins that are produced." Francesca Aguilo, Associate Professor, Department of Molecular Biology, Umeå University Although more research is needed before the results can be translated into treatments, the study points to a new direction for research on treatments; to attack cancer as a disease of misregulated protein production.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To make cancer care smoother and more effective, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has introduced a new clinical trial for people with gastrointestinal cancers, such as cancers of the stomach, colon, and esophagus. The PAGODA trial (Alliance A232402CD) will test a proactive approach to chemotherapy dose adjustments, aiming to minimize treatment interruptions and help patients complete their chemotherapy as planned. Unplanned chemotherapy interruptions can be stressful, time consuming, and may affect how well treatment works. Our trial will test a new approach that uses a clear, step-by-step plan to adjust chemotherapy doses before problems occur rather than waiting until side effects happen." Unplanned delays are also inefficient for clinical teams, resulting in unused treatment capacity at the time of the delay and duplicative future clinic visits and laboratory testing. Lastly, delays that lead to reduced chemotherapy dose-intensity can have a negative effect on cancer treatment outcomes This trial will test PAGODA, the Proactive Graduated Dose Modification Algorithm. The trial plans to enroll about 400 patients with cancer of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, stomach, small intestine, appendix, colon, rectum, and cancers of unknown primary with suspected GI origin. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: o Standard care: Doctors adjust chemotherapy doses as they normally would. o PAGODA approach: Doctors follow the algorithm to guide dose changes. Both groups receive the same chemotherapy drugs commonly used for GI cancers. "This study is about improving experience for patients and their loved ones," added Dr. Brooks. If PAGODA proves successful, it could change how we manage chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers-making care more consistent and less burdensome."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, provides insights that may help to explain this disparity. To investigate the sex difference in MM, researchers analyzed data on 850 patients with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in the Integrative Molecular And Genetic Epidemiology (IMAGE) study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Compared with female patients, male patients were more likely to have advanced (International Staging System stage III) disease at the time of diagnosis. Males were also more likely to have high myeloma load-serum monoclonal protein (an abnormal protein produced by cancerous blood cells), more organ failure (especially kidney failure), and bone damage. Men were less likely than women to have low bone mineral density, and myeloma-defining features tended to differ between the two sexes. These differences were apparent even after taking numerous factors into account-including race, age, body mass index, education, income, smoking, and alcohol use. Analyses suggested that certain chromosomal abnormalities that lead to initiation of myeloma occurring more often in younger males may help to explain some of the differences seen in this study. This research suggests that sex-specific mechanisms promote multiple myeloma pathogenesis, which may account for the excess risk seen in men. These findings may be used to improve risk stratification, diagnosis, and tailored treatments for both men and women with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma or related early precursor conditions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Research from Radboud university medical center and university hospital Bonn (UKB) in collaboration with researchers from Munich and Barcelona, shows that DNA analysis of colorectal polyps provides important additional information on the development of these polyps and colorectal cancer. The results have now been published in Gastroenterology. It is estimated that hereditary factors play a role in about 5–10% of these cases, with a higher prevalence of hereditary factors in younger patients. A large number of colorectal polyps are considered potential precursors to cancer: at least 10 polyps in people under 60 and more than 20 in those under 70. These individuals can undergo genetic testing through blood DNA analysis. In about one-quarter of cases, a genetic cause is identified. These patients and the mutation carriers among their relatives qualify for regular screenings to detect and treat colorectal cancer at an early stage. However, in the remaining three-quarter patients, no genetic cause of the disease can be uncovered, even when there is strong suspicion of hereditary risk, explains Richarda de Voer, lead researcher at Radboudumc. "For example, because they have a large number of polyps or relatives diagnosed with colorectal cancer. We wanted to know whether this could provide more information, such as how a polyp develops." Together with an international team within the Solve-RD consortium, the research groups analyzed 333 polyps from 180 individuals across Europe who had no genetic cause detected by analysis from blood-derived DNA. These polyps were mainly caused by non-hereditary mutations in the APC gene, but in at least 20% of individuals, there was APC mutational mosaicism. This means that the predisposition is not present in all body cells, but for example, restricted to cells of the large intestine. We already know for some time that this predisposition for polyps and colorectal cancer exists, but it is not yet routinely analyzed across all centers in Europe." Furthermore, this study suggests that in the development of adenomatous polyps without hereditary predisposition, APC is likely the only gene where mosaicism plays a role. "If a blood test is negative, DNA analysis of polyps is the way to detect this form of genetic predisposition. This is important because siblings of someone with this form of predisposition are not at increased risk, but their offspring may be" De Voer completes. Almost all of these showed a non-hereditary mutation in the BRAF gene. Detailed genetic analysis revealed that these polyps genetically resemble an overgrowth of normal intestinal tissue. De Voer: "We want to investigate this further, because at this point, we cannot say whether these polyps will always develop into colorectal cancer." "In particular the identification of APC mosaicism due to the implementation of a more comprehensive work-up in routine care enables not only diagnostic clarity to the patients but relieves their relatives and can exclude a risk in the majority of their children", said Aretz. In the Netherlands, about 12,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. Everyone aged 55 to 75 receives an invitation for colorectal cancer screening every two years. Participation is voluntary and helps detect cancer early. If you are unsure or have symptoms, always contact your GP.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A whole-genome sequencing approach shows early promise over current commercial methods for identifying more patients likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor cancer treatments, according to a study led by Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian investigators. The findings suggest further development of this approach is merited. In the study, published Jan. 12 in Communications Medicine, the researchers performed whole-genome sequencing analysis on hundreds of tumor samples obtained by informed consent as part of a precision medicine initiative by Weill Cornell, NewYork-Presbyterian and Illumina, Inc., a biotechnology company known for its DNA sequencing technology. They used the results to train and validate an algorithm that detects homologous recombination deficiency, a type of DNA-repair defect. Tumors with this defect are vulnerable to PARP inhibitors, which further disrupt DNA repair, causing cancer cells to accumulate DNA damage and die. Platinum-based chemotherapies, which also damage DNA, tend to work better in these cases. An initial test suggested that the algorithm is more accurate in predicting PARP-inhibitor treatment responses compared with existing methods. A comprehensive analysis of the entire genome has advantages compared with traditional, targeted detection strategies for predicting homologous recombination deficiency." Dr. Juan Miguel Mosquera, study senior author, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and director of research pathology at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine at Weill Cornell and a pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center Dr. Mosquera is also a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell. Until now, clinicians have focused primarily on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the most frequent drivers of this DNA-repair defect, to determine if patients will benefit from PARP inhibitors. These mutations can be found most frequently in patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers. However, research shows that many other gene mutations can also disrupt this repair process-and in recent years, whole-genome sequencing, which can detect these broader changes, has become affordable enough for routine use. The team used 305 samples from Weill Cornell and NewYork-Presbyterian patients with various cancers to train an algorithm that was developed by Isabl. The algorithm looks for a genome-wide variety of DNA defects that are known to be associated with homologous recombination repair deficiency. In several cases, the algorithm appeared to flag "false negative" and "false positive" predictions from the commercial method that didn't match patient outcomes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have led the first clinical trial in the world to show that cancer drug treatments can be safely and effectively personalized based on the unique DNA of a patient's tumor. The study results, published in the January 8, 2026 online edition of Journal of Clinical Oncology found that individualizing multi-drug treatments to each patient's specific tumor mutations using molecular testing can significantly enhance treatment success. Our findings demonstrate that precision oncology at the individual level is achievable. When every patient's treatment is guided by their tumor's distinctive DNA, we can treat cancer with better accuracy." The clinical trial, known as Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT), used advanced genomic sequencing to identify the genomic changes driving each person's cancer. Clinicians then developed personalized treatment plans using FDA-approved drugs, with doses carefully adjusted for each patient to precisely target those molecular alterations - the opposite of a one-size-fits-all approach. Among a cohort of 210 patients with advanced cancers that were treated, nearly 95% had distinct tumor DNA profiles - no two cancers were alike. This led to 157 different treatment regimens, including 103 new drug pairings that had never been tested together before. Importantly, those who received new drug combinations did not experience more severe side effects than patients receiving standard therapies. The study also found that starting new drug mixes at lower doses and carefully increasing them over time kept treatments safe, even with therapies that had never been used together before. "The I-PREDICT study shows what's possible when we let a patient's biology guide their treatment," said Shumei Kato, MD, associate professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and medical oncologist at UC San Diego Health. "By using biomarkers to select drugs and adjust doses, we can design combinations that precisely target the drivers of each person's cancer." "Innovative clinical trial design is a central part of what we do at Moores Cancer Center," said Diane Simeone, MD, director of Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health. "This study reflects the strength of our multi-disciplinary team-based approach, combining scientific leadership, clinical trial expertise and the infrastructure needed to bring discoveries directly to patients. Both Sicklick and Kato are members of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, which served as a key partner in supporting the clinical trial. Sicklick, who is also co-leader of the structural and functional genomics program at Moores Cancer Center, adds that this research marks a turning point for cancer treatment. "Instead of a one-size-fits-all, we're moving toward one-size-fits-one," said Sicklick. The new publication expands this work, including more patients and longer follow-up, while offering detailed guidance on how other organizations can replicate precision cancer care strategies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adding yoga to standard care for opioid use disorder (OUD) may speed up recovery from opioid withdrawal and improve nervous system regulation, results from a new randomized clinical trial suggested. Among male patients with OUD, those who received buprenorphine and completed 10 supervised yoga classes recovered from opioid withdrawal 4 days faster than those who received buprenorphine alone. Yoga was also associated with improved measures of anxiety, sleep, and pain. “These findings support integrating yoga into withdrawal protocols as a neurobiologically informed intervention addressing core regulatory processes beyond symptom management,” wrote lead investigator Pratima Murthy, MD, director of the National Institute of Mental Health and NeuroSciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, and colleagues. The opioid epidemic is currently considered a public health crisis, with 76% of US drug overdose deaths in 2023 involving opioids. While drug treatments for OUD, such as buprenorphine, help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms, they don't fully address the disruption of nervous system activity that has been linked to a greater risk for relapse, the investigators noted. For the randomized, blinded clinical trial, a total of 59 male participants (mean age, 26 years) with OUD who had mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms received treatment with buprenorphine plus yoga (n = 30) or buprenorphine alone (n = 29). Those who had undertaken yoga classes for OUD in the past 6 months were also excluded. Buprenorphine dosage was determined by each participant's psychiatrist based on the patient's withdrawal symptoms. Recovery was defined as the first day a patient's COWS score fell below 4 (indicating minimal or no withdrawal symptoms) and remained at that level. Autonomic nervous system regulation was assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. Secondary outcomes assessed were anxiety, measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; sleep latency based on participants' self-reported time to fall asleep; and pain, assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire. Investigators found that withdrawal symptoms stabilized significantly faster in the yoga group, with a median time to stabilization of 5 days compared to 9 days for the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 4.40; P < .001). There was no significant difference in total doses of buprenorphine between the groups. Limitations included the male-only sample, single-center design, and short intervention period. “By targeting parasympathetic restoration, yoga may fill a critical therapeutic gap in standard OUD care, supporting integration into withdrawal protocols as a neurobiologically informed intervention with potential economic benefits,” the investigators wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Physical exercise is one of the main recommendations for maintaining good health. However, when practiced compulsively and without control, it can become a problem: exercise addiction. An international study led by Miguel Hernández University of Elche (UMH) and the Institute for Health and Biomedical Research of Alicante (ISABIAL) has identified perfectionism and competitive sports practice as two factors most strongly associated with the risk of developing this behavior.The research, published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, analyzed more than 1,000 young adults (average age 25, 65% male), including both athletes and non-athletes. Participants completed questionnaires about exercise habits, personality traits, and motivations related to physical activity. To interpret the data, researchers applied artificial intelligence techniques capable of identifying complex patterns among psychological and behavioral variables. We found that perfectionism and certain goals linked to body image - such as losing weight or gaining muscle - predict a higher risk of exercise dependence, particularly among those involved in competitive sports." Thomas Zandonai, Ramón y Cajal Researcher, Department of Pharmacology, Pediatrics, and Organic Chemistry at UMH This pattern holds for both professional and amateur athletes, although signs of risk are already more frequent among amateurs than in those who exercise only recreationally. In contrast, the study found no significant differences between men and women.Exercise addiction shares features with other addictive behaviors but is also connected to conditions like eating disorders and compulsive exercise, which complicates diagnosis. The authors emphasize that the findings represent population-level risk models, not individual diagnoses: not all perfectionist or competitive athletes will develop dependence, but the information can help identify those who may need support to maintain a healthy relationship with exercise. "What we detect are phenotypes or risk patterns, not individual diagnoses," notes Ana María Peiró, UMH professor and coauthor. She notes that the concept of perfectionism in everyday language does not always align with what validated psychological tests measure. However, Peiró advises that "if exercising causes distress or interferes with daily life, consulting health professionals is recommended. Predictive modelling links exercise dependence to associated psychological and behavioral risk factors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at VIB and KU Leuven have identified a molecular process that allows motor neurons to maintain protein production, a process that fails in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, reveals an early weakness in neurodegeneration and highlights a potential target for future therapies. Using advanced spatial transcriptomics, scientists at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research analyzed gene expression separately in neuron cell bodies and axons in adult mice. They found that axons contain unexpectedly high levels of the molecular machinery needed to make proteins. The researchers traced the problem to Eif5a, a protein required for translation that must undergo a chemical modification called hypusination to function properly. In mutant neurons, the active form of Eif5a was specifically lost from axons, leading to reduced local protein synthesis. "We showed that local translation depends on the protein levels of Dohh, an enzyme essential for Eif5a hypusination," says Dr. Diana Piol (VIB-KU Leuven, now at the University of Padova), first author of the study, "When we supplied axons with spermidine, a naturally occurring molecule needed for this modification, they were able to restore Eif5a activity. In turn, this improved local protein production, strengthened axonal structure, and enhanced neuronal activity. "These defects in protein production start locally in axons, long before the neurons themselves degenerate," says senior author Prof. Sandrine Da Cruz (VIB-KU Leuven). This discovery was enabled by the pioneering use of spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression within neuronal subcellular compartments, highlighting the critical role of distal axon homeostasis as a promising therapeutic target. "Spermidine treatment also reduced toxicity in fruit fly models of ALS linked to both FUS and TDP-43, suggesting that this pathway may be relevant across multiple forms of the disease.Although these findings do not yet lead directly to a treatment, they identify Eif5a hypusination as a promising therapeutic target and demonstrate how spatial analysis can reveal early, compartment-specific mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease. Axonal Eif5a hypusination controls local translation and mitigates defects in FUS-ALS.
