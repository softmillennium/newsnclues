                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA (Jan. 12, 2026) – On July 2 in the nation's capital, a relatively inexperienced U.S. Women's National Team dominated FIFA's No. 8-ranked Canada at a sold-out Allstate Continental Clásico. First half goals from defensive midfielder Sam Coffey, her third of the year and fourth all-time, and midfielder Claire Hutton, the first of her international career in just her sixth cap, led the Americans to their 54th all-time win over Canada in 67 matches. Both Avery Patterson and Tara Rudd recorded their second career assists, and Yazmeen Ryan's goal was her second in as many matches. The high-energy match, played in front of more than 19,000 fans on Independence Day weekend, featured a raucous and patriotic environment, as well as a comprehensive performance on both sides of the ball against the USA's long-time regional rival. Dickey finished the night with three saves and her second straight clean sheet as a starter. The USA played the match with a roster that did not include almost all of its European-based players, with defender and U.S. captain for the match, Naomia Girma, being the exception. USA – SAM COFFEY (AVERY PATTERSON), 17th minute: Lavelle lofted a bending service into the penalty box on a direct free kick about 30 yards from goal on the left side. The ball took a bounce off a Canadien defender and then off Patterson. Coffey stepped to the free ball and from close range, delivered a low-driven strike with her right foot into the lower right side of the net for the opening goal. USA – CLAIRE HUTTON (ROSE LAVELLE), 36th minute: The second goal of the night also arrived on a set piece. On a corner kick, Lavelle drove a left-footed kick into the box from the right side. Hutton's soared to put her header on frame from just inside the edge of the six-yard box.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Soccer fans around the globe have lodged their complaints about the high prices for tickets to 2026 World Cup matches in North America this summer. However, in what may be a first, someone who will be playing in the tournament is also echoing their concerns. "It is too expensive," Weah told French outlet Le Dauphiné. "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. WORLD CUP TICKETS: How to buy them In an effort to make some reasonably priced options available, FIFA is providing a selected number of tickets to national federations of the participating countries for them to distribute to loyal fans who have previously attended their nations' matches. The "supporter entry tier" tickets − which cost $60 apiece − are extremely limited. Otherwise through FIFA's dynamic ticket pricing, the cheapest group stage games that did not involve host nations Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have ranged from $120 to $265, and from $4,185 to $8,680 for the July 19 championship match in East Rutherford, New Jersey. "Lots of real fans will miss matches." Currently on loan at Marseille from Juventus, Weah, 25, has scored seven goals and recorded five assists in 47 appearances for the U.S. men's national team.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rough Draft is a clever, curated, and concise email to help you stay up-to-date. Attendees at the Jan. 8 Leadership Perimeter Summit meeting were given an insider look at the upcoming FIFA World Cup matches in Atlanta and heard advice on how to effectively leverage the event for maximum results. Atlanta takes the global stage as one of 16 North American host cities for the FIFA World Cup semifinals starting in June, with eight matches, including five group stage games, a Round of 32 match, a Round of 16 match, and one of the tournament's semifinals. A panel moderated by Discover Dunwoody Chief Marketing and Operating Officer Mark Galvin, included Dan Corso, the executive director of the Atlanta Sports Council, David Abes of Dash Hospitality, and Sherry Jackman, the executive director of Visit Decatur. Corso said Atlanta is one of only two cities in the United States, along with Los Angeles, to have hosted both FIFA World Cup matches as well as the Olympics. FIFA officials came to Atlanta in 1994 on a similar mission, but at the time, there were no grass stadiums with enough seating to accommodate the competition, Corso said. “Eight matches were more than we expected,” Corso said. “But we just weren't quite there [to reach the 80,000-seat mandate].” “We are very conscious not to infringe on the FIFA rules, while scheduling events every day in Decatur,” she said. “We see this not as a money-maker, but an investment in our future. Decatur will kick off its 34-day celebration with a concert by Big Boi of OutKast fame, and conclude with a concert by Decatur-based Indigo Girls. Abes said he believes that his Funwoody complex of restaurants, all of which face a large courtyard equipped with a large-screen television, already has the elements in place to attract FIFA fans. “I'm very excited about the games that will be out of town, because we can capitalize on what we already have – a place that's energetic and fun,” he said. Corso said FIFA has extremely strict rules about the use of its logo and associated images. For example, during the World Cup, Mercedes-Benz stadium will be known only as Atlanta Stadium, and its logo will be covered completely. “They are very protective of their partners,” Corso said. “For example, we developed a poster using all the guidelines, but it was rejected because we had a tiny plane in the background, and it was not the colors of Qatar Airways, which is their partner.” “It's important for everyone to find a way to enjoy the games and promote their businesses, but respect the rules,” Corso said. In other business, the group awarded three graduates with the Carolyn Axt Alumni Award – Sherwin Nelson Clemons ('14), Dr. Melody Kelley ('22), and Dr. Michael Stewart ('17). Stewart, an orthodontist, serves on the Sandy Springs Board of Trustees. Get the best of Rough Draft Atlanta directly in your email inbox. You must be logged in to post a comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xabi Alonso has left Real Madrid by mutual consent following their 3-2 defeat by Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final. A statement read: “Real Madrid CF announces that, by mutual agreement between the club and Xabi Alonso, it has been decided to end his time as first team coach. “Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values ​​of our club. “Our club thanks Xabi Alonso and his entire technical team for their work and dedication during this time, and wishes them the best of luck in this new stage of their lives.” Former Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa, who played with Alonso at both Liverpool and Madrid, takes over the reins, the club has confirmed. Arbeloa is currently the manager of Real's ‘Castilla' youth side, but has been immediately promoted to replace his ex-team-mate. Another statement released on Monday read: “Real Madrid CF announces that Alvaro Arbeloa is the new first-team coach. “Alvaro Arbeloa has been the manager of Castilla since June 2025, and has spent his entire coaching career in Real Madrid's youth academy since 2020. “As a player, Arbeloa was part of Real Madrid during one of the most successful periods in its history. He wore our shirt between 2009 and 2016, making 238 official appearances. “With the Spanish national team, Álvaro Arbeloa was also part of a historic era, winning the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and two European Championships (2008 and 2012). Robert Lewandowski re-established Barca's lead, before Gonzalo Garcia cancelled that out in the 51st minute. Real were thrashed 4-0 in the semi-finals by Paris Saint-Germain at the Club World Cup, and find themselves four points adrift of Barca at the top of La Liga. Tensions have been bubbling at the Bernabeu all season, with many reporting that Alonso had a strained relationship with many key players.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA's pricing for this summer's tournament has been criticized by fans, particularly in Europe Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images Olympique de Marseille and USMNT winger Timothy Weah has said he is “disappointed” at the steep prices already seen for this summer's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, describing the tournament as out of reach for regular soccer fans. “It is too expensive,” Weah, 25, told French outlet Le Dauphiné. “I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Weah, son of 1995 Ballon d'Or winner and former Liberia president George Weah, spoke with the French outlet ahead of Tuesday's French Cup. Weah was there for the team's bizarre press conference inside the White House with President Donald Trump, later telling reporters, “I just want to play football, man.” The New York metro area will host eight World Cup matches next year, including the final, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. A lower-level ticket for the championship match was priced at $8,860 in December, nearly $2,000 more than its original price in October. Ticket prices rose after the World Cup draw last month. Prices for hotel rooms also jumped by more than 300 per cent. FIFA responded to the mounting backlash by adjusting its pricing categories to offer about 1,000 tickets per game for $60 for supporters of the two participating teams.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marseille suffered a heartbreaking penalty shoot-out loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Trophee des Champions on Thursday, having led 2-1 heading into the 95th minute. Following that match in Kuwait, Benatia spoke to reporters in the mixed zone, saying: "You'll soon see that there will be others in our place, and we'll have to give them time to work because in Marseille, you never have time." As such, there has been speculation that his time at Marseille could be nearing an end, having previously made similar hints last year. Benatia's contract at Marseille runs to 2027, which is also when De Zerbi's deal is up, and the Italian says he cannot see a scenario where he stays beyond the Moroccan's tenure. Asked about Benatia's comments ahead of Marseille's Coupe de France round-of-32 tie against Bayeux, De Zerbi said: "Benatia loves Marseille, perhaps even more than I do, since he was born and raised here. "He's the one who brought me here. The day Benatia leaves, I'll leave too. "I got here thanks to Medhi and Pablo [Longoria, Marseille president]. If one of those two is no longer here, given that they're the ones who brought me here… The day Benatia leaves, I'll leave too. But you'd have to ask him directly."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sports writers and commentators have been discussing what he could bring to the team. Reyna, who grew up in the northern Westchester County town, plays pro soccer for Borussia Monchengladbach, which is competing in the top level of Germany's Bundesliga. A number of U.S. players are in Europe's best pro leagues, trying to lock up more playing time and perform well to capture U.S. team head coach Mauricio Pochettino's attention ahead of the cup, which will pit 48 national teams against each other. Perhaps the biggest national-team shoo-in at this point is Christian Pulisic, who plays for storied A.C. Milian in Italy's Serie A and is that league's second highest goal scorer this season so far. “Borussia are a fantastic, big club," Reyna said of Monchengladbach in an August 2025 release announcing his move to the team from another German pro team, Borussia Dortmund. Alexi Lalas, a 1994 World Cup U.S. team player who is now a soccer broadcast commentator and podcaster, said in a mid-December “State of the Union” podcast that “this is rarefied air for Gio Reyna," after Reyna had started three consecutive matches at that point for Borussia Monchengladbach. “I couldn't be happier because this is, when we judge Gio Reyna, this is how we want to judge him and the context that we want to judge him in,” Lalas said on the podcast, adding: “Just starting, playing, hopefully playing well." There was no prediction as to whether Reyna may be in the cup squad. But Lalas said in the podcast at the time that Reyna, if he continues like this, "will have done everything in his power to make a case for himself" and "he is doing everything that I think we want him to do." After starting his fourth consecutive match for Monchengladbach, Reyna said in an interview shown on ESPN online that it "felt pretty good tonight, but just have to keep going now and working."</p>

She returns to her home state after a decorated professional career that has spanned the NWSL, UEFA Women's Champions League, and international football's biggest stages. “Signing Lindsey Heaps is a defining moment for Denver Summit FC,” said Denver Summit FC General Manager Curt Johnson. Denver Summit FC will play its inaugural home match of the 2026 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season at Empower Field at Mile High on Saturday, March 28 at noon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the first time in 2026, it was a packed week for American players in Europe, as leagues in Germany, the Netherlands and other nations resumed following a lengthy winter break. Across the board, it was a mixed weekend for U.S. men's national team players as well. Chris Richards played a full 90 minutes for the first time since sustaining an injury in December, but it came in Crystal Palace's historic FA Cup loss to sixth-tier side Macclesfield FC. Meanwhile, Ricardo Pepi scored his 13th goal of the season, but sustained a fractured forearm, which will sideline him for two months. To say it was a memorable weekend would be an understatement, on both the positive and negative sides. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢 𝐩𝐚𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞, Folarin Balogun a ouvert le score à la 𝟐𝟕' 🎯1️⃣-3️⃣ #USOASM pic.twitter.com/ktMkla4T12 The USMNT striker battle had quite the weekend, with Josh Sargent rumored to be moving to MLS with Toronto FC and Pepi picking up an injury that will keep him out of consideration for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal. Already the frontrunner to start for Pochettino's side at the 2026 World Cup, Balogun netted his first goal of 2026 in a 3–1 French Cup win over third-tier side, US Orléans for his eighth goal across all competitions this season. It also marked his second goal contribution of 2026, after picking up an assist against Lyon on Jan. 3. The 27-year-old and Monaco are back in action on Friday against Lorient in Ligue 1, before looking towards their next Champions League match against Real Madrid on Jan. 20, with Balogun hoping for more individual success in those matches. “I'm still looking to be a lot more decisive in those games,” he told FIFA about his Champions League hopes. I'm able to contribute with important goals that are helping us win games and help us potentially progress to the next round. If there was any team in the world that needed a big win this weekend, it was Celtic FC, after dismissing former MLS Coach of the Year Wilfried Nancy following a dismal eight-game spell. Luckily for the Scottish giants, they got just that with a 4–0 win over Dundee United, which included a standout performance at center back from American defender Auston Trusty. Trusty played the full 90 minutes and formed a strong partnership with fellow central defender Liam Scales, with the two combining for 12 defensive contributions and Trusty making 12 passes into the final third. His goal came after a smart diagonal run into the box and he did well to take a second effort after his initial shooting attempt from an awkward angle ricocheted off a defender. Outside of the goal, he had two other shots and created an additional two chances, while making three recoveries in a dominant effort from his side. The win lofted his team to 10th in the Bundesliga table as well, ahead of its next match on Wednesday against Cole Campbell's TSG Hoffenheim. The American bagged a brace in Leeds United's 4–3 loss to Newcastle United, bringing his tally to three goals in as many games; he found the back of the net in last weekend's draw with Manchester United as well. Despite his brief cameo appearance, Aaronson's USMNT stock still rose in importance, with Pepi sustaining a concerning injury in the Netherlands. While Pepi is likely to return for the World Cup, Aaronson's form gives the USMNT hope that he can fill that void in offensive production, given his versatile attacking role in manager Daniel Farke's side.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said it would invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to secure the World Cup and events marking 250 years of American independence. The money will be overseen by a new DHS office focused on quickly buying and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies. It's a big bet on high-tech tools for a department under pressure to secure those high-profile events but also aiming to meet President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown demands. The news also comes as a response to the increasing technological sophistication of drug cartels, which have used their own drones and cyberattacks to help ship narcotics and surveil US officials. “Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. The announcement comes as drug cartels are increasing their technological sophistication, having used their own drones and cyberattacks to help ship narcotics and surveil US officials. Cheap and available online, drones have been a major security concern for public safety officials for years. A Baltimore man pleaded guilty last year after flying a drone over M&T Bank Stadium in the city during the 2025 NFL playoff game between the Ravens and Steelers. Separately, a series of drone sightings in New Jersey in 2024 raised public alarm and prompted calls from lawmakers for the executive branch to get a grip on the problem. Over a million international visitors are projected to come to the US for the tournament. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, a part of DHS, last month gave $250 million to 11 states hosting World Cup matches to buy counter-drone technology. The drug cartels that the Trump administration have declared terrorist groups have embraced drones for smuggling and surveillance. The possibility of equipping drones with lethal weaponry also has experts concerned. A Mexican drug cartel hired a hacker to surveil the movements of a senior FBI official in Mexico City in 2018 or earlier, gathering information from the city's camera system that allowed the cartel to kill potential FBI informants, the Justice Department inspector general said in a report last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After losing several U.S. stars overseas in recent years, the National Women's Soccer League welcomed one back Monday. Lindsey Heaps, the national team captain, is returning stateside after four years in France, signing a four-year contract with the expansion Denver Summit. “I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with Lyon, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.” Heaps, who will turn 32 in May, has spent her entire career in France and the NWSL, signing with Paris Saint-Germain out of high school, then moving to the Portland Thorns and Lyonnes. Her return comes as the NWSL is attempting to retain U.S. standout Trinity Rodman, a highly sought free-agent forward from the Washington Spirit. It was not initially clear whether Heaps' contract falls under the new rule. Heaps' return would buck a trend of U.S. players heading abroad, a group that includes Chelsea's Naomi Girma, Catarina Macario and Alyssa Thompson; Arsenal's Emily Fox, Aston Villa's Jenna Nighswonger; PSG's Crystal Dunn; and Lyonnes' Lily Yohannes and Korbin Shrader. Also, Portland reportedly is in the process of selling U.S. midfielder Sam Coffey to Manchester City. Heaps — from Golden, Colorado, 15 miles west of Denver — will become the centerpiece of Summit, which will accompany Boston Legacy as newcomers in the 13-year-old league. Heaps has been with the national team since 2013, totaling 170 appearances and 38 goals. At Lyonnes, Heaps has scored 31 goals and been part of four league championships, plus the 2021-22 UEFA Women's Champions League trophy. “Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,” Summit Coach Nick Cushing said. Summit investors include Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin and Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. Until then, it will make its home debut March 28 at Empower Field at Mile High (the NFL stadium) before settling into a temporary venue in Centennial, a suburb south of Denver.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>adidas delivers fresh Scotland looks ahead of a long-awaited World Cup return. adidas has officially unveiled Scotland's new home shirt, and fans are buzzing with interest as the team books its place in the USA, Canada and Mexico showpiece. From Saltire-inspired home colours to bold away kit leaks, Scotland's World Cup apparel mix tradition with a modern edge. With demand for the strip spiking dramatically since qualification, here's your complete breakdown of the Scotland home and away kits, their release timelines and what they'll cost you. Replica versions of the home shirt tend to sit around £75 in key markets, with youth and kids' sizes available for lower prices through official outlets, and options to add custom lettering at checkout. While the home strip is live and selling fast, Scotland's 2026 World Cup away kit hasn't been officially released yet, but plenty of leaks have emerged to give fans a good look at what's coming. Early images circulating online show a striking ‘Trace Scarlet' (light coral) base colour paired with navy detailing and thin navy pinstripes, a fresh departure from the usual away palettes. The retro-inspired vibe, likened to Scotland's 1999 Umbro kit but through an adidas lens, has already sparked lively debate among supporters. As with other teams' away releases, pricing is expected to mirror the home shirt's structure once official figures are confirmed, with retail tags likely set according to region and retailer.

The Atlanta native co-owns Tyde Tate Kitchen in South Downtown, just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium. He and several other family members run the restaurant that sits next to Spiller Park Coffee. "We've done everything you can think of: cook, clean, somebody needs to scrub the toilet? The area carries decades of blight and concern, but it wasn't always that way, according to Jon Birdsong. Birdsong is the CEO of SoDo Atlanta, a holding company of ten city blocks, 16 acres and more than 50 historic buildings in South Downtown Atlanta. "Perception of safety is a massive challenge," Birdsong said. "It's not as well lit, there's not as many businesses, and we're doing everything we can to fix that." "These buildings have been forgotten for so long, they were even forgotten to be torn down," Birdsong said. "So now we're taking these unpolished jewels, adding a little shine to them and really turning it into a startup district wrapped around unique boutique and local retail and, of course, the most important piece, housing." Birdsong noted that many of the new housing units that would be created downtown would not necessarily come with designated parking in an attempt to save some residents costs that could go toward rent. Birdsong said there are efforts to secure the new investment in South Downtown. Atlanta Police have 24-7 patrols in the area, and the community employs Verkada security system, Undaunted robotic security system and Flock safety cameras. Sankey said the end result of using data and automation to speed up projects is that more jobs will be available sooner to those who need them. Downtown has already begun a transformation through the Centennial Yards project and other developments, such as the Signia Hilton. After opening up his family's first restaurant in West Midtown, he said he took a chance on the downtown location to pioneer a new opportunity for growth. “When you looked around this area, it was always dark, cold, and the ambience wasn't there," Bhamaraniyama said. I think that's one thing we're still fighting through, but it's getting better. Everybody needs a little jolt in the heart sometimes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It would be a controversial move due to the country's stance on LGBTQ+ rights. Qatar put together a women's national team in 2009, but as per The Guardian, they have not played an official match for 12 years. However, with the tournament set to take place in the winter, Qatar does have an advantage due to its warm winter climate. Qatar hosted the 2022 men's World Cup, but recently failed in their efforts to stage the men's Club World Cup in 2029. The Women's Club World Cup will run between January 5th and 30th in 2028. The first Club World Cup will feature 16 teams, including at least five from Europe. While FIFA has yet to determine its entry criteria, Arsenal are likely to be involved after winning the Champions League. Women's football fans expressed concerns about the tournament ahead of its introduction in 2028. Deborah Dilworth, head of women's football for the Football Supporters' Association (FSA), sent a letter to WSL chief executive Nikki Doucet and FA CEO Mark Bullingham to express “serious concerns”.
