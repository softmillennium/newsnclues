ICE's approval rating among Americans currently sits at -13-points, a recent poll revealed. 

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

More Americans support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency than at any point since it was established in 2003, new polling shows. 

According to data examined by Civiqs, 42 percent support getting rid of the agency while 50 percent oppose doing so, a split of just 8 points. This represents a major shift from a year ago, at the start of President Donald Trump's second term, when only 24 percent of Americans supported abolishing ICE and 59 percent opposed the idea, a 35-point split.

The 27-point change over the past year comes as Trump uses the agency to terrorize immigrant communities and overrun U.S. cities in the name of his mass deportation campaign, often using tactics that are not only harmful but illegal.

Polling indicates Americans are opposed to Trump's tactics on immigration, despite it once being an issue Trump viewed as popular during the 2024 presidential campaign.

According to a December AP-NORC poll, just 38 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job performance when it comes to the issue of immigration. Conversely, 60 percent disapprove of how he's performed on the issue. 

A Pew Research poll from October asked respondents their views on deportation in general. Only 36 percent said the Trump administration was deporting immigrants at a rate they described as the “right amount.” Meanwhile, 53 percent said the administration was seeking to deport immigrants at a rate that was “too much.”

More recently, in the wake of an ICE agent shooting and killing Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good last week, polling from YouGov shows that most Americans are upset with the federal agency, with a snap poll conducted on the day of her death finding 52 percent disapproving of ICE and 39 percent approving.

Additional polling from YouGov that day found that 51 percent of Americans believe the tactics used by ICE agents are too forceful, with only a quarter of respondents (27 percent) believing they are about right. 

ICE's popularity rating, now in the negatives, has reversed significantly since Trump took office, as the current -13-point approval number is a stark change from the +16-point rating the agency had before the Trump administration took power. 

As data journalist G. Elliott Morris explained, the reason for Americans' shift in opinion is simple.

“The growing backlash to ICE is a byproduct of people learning about the agency's enforcement tactics,” he recently wrote, adding:

Over the past year, the more people have seen of ICE, the more they have soured on it. The Trump administration's tactics have horrified persuadable voters and made even some Republicans uncomfortable. 

“This is what happens when an extreme president enacts an extreme agenda,” Morris elaborated, “when the consequences of that extremity are visual, visceral, and plastered across the news and social media on a daily basis.”

…We ask that you take just a second to read this message.

We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. Since his inauguration last year, we've seen frightening censorship, a right-wing takeover of the news industry, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board.

We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

We need your help to sustain the fight against authoritarianism in 2026. Please take a meaningful action in this fight: make a one-time or monthly donation to Truthout. If you have the means, please dig deep.

Leftwing leader rallies his supporters as US president accuses him of drug trafficking and threatens military action

A leftwing South American firebrand calls for his followers to rally in public squares nationwide to defend his country's sovereignty and decry verbal attacks from Donald Trump. The US president accuses the leader of personally flooding American streets with illegal drugs and imposes sanctions against him and his wife. Threats of military action are followed by a phone conversation between the two leaders.

One might imagine that this is a description of the buildup of tensions that led to the 3 January special forces raid on Caracas to capture the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, to face several criminal charges in New York.

But a similar script has been playing out in Colombia for the past year, leading to a volley of insults and threats between Trump and the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, the country's first ever leftwing leader.

Sandra Borda, a political analyst with the University of the Andes, said: “Trump has been doing to Petro the same thing that he did with Maduro, which is to link him directly as a person with drug trafficking.”

Despite the parallels, Colombia is not Venezuela, and Petro is no Maduro. While Maduro is widely believed to have stolen last year's election from the opposition, Petro's electoral win in 2022 has never been questioned. Maduro was indicted in a US federal court; Petro has no such charges against him. The deep institutional ties between Colombia and the US military and police forces are unrivalled in Latin America.

Even so, tensions between Colombia and the US reached their peak this week when Trump threatened military action against Colombia similar to the operation in Caracas and claimed Petro was a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”. In response, Petro, a former guerrilla, said: “I swore not to touch a weapon again … but for the homeland I will.”

He called on his supporters to rally across the country on Wednesday, but just as he prepared to address the crowds he was patched through to Trump, with whom he spoke for an hour. The call, which the Colombian foreign ministry characterised as a “good meeting”, seemed to defuse the escalation. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that it had been an “honour” to speak to Petro and that he had invited the Colombian president to the White House.

Cynthia Arnson, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on Colombia-US relations, said: “It's taken herculean efforts by diplomats on the Colombian and the US side to keep the relationship from imploding.”

But profound differences remain between the two leaders and the animus goes back to the first days of the second Trump administration.

Days after Trump took office in January 2025, Petro said his government would refuse to accept US military planes transporting deported Colombian citizens, demanding they be treated with “dignity and respect”. Trump shot back, imposing a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods and revoking the US visas of some government officials. After reaching an agreement on the flights, the US backed down on the tariffs.

In September, the US “decertified” Colombia for not doing enough to combat illegal drug production and trafficking, citing a sharp rise in cocaine production and blaming “the failures and incompetence of Gustavo Petro and his inner circle”. Despite the decertification, a waiver allowed US aid to continue to flow to Colombia.

A week later, during the UN general assembly, Petro stood on a New York street, megaphone in hand, addressing a pro-Palestine rally and called on American soldiers to disobey any illegal orders from their commanders. In response, the United States revoked his US visa.

In October, it placed financial sanctions on Petro, his wife, his son and the interior minister, Armando Benedetti, for what the treasury department claimed was “their involvement in the global illicit drug trade”.

While Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, there is no evidence that Petro, who was elected in 2022, is in any way involved in the business. Colombia's narcotics trade is largely controlled by illegal armed groups such as the Gulf Clan, the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) guerrilla group, the majority of whose members demobilised after a 2016 peace deal.

Petro's government has seized unprecedented amounts of cocaine – 836.8 tonnes between January and October 2025 – but these successes have been eclipsed by growing coca cultivation and potential for cocaine production, which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reportedly estimated at 3,000 tonnes in 2024, although the official numbers have not yet been made public.

When the US began bombing suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Petro accused US government officials of having “committed murder and violated our sovereignty in territorial waters”.

Drug trafficking was reportedly one of the principal issues discussed on the Petro-Trump call, with the Colombian president asking for US cooperation in combatting fighters of the ELN who often cross into Venezuela when attacked in Colombia, according to Benedetti.

Until the call between the presidents, Petro's brash demeanour had made him a lightning rod for Trump and members of his administration. The Colombian president seems to thrive on conflict, as he enjoys posting long rants on social media and giving lengthy, often rambling speeches. “The more I am attacked, the more support I get,” he once told a reporter.

Though many of Latin America's left-leaning leaders, including Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, have clashed with Trump, Petro is “in his own category”, said Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, an NGO. “This is a leader who is every day saying what he thinks about Trump and using very strong language,” he said.

Petro's rebellious nature began when he joined the M-19 urban guerrilla group at the age of 17. He ascended swiftly into the political wing of the organisation. When he was chosen to serve as his home town's ombudsman in 1981, he was already an active but covert M-19 member. He was detained by the army in 1985 for possessing weapons – which he said were planted – and subjected to four days of torture by the army. Petro claimed he had never engaged in combat.

The M-19 was of the first guerrilla groups to demobilise in 1990 and seek a role in traditional politics after peace talks. After helping draft a new constitution, Petro won a seat in congress, starting a long legislative career in which he won the most votes of any representative in 2002.

From his congressional seat, Petro presented evidence of collusion between politicians and rightwing paramilitary leaders that implicated allies of the then president, Álvaro Uribe. Many of those Petro accused were eventually convicted. Petro was elected mayor of the Colombian capital, Bogotá, in 2011 for a tumultuous four-year term during which he was briefly removed from office by the country's inspector general. After several failed bids for the presidency, he was elected to the nation's top post in 2022.

Borda said the Colombian president's assertiveness could backfire. “If Petro insists on provoking Trump, it will become more costly politically in terms of the domestic political process,” she said.

Colombia will hold legislative elections in March and the first round of a presidential vote in May. Petro, whose term ends on 7 August, is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term.

Isacson said a belligerent US stance toward Colombia could boost the leftwing candidate, Iván Cepeda. “This sort of new aggressive United States – that is a perfect issue for the left,” he said.

Reacting to the US threats of military action in the country, the rightwing candidate Paloma Valencia, of the Democratic Centre party, said on X: “Our legal and political reality is different from Venezuela's. We will beat [Petro] and his heirs with votes at the ballot boxes … without intervention from anyone.”

The animosity between Petro and Trump will probably not have disappeared with one telephone call, and Maduro spoke with Trump less than two months before his capture. But Borda said the conversation and the announced meeting in Washington was “a step in the right direction”.

Occasionally, history generates smooth changes from one era to another. More commonly, such shifts occur only gradually and untidily. Sometimes, as former Downing Street foreign policy adviser John Bew puts it in The New Statesman, history unfolds “in a series of flashes and bangs.” 

In Caracas earlier this month, US President Donald Trump's forces did this in spectacular style. In the process, the US brushed aside more of what remains of the so-called rules-based order, with which it tried to shape the West after 1945. 

The capture of former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has precedents in US policy. However, discerning a wider new pattern from the kidnapping is not easy, especially at this early stage. As our columnist Aditya Chakrabortty has argued last week, the abduction can be seen as an assertion of US power, but also as little more than a chaotic asset grab. 

HARD POWER

The US' historic allies are still struggling to understand these changes. Even more important, they are struggling to respond to them. Events such as those in Caracas raise stark questions of power. They embody the exact same reality that Trump delights in celebrating. The US is a superpower. Allies, including the UK, are not. These questions are not going to disappear. The British government should not be condemned for each hesitation. However, the hesitations cannot continue indefinitely. Britain needs a grown-up debate and a clear new course of international direction. 

In The Spectator last week, former British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson rubbed Europe's noses in it. 

“Trump has the means and the will ... and they [Europe and the UK] do not,” he said. 

In Caracas, Trump did more in a day than diplomacy has achieved in 10 years, he said. 

The issue is “Europe's growing political impotence in the world,” he said. 

The way to reclaim a seat at the table is not through “histrionics” or “fine words,” but by the collective deployment of “hard power and hard cash,” he added. 

Many would disagree with this sweeping dismissal of international rules and its insistence on transatlantic realpolitik, perhaps because of its author. However, Mandelson is not alone. Officials, advisers, academics and commentators of every stripe are also trying to make larger sense of the US' transformation from necessary power to rogue state. 

DEBATE NEEDED

The arguments of Bew, adviser to four British prime ministers from Boris Johnson to Keir Starmer, are important. In his view, Caracas marks three things: 

First, an increased US willingness to use executive power for swift military action. 

Second, a further assertion of a US mercantilism that insists on US control of oil, gas and minerals. 

Third, at least as promoted by the US Department of State, a turn to a hemispheric approach, implying perhaps that China and Russia would be given freer rein in other regions. 

We can, should and do regret these emerging shifts. However, as Bew said, while we mourn the disintegration of the rules-based order and decry the mercantilism dominating the West's most dynamic economy, the old world and its assumptions are not coming back any time soon. Countries such as Britain have to decide what economic and technological adaptations they should make in this new world to protect their interests and people. No one can pretend that is easy, but it is a debate that involves us all, with implications that would affect us all, and therefore one in which all must have a voice.



                                                                                Jan. 1 marks a decade since China repealed its one-child policy. Just 10 days before, Peng Peiyun (彭珮雲), who long oversaw the often-brutal enforcement of China's family-planning rules, died at the age of 96, having never been held accountable for her actions. Obituaries praised Peng for being “reform-minded,” even though, in practice, she only perpetuated an utterly inhumane policy, whose consequences have barely begun to materialize.
It was Vice Premier Chen Muhua (陳慕華) who first proposed the one-child policy in 1979, with the endorsement of China's then-top leaders, Chen Yun (陳雲) and Deng Xiaoping (鄧小平), as a means of avoiding the                                    



                                                                                The immediate response in Taiwan to the extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the US over the weekend was to say that it was an example of violence by a major power against a smaller nation and that, as such, it gave Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) carte blanche to invade Taiwan. That assessment is vastly oversimplistic and, on more sober reflection, likely incorrect.
Generally speaking, there are three basic interpretations from commentators in Taiwan.
The first is that the US is no longer interested in what is happening beyond its own backyard, and no longer preoccupied with regions in other                                    



                                                                                A recent piece of international news has drawn surprisingly little attention, yet it deserves far closer scrutiny. German industrial heavyweight Siemens Mobility has reportedly outmaneuvered long-entrenched Chinese competitors in Southeast Asian infrastructure to secure a strategic partnership with Vietnam's largest private conglomerate, Vingroup. 
The agreement positions Siemens to participate in the construction of a high-speed rail link between Hanoi and Ha Long Bay. German media were blunt in their assessment: This was not merely a commercial win, but has symbolic significance in “reshaping geopolitical influence.”
At first glance, this might look like a routine outcome of corporate bidding. However, placed in                                    



                                                                                The last foreign delegation Nicolas Maduro met before he went to bed Friday night (January 2) was led by China's top Latin America diplomat. “I had a pleasant meeting with Qiu Xiaoqi (邱小琪), Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping (習近平),” Venezuela's soon-to-be ex-president tweeted on Telegram, “and we reaffirmed our commitment to the strategic relationship that is progressing and strengthening in various areas for building a multipolar world of development and peace.”
Judging by how minutely the Central Intelligence Agency was monitoring Maduro's every move on Friday, President Trump himself was certainly aware of Maduro's felicitations to his Chinese guest. Just

Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine entered its  1,418th day on Jan. 11, the same number of days that the Soviet Union fought Nazi Germany during World War II, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address. 

Zelensky compared Russia's tactics in Ukraine to those of the Nazis, saying Moscow is replicating 20th-century fascism. 

"Russia's large-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for as long as Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union," the president said. 

"Today marks the 1,418th day of Russia's war against Ukraine. They wanted to repeat and did repeat the mockery of people — repeated fascism, repeated almost all the worst things that happened in the 20th century."

Despite Russia's years-long campaign of aggression, the Kremlin has failed to achieve its military goals, Zelensky said. 

"But still, the Russians are trying to capture the same Donbas as almost four years ago," he pointed out. 

"They want to lie again that they have taken Kupiansk, are dying endlessly in the fields of Zaporizhzhia, and are still fighting against a united Ukraine. ...This says a lot about the system (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has built."

According to the latest report by the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, Russia has lost 1,220,000 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. Russia has also lost over 35,000 artillery systems, 11,500 tanks, 430 aircraft, and 28 ships, according to the General Staff.

Zelensky called on the U.S., Europe, and other allies to combine forces to continue pushing back against the Russian threat. 

"Every day of war is a reminder that the world cannot protect itself from madmen," he said. 

Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the Soviet Union, on June 22, 1941. The ensuing vast and deadly land war — sometimes referred to as the Eastern Front or the Great Patriotic War — lasted approximately 1,418 days, until Germany's surrender on May 9, 1945. 

While Ukrainian officials have been working closely with U.S. representatives in recent weeks on a draft peace agreement including postwar security guarantees, Russia has consistently refused to budge on its maximalist aims. 

Zelensky said on Jan. 4 that Ukraine is actively pursuing diplomacy, but is prepared to continue fighting if the peace deal fails and is drawing up plans for ongoing defense.

The move comes as London looks for stronger tools to disrupt illicit oil shipments that help fund Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as sanctioned exports linked to Iran and Venezuela.



"Ensuring that people can keep warm, cook food, and live reasonably normal lives is vital in enabling them to persevere in this war — a war that they are fighting on behalf of us all," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.



Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the energy supply situation in the region is "extremely dire," noting that the "energy capacity losses are reaching practically catastrophic scale."

The full-scale war in Ukraine entered its 1,418th day on Jan. 11, matching the length of Nazi Germany's fight against the Soviet Union during World War II. Russia has "repeated almost all the worst things that happened in the 20th century," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

Emergency services arrived at the scene to extinguish a fire following an alleged attack, according to local residents.

"The wet dreams of British perverts," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

Russian forces struck an ambulance in the town of Semenivka in Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 11, injuring two medical workers, a local official reported.

Russia launched a wave of drones towards Kyiv overnight on Jan. 12, striking a building within the city, local officials reported.

Electricity was fully restored across Zaporizhzhia Oblast by the morning, the regional grid operator Zaporizhzhiaoblenergo said on Jan. 11.

The U.K. has launched Project Nightfall, a competition to rapidly develop new long-range ballistic missiles for Ukraine. The missiles will be able to travel 500 km (310 miles) and come equipped with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. 



The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced.

Party aims to turn tables after struggling to deal with criticisms about inflation during Biden presidency

In their quest to undo Donald Trump's grip on voters, Democrats have staked their hopes on one word above all others: affordability.

It has become a staple of press conferences, a priority of candidates and a subject of legislation ahead of the November midterm elections. When Democrats don't like something that Trump does – a frequent occurrence – their counter-argument is that Americans would have been better off if the president instead concentrated on making life less expensive.

“Democrats in the House and Senate [are] focusing on lowering your costs, dealing with affordability. Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are focused on spending treasure and, God forbid, lives on military adventurism overseas,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week, just before the chamber voted to advance a resolution halting further attacks on Venezuela without congressional permission.

It's a turning of the tables for Democrats, who spent much of Joe Biden's presidency struggling to respond as a historic wave of pandemic-related inflation rippled through the US economy and sent his presidency to a desultory end after a single term.

Trump returned to the White House after a campaign spent insisting that he could lower prices on “day one”. The promise was widely viewed as an economic impossibility, and now the chickens are coming home to roost for the president, with Democrats the likely beneficiaries.

“It's a weakness for Republicans, because Republicans did say, hey, look, man, you put us in charge, and we're going to make this better, and prices are going to go down. And, of course, they haven't,” said Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

“That's an Achilles heel, and Democrats are well-served to take advantage of it.”

The latest indication of the GOP's jitters arrived on Thursday, when 17 House Republicans broke with their party's leaders and joined Democrats to pass a three-year reinstatement of premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans.

It was a turnaround from October, when Democrats sparked a record-long government shutdown by refusing to vote for funding bills unless the subsidies were extended, noting that people who purchase insurance through the ACA exchanges would see significant price increases without the aid.

The resistance eventually broke, but Republican House speaker Mike Johnson then announced he would not allow any legislation reinstating the credits for any length of time to come to the floor. Moderate Republicans then circumvented him to force a vote on the three-year extension – which was the Democrats' preferred option.

“It left us with two options - either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that's why I proceeded down the path that I did,” Republican congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the main players in the revolt, said in an interview with NPR.

While the bill is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate without changes, Democratic House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries hailed its approval as a sign the party's strategy is working. “Democrats in the minority, governing as if we're in the majority, because we believe that we have to get things done for the American people in the midst of this affordability crisis, which is not a hoax,” he said after the vote.

The last part has become a staple line for Jeffries, after Trump dismissed affordability concerns as a “hoax” at a Pennsylvania rally in December.

Yet the data underscores why Americans remain worried about their livelihoods. While inflation is today nowhere near as high as the more than 9% peak hit in mid-2022 during Biden's presidency, prices continue to grow above the target set by the inflation-fighting Federal Reserve, rising at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, according to the latest consumer price index data.

A NPR/PBS News/Marist poll published in December showed that public approval of Trump's handling of the economy has dropped to 36%, the lowest level since the survey began asking the question.

Schumer doubled down at his recent press conference, promising that “Democrats are going to make healthcare and other high costs, the high cost of living, the No 1 issue for all of 2026”.

They are set to be joined in the campaign by outside groups that have already spent big to put the issue on voters' radar. Leor Tal, campaign director of non-profit Unrig Our Economy, said the group had spent $10m last year encouraging constituents to contact Republican lawmakers and tell them “to stop driving up costs on everything from hamburgers to healthcare to holiday gifts”.

“One vote won't undo all they've done to make life more expensive for everyday Americans, like the historic healthcare cuts they have already made. But it's safe to say they have heard their constituents' complaints,” she said.

Republicans, by contrast, have banked that their political fortunes will reverse during the upcoming tax season, thanks to policies enacted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last summer, which they have now rebranded as the “Working Families Tax Cut”.

“Those provisions will hit American households and wallets, and you're going to see all boats begin to rise,” Johnson said this week.

“All American families are going to receive the largest tax refund they ever have, and that all begins very soon here.”

Republicans are otherwise sticking to what Hetherington described as a familiar playbook, by seeking to divert voters' attention elsewhere, such as to Trump's successful raid on Venezuela, or his allegations of widespread fraud in childcare spending.

Many in the party have also tried to argue that the increase in prices, which intensified as the economy recovered from Covid, is the fault of Biden, a strategy Hetherington said was unlikely to work.

“The political science would suggest that whoever happens to be in charge, whether they are responsible for the inflation or not, they tend to get punished for it,” he said.

“I don't know how nobody came up with the term affordability before, but it really seems to resonate with people. It doesn't seem to be getting old.”

            Hot Stocks 





            Last January, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was eager to have an ally in the White House to go after foreign regulations “pushing” American tech firms “to censor more” content.
    


            That was days before Donald Trump's inauguration, and the president has been quite willing to take up that mantle. It's led to an escalating stand-off between the United States and European Union that could increasingly weigh on their relationship.
    


            The president has pushed the European Union and other foreign governments to pull back on regulating US tech firms, while also promoting fewer guardrails domestically. His administration intensified those efforts last month by threatening to penalize European tech firms and seeking to block prominent tech safety researchers and a regulator from entering the United States.
    


            The growing tensions are rooted in a fundamental disagreement over the regulation of tech companies. Regulators in Europe, a global leader in tech-related legislation, believe some guardrails promote online safety, free speech and industry competition. The United States has taken a largely hands-off approach.
    


            Republicans, now controlling the US government, have in recent years framed content moderation efforts as “censorship.” And US tech companies — chafing at having to comply with new EU requirements or face fines — may now be seizing an opportunity to push back.
    


            It's a conflict that could put Silicon Valley in the crosshairs of wider US-EU trade negotiations this year, especially as the Trump administration views unfettered advancement in artificial intelligence as crucial for the economy and national security.
    


            “There's kind of a collision… between the Trump administration's complaints about censorship and the desire of Big Tech firms to, in some cases, scrap the digital legislation from the EU entirely,” said Lindsay Gorman, managing director of the technology program at the German Marshall Fund policy organization. “We could be on an increased collision course because EU officials have said that they're not going to be bulldozed.”
    


            Here's what we know.
    


            The US-EU fight over regulating tech dates back to Trump's first administration. American officials sharply criticized the EU's General Data Protection Regulation after it went into effect in 2018. US tech companies had also lobbied against the law.
    


            EU antitrust actions against American tech firms also prompted discrimination claims, which European officials denied.
    


            In 2023 and 2024, respectively, Europe's Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) went into effect. The laws imposed sweeping new rules around social media moderation, targeted advertising and interoperability between major platforms, as well as costly fines for tech giants that violated the laws.
    


Trump lays bare his contempt for Europe in blistering new national security plan



            Experts note that the laws were in some ways intended to make life easier for the tech companies, preventing them from having to comply with different laws from the EU's 27 member states. (Trump has encouraged a similar approach in the United States regarding AI regulation.)
    


            As Trump prepared for his second term, tech CEOs including Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook sought to curry favor with him and raised concerns about European regulations.
    


            Vice President JD Vance in February used his speech at the Munich Security Conference to rail against European “censorship.” The same month, Trump signed a memo saying his administration would investigate and consider imposing tariffs on foreign governments that tax US tech companies or impose policies that “incentivize … censorship.”
    


            For its part, European officials have pushed back on the notion that their rules unfairly target American firms.
    


            “As we have made clear many times, our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,” Thomas Regnier, the European Commission's spokesperson for tech sovereignty, said in a statement to CNN. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination.”
    


            The EU fined Apple and Meta a combined €700 million ($797 million) in April, the first enforcement action under the DMA. Meta criticized the move as a “tariff” designed to “handicap successful American businesses,” and Apple said the EU was “unfairly targeting” the company.
    


            In September, Trump threatened the EU with a tariff investigation after it fined Google $3.45 billion for violating its antitrust laws. Trump called the fine “very unfair,” adding that the money “would otherwise go to American Investments and Jobs.”
    


            The Commission in December fined X around $140 million, saying the “deceptive design” of its blue verification checkmark and other measures violated the DSA. X owner Elon Musk called the fine “crazy” and urged a “response not just to the EU, but also to the individuals who took this action against me.” Several US lawmakers also bashed the fine, including Vance, who said on X that “the EU should be supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.”
    


            Later that month, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer threatened European tech companies including SAP, Spotify and Mistral with “fees or restrictions” if the EU didn't back down on regulatory actions against American firms.
    


            “If the EU and EU Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” Greer said in an X post.
    


            Days later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced visa sanctions against Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner involved in the DSA, as well as four employees of organizations that combat online disinformation and hate, for alleged censorship.
    


            Regnier condemned the travel restrictions and said the European Commission denies that its laws “amount to any form of censorship,” adding that the rules “ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.” Breton responded in an X post noting the DSA's broad support among European lawmakers and saying: “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn't where you think it is.'”
    


            The Trump administration's claims of “censorship” by Europe comes even as the president himself has taken actions that could chill free speech domestically, such as targeting journalists and seeking to deport non-citizen professors and students who have spoken in support of Palestinians.
    


            The fight could become a linchpin in broader negotiations this year.
    


            The US and EU are continuing hammer out and implement the details of a trade deal reached in July. The agreement included a commitment to address “non-tariff barriers” to trade, which Gorman said “was kind of a wink and a nod to the digital regulations, but it didn't get resolved.”
    


            “It seems like the tariffs conversation has somewhat come to a conclusion … but the technology issues, and in particular the enforcement of the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, are the unfinished business of the US-EU trade deal,” she added.
    


State Department imposes sanctions on former EU official, disinformation group leaders for ‘censorship'



            The EU does not appear to be backing down. The Commission announced new investigations in December into potential anticompetitive behavior by both Meta and Google.
    


            EU lawmakers have proposed a digital omnibus aiming to simplify — which could amount to scaling back — some of its tech rules to make Europe more competitive in tech and AI. But not all officials agree that regulation hurts innovation. The proposal also didn't seem to satisfy American officials; after it was introduced, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for further rules rollbacks in exchange for lower tariffs.
    


            The conflict underscores the need for Europe to build its own technologies and reduce its reliance on Silicon Valley, said Giorgos Verdi, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
    


            “Could the US use its dominance over AI chips, its dominance over cloud in Europe, its dominance over AI systems in order to exert more pressure?” Verdi said. “In order to build more resilience for Europe … there is a geopolitical case for European innovations to emerge.”

Picture is as murky as a barrel of oil, with US companies in 2026 expecting their first production drop in four years

US shale-oil producers were already contending with oil prices at four-year lows. News that they may soon face a significant competitor in their back yard probably wasn't how frackers wanted to greet 2026.

The US capture of Venezuela's President Nicolaá Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, hit the share prices of independent shale-oil producers, such as Diamondback Energy and Devon Energy, last week.

Over the last 20 years, the US fracking industry has built itself into the main driver of domestic oil production: it accounted for 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023. With average production levels of 13.6m barrels a day (BPD), the US is the world's largest crude-oil producer.

It will take years for Venezuela's production to ramp up, limiting the near-term impact on US suppliers, but Donald Trump has made clear he wants firms to move quickly.

The development comes at a difficult time for the industry, which is pressured by a global glut of oil. Higher supplies come from an unwinding of 2023 voluntary production cuts by some members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and growth in non-Opec countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China and Guyana.

Oil prices have been trending down since passing $100 in early 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. With supply overwhelming demand, nearby Nymex West Texas Intermediate crude-oil futures prices – agreed rates for assets to be bought at a later date – are trading at about $56 a barrel. Longer-dated futures contracts for the US oil benchmark forecast prices range between $56 and $57 a barrel until June 2028.

US fracking is expensive, so the industry will not welcome more price pressures. Potentially, this is a threat to Republicans who have championed fracking in swing states like Pennsylvania, where the shale revolution has been an economic boon.

For now, the picture is as murky as a barrel of oil.

Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at US Bank Asset Management Group, says any impact Venezuela has on US producers is a matter of timing. The US oil market is currently “acting like a reasonably supplied market with expectations that supply continues to increase, which keeps dampening those oil prices”, he said.

Whether Venezuelan production resumes as projected is debatable, but one saving grace for US producers is that Venezuelan oil is heavy, and requires more processing than the light oil the US pumps. That makes Venezuelan petroleum less of a competitive threat to the US, since refiners globally can use light oil, says Peter McNally, global head of sector analysts at Third Bridge. Still, Venezuela's potential output adds to the growing global glut.

The economics of US oil production, when oil is about $57 a barrel, are troublesome in the longer term. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that break-even prices for existing wells, in both shale and non-shale production, are between $26 and $45 a barrel, but that break-even rises to between $61 and $70 for any newly drilled wells.

Despite sluggish returns, the shale-oil industry is in better shape than in 2020. Producers' balance sheets were already laden with debt when prices briefly turned negative during the Covid lockdown, says Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.

Many smaller producers went bankrupt. Those that survived started to focus on generating cashflow and return on invested capital, rather than hiking production. That capital discipline means companies are in better fiscal shape to weather lower oil prices, and are likely to keep a close eye on the bottom line, Thummel says. “What that means is they're going to cut back on spending and [rein in] production.”

The difficult times in 2020 ushered in consolidation, and the industry became dominated by oil majors like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rather than the independent producers that started up during the initial hydraulic fracturing oil boom in the early aughts. Sustained lower prices could spell problems for the numerous small, private drillers, especially if Venezuela's oil comes online, says Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert Financial.

“The overall long-term implication is it's definitely negative for the … run-of-the-mill frackers, because you're going to see more supply, and that supply is clearly going to put pressure on the fracking industry,” he says.

Companies are likely to keep output flat in 2026. The Energy Information Administration, the US Department of Energy's statistical arm, estimates 2026 production to average 13.5m BPD, down slightly from 2025's 13.6m-barrel record output – the first production drop in four years.

Stewart Glickman, director of fundamental research at CFRA Research, says he's slightly concerned oil production in the US mainland, referred to as the Lower 48, may be peaking. Capital expenditures are down about 40% from 2014's peak, as companies relied on technological improvements to increase output. Since shale-oil production declines quicker than traditional drilling, Glickman says the US might be closer to start seeing overall production falling.

“Instead of, 13.5 [million BPD] becoming 14, becoming 14.5, maybe we start to get a little bit of cresting and slight decline, because the lack of reinvestment is eventually going to catch up with you,” he says. “There's a lot of moving parts, and now you add Venezuela on top it, and the longer-term risk.”

MOSCOW, January 12. /TASS/. Ukraine seeks to stall talks by staging provocations against Russia; Donald Trump takes control of Venezuela; and more US strikes on Iran may spark a regional war. These stories topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Kiev carried out a whole series of terrorist attacks in the past two weeks, including a strike on civilians in the Kherson Region and an attempted attack on one of the Russian president's state residences. The Ukrainians' goal clearly is to impact the negotiation process by provoking Moscow to violate international law, Rodion Miroshnik, the Russian Foreign Ministry's ambassador-at-large, told Izvestia.

On January 1, the Ukrainian armed forces conducted a deliberate strike on a hotel and a cafe in the Kherson Region, where 29 people were killed. Earlier, on December 29, they attempted a drone attack on Vladimir Putin's state residence on Lake Valdai. The Ukrainians' actions did not go unanswered, with Russia once again using its Oreshnik intermediate-range missile system, this time to hit sites in the Lvov Region.

Miroshnik believes that Kiev's main objective is "to impact the negotiation process by trying to provoke Russia to act inappropriately, preferably in an emotional manner, and violate international humanitarian law, which Kiev could portray in a negative light in the US eyes" According to the Russian diplomat, these activities have definitely been agreed on with Kiev's European partners and accomplices.

"By taking such action, Kiev primarily aims to demonstrate to its Western partners that Ukraine is not the loser as it maintains resistance. So there is no reason to say that Kiev is ready to accept the terms of a peace agreement," political scientist Denis Denisov noted.

It seems that the resumption of direct bilateral talks with Russia either on the political or at least a technical level is not under consideration, Valdai International Discussion Club expert Andrey Kortunov pointed out. Had it been so, "we would probably have seen some steps aimed at easing the conflict," he explained.

"As far as I can tell, the Ukrainian leadership expects that it will be able to put pressure on Russia through the United States, that is, the Donald Trump administration, by claiming that the escalation is the result of Russia's actions, blaming Moscow for continued hostilities, and trying to persuade the US to impose another package of sanctions," Kortunov emphasized.

 

US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that "secures Venezuelan oil revenue for the good of the American and Venezuelan people." He also held a meeting with the executives of the biggest US oil companies, urging them to step up investment in Venezuela's energy sector, Vedomosti reports.

Trump wants to go down in history as a great president, which is the main objective that needs to be understood, particularly when analyzing the recent US operation against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, said Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. Besides, in the expert's view, Trump's sudden foreign policy moves are also directly linked to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. "If there are no foreign policy shocks, there may be some domestic ones, which could affect a significant part of the American ruling class," the expert observed.

The region may face greater polarization following Maduro's arrest by the Americans, Dmitry Rozental, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Latin American Studies, said.

According to him, the countries of the region will in one way or another focus on cooperation with the United States, while bearing in mind the need to diversify their foreign policy. China, Russia, the European Union, and India remain quite active in Latin America. "China's positions are still very strong, even though Trump has been able to push it back a bit. Beijing is the main trading partner for a number of countries," Rozental pointed out.

Meanwhile, when it comes to Venezuela, the US authorities seem to rely on small enterprises rather than major oil giants. The reason why major players are unwilling to return to the Venezuelan oil market is because the use of the country's oil entails difficulties, InfoTEK editor-in-chief Alexander Frolov told Izvestia. "Extracting Venezuelan oil requires long and costly exploration efforts, which may even produce no results at all. It also requires certain conditions on the global market, including high oil prices and a quick rise in demand, which would make it possible to supply this high-cost oil to the market without having to fear a drop in prices. There is a lot of doubt that American companies will be able to significantly increase oil production in Venezuela," the expert concluded.

 

The White House is considering the options for potential strikes on Iran. Experts don't rule out that the US could target both military and nuclear facilities, as well as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's residence. If such a scenario materializes, Iran's potential retaliation would affect other Middle Eastern countries, including Israel, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, Izvestia notes.

There is currently a 50/50 chance that the US will attack Iran, said Farkhad Ibragimov, political scientist and lecturer with the Economic Department at the Patrice Lumumba Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. "On the one hand, some members of the Trump administration believe Washington should not do that. However, others are confident the time has come," he noted. If Washington opts for military action, Tehran will see Israel and US military and naval bases as "legitimate targets," Iranian Parliament Chairman Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf warned. In such a case, Qatar and the UAE are also likely to be affected amid the escalation, for which reason the entire Middle East could plunge into a war, Ibragimov pointed out.

So far, Trump's statements about strikes on Iran appear to relate to psychological pressure that can be regarded as part of an information campaign against Tehran, American studies expert Malek Dudakov stressed. He believes that the main goal pursued by the US and Israel is to bring a pro-US government to power in Tehran.

Yury Lyamin, senior researcher with the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, told Vedomosti that the US operation to abduct Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had increased the likelihood of another round of tensions in the Middle East. Trump appears inclined to take ever more risky foreign policy steps.

Meanwhile, protests in Iran will reinforce the role of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and increase repression, said Ilya Vaskin, junior researcher with the Center for the Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia Studies at the Higher School of Economics. External forces, including US and Israeli intelligence agencies, are fueling more protests, particularly through a media promotion campaign for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the Iranian shah overthrown in 1979, Lyamin believes. "Minorities such as the Kurds are active in the protests, but they are interested not in changing the government but in acquiring autonomy or independence, which is contributing to the overall instability in the country," he added.

 

NATO continues its military buildup in the northern latitudes, adding to tensions in the Arctic region, Russian Ambassador to Copenhagen Vladimir Barbin told Izvestia. Simultaneously, the US is increasing pressure on Denmark, with analysts predicting that Washington will be given exclusive rights to use Greenland's resources and build additional bases on the island.

"The level of military activity and presence in the northern latitudes will remain at least the same in the coming years," Nikita Lipunov, junior researcher with the Institute for International Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, noted. The Arctic Council, which will turn 30 in 2026, could help curb the militarization of the region. Denmark took over its chairmanship last year but it seems reluctant to seek meaningful breakthroughs in terms of international cooperation under the Arctic Council's auspices, the Russian envoy to the country said.

Meanwhile, NATO countries also have internal differences. Washington and Ottawa remain engaged in a territorial dispute over the maritime boundary in the Beaufort Sea, which experts believe is rich in oil. However, this long-standing conflict has given way to a new dispute, stemming from the US claims to the island of Greenland that belongs to Denmark.

"In order to achieve its goals, the Trump team may use diplomatic and economic levers to put pressure on Denmark. Besides, the US could also launch a large-scale information campaign to promote the narrative related to Greenland acquiring autonomy," said Tigran Meloyan, an analyst with the Center for Mediterranean Studies at the Higher School of Economics.

In the expert's opinion, Denmark will have to make concessions at some point, particularly by granting the US exclusive access to rare earth, oil and gas deposits, as well as expanding Washington's rights to set up military bases in Greenland. This would allow the United States to ensure long-term access to commodities and strengthen its position in the Western Hemisphere.

 

A suspension of Venezuelan oil supplies to China could allow Russia to increase exports to the East Asian nation and cut discounts on the market, said analysts interviewed by Kommersant.

Russian oil companies may boost supplies to independent refineries in China, which are likely to face disruptions in Venezuelan oil purchases, analysts from Kpler and Argus pointed out. A blockade on Venezuelan exports and the seizure of tankers by US forces have brought shipments to China almost to a halt. An increasing number of market participants expect that Venezuelan oil supplies to China will drop following the January 3 arrest of President Nicolas Maduro and US leader Donald Trump's statements about Washington's control of the Latin American country, Argus experts noted. Analysts believe that Chinese oil refineries could start facing serious problems with oil supplies in March 2026.

Kpler experts see Nicolas Maduro's arrest as "a turning point" for Venezuela's oil industry and the global heavy oil market.

Igor Yushkov, an expert at the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, believes that a resumption of Venezuelan oil exports will benefit Russia. According to him, the main commodity flows will be redirected to the US market, which will boost Russia's competitiveness on Asian markets. In the expert's view, tanker seizures are unlikely to become a regular practice that could significantly change supply routes or lead to higher insurance risks.

Maxim Shaposhnikov, advisor to the Industrial Code fund manager, expects China to reach an agreement with the US on preserving Venezuelan supplies, but this will require time. According to him, Venezuelan oil output will return to the previous levels quite quickly, but a rise in production will take at least 18 months to two years because infrastructure is worn down and no one is in a hurry to upgrade it. Besides, in Shaposhnikov's words, China won't be able to fully restore Venezuelan supplies at the same prices. That said, Chinese refineries will have an interest in Russian oil, which could result in reduced discounts for Russian crude.

MOSCOW, January 12. /TASS/. The loss of Belogorye in the Zaporozhye Region will weaken the Ukrainian army's defenses near the city of Zaporozhye, a source in Russian defense circles told TASS.

Russia's Defense Ministry reported on January 11 that its Battlegroup Dnepr had liberated the settlement of Belogorye.

"Belogorye played an important role in the enemy's defensive lines in the Zaporozhye direction. Its seizure opens an operational way for Russian troops to develop an offensive towards one of the Ukrainian army's key areas of defense - the town of Orekhov. The loss of that stronghold may seriously complicate the enemy's ability to keep sustainable defenses at approaches to the city of Zaporozhye," the defense source said.

Russian unmanned systems troops played an important role in liberating Belogorye. Drone teams thwarted the rotation of Ukrainian forces several days before the assault, which considerably facilitated the Russian army's advance on the ground, he specified.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova lashed out on Jan. 11 at British Defense Secretary John Healey after he said he would detain Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, calling the remarks "the wet dreams of British perverts."

Zakharova made the comments to the state-controlled TV Centre channel in response to remarks Healey gave to the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 9 while visiting the site of a deadly Russian drone strike on a high-rise residential building in Kyiv. 

Asked which world leader he would choose to kidnap if given the chance, Healey said he would "take (Russian President Vladimir) Putin into custody and hold him account for war crimes."

Standing amid the aftermath of the overnight attack, Healey pointed to Russian atrocities as the basis for his remarks, including "what I saw in Bucha on one of my first visits to Ukraine" and "the abduction of some of the Ukrainian kids that I met in Irpin."

While Healey's comments were hypothetical when made, they followed a shift in the international landscape after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, a move that raised questions about whether similar actions could follow.

Healey's remarks came just one day after Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across Ukraine overnight on Jan. 8–9, killing at least four people and injuring 24 others in Kyiv. 

Zakharova, a longtime fixture of Russia's foreign policy messaging, is widely known for using undiplomatic and provocative language. Her public comments frequently feature personal insults, sarcasm, and aggressive rhetoric aimed at foreign officials and governments.

Trump, who has spent months attempting to broker a negotiated settlement between Moscow and Kyiv, earlier offered a sharply contrasting view when asked about the prospect of detaining Putin.

Asked whether such a move might be necessary, Trump replied ambiguously, "Well, I don't think it's going to be necessary," adding, "I've always had a great relationship with (Putin)."

The move comes as London looks for stronger tools to disrupt illicit oil shipments that help fund Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as sanctioned exports linked to Iran and Venezuela.



"Ensuring that people can keep warm, cook food, and live reasonably normal lives is vital in enabling them to persevere in this war — a war that they are fighting on behalf of us all," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.



Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the energy supply situation in the region is "extremely dire," noting that the "energy capacity losses are reaching practically catastrophic scale."

The full-scale war in Ukraine entered its 1,418th day on Jan. 11, matching the length of Nazi Germany's fight against the Soviet Union during World War II. Russia has "repeated almost all the worst things that happened in the 20th century," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

Emergency services arrived at the scene to extinguish a fire following an alleged attack, according to local residents.

"The wet dreams of British perverts," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

Russian forces struck an ambulance in the town of Semenivka in Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 11, injuring two medical workers, a local official reported.

Russia launched a wave of drones towards Kyiv overnight on Jan. 12, striking a building within the city, local officials reported.

Electricity was fully restored across Zaporizhzhia Oblast by the morning, the regional grid operator Zaporizhzhiaoblenergo said on Jan. 11.

The U.K. has launched Project Nightfall, a competition to rapidly develop new long-range ballistic missiles for Ukraine. The missiles will be able to travel 500 km (310 miles) and come equipped with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. 



The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced.

            Greenland's untapped mineral wealth has helped land the island at the top of President Donald Trump's empire-building wish list.
    


Trump officials view Greenland's underground riches as a way to loosen China's stranglehold over the rare-earth metals that are critical for everything from fighter jets and lasers to electric vehicles and MRI scanners.
    


            “We need Greenland … It's so strategic right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One earlier this month.
    


            “We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not. If we don't do it the easy way, we'll do it the hard way,” Trump said Friday at a press conference with oil executives.
    


            Although Trump has recently downplayed Greenland's natural resources, his former national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News in 2024 that the administration's focus on Greenland was “about critical minerals” and “natural resources.”



            But the reality is that Denmark's ownership of Greenland is not what's stopping the United States from tapping the island's treasure trove. It's the punishing Arctic environment.
    


            Researchers say it would be extremely difficult and expensive to extract Greenland's minerals because many of the island's mineral deposits are located in remote areas above the Arctic Circle, where there is a mile-thick polar ice sheet and darkness reigns much of the year.
    


            Not only that, but Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, lacks the infrastructure and manpower required to make this mining dream a reality.
    


            “The idea of turning Greenland into America's rare-earth factory is science fiction. It's just completely bonkers,” said Malte Humpert, founder and senior fellow at The Arctic Institute. “You might as well mine on the moon. In some respects, it's worse than the moon.”
    


            Despite its name, approximately 80% of Greenland is covered with ice. And mineral extraction — or just about anything — in the Arctic can be five to 10 times more expensive than doing it elsewhere on the planet.
    


            Trump's interest in Greenland is not new — nor is he the first US president to covet the island.
    


            Yet Trump's startling intervention in Venezuela and decision to take control of the South American nation's vast oil riches have refocused attention on his interest in Greenland.
    


            The chance that the United States takes control of any part of Greenland has surged to around 40% on prediction market Kalshi, up from about 20% in mid-2025.
    


            Of course, there are major differences between the situations in Venezuela and Greenland.
    


            Not only is Greenland a territory of NATO ally Denmark, but unlike Venezuela it is very much open to business that can operate there, and it has a long history of political stability.
    


            For years, if not decades, officials in Greenland have courted foreign direct investment. People in Greenland say they already are open to business opportunities without any belligerence.
    


            “I don't see a need for taking over Greenland. We're open to investment and working with Americans,” Christian Keldsen, managing director of the Greenland Business Association, told CNN in a phone interview. “Why would you say something like ‘take over the country' when you can get what you want by just behaving?”
    


            Getting US businesses to take a chance on Greenland may be a fantasy, experts say.
    


            “If there was a ‘pot of gold' waiting at the end of the rainbow in Greenland, private businesses would have gone there already,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
    


            However, Funk Kirkegaard, who previously worked with the Danish Ministry of Defense, said it's just “very difficult” to make a business case for the very large upfront investment that would be required.
    


            It's possible Trump tries to provide financial incentives and guarantees to entice US companies to make those massive investments, similar to the guarantees that Big Oil is seeking to drill aggressively in Venezuela.
    


            “If given enough taxpayer dollars, private business would be willing to do almost anything,” Funk Kirkegaard said. “But is that a good foundation on which to purchase a territory? The answer is no in Greenland, just as it's no in Venezuela.”
    


            The climate crisis has caused melting ice and rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic, leading some to hope for new economic opportunities.
    


            However, it's too early to say this will be enough of a game-changer to overcome the environmental challenges of mining in Greenland. While ice melt has opened up some shipping routes, it has also made the ground less stable to drill and raises the risk of landslides.
    


            “Climate change doesn't mean it's easy. This is not the Mediterranean or your bathtub. There's just less ice freeze,” said Humpert of The Arctic Institute.
    


            Relatedly, Greenland's stringent environmental regulations would add expense and difficulty to widespread mining.
    


            Of course, those regulations reflect the local population's desire to keep the environment pristine. If the Trump administration somehow made those regulations disappear, it might prove deeply unpopular.
    


            “You could end up having a hostile local political situation,” Funk Kirkegaard said.
    


            Selling Greenland to the United States would likely require a referendum.
    


            Yet a poll published in January 2025 found that just 6% favor Greenland becoming part of the United States. The overwhelming majority of Greenlanders, 85%, said they do not want that to happen.
    


            Adam Lajeunesse, chair in Canadian and Arctic policy at St. Francis Xavier University, said the “bizarre rhetoric” about taking over Greenland risks undermining the economic and strategic objectives US officials by harming the relationship with Greenland and Denmark.
    


            “You could see the United States no longer viewed as a friend and partner but as a bully that should be resisted,” he said.
    


            To some extent, this may already be happening.
    


            Keldsen, the Greenland Business Association executive, cautions US officials risk damaging the relationship with the local population.
    


            “At the moment, everything American is a red flag,” he said. “Everyone is wondering, ‘Am I supporting someone taking over my country?'”

            Around 1,000 additional US Customs and Border Protection agents are expected to deploy to Minneapolis, according to two federal law enforcement sources, as tensions between federal law enforcement and local counterparts flare after an ICE-involved shooting last week left a mother of three dead.
    


            The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, one of the sources said. That comes on top of a deployment of about 2,000 federal agents to the area that CNN reported early last week.
    


            Videos of last week's shooting are still emerging, and there's more to be learned, but the surge is the latest development in the monthslong spat between the Democratic-led city and the federal government after President Donald Trump first ramped up immigration enforcement in the Minneapolis area in December – dubbed Operation Metro Surge, which a federal official initially said was targeting undocumented Somali immigrants but also led to the arrests of immigrants from other nations.
    


﻿“DHS law enforcement have made over 2,000 arrests since Operation Metro Surge began,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Monday.
    


            Officials in the North Star State have continued to echo each other's calls for immigration officials to cooperate with local law enforcement and leave – which has prompted biting rhetoric in return from federal officials.
    


            After a weekend fraught with high-level name-calling, new shooting videos surfacing and widespread protests, here's the latest.
    


            On Saturday, DHS posted a new video on X showing the three minutes and 30 seconds that preceded an ICE agent's gunfire, which struck and killed 37-year-old US citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis on Wednesday.
    


            The new video shows Good's vehicle — a maroon Honda Pilot — partially blocking the street. Several vehicles that stopped behind her appear to belong to federal agents, based on activity observed in other videos.
    


            In its post, DHS claimed, without providing evidence, Good was “stalking and impeding a law enforcement operation over the course of the morning.”
    


Cell phone footage raises new questions about ICE agent's tactics before fatal shooting



            Several vehicles pass Good's car during the video. About 40 seconds into the clip, the camera focuses on Good moving in her vehicle as honking can be heard, but it's unclear where the honking is coming from.
    


            Three minutes in, law enforcement sirens go off and there are more car horns. At 3:11, two vehicles pass Good's car. A truck that appears to belong to a federal agent pulls up perpendicular to Good, and agents get out of the vehicle. Good appears to be motioning to them with her hands.
    


            The agents then exit the vehicle and the video cuts off right before the deadly shooting.
    


            DHS's post came the day after CNN obtained cell phone video of the interaction captured by the agent who fired at Good, Jonathan Ross.
    


            Ross' video does not show if the SUV made contact with him, as the camera angle jerks up to the sky. Another video, shot by a bystander, shows the SUV may have made contact as it lurches forward, and he moves to the side.
    


            DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Ross' video supports what the agency has said – that the ICE agent acted in self-defense.
    


            The shooting itself is not visible, but three gunshots are heard as the phone in Ross' hand jostles further and then is facing the house behind Ross.
    


            National-level tensions mounted Sunday morning as Noem called on officials in Minnesota to “grow up,” following their complaints that federal agencies aren't cooperating with state and local officials investigating Good's killing. The Justice Department has blocked state investigators from participating in what initially was meant to be a joint FBI and state criminal investigation, state officials said.
    


            Noem homed in on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Democrats she said have politicized the shooting and encouraged “destruction” and “violence” in the city.
    


            “They've extremely politicized and inappropriately talked about the situation on the ground in their city. They have inflamed the public. They have encouraged the kind of destruction and violence that we have seen in Minneapolis the last several days,” Noem said on CNN's “State of the Union” Sunday.
    


            “I would encourage them to grow up, get some maturity, act like people who are responsible, who want people to be safe, and the right thing be done,” she said.
    


            Moments later, Frey strongly condemned the incident to CNN's Jake Tapper and urged ICE officers to get out of Minneapolis.
    


            “She's calling Minneapolis this dystopian hellhole. You know how many shootings we've had so far this year? Two, and one of them was ICE,” Frey told Tapper less than two weeks into 2026.
    


            Frey doubled down on his assertion that the officer who shot Good was “a federal agent recklessly using power that ended up in somebody dying.”
    


            “Am I biased in this? Of course. I'm biased, because I got two eyes. Anybody can see these videos, anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist,” Frey said.
    


            The mayor called for an independent investigation into the shooting.
    


‘Get the f**k out of Minneapolis': Mayor sends message to ICE after deadly shooting



            In DC, US Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota, said the federal government is stoking “chaos” with its heavy-handed immigration enforcement efforts in the wake of last week's shooting death of a US citizen.
    


            CBP Commander Gregory Bovino was already in the Minneapolis area last week with hundreds of agents. He is conducting targeted operations, including door knocks, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. The documents provided to those who receive door knocks are either administrative warrants – which are signed by an immigration officer but don't carry the same legal weight as a judicial warrant – or copies of their final orders of removal.
    


            “What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask,” Omar said on CBS's “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would.”
    


            Omar, accompanied by fellow Minnesota Democratic Congress members, said she was denied access to a Minneapolis-area ICE facility on Saturday morning after being inside briefly.
    


            Noem issued a directive on Thursday barring lawmakers from visiting detention facilities without a week's notice, McLaughlin said in a statement, due to “escalating riots and political violence targeting buildings and facilities used by ICE.”
    


            The DHS secretary acted to “ensure adequate protection for Members of Congress, congressional staff, detainees, and ICE employees alike,” McLaughlin said in Sunday's statement.
    


            As outrage has grown following Good's death, more than 1,000 demonstrations were planned across the United States over the weekend in protest of the Trump administration's surge of immigration action in Minneapolis and elsewhere.
    


            Saturday's massive protest in the Twin Cities took many shapes throughout the day, starting at Powderhorn Park, located about a mile from where Good was shot and which had been a prime gathering place for protests following the 2020 killing of  George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. After marching through a Minneapolis neighborhood, the crowd of thousands gathered on the street where Good was fatally shot.
    


            Even with the decision of Gov. Tim Walz to put the National Guard on standby, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is concerned that frequent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement may get out of control, O'Hara said in a podcast published Monday by The New York Times.
    


            “It could very, very quickly explode,” O'Hara told the Times' “The Daily” podcast. “And with the level of staffing that we have and the time that it takes to get the National Guard to come in, it will be too late. That's my fear.”
    


            Meanwhile, thousands protested elsewhere in the country in rallies opposing aggressive immigration enforcement policies and tactics.
    


            In Los Angeles, a police helicopter's search light beamed down on protesters on Alameda Street, who were outfitted with upside-down American flags and handmade anti-ICE posters.
    


            The street was also the site of clashes between protesters and police in June last year, when crowds gathered to rally against immigration raids and Trump's deployment of the National Guard.
    


            With signs declaring, “The Trump Fascist Regime MUST GO NOW!!” And “WAKE UP AMERICA,” protesters marched in front of the White House despite the steady rain across the capital.
    


            One protester, Claudia Schur, joined the march to share her grievances against several Trump administration actions.
    


            “There's no rules anymore, no shame, no integrity,” Schur said while holding a sign that said, “ICE Out.” “It's just a country I can't even, I can't, I don't recognize.”
    


            Julia Doherty, who marched alongside Schur, said she's concerned about the polarization among Americans.
    


            “There's no sense of community. We're just so polarized, it's horrifying,” Doherty said. “And we need to stand up and do whatever we can to, to effect change.”

 Neither America Nor China Can Achieve True Tech Dominance

 Colin H. Kahl

In July, the Trump administration released an artificial intelligence action plan titled “Winning the AI Race,” which framed global competition over AI in stark terms: whichever country achieves dominance in the technology will reap overwhelming economic, military, and geopolitical advantages. As it did during the Cold War with the space race or the nuclear buildup, the U.S. government is now treating AI as a contest with a single finish line and a single victor.

But that premise is misleading. The United States and China, the world's two AI superpowers, are not converging on the same path to AI leadership, nor are they competing across a single dimension. Instead, the AI competition is fragmenting across many domains, including the development of the most advanced large language and multimodal models; control over computing infrastructure such as data centers and top-of-the-line chips used to train and run models; influence over which technologies and standards are used throughout the world; and integration of AI into physical systems such as robots, factories, vehicles, and military platforms. Having an edge in one area does not automatically translate into an advantage in the others. As a result, it is plausible that Washington and Beijing could each emerge as leaders in different parts of the AI ecosystem rather than one side decisively outpacing the other across the board.

This outcome is even more likely in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to lift some export controls on advanced AI chips to China. In December, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. government would permit the sale of Nvidia's H200—the company's second most powerful AI chip—to approved customers in China. The decision reflects a belief that allowing China access to “good enough” computing power can generate revenue for U.S. companies and reinforce American technological standards without risking the United States' edge in AI innovation. But the danger of selling high-end U.S. chips to China is that it could lead to a more divided AI landscape—one in which U.S. firms maintain a lead in providing advanced AI-based services, but Chinese companies gain ground in disseminating their slightly less advanced but cheaper technology around the world and applying AI to machines, factories, and infrastructure.

The most plausible outcome of the AI race, then, may not be decisive American or Chinese victory, but something more complex and more consequential: an asymmetric form of AI bipolarity. In a world without a clear winner, the United States will need to adapt to a longer-term competition while engaging China to manage the shared risks that advanced AI is likely to produce.

The United States still enjoys a clear advantage at the cutting edge of AI. The world's most capable large language models and multimodal systems are produced by U.S. firms such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. These models demonstrate superior reasoning and tool-use capabilities—such as autonomously writing and debugging code, querying live databases, and analyzing spreadsheets—and anchor the most commercially valuable AI services, including AI assistants that help manage cloud platforms, productivity software, and customer service.

But the United States' lead at the frontier is narrower than it once appeared. Chinese firms including DeepSeek, Alibaba (through its Qwen models), and Moonshot AI (with its Kimi series) are catching up. For many practical applications, such as drafting text, summarizing and translating documents, writing routine code, or powering customer service chatbots, the difference between the best U.S. models and the best Chinese ones is already marginal.

For now, the United States' most significant advantage lies not in models but in compute—the quality and quantity of computing resources to train and run AI models. U.S. companies design the world's most advanced AI chips, primarily through Nvidia, and the United States is far ahead of China in the scale of AI data centers. U.S. firms control roughly 70 percent of global AI compute, whereas Chinese companies control around ten percent. This capacity allows U.S. companies to train larger and more capable models and absorb the enormous computational costs of customers making requests of models in ways that Chinese competitors cannot easily match. U.S. companies, such as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, plan to spend trillions of dollars on specialized chips, AI-focused data centers, and the energy infrastructure to power them over the next few years, likely widening the computing power gap between the United States and China, at least in the near term.

Export controls that were enacted during Trump's first term and dramatically strengthened under the Biden administration reinforced this advantage. Restrictions on advanced AI chips and on semiconductor manufacturing equipment have made it difficult for Chinese firms to acquire or produce sufficient quantities of leading-edge chips for AI, which has slowed China's ability to create the computing power required to train and deploy the most advanced models.

China has still managed to make some decent chips. Huawei's Ascend 910 series—the best Chinese semiconductors—perform about 60 to 70 percent as well as Nvidia's H100 or H200 on some AI workloads. But Huawei can make only hundreds of thousands of them, whereas Nvidia currently produces and exports millions of far more capable AI chips each year.

China has access to vast quantities of data and deep pools of AI talent. It can also easily and quickly build AI-related infrastructure and generate the energy to power it. Access to computing power, then, remains the single most binding constraint on China's global AI ambitions—a constraint that the Trump administration just eased with its decision to allow some Chinese firms to buy Nvidia's H200 chips. Although Chinese companies still won't have access to Nvidia's newest Blackwell generation or its forthcoming Rubin line, the H200 remains highly capable. It was released in 2024, is still used in major AI data centers run by U.S. companies, and is about ten times more powerful than the chips that could be sold to China under U.S. President Joe Biden's export regulations. The Trump administration has hinted that other U.S. chipmakers, including AMD and Intel, might also be permitted to sell advanced chips.

The White House seems to believe that allowing the sale of powerful but not leading-edge chips will generate revenue for U.S. firms that can be put toward research and development while preserving U.S. leadership at the frontier of AI research. The Trump administration also reasons that continued Chinese reliance on U.S.-designed hardware and software—particularly Nvidia's CUDA platform—will enable the United States to influence programming frameworks, development tools, and data-center architectures used by Chinese AI firms. Another motivation seems to be the conviction that selling chips that outperform China's domestic alternatives could reduce Beijing's incentives to speed up indigenous development of advanced AI chips.

The risks of selling H200 chips to China, however, outweigh the benefits. Depending on the number of H200 chips that ultimately reach China and how efficiently they are used, the United States could lose its massive advantage in compute capacity. According to analysis by the Institute for Progress, if the United States exported no advanced chips to China, its compute capacity in 2026 would be more than ten times that of China's. With aggressive H200 exports, however, the U.S. advantage could dwindle to the single digits—or, under some scenarios, disappear. In other words, with unrestricted H200 exports, Chinese AI labs could build supercomputers approaching the performance of top U.S. systems, albeit at a higher cost.

Just as important, exporting H200s is unlikely to slow China's efforts at making its own advanced chips in the long run. China's domestic chip production is constrained by manufacturing bottlenecks, not by lack of demand. Since Trump's December announcement, Chinese firms have already placed orders for more than two million H200s—far exceeding what Huawei or other Chinese companies can currently produce. As a result, U.S. chip sales are likely to add to, rather than substitute for, China's total available compute. Moreover, there are some signs that Beijing may require potential buyers of the H200 chips to justify why domestic alternatives will not suffice, suggesting that Chinese authorities are prepared to maintain artificial demand for homegrown chips through procurement mandates and restrictions on foreign hardware in sensitive sectors.



The decision to export H200 chips to China also risks eroding the broader export controls that the United States has negotiated with its allies. In 2019, the Netherlands—home to ASML, the world's leading manufacturer of advanced lithography equipment—agreed to restrict exports of its most sophisticated tools to China, recognizing that these machines are essential for producing leading-edge semiconductors. Dutch officials are now asking why they should continue to limit exports of critical manufacturing equipment when U.S. firms are allowed to sell the finished chips produced using the same equipment. If the Netherlands or other key allies, such as Japan and South Korea, were to loosen their export controls, China's ability to domestically produce high-end chips could improve sharply—eventually undercutting not only Nvidia but also U.S. data center companies that rely on sustained hardware advantages.

The implications of the Trump administration's export reversal, however, extend beyond China's domestic market. Chinese firms such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent are increasingly building and operating—or partnering to expand—data center infrastructure in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Even if Beijing restricts H200 imports for domestic use, these companies could deploy U.S.-designed chips overseas, offering subsidized, vertically integrated AI infrastructure bundled with power, connectivity, and talent programs.

China is already skilled at disseminating its technology to other countries. U.S. labs typically rely on proprietary, closed-weight models that are accessed through cloud services. They are powerful and easy to use but tightly controlled by their developers and difficult for customers to modify. Chinese firms, by contrast, have embraced open-weight models, which are appealing because they are cheaper, can be more easily tailored to specific industries or languages, and can be run through local rather than U.S.-based cloud providers—which, in turn, reduces concerns about data localization and foreign dependence. Although these open-weight models are generally less reliable than leading U.S. systems, China's approach embeds its AI in global AI ecosystems.

The Trump administration is keen to promote the global diffusion of an American AI technology stack in which U.S. data centers, chips, and models are bundled together and the world remains dependent on U.S. hardware, software, and services. But in the wake of the H200 decision, Chinese firms are likely to build data centers in foreign countries using advanced U.S. chips running attractive Chinese open-weight models. This is not an American AI stack; it is a U.S.-enabled Chinese one.

Even if the United States continues to lead at the AI frontier—and even if U.S. cloud providers remain the backbone of global AI services—it may not be sufficient to beat China in the AI race. This is because beyond models, compute, and diffusion lies another dimension of the race that may prove decisive: embodied AI. Unlike models that generate text or images, embodied AI systems integrate sensing, perception, control, and decision-making to operate in physical environments. They underpin industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent machines that learn by interacting with the world.

Here, China may be particularly well positioned. Beijing has explicitly elevated embodied AI as a national priority. Central government plans have identified intelligent manufacturing and humanoid robotics as critical emerging industries, while local governments have offered grants, tax incentives, subsidized land, and preferential procurement to firms deploying AI-enabled automation. Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shanghai, and Zhejiang are piloting large-scale programs focused on humanoid robotics and industrial automation, often pairing research institutes with manufacturing partners to accelerate real-world testing and deployment.

These efforts are already translating into productivity gains. AI-enabled automation has helped Chinese factories reduce defect rates, shorten production cycles, and operate continuously with fewer workers. According to the International Federation of Robotics, China's stock of industrial robots exceeded two million in 2024. That year, Chinese factories installed roughly 300,000 new robots—more than the rest of the world combined—whereas U.S. factories put in place just 34,000. Some Chinese factories for electronics and electric cars are already operating with minimal human supervision.

In the years to come, the benefits of AI will not only depend on making smarter models but also on turning bits into atoms—that is, translating the gains from greater intelligence into economic productivity, industrial competitiveness, and novel military capabilities. All of this hinges on the ability to embed intelligence into machines that act in the real world and shape the real economy—areas in which China is well positioned to dominate.

Taken together, these trends point toward an emerging end state that defies simple narratives of victory or defeat. The AI race is no longer a sprint toward a single finish line nor is it even a marathon. Instead, the United States and China are competing in an AI decathlon and the United States must shift its strategy accordingly. As AI bipolarity comes into view, the United States must lean into its strengths where they matter most, disseminate its technology, and accept the necessity of sustained AI dialogue with Beijing even amid intensifying rivalry.

For starters, Washington should avoid further eroding its advantages in computing power—the bedrock of global AI leadership. If the administration is unwilling to reverse its H200 decision, and Congress does not intervene, the Commerce Department should approve licenses for H200 exports slowly and apply heightened scrutiny to Chinese firms with close ties to China's national security agencies.

At the same time, the Trump administration must follow through on the pledge it made in its AI action plan to rigorously enforce remaining export controls—most notably on high-bandwidth memory, advanced lithography equipment, and other critical semiconductor manufacturing and packaging tools needed to produce top-tier chips. These controls remain among the few ways Washington can influence the tempo and scale of China's progress in AI.To compete with China's “good enough” AI infrastructure and open-weight model strategy, the administration should direct the International Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to fund AI projects in countries across the so-called global South to compete with subsidized, state-backed Chinese alternatives—and work with Congress to secure expanded legal authorities and financial resources to do so. Absent such efforts, Chinese AI ecosystems are likely to become the default option in many developing countries, providing Beijing new levers of influence and entrenching AI models and standards that normalize surveillance and censorship.Simultaneously, the administration must work with Congress to prepare for the domestic economic shocks that AI bipolarity is likely to intensify. As the United States comes to dominate services on the frontier of AI, a growing number of white-collar jobs—particularly entry-level positions—will probably be displaced by machine intelligence. Meanwhile, China's dominance of the industrial applications of AI risks further hollowing out U.S. manufacturing and creating new dependencies on Chinese goods and supply chains.

These trends cannot be reversed, but their risks can be mitigated. The administration should work with Congress to invest more in STEM education, vocational training, and midcareer retraining and should encourage the adoption of AI systems that complement rather than replace human labor. Washington must also update labor laws, regulations, and safety guidelines to account for the ways AI is likely to reshape the workforce and deploy AI aggressively in health care, education, and government to make public services more efficient, accessible, and affordable. At the same time, reducing dependence on China will require supporting AI-enabled manufacturing in the United States, strengthening supply chains with trusted partners, and ensuring that productivity gains from automation translate into durable economic capacity at home.

Although AI bipolarity will likely intensify tensions between the United States and China, it also strengthens the case for sustained superpower dialogue. In a bipolar AI ecosystem, neither side can fully insulate itself from the risks generated by the other. Both countries therefore have strong incentives to manage those risks, including by coordinating efforts to prevent nonstate actors from using AI for catastrophic cyber or biological attacks—something Trump's AI action plan warns is a growing danger. They also share an interest in ensuring that increasingly advanced AI remains under human control, even if Washington and Beijing disagree profoundly on the values those systems should reflect. In a world where the AI race is multifaceted and where neither side is likely to emerge as a clear winner, avoiding a destabilizing race to the bottom remains more important than ever.

WASHINGTON, January 12. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with Iranian representatives to discuss Tehran's nuclear program, White House press pool journalists reported.

According to their information, representatives of the "Iranian leadership called" the US leader on January 10. "Iran wants to negotiate, yes. We may meet with them, I mean, a meeting is being set up," Trump said. According to Reuters, the talks were about Tehran's nuclear program. The news agency also pointed out that the US leader noted that Washington is in contact with Iran's opposition forces.

In 2015, Iran and the UK, Germany, China, Russia, the US, and France signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), ending a crisis that began in 2002 when the West accused Tehran of developing nuclear weapons. However, in 2018, US President Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from the agreement and reinstated all US sanctions against Iran. In response, Tehran announced in 2020 that it would reduce its commitments under the JCPOA and restrict IAEA inspectors' access to nuclear facilities. The agency continued its inspections until the Iranian-Israeli escalation in June 2025.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia launched a wave of drones towards Kyiv overnight on Jan. 12, striking a building within the city, local officials reported.

Several explosions were heard in Kyiv around 1:30 a.m. local time, according to a Kyiv Independent journalist on the ground.

Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, reported that a fire had broken out at unspecified "non-residential building" in the Solomianskyi district of the city.

Videos posted to social media appear to show a large fire emanating from the building. Vehicle fires were also reported at the site of the drone strike.

No information was immediately available as to the extent of the damage caused or whether there were any casualties sustained.

Ukraine's Air Force warned of subsequent waves of drone attacks on Kyiv Oblast beginning around 3 a.m. local time.

The renewed attack on the capital comes as the city and its residents contend with ongoing heat outages following a large-scale Russian attack on Ukraine overnight on Jan. 9.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko previously called on residents of the capital, if possible, to leave the city after a Russian attack on Jan. 9 left half of the city's apartment buildings without heating.

While efforts to restore power to residential buildings continue, Klitschko warned that the situation is expected to remain difficult, as freezing temperatures are forecast to persist in the coming days.

As of early on Jan. 11, over 1,000 buildings in Kyiv remained without heat, with restorations attempts currently in progress.

Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said that significant improvements in the energy supply situation are expected by Jan. 15.

The mass Russian missile and drone strike overnight on Jan. 9 killed at least four people and injured 25 others in Kyiv and severely damaged the capital's critical infrastructure.

In recent days, Russia has also targeted regional centers in the east and south of Ukraine, leaving Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts without power on the evening of Jan. 7. New outages were reported in both regions overnight on Jan. 11.

Russian forces also targeted critical infrastructure in the western Lviv Oblast overnight on Jan. 9, launching the new Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile.

He previously worked in Canadian politics as a communications lead and spokesperson for a national political party, and as a communications assistant for a Canadian Member of Parliament. Basmat has a Master's degree in Political Management from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and a Bachelor of Arts in Politics and Governance from Toronto Metropolitan University. 



The move comes as London looks for stronger tools to disrupt illicit oil shipments that help fund Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as sanctioned exports linked to Iran and Venezuela.



"Ensuring that people can keep warm, cook food, and live reasonably normal lives is vital in enabling them to persevere in this war — a war that they are fighting on behalf of us all," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said.



Belgorod Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the energy supply situation in the region is "extremely dire," noting that the "energy capacity losses are reaching practically catastrophic scale."

The full-scale war in Ukraine entered its 1,418th day on Jan. 11, matching the length of Nazi Germany's fight against the Soviet Union during World War II. Russia has "repeated almost all the worst things that happened in the 20th century," President Volodymyr Zelensky said. 

Emergency services arrived at the scene to extinguish a fire following an alleged attack, according to local residents.

"The wet dreams of British perverts," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said.

Russian forces struck an ambulance in the town of Semenivka in Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 11, injuring two medical workers, a local official reported.

Russia launched a wave of drones towards Kyiv overnight on Jan. 12, striking a building within the city, local officials reported.

Electricity was fully restored across Zaporizhzhia Oblast by the morning, the regional grid operator Zaporizhzhiaoblenergo said on Jan. 11.

The U.K. has launched Project Nightfall, a competition to rapidly develop new long-range ballistic missiles for Ukraine. The missiles will be able to travel 500 km (310 miles) and come equipped with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. 



The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced.

Pope Leo XIV has met with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the Vatican. Monday's meeting was not previously announced. Machado is touring Europe and the United States after escaping Venezuela in early 2025. Pope Leo, the first American pontiff, calls for Venezuela to remain independent following the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces.

ROME (AP) — Pope Leo XIV met with Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado in a private audience at the Vatican on Monday, during which the Venezuelan leader asked him to intercede for the release of hundreds of political prisoners held in the Latin American country.

The meeting, which hadn't been previously included in the list of Leo's planned appointments, was later listed by the Vatican in its daily bulletin, without adding details.

Machado is touring Europe and the United States after she reemerged in December after 11 months in hiding to accept her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway.

“Today I had the blessing and honor of being able to share with His Holiness and express our gratitude for his continued support of what is happening in our country,” Machado said in a statement following the meeting. 

“I also conveyed to him the strength of the Venezuelan people who remain steadfast and in prayer for the freedom of Venezuela, and I asked him to intercede for all Venezuelans who remain kidnapped and disappeared,” she added. 

Machado also held talks with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin, who was Nuncio in Venezuela from 2009 to 2013.

Pope Leo has called for Venezuela to remain an independent country after U.S. forces captured former President Nicolás Maduro in his compound in Caracas and took him to New York to face federal charges of drug-trafficking.




Leo had said he was following the developments in Venezuela with “deep concern,” and urged the protection of human and civil rights in the Latin American country. 

Venezuela's opposition, backed by consecutive Republican and Democratic administrations in the U.S., had vowed for years to immediately replace Maduro with one of their own and restore democracy to the oil-rich country. But U.S. President Donald Trump delivered them a heavy blow by allowing Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, to assume control.

Meanwhile, most opposition leaders, including Machado, are in exile or prison.

After winning the 2025 Nobel Prize for Peace, Machado said she'd like to give it to or share with Trump.

Machado dedicated the prize to Trump, along with the people of Venezuela, shortly after it was announced. Trump has coveted and openly campaigned for winning the Nobel Prize himself since his return to office in January 2025. 

The organization that oversees the Nobel Peace Prize — the Norwegian Nobel Institute — said, however, that once it's announced, the prize can't be revoked, transferred or shared with others.

“The decision is final and stands for all time,” it said in a short statement last week.

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola said Monday that she would challenge Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan in this year's midterm elections, vowing to shake up the establishment to make life more affordable for Alaskans. 

“Life is difficult here, and we know that we have to take care of each other,” Peltola said in a video announcement. 

Peltola, who is Yup'ik, was the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress. She won special and regular elections in 2022, defeating a field that included Republican former Gov. Sarah Palin. In 2024, she lost to Republican Nick Begich, who had also run in 2022.

Peltola's time in Congress was marked by tragedy. Her mother died in 2023, and her husband died in a plane crash later that year. 

Peltola focused on local concerns in her announcement, saying Alaska's future depends on fixing the “rigged system in D.C. that's shutting down Alaska, while politicians feather their own nests.”

She said the salmon and migratory birds that once filled the freezers of Alaska Native subsistence hunters are now harder to find, forcing families who live far from the state's limited road system to rely on grocery stores for pricey staples, driven up by high transportation costs.

“It's not just that politicians in D.C. don't care that we're paying $17 for a gallon of milk in rural Alaska,” she said. “They don't even believe us. They're more focused on their stock portfolios than our bank accounts.”




Although Democrats are hopeful about picking up seats in this year's midterms, Alaska could prove to be difficult political terrain. Sullivan, a former state attorney general and natural resources commissioner, defeated the state's last Democratic senator in 2014. 

The Republican National Committee said Peltola became “a rubber stamp for the far-left the second she got to Washington.”

“Alaskans saw through her empty promises then showed her the door, and she'll lose to Dan Sullivan who fights for Alaskans every day,” RNC spokesperson Nick Poche said in a statement.

While serving in Washington, Sullivan has been involved in military and resource development issues, and he was endorsed by then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.

“Senator Sullivan has spent years delivering real results for Alaska: historic investments in our state's health care, major funding for our Coast Guard, helping protect those who can't protect themselves and policies that are finally unleashing Alaska's energy potential,” his campaign spokesperson, Nate Adams, said in an email to The Associated Press. 

“His opponent,” Adams said, “served a term and a half in Congress where she didn't pass a single bill. Alaskans deserve a senator with a proven record of getting things done, and the contrast couldn't be clearer in this race.”

Peltola has long touted her ability to work across party lines, such as supporting the large Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope. She angered some Democrats in 2024 when she refused to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race won by Trump.

Peltola said Alaska's Republican congressional delegation used to ignore partisanship and do what was right for the state, such as backing public media and disaster relief, and even invoked Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens. 

“It's about time Alaskans teach the rest of the country what Alaska First and, really, America First looks like,” Peltola said.

Alaska has open primaries and ranked choice voting in general elections. The top four vote-getters in the August primary regardless of party affiliation will advance to the November general election.

Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'Saturday in America' to weigh in on the fight for fairness in women's sports as the Supreme Court is set to hear cases involving transgender athletes.

With the U.S. Supreme Court set to rule on two cases focused on the issue of biological males in women's sports, hundreds of prominent figures in sports and politics have publicly taken a side. 

At least 77 amicus briefs have been filed for the upcoming court review, some in support of the trans athlete plaintiffs and some in support of the "save women's sports" defendants. Famed athletes, coaches, U.S. lawmakers and other state and federal government officials have signed onto those briefs, declaring their allegiance in the historic legal battle.

Idaho and West Virginia are among almost 30 states with laws preventing transgender students who identify as female from competing on girls' sports teams sponsored by public schools and colleges. In 2020 and 2021, the trans athlete plaintiffs successfully challenged the laws in Idaho and West Virginia, respectively, to enable their participation on women's and girls' sports teams. 

Both trans athletes are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). 

The justices will examine whether the landmark federal law, Title IX forbidding sex discrimination in education, applies in these inclusion cases.      

Idaho in 2020 became the first state to pass such restrictions with the Fairness in Women's Sports Act.

Both sides in the legal dispute have accused the other of peddling false and misleading facts, terminology and narratives about enforcement of the state laws, and the stakes for both transgender and cisgender athletes.

The Supreme Court in July agreed to hear the separate appeals from the states and is expected to issue final, binding rulings on the merits by late June.

"Idaho's women and girls deserve an equal playing field," said Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador, who is expected to argue the case in Tuesday's public session. "For too long, activists have worked to sideline women and girls in their own sports."         

States with such laws, and groups and lawmakers supporting them, say the issue is about common sense and student safety.

Lawyers will tell the high court there are inherent physical differences between females and males, and these legislative acts would ensure those they call "male" or "boy" students cannot compete on girls' sports teams involving competitive skill or contact.

But LGBTQ+ rights supporters say such laws and labels are clearly discriminatory and were never a big issue until some states sought to politicize them.

Meanwhile, two West Virginia female students and their families came forward with the allegations against one of the trans plaintiffs ahead of oral arguments for the case next week. Fox News Digital is not disclosing the name of the trans athlete because the individual is a minor.

TOP DEMS SILENT AFTER TRANS ATHLETE THEY BACKED IN SCOTUS CASE IS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION

Bridgeport High School female student Adaleia Cross, who is a former track and field teammate of the trans athlete when the two were at Bridgeport Middle School, alleges the trans athlete made comments to her that constituted sexual harassment in the girls' locker room. Cross, who is one year older than the trans athlete, said she quit the track and field team at Bridgeport High School last year as a sophomore to avoid sharing a locker room again with the trans athlete once that athlete reached high school.

Cross' mother, Abby, told Fox News Digital what the trans athlete allegedly said to her daughter when they shared the girls' locker room during the 2022-23 school year. Adaleia was in eighth grade, and the trans athlete was in seventh.

Abby Cross alleged that the trans athlete made extremely graphic and vulgar sexual threats to her daughter and other girls on the team.

The ACLU has responded to the Cross family's allegations.

"Our client and her mother deny these allegations and the school district investigated the allegations reported to the school by A.C. and found them to be unsubstantiated. We remain committed to defending the rights of all students under Title IX, including the right to a safe and inclusive learning environment free from harassment and discrimination," read an ACLU statement provided to Fox News Digital.

The Cross family's attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) have responded to the ACLU's statement. 

"Our client has sworn under oath and under penalty of perjury in numerous cases about the events that took place between her and the male athlete. As a result of the situation, [Cross] had to step away from the sport she loved entirely and sacrifice a key element of her school experience to protect herself," read an ADF statement provided to Fox News Digital. 

ADF is also representing the state of West Virginia against the trans athlete in the case that is set to be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Former Lincoln Middle School girls' track and field runner Emmy Salerno alleges the trans athlete used "intimidation tactics" against her after Salerno refused to compete against the trans athlete during an event in the 2024 spring season. 

"After we stepped out, it was an immediate personality change. He didn't want to talk to me. He just wanted to stare at me, and just stare down," Salerno told Fox News Digital.

Salerno said there was an incident where the trans athlete followed her while they were at a local basketball game, making intimidating stares, and Salerno was concerned the trans athlete would try to "fight" her.

"At the basketball game when he just followed me everywhere, I kind of felt like, ‘Is he going to try to fight me?'" Salerno said. "'Is he going to try and sneak up behind me and punch me?'"

The ACLU has not responded to Fox News Digital's request for a response to Salerno's allegations.

BEIJING (AP) — A leader of the Canadian government is visiting China this week for the first time in nearly a decade, a bid to rebuild his country's fractured relations with the world's second-largest economy — and reduce Canada's dependence on the United States, its neighbor and until recently one of its most supportive and unswerving allies.

The push by Prime Minster Mark Carney, who arrives Wednesday, is part of a major rethink as ties sour with the United States — the world's No. 1 economy and long the largest trading partner for Canada by far.

Carney aims to double Canada's non-U.S. exports in the next decade in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the American leader's musing that Canada could become “the 51st state.”

“At a time of global trade disruption, Canada is focused on building a more competitive, sustainable, and independent economy,” Carney said in a news release announcing his China visit. “We're forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner.”

He will be in China until Saturday, then visit Qatar before attending the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week.

Trump's tariffs have pushed both Canada and China to look for opportunities to strengthen international cooperation, said Zhu Feng, the dean of the School of International Studies at China's Nanjing University.

“Carney's visit does reflect the new space for further development in China-Canadian relations under the current U.S. trade protectionism,” he said. But he cautioned against overestimating the importance of the visit, noting that Canada remains a U.S. ally. The two North American nations also share a deep cultural heritage and a common geography. 

Carney has been in office less than a year, succeeding Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister for nearly a decade. He is not the first new leader of a country to try to repair relations with China.

Australian Premier Anthony Albanese has reset ties since his Labor Party came to power in 2022. Relations had deteriorated under the previous conservative government, leading to Chinese trade restrictions on wine, beef, coal and other Australian exports. Unwinding those restrictions took about 18 months, culminating with the lifting of a Chinese ban on Australian lobsters in late 2024.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has sought to repair ties with China since his Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024. He is reportedly planning a visit to China, though the government has not confirmed that.

The two governments have differences, with Starmer raising the case of former Hong Kong media magnate Jimmy Lai, a British citizen, in talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in late 2024 in Brazil.

Trump, who has said he will come to China in April, has indicated he wants a smooth relationship with China, though he also launched a tit-for-tat trade war, with tariffs rising to more than 100% before he backed down.

In Canada, Trump's threats have raised questions about the country's longstanding relationship with its much more powerful neighbor. Those close ties have also been the source of much of Canada's friction with China in recent years.

It was Canada's detention of a Chinese telecommunications executive at the request of the U.S. that started the deterioration of relations in late 2018. The U.S. wanted the Huawei Technologies Co. executive, Meng Wenzhou, to be extradited to face American charges.

China retaliated by arresting two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on spying charges. While they were imprisoned, Meng was under house arrest in Vancouver, a Canadian city home to a sizable Chinese population. All three were released under a deal reached in 2021.

More recently, Canada followed the U.S. in imposing a 100% tariff on electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum from China.

China, which is Canada's second-largest trading partner after the U.S., has hit back with tariffs on Canadian exports including canola, seafood and pork. It has indicated it would remove some of the tariffs if Canada were to drop the 100% charge on EVs.

An editorial in China's state-run Global Times newspaper welcomed Carney's visit as a new starting point and called on Canada to lift “unreasonable tariff restrictions” and advance more pragmatic cooperation.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Monday that China looks forward to Carney's visit as an opportunity to “consolidate the momentum of improvement in China-Canada relations.”

Carney met Xi in late October in South Korea, where both were attending the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. 

He has also tried to mend ties with India, where relations deteriorated in 2024 after the Trudeau government accused India of being involved in the 2023 killing of a Sikh activist in Canada. The fallout led to tit-for-tat expulsions of senior diplomats, disruption of visa services, reduced consular staffing and a freeze on trade talks.

A cautious thaw began last June. Since then, both sides have restored some consular services and resumed diplomatic contacts. In November, Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand said the two countries would move quickly to advance a trade deal, noting the government's new foreign policy in response to Trump's trade war.

Carney is also expected to visit India later this year.

CHICAGO - The ex-husband of an Ohio dentist's wife, killed in a double murder, is expected in an Illinois courtroom Monday afternoon as extradition proceedings are expected to begin.

Michael David McKee, 39, was arrested after allegedly killing a couple in Columbus, Ohio, police and court records show. Police responded to a home in Columbus' Weinland Park neighborhood around 10 a.m. Dec. 30 and found Spencer Tepe, 37, and Monique Tepe, 39, both dead with gunshot wounds. McKee is Monique's ex-husband.

McKee was booked at the Winnebago County Sheriff's Office in Illinois just before noon Saturday, jail records show. He's facing upgraded premeditated aggravated murder charges in Ohio in relation to Spencer and Monique's death. 

Court records in Ohio show Monique filed for divorce in 2017 after getting married to McKee on August 22, 2015. McKee has lived in various states, including Virginia, Nevada and Illinois, since 2020, according to public records. McKee recently moved to Chicago, Illinois, and is a vascular surgeon in the Rockford, Illinois, area.

McKee is scheduled to appear in a Winnebago County (Illinois) court on Monday at 1:30 p.m., in what's expected to be related to his extradition to Ohio. 

Charging documents indicate police were able to identify McKee by linking him to a car that arrived in the Tepes' neighborhood shortly before the murders and left just after the homicide. The car was then located in Rockford, Illinois, and police found evidence it belonged to McKee.

Prior to McKee's arrest, Columbus police released surveillance video showing a "person of interest" walking in the alley near the Tepes' house in the early morning hours of Dec. 30.

A man could be seen walking slowly in what appeared to be a dark coat and light-colored pants.

Spencer and Monique Tepe were found dead on Dec. 30 at around 10:00 a.m., when a friend went to the couple's house and told a 911 operator that he could see a body inside.

"There's a body," the caller says. "Our friend wasn't answering his phone. We just did a wellness check. We just came here, and he appears dead. He's laying next to his bed, off of his bed in this blood. I can't get closer to see more than that."

The couple was killed one month short of celebrating their five-year wedding anniversary, Rob Misleh, Spencer's brother-in-law, told WSYX.

Fox News contributor Paul Mauro joins 'America's Newsroom' to share more details on Charlie Kirk's suspected assassin, as well as his roommate's potential culpability and the growing issue of how Gen Z's internet access can lead to radicalization.

The alleged assassination plots tied to Luigi Mangione and Tyler Robinson were chillingly deliberate, prosecutors say, yet both cases stumbled over the same unexpected hurdle — U.S. law doesn't offer a clear path to the top penalty when there is a political motive, but the victim doesn't come from a protected category.

Mangione, 27, is accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan on Dec. 4, 2024. He allegedly wrote political messages on shell casings recovered from the scene.

Months later, Robinson, 22, was accused of sniping Charlie Kirk as he spoke to a crowd at Utah Valley University in September, and, in an alleged copycat twist, also left behind casings with messages engraved in them.

Thompson, 50, and Kirk, 31, were both married fathers of two. Both of their murders have an alleged political motive. Yet prosecutors in each case have been forced to get creative with how they charged them in order to seek the maximum possible punishments — life without parole in New York and execution in Utah.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office had charged Mangione with terrorism enhancements in order to justify a first-degree murder charge under state law, which could have been punished with a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge threw that charge out, and Mangione faces a second-degree murder charge, which has a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole remaining.

While New York has a state-level terror charge, Utah doesn't.

"Interestingly, had [Robinson] been charged in federal court, it would've been a terrorist act, committing an act of political terror — but in the state system they don't have that same statute in charge, so they brought the murder case," said Greg Rogers, a UVU professor and former FBI agent. "It wasn't that they didn't believe they could prove a terrorism case in that matter, it was just that it was gonna be charged in state court rather than federal."

The New York judge overseeing Mangione's case "made a grievous error," he told Fox News Digital.

"They did charge terrorism, because they're actually convinced they could prove it," he said. "Terrorism statutes are, and this isn't an oversimplification, if you commit a homicide in furtherance of a political motive, which he allegedly did, that satisfies that statute."

"You essentially have a confession in the terrorism case, and in the homicide case you have it on video," he said. "[But] tens of thousands of people not only aren't even upset with him, they're totally supportive."

He cited the alleged journals Mangione kept, which referenced the plot and a potential motive as a condemnation of the U.S. health insurance industry — and also Mangione's fervent supporters, who have showed up to his court hearings dressed up in green as a reference to the Luigi character from "Super Mario Bros."

"How did we get to where tens of thousands of our citizens think this is great?" he added.

In Utah, in order to seek the death penalty, Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray's office charged Robinson with aggravated murder, alleging that he knowingly created a great risk of death to people in the crowd in addition to Kirk's slaying. That's an aggravating factor under Utah law.

LUIGI MANGIONE DEFENSE SAYS COPS PEDDLED BOGUS MOM QUOTE AS JUDGE WEIGHS IF EVIDENCE WILL MAKE IT TO TRIAL

But legal experts say that only a single shot was fired, which the defense is likely to use to challenge that aspect of the case.

"The death penalty was essentially outlawed back in 1972 when the Supreme Court thought that it was being applied arbitrarily," said Matt Mangino, a former district attorney of Lawrence County in Pennsylvania who wrote a book on capital punishment, "The Executioner's Toll, 2010."

To do that, he said, states implemented "bifurcated trials," where jurors decide on life or death after a conviction, and by creating the system of aggravating factors.

While the laws vary between states, aggravators often include targeting police officers, politicians, witnesses or young children. In Idaho, the aggravator prosecutors wanted to use against Bryan Kohberger was that he killed multiple people — but he pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty.

"It's no longer just enough to have a planned premeditated murder to be subject to the death sentence," Mangino told Fox News Digital. "There has to be something more."

Business leaders, like Thompson, or political figures who aren't office holders, like Kirk, don't meet those criteria, even if there's an alleged political motive, he said. And premeditated, cold-blooded murders are not uncommon.

"I think what we have to look at is, what does assassination mean? Does assassination mean that you've murdered somebody for some political purpose?" he said. "And that might be hard to really define in a way that it's fair."

Existing aggravators are easy to define, he said: a member of Congress, a young child, a witness expected to testify in an upcoming case.

"How do you define someone who doesn't fit into those specific categories that is outspoken about LGBT issues or is outspoken about immigration, how do you evaluate that?" he said. "I mean how famous do you have to be?"

Kirk was famous as a media personality and political commentator who founded Turning Point USA. Thompson was not a household name before his murder.

Without a clear definition for the crime of assassination, he said, prosecutors are left stretching existing laws — and risking reversals.

"I think you also open the door to the defense coming after you and saying, wait a second, why is my guy getting the death penalty under the aggravated circumstances of assassination when other people who are killed because they're politically motivated aren't getting it?" he added. "It opens the door on both ends, both to victims' families feeling as though they are not getting justice and defendants feeling as if they are being overcharged."

Mangione could still face the potential death penalty if he is convicted of pending federal charges related to Thompson's slaying.

Yoel & Mari Díaz, a husband-wife influencer duo who escaped communism, share why most Latinos are rejoicing in Nicolás Maduro's capture.

The U.S. operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has ignited sharp debate in Washington and abroad over whether the move undermines international norms — or delivers a deliberate deterrent message to rivals like China and Russia.

Critics argue that seizing the leader of a sovereign nation risks setting a dangerous precedent — one that adversaries could cite to justify their own military actions beyond their borders.

"My main concern now is that Russia will use this to justify their illegal and barbaric military actions against Ukraine, or China to justify an invasion of Taiwan," Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said in a statement.

"What will we say now if Putin tries to capture Zelenskyy?" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., asked.

Others counter that such norms have never constrained Moscow or Beijing, and that deterrence is shaped less by legal arguments than by demonstrations of power, speed and capability.

TOPPLING MADURO WAS EASY — GOVERNING VENEZUELA COULD TRAP US FOR YEARS

"I don't think Putin or Xi ever doubted that power overrides sovereignty," said Pedro Garmendia, a Washington-based geopolitical risk analyst. "What we've seen consistently from China and Russia is that they use rhetoric around international law when it suits them and ignore it when it doesn't."

For U.S. adversaries, the most jarring signal may not be diplomatic fallout but the stark demonstration of American lethality.

The operation resulted in the deaths of dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel, according to Venezuelan and Cuban authorities, as U.S. forces pushed through layers of armed resistance protecting Maduro. Cuban officials acknowledged the loss of multiple military and intelligence personnel deployed in Venezuela, while Venezuelan authorities confirmed heavy casualties among elite security units. Independent estimates place the total death toll — security forces and civilians combined — at several dozen.

President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged the nature of the mission, describing it afterward as a violent operation by necessity, given the threat environment and the presence of armed foreign forces embedded within Maduro's security apparatus. Trump argued the level of force reflected the reality of penetrating a defended capital and preventing Maduro from escaping or rallying loyalist units.

Analysts say that willingness to use decisive force — and to own it publicly — carries its own deterrent value.

Garmendia noted that Venezuela was no marginal partner for U.S. adversaries. 

"Both countries have invested tens of billions of dollars in the Chávez and then Maduro regime," he said. "Having the leader of that regime captured and taken into U.S. custody so suddenly — especially when a Chinese special envoy had just met with Maduro hours before — is frankly embarrassing to both countries."

Beyond casualties, the operation sent a second signal through its execution: speed, precision and deep preparation.

U.S. special operations forces spent months rehearsing the raid, including training on a full-scale replica of Maduro's compound. CIA officers built a detailed picture of Maduro's daily routines — tracking when he slept, where he traveled, how his security rotated and which locations offered the narrowest escape routes.

That intelligence allowed planners to identify a precise window when Maduro was most vulnerable. Airspace suppression, rapid insertion and coordinated ground movement unfolded in minutes, denying Venezuelan and allied forces time to respond effectively.

Trump later pointed to that preparation as evidence the operation was deliberate rather than impulsive, arguing that speed and overwhelming force were essential to prevent Maduro from slipping away or turning the operation into a prolonged firefight.

AFTER MADURO, VENEZUELA POWER VACUUM EXPOSES BRUTAL INSIDERS AND ENFORCERS

Former FBI counterintelligence operative Eric O'Neill said those details are likely to matter more to Beijing and Moscow than legal debates at the United Nations.

"At least while Trump is in office, it's going to look a lot like deterrence to China and Russia," O'Neill said. "They didn't even get a chance to blink before Maduro was gone."

O'Neill added that the execution underscored a broader message. 

"That sends a strong signal that the United States can find its adversaries anywhere in the world," he said, arguing rivals already inclined to violate international norms are unlikely to be emboldened by an action they lack the capability to replicate.

The final deterrent signal lies in experience: the institutional ability to plan and execute complex, intelligence-driven operations built on decades of counterterrorism and special operations campaigns.

U.S. officials point to the seamless integration of intelligence collection, rehearsal, logistics and kinetic force as evidence of a mature operational system that can be activated with little warning — an advantage adversaries must assume exists even when they cannot see it.

Concern has nevertheless been echoed by international institutions. 

Ravina Shamdasani, chief spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office, warned the operation could weaken global norms. 

"It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like," Shamdasani said, arguing the intervention "damages the architecture of international security and makes every country less safe."

China said it was "deeply shocked," condemning what it called the U.S.'s "blatant use of force against a sovereign state and its action against its president," and claiming it "seriously violates international law" and threatens stability in Latin America and the Caribbean.

The criticism comes as Beijing has intensified military pressure on Taiwan, including near-daily air incursions and large-scale exercises meant to signal its own willingness to use force.

Russia likewise denounced the U.S. operation at the United Nations as a violation of sovereignty and international law, even as it continues its war in Ukraine while rejecting international legal judgments and condemnation.

For U.S. strategists, that contrast reinforces the intended message: adversaries may invoke international law rhetorically, but what shapes their calculations is demonstrated capability — especially when paired with the experience to plan, rehearse and execute without warning.

Joseph Hernandez, a Cuban immigrant and N.Y. comptroller candidate, shares his family's experience fleeing communist Cuba and discusses the country's uncertain future after Maduro's capture, emphasizing its oil dependency on Venezuela.

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez declared Sunday that the island nation would defend itself "to the last drop of blood," responding to pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to strike a deal with Washington. 

President Trump had spoken about Cuba in a Truth Social post earlier in the day, urging that "they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE."

"Those who blame the Revolution for the severe economic shortages we suffer should hold their tongues out of shame. Because they know it and acknowledge it: they are the fruit of the draconian measures of extreme strangulation that the U.S. has been applying to us for six decades and now threatens to surpass," the Cuban wrote on X, according to a translation of the Spanish-language post. 

"#Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. No one dictates what we do. Cuba does not aggress; it is aggressed upon by the United States for 66 years, and it does not threaten; it prepares, ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood," he wrote in another post, according to the translation.

U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., who was born in Cuba, responded to the foreign figure's post.

"You dictators, henchmen, and executioners of the Cuban nation think you own the island. You don't have much time left," he declared, according to the translation of his post, also written in Spanish.

Trump declared in a Truth Social post on Sunday, "Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services' for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE! Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last weeks U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn't need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.

"Venezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will. THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE," he warned.

Rep. Gimenez thanked the president.

"I was born in Cuba & forced from home shortly after the Communist takeover. Today, I represent my community in Congress. Thank you, President Trump, first Venezuela & next is Cuba. We will be forever grateful. Our hemisphere must be the hemisphere of liberty," the lawmaker wrote in a post on X.

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP)
























The Golden Globes had some predictable stuff, like “One Battle After Another” and “Adolescence” cleaning up and host Nikki Glaser making fun of the age of Leonardo DiCaprio's partners.

But there were also some sweet moments, like when “Adolescence” star Erin Doherty, who played a child therapist, won the trophy for best female actor in a supporting role on television — and thanked therapists. 

Or when George Clooney, who was sitting at the lip of the stage, gallantly helped Jean Smart up to the podium and later hugged his former “ER” co-star Noah Wyle on his way to accepting best TV drama for “The Pitt.”

There were some weird moments, too, like when Rose Byrne explained why her partner and fellow actor Bobby Cannavale wasn't there to see her win: He was at a reptile expo in New Jersey because the family was getting a bearded dragon.

A sweet occasion was when “Pluribus” star Rhea Seehorn, onstage to accept her acting award for a TV drama, first told presenter Queen Latifah that she met her 20 years ago while she was between jobs and the rapper-actor was “so nice.” 

Other moments included a Golden embrace of Brazilian filmmaking, Seth Rogen having deja vu, Amy Poehler dunking on NPR and “KPop Demon Hunters” singer-songwriter Ejae encouraging viewers to keep striving.








Wagner Moura won the Golden Globe for lead actor in a movie drama, becoming the second Brazilian to take home a Globes acting prize after Fernanda Torres' win last year for “I'm Still Here.”

Moura in “The Secret Agent” plays a former professor forced into hiding while trying to protect his young son during Brazil's military dictatorship of the 1970s. The movie also won the Globe for best non-English film.

“‘The Secret Agent' is a film about memory — or the lack of memory — and generational trauma,” Moura said in his acceptance speech. “I think that if trauma can be passed along generations, values can too. So this is to the ones that are sticking with their values in difficult moments.” 

Moura is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in Netflix's “Narcos,” which ran from 2015 to 2017 and earned him a Golden Globe nomination in 2016. He was also in 2024's “Civil War.”

On Sunday, he brushed aside competition from Joel Edgerton in “Train Dreams,” Oscar Isaac from “Frankenstein,” Dwayne Johnson in “The Smashing Machine,” Michael B. Jordan in “Sinners” and Jeremy Allen White from “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere.”

Last year, Brazil earned its first Oscar win in the international film category for “I'm Still Here.”





Seth Rogen won his first Golden Globe only months after his showbiz satire “The Studio” set an entire episode at the same awards ceremony.

“This is so weird! We just pretended to do this and now it is happening!” Rogen said, cradling his trophy. “I thought the only way I would get to hold one is to create a whole show to give myself a fake one.”

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP)



The Golden Globe episode of “The Studio” follows Rogen's studio executive, Matt, as he attends the Globes, where he's obsessed with the idea that his name gets mentioned in an acceptance speech.

In his actual winning speech, Rogen thanked his fellow nominees, calling out “Only Murders in the Building” duo Steve Martin and Martin Short. “I remember growing up watching you guys, my whole life thinking, ‘One day I'm going to beat them.'” He then laughed, adding “I did not think that.”





“Good Hang with Amy Poehler” won the inaugural best podcast award and the host had a joke about her rivals at National Public Radio.

“I know that I am new to this game. I have great respect for this form,” Poehler said. “I have great respect for everyone I am nominated with. I am big fans of all of you — except for NPR: just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. Try harder.”

Poehler's show beat out “Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,” “Call Her Daddy,” “The Mel Robbins Podcast,” “SmartLess” and “Up First,” from NPR. (She also beat her ex-husband Will Arnett, part of “SmartLess.”)

It is Poehler's second Globe, having won one in 2014 for “Parks and Recreation.” She said her podcast is an attempt to make a “rough and unkind world filled with a little bit more love and laughter.”

The podcast nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from conservative-leaning programs like “The Megyn Kelly Show,” “The Tucker Carlson Show,” “The Ben Shapiro Show,” Candace Owen's “Candace” and “The Joe Rogan Experience.”





“Golden” from “KPop Demon Hunters ” won the Globe for best original song and one of its songwriters had a lesson to others struggling to be heard.

“When I was a little girl, I worked tirelessly for 10 years to fill one dream — to become a K-pop idol. I was rejected, and disappointed that my voice wasn't good enough,” said co-singer Ejae, who also co-wrote the track with Mark Sonnenblick and Lee Hee-joon. “Now I'm here as a singer and a songwriter.”

“So it's a dream come true to be part of a song that is helping other girls, other boys and everyone of all ages to get through their hardship and to accept themselves,” Ejae added.

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP)



The “KPop Demon Hunters” soundtrack has topped the charts — debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200. The movie also won the Globe for best animated film.

“Golden” contains the lyrics: “Waited so long to break these walls down/To wake up and feel like me/Put these patterns all in the past now/And finally live like the girl they all see.”



“Adolescence” won four Golden Globes and writer Jack Thorne highlighted the young people in the show's cast, saying, “You are proof the world can be better.”

“Removing hate is our generation's responsibility. It requires thought from the top down. The possibility seems remote right now, but hope is a beautiful thing,” he added.

(Kevork Djansezian/CBS Broadcasting via AP)



The Netflix four-part series, which traces the emotional fallout after a U.K. teenager's stabbing, has become a sensation. It won eight Emmy Awards last year, including outstanding limited or anthology series.

On Sunday, “Adolescence” won Globes for best limited series, anthology series, or motion picture made for television; TV male supporting actor for Owen Cooper; TV female supporting actor for Erin Doherty; and TV lead male actor for Stephen Graham.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Nikki Glaser went hard then eased up in her monologue to open Sunday's Golden Globes. 

In her earliest jokes she suggested stars in the room might be in the Epstein Files and took a shot at CBS, the network airing the show. 

“There are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” she said. “And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department.” 

She segued into mocking the recent woes at CBS News and its killing of a critical “60 Minutes” story about the Trump Administration sending immigrants to a prison in El Salvador. 

“The award for most editing goes to CBS News,” she said. “Yes, CBS News: America's newest place to see BS news.”

She didn't bring up Venezuela, a subject she told The Associated Press this week she was considering mentioning, but worried it would already be old news in the chaotic moment. And there was no mention of ICE. 

Glaser also told the AP she was struggling to find a joke about Julia Roberts, saying she was so beloved and respected that nothing Glaser tried with her comedy club test audiences was landing. 

She found a way to come at it sideways. 

“Just like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts,” she said, and got the big laugh she was looking for. 

It was Glaser's second time hosting the show. She was quickly rehired after getting strong reviews in her first outing last year. She was hired the first time after the ruthless roast she gave the attendees of the Netflix roast of Tom Brady. She's been kinder on the Globes, but her jokes still had some bite. 




She made the obligatory joke about Leonardo DiCaprio dating young women. 

“You've worked with every great director. You've won three Golden Globes and an Oscar,” she said. “And the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.”

She then went meta and apologized for being so obvious.

“Leo, I'm sorry I made that joke, it's cheap. You know what, I tried not to, but like, we don't know anything else about you, man. Like, there's nothing else, like open up!” she said, getting a bigger laugh than she did for the first joke, especially from DiCaprio himself. 

She focused on the lean frame of Timothée Chalamet in her inevitable joke about the nominee — and later winner — for “Marty Supreme,” calling him “the first actor in history to have to put on muscle for a movie about ping pong. This is true. He gained over 60 ounces.”

During the show, she stood in the audience and gave a presentation on the ballroom's layout. 

“To my right are the tables for ‘Hamnet,' ‘All Her Fault' and ‘Bugonia,'” she said, “an area we're calling ‘traumatized woman alley.' We'll never find out where ‘traumatized men alley' is because they're not allowed to tell us.” 

Like last year when she merged “Wicked” and “Conclave” into the aborted gag song “Popeular,” she started at one point to sing a deliberately hacky song.

This time she pretended to accidentally say “K-Pong Demon Hunters” before shedding her dress to show athletic wear underneath, grabbing a ping pong paddle-shaped microphone and merging “Marty Supreme” with “KPop Demon Hunters” to the tune of the latter's best original song winner “Golden.” 

“Marty” co-star Fran Drescher soon stepped out to cut Glaser off, saying in her famous nasal rasp, “You have to stop singing, your voice is so annoying.”

But Glaser was also on the receiving end of one joke, from Judd Apatow, who told a story before presenting best director. 

“Nikki Glaser used to be our babysitter,” he said. “That's true. She was our babysitter. And she's like, ‘I do standup comedy.' And then I went online to watch her set and it was all about smoking reefer and having weird sex and then she stopped being our babysitter.”

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jauan Jennings hid his eyes behind sunglasses, but could not hide his emotions with the San Francisco 49ers set to play an NFC postseason rubber match in Seattle.

The 49ers wideout-turned-backup quarterback slammed his fists on the table and essentially told the Seahawks to bring it on. He leaned into the microphone and yelled, “CAN'T WAIT!” before he walked off with a knowing smile that perhaps the best in San Francisco was yet to come.

The 49ers are in for a playoff treat, thanks in large part to a pretty neat trick pulled off by Jennings.

Brock Purdy threw a go-ahead 4-yard touchdown pass to Christian McCaffrey late in the fourth quarter, San Francisco used a trick play on a TD toss from Jennings to McCaffrey, and the 49ers eliminated the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles with a 23-19 wild-card victory Sunday.

“We went to the Super Bowl,” Jennings said. “So, we've got to top that.”

Maybe if the Eagles watched that 49ers' Super Bowl loss to Kansas City after the 2023 season, they wouldn't have been so caught by surprise by the play. A former high school quarterback, Jennings threw a TD pass on a similar play in the Super Bowl and this one to McCaffrey put him on a list with Purdy, Joe Montana and Steve Young as 49ers QBs who have thrown for multiple career touchdowns in the postseason.

How's that for heady company?

The play was called “Skyy Bang reverse pass” — in honor of wide receiver Skyy Moore — and the double reverse was suggested by offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak. 




“It was a hell of suggestion,” coach Kyle Shanahan said.

The not-so Philly special was quite a way to put a dagger in the Super Bowl champs' season. 

The 49ers head to top-seeded Seattle next weekend for an NFC divisional playoff game. The NFC West rivals split the season series. BetMGM put the Seahawks as early 6 1/2-point favorites.

Purdy threw for 262 yards and got the road win in Philadelphia he failed to get three seasons ago when he was injured in a dismal outing in Philadelphia in a loss in the NFC title game.

Purdy had two passes intercepted in this one by All-Pro cornerback Quinyon Mitchell, but the Eagles scored just three points off the turnovers.

The 49ers could head to Seattle without star tight end George Kittle, who was carted off the field with a right Achilles tendon injury late in the first half.

The Eagles — who won a Super Bowl on a trick play — were foiled by one when Jennings was pitched the ball and rolled right and hit McCaffrey for an over-the-shoulder catch and a 29-yard touchdown. The score on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the 49ers a 17-16 lead.

“I looked up, the ball's in the air and Christian tracked it,” Purdy said. ”It was wobbling in the wind. The fact that Christian caught it over his shoulder, dude, I was like, ‘Oh my gosh.'”

Jennings had 66 yards receiving and 48 rushing in addition to his TD pass.

“JJ thinks he can make every play known to man,” Shanahan said.

The Eagles would only get Jake Elliott's 33-yard field goal in the quarter for a brief 19-17 lead. 

Philadelphia was again doomed by a lethargic offensive effort under embattled offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo that cost it a shot at a repeat championship. Super Bowl MVP Jalen Hurts threw for only 168 yards and a touchdown and the Eagles failed to build off a 13-10 halftime lead by totaling only 36 total yards in the third quarter on 16 plays. 

Hurts was incomplete on a last-gasp fourth-and-11 attempt with 43 seconds left that ended their final drive.

“I just didn't make the play,' Hurts said. ”I own it. I own it all.”

The game never reached its offensive slugfest potential after the teams traded touchdowns on their opening drives.

Purdy, rendered ineffective by a torn ligament in his right elbow on the opening drive against the Eagles in a disastrous NFC title game loss three seasons ago, completed all three passes for 74 yards and capped the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Demarcus Robinson.

The Eagles tied it on a 1-yard sweep by Dallas Goedert, their red zone go-to ace with 11 TD receptions who became the first tight end to rush for a score in NFL postseason history.

The Eagles turned again to Goedert on fourth down when Hurts hit him for a 9-yard TD that made it 13-7.

Eddy Pineiro kicked a 36-yarder for the 49ers that cut it to 13-10 at halftime.

The 49ers took it from there and hope to pull off their second road win of the season in Seattle.

“It's just cool for everybody across the board to be able to have this kind of win and celebrate all the stuff that we've been through,” Purdy said.

Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown had to be separated from coach Nick Sirianni by chief security officer Dom DiSandro during a sideline blowup late in the first half. Brown ripped off his helmet in frustration and yelled more in Sirianni's direction after the Eagles punted to end a drive.

Kittle was pushed out of bounds on a 6-yard reception and grabbed the back of his lower right leg. He was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Eagles running back Saquon Barkley ran for 106 yards, but was slow to get up on a run in the fourth quarter. He used the stationary bike on the sideline to stay loose.

49ers: The 49ers won 17-13 in Seattle in the season opener only for the Seahawks to return the favor with a 13-3 win in the season finale.

Eagles: Could make yet another change at offensive coordinator as they try not to waste more prime years from Hurts, Barkley and the receivers.

— 

This story has been corrected to fix the go-ahead touchdown pass to 4 yards, not 6 yards.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Federal agents carrying out immigration arrests in Minnesota's Twin Cities region already shaken by the fatal shooting of a woman rammed the door of one home Sunday and pushed their way inside, part of what the Department of Homeland Security has called its largest enforcement operation ever.

In a dramatic scene similar to those playing out across Minneapolis, agents captured a man in the home just minutes after pepper spraying protesters outside who had confronted the heavily armed federal agents. Along the residential street, protesters honked car horns, banged on drums and blew whistles in attempts to disrupt the operation.

Video of the clash taken by The Associated Press showed some agents pushing back protesters while a distraught woman later emerged from the house with a document that federal agents presented to arrest the man. Signed by an immigration officer, the document — unlike a warrant signed by a judge — does not authorize forced entry into a private residence. A warrant signed by an immigration officer only authorizes arrest in a public area.

Immigrant advocacy groups have conducted extensive “know-your-rights” campaigns urging people not to open their doors unless agents have a court order signed by a judge.

But within minutes of ramming the door in a neighborhood filled with single-family homes, the handcuffed man was led away. 

More than 2,000 immigration arrests have been made in Minnesota since the enforcement operation began at the beginning of December, said Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News on Sunday that the administration would send additional federal agents to Minnesota to protect immigration officers and continue enforcement.

The Twin Cities — the latest target in President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement campaign — is bracing for what is next after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by an immigration officer on Wednesday.

“We're seeing a lot of immigration enforcement across Minneapolis and across the state, federal agents just swarming around our neighborhoods,” said Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city councilmember. “They've definitely been out here.”

Chavez, the son of Mexican immigrants who represents an area with a growing immigrant population, said he is closely monitoring information from chat groups about where residents are seeing agents operating.

People holding whistles positioned themselves in freezing temperatures on street corners Sunday in the neighborhood where Good was killed, watching for any signs of federal agents.

More than 20,000 people have taken part in a variety of trainings to become “observers” of enforcement activities in Minnesota since the 2024 election, said Luis Argueta, a spokesperson for Unidos MN, a local human rights organization .

“It's a role that people choose to take on voluntarily, because they choose to look out for their neighbors,” Argueta said.

The protests have been largely peaceful, but residents remained anxious. On Monday, Minneapolis public schools will start offering remote learning for the next month in response to concerns that children might feel unsafe venturing out while tensions remain high. 

Many schools closed last week after Good's shooting and the upheaval that followed.

While the enforcement activity continues, two of the state's leading Democrats said that the investigation into Good's shooting death should not be overseen solely by the federal government.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and U.S. Sen. Tina Smith said in separate interviews Sunday that state authorities should be included in the investigation because the federal government has already made clear what it believes happened.

“How can we trust the federal government to do an objective, unbiased investigation, without prejudice, when at the beginning of that investigation they have already announced exactly what they saw — what they think happened,” Smith said on ABC's “This Week.”

The Trump administration has defended the officer who shot Good in her car, saying he was protecting himself and fellow agents and that Good had “weaponized” her vehicle.

Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, defended the officer on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing.” 

“That law enforcement officer had milliseconds, if not short time to make a decision to save his life and his other fellow agents,” he said.

Lyons also said the administration's enforcement operations in Minnesota wouldn't be needed “if local jurisdictions worked with us to turn over these criminally illegal aliens once they are already considered a public safety threat by the locals.” 

The killing of Good by an ICE officer and the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland, Oregon, led to dozens of protests in cities across the country over the weekend, including New York, Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and Oakland, California.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday night that he is considering “very strong options” for a U.S. military response to Iran‘s violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters.

“We're looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options. We'll make a determination,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

Trump also revealed that Iran has reached out about negotiating a possible nuclear deal after Trump withdrew the United States from the previous one during his first term. But he stressed that the U.S. “may have to act before a meeting,” adding that the regime is “starting” to cross his red line, where he previously vowed U.S. intervention if it killed protesters.

“They're starting to [cross it]. It looks like [it]. There seem to be some people killed that aren't supposed to be killed. … They rule through violence,” he said.

The president added that he is receiving “hourly” reports on the situation, which is worsening.

Multiple U.S.-based human rights groups have indicated that the death toll from the protests is now over 500, just two weeks after they began in late December 2025. Arrests also number in the tens of thousands.

IRAN SAYS US AND ISRAEL ‘LEGITIMATE TARGETS' IF TRUMP ORDERS STRIKES OVER PROTESTS

Iran has previously threatened preemptive strikes on nearby U.S. bases if Trump were to green light a military response.

Trump warned on Sunday that if that were to happen, the U.S. “will hit them harder than they imagine.”

            Federal prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his June testimony before Congress about the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation of its headquarters in Washington, DC.
    


            The stunning action against the independent Federal Reserve was met with an equally extraordinary statement posted by Powell in a video Sunday night, in which he said the investigation was a direct result from his ongoing struggle with the administration over interest rates. Powell said it was a consequence of broader “threats and ongoing pressure” by the administration.
    


            “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell said in a statement late Sunday.
    


            The probe sends a chilling message to Powell – and to whomever might next lead the Fed. President Donald Trump's unyielding attacks on the Fed chair, whom the president has said he will not renominate, have hammered on the Fed's traditional political independence. Trump has even said he should have a say in rate decisions.
    


            But the criminal probe takes Trump's fight with the Fed to a whole new level. It shows that whoever Trump selects to replace Powell at the conclusion of his term in May will face continuing pressure from the administration to lower interest rates.
    


            Investors and economists across the globe prize the Fed's independence. It guarantees policymakers will think of the long-term ramifications of setting monetary policy – and not short-term political whims – when steering the economy.
    


            On Sunday, Powell directly linked the probe to the question of the Fed's independence and its ability to set interest rates without political interference.
    


            “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions—or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”
    


            Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin declined to comment on the investigation but said in a statement to CNN that the attorney general wants to “prioritize investigating any abuse of tax payer dollars.”
    


            The White House referred CNN to the DOJ statement. In an interview with NBC News on Sunday, Trump denied knowledge of the investigation, saying, “I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings.”
    


            Trump and his allies have repeatedly slammed Powell over the past year for not cutting interest rates to the president's liking. The Fed in the second half of last year lowered rates three times in row, though officials have recently said they're unlikely to lower rates again for a while.
    


            Trump's pressure campaign has included a barrage of personal insults at Powell, evolving into threats to fire the Fed chair. However, Powell has maintained that Trump does not have the authority to fire him.
    


            Later in the year Trump targeted Fed Governor Lisa Cook, appointed by then-President Joe Biden. The president and his allies accused Cook of mortgage fraud. Trump cited the allegations when he fired her in August, although Cook has not been charged criminally. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments later this month on whether Trump can terminate Cook.
    


            The Fed's renovation has also been a source of ongoing controversy. Powell testified before Congress in June, saying the renovation was a collaboration with various agencies and that costs had changed over time.
    


            Trump has threatened to sue Powell over the renovation. Last month, the president said he was considering “a suit against Powell for incompetence.”
    


            Trump allies such as Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought have claimed the project was mismanaged. But the Fed says the upgrades to its decades-old buildings were necessary, including removing asbestos and upgrading electrical and ventilation systems.
    


            The acrimony spilled out into public view in July, when Trump joined Powell on a tour of the project. Powell corrected Trump in front of reporters about the cost of the project, with the tension between the two men palpable.
    


            The federal probe comes as Trump prepares to announce his pick for Powell's replacement once his term ends in May. The decision will cap a months-long search process for arguably the most influential role in the global economy.
    


            Trump has hinted that the next Fed chair might be National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, though he has also recently interviewed Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, and is expected to interview BlackRock Global Fixed Income Chief Investment Officer Rick Rieder.
    


            Trump has said he will announce his pick “early” this year.
    


            After the federal probe became public late Sunday, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said in a post on X that he will “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed—including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy—until this legal matter is fully resolved.” Tillis is not seeking re-election.
    


            Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts echoed that in a statement Sunday: “The Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.”
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, also criticized the move, saying in a statement: “Trump's assault on the Fed's independence continues, threatening the strength and stability of our economy.”
    


            “This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,” Schumer said in a statement.
    


            Investors and analysts also fretted about the probe and what it could mean for the world's largest economy.
    


            “We are stunned by this deeply disturbing development which came out of the blue after a period in which tensions between Trump and the Fed seemed to be contained,” wrote Krishna Guha, vice chairman at Evercore ISI, in a note.
    


            “At the time of writing we are still looking to get more information and context, but on the face of it, it looks as if the administration and the central bank are now in open war…”

Meta on Monday announced it has appointed Dina Powell McCormick as its president and vice chairman.

Powell McCormick joined Meta's board in April but resigned in December, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In her new role, Meta said Powell McCormick will serve as a member of the company's management team and will help guide its strategy and execution. 

"Dina's experience at the highest levels of global finance, combined with her deep relationships around the world, makes her uniquely suited to help Meta manage this next phase of growth as the company's President and Vice Chairman," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.

Prior to joining Meta, Powell McCormick served as deputy national security advisor to President Donald Trump, and she served under Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in President George W. Bush's administration. 

Powell McCormick marks the second former member of the Trump administration that Meta has hired in recent weeks. The company said earlier this month that it has hired a new chief legal officer, Curtis Joseph Mahoney, who previously served as a deputy U.S. trade representative during Trump's first term.

"Congratulations to DINA POWELL MCCORMICK, WHO HAS JUST BEEN NAMED THE NEW PRESIDENT OF META. A great choice by Mark Z!!! She is a fantastic, and very talented, person, who served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction!," Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday. 

Powell McCormick also spent 16 years in senior leadership roles at Goldman Sachs, and most recently acted as an executive at BDT & MSD Partners.

A rising number of supply chain managers say that President Donald Trump's tariffs and associated costs are leading to layoffs and a lower confidence about investments needed to grow their businesses.

Double the percentage of supply chain managers (32%) are reporting layoffs as compared to April (16%), according to a new survey conducted by the Association for Supply Chain Management and CNBC.

"Tariffs just don't hit the balance sheet. They hit the people," said Abe Eshkenazi, CEO of ASCM. "We're seeing layoffs because of companies trying to manage their cost structure. If you don't have the necessary resources and the capabilities and knowledge of talented staff, it will have a long-term impact." 

While the national unemployment rate has only ticked higher rather than spiked since April when Trump's broad tariffs were first introduced, job growth last year was at its lowest outside of a recession since the early 2000s, according to the December jobs report issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. What some are calling a "hiring recession" is typified by rising long-term unemployment and anemic job creation, which has stalled since April.

A majority of respondents (65%) reported at least a 10-15% increase in costs, which according to ASCM, can be a "major shock" reshaping budgets, strategy, and the viability of some businesses. Thirty-four percent of those respondents cited an increase in costs greater than 15%.

While companies across the economy are anxiously awaiting a decision from the Supreme Court over the legality of many of Trump's tariffs and the potential for refunds, Eshkenazi said broader business impacts can't easily be reversed.

"The Supreme Court decision may settle a lot of legal questions, but not a lot of the operational, the financial, and the human impact that we've already seen," he said. "Investing is impacted because you have shorter planning cycles and time horizons, which make it harder for organizations to plan. Right now, you're in a constant firefighting mode as opposed to a planning mode," Eshkenazi added.

The survey of supply chain managers in sectors across the economy was conducted between Dec. 15, 2025 and Jan. 7, 2026 across over 220 respondents. It was the ASCM's third tariffs-related survey in the past year, and the first conducted in conjunction with CNBC.

Businesses, both large and small, have told CNBC that even if court-ordered refunds recoup some of the costs resulting from Trump's trade policy, they cannot make up for time lost due to a decrease in productivity from the added administrative hours needed to file paperwork for the expansive tariffs. 

"Navigating the tariffs is an administrative burden," Eshkenazi said. "We're spending a huge amount of time tracking rule changes, validating a lot of the codes, and trying to find the most effective way to operate in the short term without a long-term plan."

In addition to the time-consuming paperwork, business owners tell CNBC some of the costs related to tariffs would not be covered by refunds. Baby products company Lalo, which paid limited tariffs before the tariffs Trump issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was required by U.S. Customs to put up collateral to secure customs bonds as a guarantee the company can pay the tariff bill. 

"We never had to do that before," said Michael Wieder, co-founder of Lalo. "This was on top of the millions we paid in tariffs. We have hundreds of thousands of dollars held as collateral on our customs bond," he said.

These capital challenges are not unusual, according to Eshkenazi. "The money in these bonds is essentially dead money," he said. 

The price of customs bonds covers 10% of the duties and taxes paid over a rolling 12-month period. "So if duties and taxes go up, the customs bond goes up as well," said Lori Mullins, director of operations at Rogers & Brown Custom Brokers. Importers need to provide the bond surety company with audited financials for the previous year showing that they have the funds to support the bond amount. "If the importer does not have the funds, the bond surety will require collateral, and in many cases, that's done in the form of a letter of credit. This is why funds stay tied up," Mullins said.

Normally, funds are held for 314 days by Customs until the duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive government sign off.  

During that period of time, the cash from the business put into the bonds does not earn any interest. "I could be using that money to grow my business or even have it in an account that was accruing interest. This is taking money away from small businesses to use as working capital and sell more product. It is hurting our business," Wieder said.

Business owners have previously told CNBC that it is unrealistic to think they will be made whole even if they are refunded tariffs by a Supreme Court decision, with many saying they are also on the hook for high-interest predatory loans taken out to pay the tariffs.

Eshkenazi said members of his association are telling him the money they are spending on tariffs and associated costs is just a tax dragging down their supply chain. "You can't resource and requalify staff overnight," he said. "This isn't just about resilience and reacting to the court ruling. It's about having certainty in the U.S. economy, and what kind of pricing models they can plan on."

The economic outlook among the survey respondents was mixed, with 38% of supply chain professionals negative; 27% neutral; and 35% positive. Over half (56%) are concerned about a recession, yet it is roughly a third of those respondents that have a neutral or negative view of the economy, causing what the ASCM says is a "fuzzy and uncertain picture of the U.S. economy.

"This disconnect reflects confusion and a lack of confidence for companies to plan for the future," Eshkenazi said. Among the 56 percent of ASCM members that fear a recession, two-thirds think it may begin in the second quarter. "That is not good for companies looking to make investments," he added.

President Donald Trump will face an important obstacle — from within his own party — as he seeks to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Sunday he will block any Trump appointees to the central bank, including for the new chair, in light of revelations over the weekend that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential perjury charges.

"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question," Tillis said in a statement.

"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved," he added.

That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate.

Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the "one big beautiful bill" spending package last year.

Powell's position isn't the only one at stake.

Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.

However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed.

"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure," Powell said.

Tillis isn't the only banking panel member to criticize Trump over the move.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell "a dangerous man" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a "sock puppet" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates.

"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair," Warren said in a statement.

While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he can stay on as governor until 2028. He has not indicated yet whether he will do so.

The White House has been conducting an extensive search for the new chair, with the candidate field whittled down to five. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.

CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.

Happy Monday. I find myself at an impasse trying to decide what to write in this intro. As someone who's committed to their skincare routine, I should write about this story on the latest men's beauty trend. But as a Michigan native, I'd be remiss not to mention GM's new headquarters in Detroit.

Stock futures are down this morning. The stock market is coming off a winning week.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced last night that he was under criminal investigation tied to the central bank's building renovations. Powell's statement marks a significant escalation of the conflict between the central bank chief and President Donald Trump over the Fed's stance on interest rates.

Here's what to know:

Bank earnings are top of mind for investors this week as they gear up for another corporate earnings season. But there's another notable sector event taking place this month: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon's 20th year in the role.

As CNBC's Hugh Son reports, some are wondering if JPMorgan Chase's era of dominance will conclude when the executive departs. It's unclear exactly when Dimon plans to step down, but the succession timeline is of particular interest as the CEO nears his 70th birthday.

JPMorgan helps kickstart earnings season tomorrow, followed by peers including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs later in the week.

Bank stocks plunged in premarket trading today after Trump said there should be a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year.

Walmart and Google are teaming up. Gemini, Google's artificial intelligence assistant, will help shoppers discover and purchase products from the retailer and its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, the companies announced yesterday.

It's not yet clear when the new feature will launch or what the financial terms were, but the plan is to begin in the U.S. before expanding abroad. As CNBC's Melissa Repko notes, Walmart struck a similar deal with OpenAI's ChatGPT — a Gemini rival — in October.

Google also launched the Universal Commerce Protocol yesterday, which the tech giant hopes will become an industry standard among shopping agents looking for and purchasing products.

This week, Boeing is expected to report its highest airplane delivery volume for 2025 since 2018. As CNBC's Leslie Josephs points out, it's a symbol of the plane builder's turnaround efforts following years of reputation-marring safety crises.

Looking ahead, Boeing is planning to ramp up production of the 737 Max and 787 Dreamliners. Such increases can help the company swing back to profitability like Wall Street expects this year.

Speaking of air travel, Allegiant said yesterday that it was acquiring rival budget carrier Sun Country in a $1.5 billion deal comprised of cash and stock. This agreement comes as value-focused airlines have grappled with surging costs stemming from the pandemic.

The blockbuster GLP-1 market has been centered around weekly injections. But as CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino reports, obesity pills can bring the industry into its next chapter in 2026.

Patients have begun receiving the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk to take daily. Rival Eli Lilly is expected to have a similar product winning regulatory approval within months.

The pills aren't expected to offer more weight loss. But they can be seen as a simpler and possibly more affordable alternative to the shots, in turn expanding the market. Pills can entice new patients who were potentially deterred by needles, or those who did not see losing weight as a high enough priority to get a weekly shot.

Here's what we're keeping an eye on this week:

Some retailers provided early holiday results on Monday that showed the crucial shopping season was solid, but didn't blow away expectations. 

Lululemon, which is preparing for a new CEO and staring down a proxy battle with its founder, said in a release it expects its holiday quarter to be "toward the high end" of its previously released guidance. Shoe maker Birkenstock and thrift store Savers Value Village also released lackluster early holiday results, while Abercrombie & Fitch cut the high end of its guidance. Meanwhile, American Eagle and Five Below bucked the trend and raised their guidance after better-than-expected holiday results. 

Lululemon said it expects fiscal fourth quarter revenue to be close to $3.60 billion and earnings to be close to $4.76 per share. Both figures are at the high end of the guidance the company released in December when it announced fiscal third-quarter earnings. 

It made no changes to its previous guidance for gross margin, effective tax rate and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Shares were about 1% higher in morning trading.

"We remain focused on executing our action plan to drive improvement in our U.S. business and look forward to the opportunities in front of us," finance chief Meghan Frank said in a statement. 

When announcing last quarter's earnings on Dec. 11, outgoing CEO Calvin McDonald said the company was "encouraged" by its early holiday performance but acknowledged wide discounting had driven demand during the Thanksgiving holiday period. When the shopping stretch ended, trends slowed, he said at the time. 

Like other higher-end brands, Lululemon has historically been very selective with discounts, but it has used them more liberally in recent quarters to offload old merchandise and styles that weren't resonating with shoppers. 

During its fiscal third quarter, margins fell by 2.9 percentage points, due primarily to higher tariffs and the bigger markdowns, it said at the time. 

Abercrombie & Fitch shares dropped more than 18% in morning trading after the retailer cut the high end of its guidance despite posting what it called "record" quarter-to-date sales. 

It's now expecting full-year sales to grow "at least 6%," down from a prior range of between 6% and 7%. It anticipates its operating margin, a closely watched metric on Wall Street, will be around 13%, compared to a previously expected range of between 13% and 13.5%. The company expects earnings per share to be between $10.30 and $10.40, trimmed from prior guidance of between $10.20 and $10.50. 

"Our team remained on offense across product, voice, and experience, resulting in record quarter-to-date net sales through fiscal December, aligned with our expectations," CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. "Importantly, we delivered balanced growth across our regions, brands, and channels."

Birkenstock, which didn't provide specific holiday-quarter guidance last year, said it expects sales in the quarter ended Dec. 31 to grow 11% to €402 million ($470 million). Shares rose about 2% in early trading.

Savers Value Village saw sales grow 8.4% during its holiday quarter, with comparable sales up 5.4%, excluding the impact of an extra week the company had in its calendar. Despite relatively strong growth, the company only reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 adjusted net income and EBITDA outlooks. Shares were slightly higher in premarket trading. 

On the other side of the aisle, American Eagle said its holiday quarter was far better than expected, with quarter-to-date comparable sales through Jan. 3 "up in the high single digits" and sales trends positive across brands and channels. 

Comparable sales at its namesake banner grew by a low single digit percentage, while comps at its intimates line Aerie were up "in the low twenties." 

American Eagle said the "record" season led it to raise its fourth quarter operating income to a range of $167 million to $170 million, up from $155 million to $160 million. 

"Momentum continued in the fourth quarter with record December sales fueled by the power of our brands, with particularly strong growth at Aerie and Offline and sequential growth at American Eagle," CEO Jay Schottenstein said in a news release. "Our customers embraced new product collections and responded to our latest marketing initiatives, with strength continuing in the post-holiday period." 

Even so, the company's stock dropped 9% on Monday.

Five Below said quarter-to-date sales as of Jan. 3 rose 23.2%, while comparable sales climbed 14.5%. 

"We are incredibly pleased with our holiday performance, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the strategies we have been executing this year. With our maniacal focus on the customer: the kid and the kid in all of us, we offered amazing, trend-right products at exceptional value and began to create a better-connected customer journey," CEO Winnie Park said in a news release. "In combination with tight-knit collaboration and alignment throughout the company, we drove strong, broad-based results." 

The company is now expecting fiscal fourth quarter sales to be around $1.71 billion, up from a previous range of between $1.58 billion and $1.61 billion, as it roughly doubled its comparable sales outlook to 14%, up from between 6% and 8%. 

It's expecting earnings per share to be between $3.93 to $3.98, up from previous guidance of between $3.34 to $3.52.  Five Below expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.95 and $4, up from a prior range of between $3.36 to $3.54 per share. 

The company's shares slid about 1% in morning trading.

The early results, which were announced ahead of the annual ICR conference in Orlando, Florida, show what many analysts had expected for the holiday shopping season. There will continue to be standouts with strong growth, but across the board, Wall Street largely anticipates results will be solid without massive, widespread gains in consumer spending. 

The National Retail Federation previously forecasted retail sales in November and December would rise between 3.7% and 4.2% compared to 2024. That's solid growth, but when higher prices from tariffs are taken into account, some analysts expect volume growth to be largely flat.

The criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is testing the U.S. central bank's independence again and reinforcing the view among global investors that they need to diversify away from U.S. assets.

"That's what seems to be transpiring this morning," Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

Futures on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq all moved lower on Monday after the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters.

Powell called the probe "a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President," in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account on Sunday. Donald Trump has previously accused Powell of being too slow to cut rates, which continue to weigh on consumers, particularly in accessing housing.

Lafargue called the probe "a surprising move," given that a new Fed chair will be announced in May when Powell's chairmanship of the Fed is due to conclude.

Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North American macro strategy at Standard Chartered, said the probe was Trump trying to intimidate Powell with "the Maduro option": a warning that he could be removed by other means, referring to how the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, was seized in a U.S. military strike last weekend.

He also warned about the pace of the administration's actions.

"The issue is the speed with which Trump is trying to do it," Englander told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday.

"Obviously, he has the midterms right in front of him. He wants to get interest rates down. I think he's trying to intimidate the Fed — either by giving Powell the Maduro option of retiring and this all goes away, or by trying to get him off.

"Unlike with Lisa Cook, this time there's an actual accusation, as opposed to just stuff you're throwing into the air."

It again places central bank independence — a key issue for investors throughout Trump's tenure — in the spotlight, with attention turning to the U.S. 10-year yield and the potential for a broader drag on risk appetite into 2026.

"I think it will bring forth that sentiment that investors need to diversify away from U.S. assets," Lafargue observed. "It will potentially create some pressure on the long end of the yield curve over time."

Nabil Milali, multi-asset and overlay portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management, said the president's strategy is "paradoxically counterproductive."

"By questioning the Fed's independence, he is fueling upward pressure on rates, particularly at the long end of the curve, which we continue to avoid in our allocation," Milali told CNBC in an email.

Looking to where investors may tilt their portfolios, Lafargue pinpointed China as "an increasingly popular trade," highlighting the country as a continued beneficiary of the AI narrative.

While investors are less optimistic about the eurozone, there are pockets of opportunities — particularly around Germany's infrastructure and defense stimulus, said Lafargue, adding there may be a rebound in healthcare, material and energy in the U.K.

While he said tensions between Trump and the Fed were "not a new narrative," he added investors needed to understand "how quickly this thing can play out." "We've heard this U.S. administration repeatedly critique the Fed… it may also accelerate the nomination of the new Fed chair potentially at Davos," he added.

Milali said the latest spat raises the risk that Powell's successor "will have little credibility in the eyes of investors", and will ultimately be subject to President Trump's directives.

"The Trump administration's latest attack on the Fed confirms that the goal of challenging the central bank's independence has never been abandoned," Milali added.

In this article

As Wall Street's top bankers huddled in New York last month, preparing to convince Elon Musk's SpaceX that they should be chosen to lead its upcoming IPO, one firm wasn't letting its star advisor miss the bake-off.

Among the squad of JPMorgan Chase investment bankers flying 2,500 miles west to California to pitch SpaceX was the lender's boss, billionaire CEO Jamie Dimon, people with knowledge of the trip told CNBC.

The morning after that pitch meeting, on Dec. 19, Dimon was already back in his customary early Friday perch: sitting in his bank's New York lobby, taking meetings in full view of the thousands of employees streaming through the building's turnstiles.

The whirlwind few days highlight the reality of Dimon's singular impact on JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market capitalization.

Dimon marks his 20th anniversary as CEO this month and remains deeply involved across the sprawling businesses of JPMorgan, a giant across Wall Street and Main Street with $4.6 trillion in assets. Half a dozen executives across investment banking, asset management and consumer banking echoed that view.

Which makes the inevitable questions surrounding Dimon's tenure loom large as he approaches 70 years of age. Dimon has for years maintained, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that his retirement was perpetually 5 years away. In 2024, for the first time, he acknowledged that window was shrinking. 

Will JPMorgan's era of dominance be over when Dimon exits as CEO?

"Given his track record, anybody else would be a downgrade," said Ben Mackovak, a bank board member and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partners.

"I'm sure somebody else could grow into the role and surprise people," Mackovak said. "But on day one, no one is going to be as qualified to run that bank as Jamie."

In two decades, Dimon took a middle-of-the-pack American lender and, with his unique combination of judgment, paranoia, attention to detail and scope of vision, created a juggernaut of finance that the world hadn't seen before.

During calm times, he invested aggressively for the future, and during periods of tumult, like 2008 and 2023, he avoided pitfalls that consumed other banks, allowing him to snap up three failed institutions.

Over the past 20 years, the bank's annual net income soared more than 500% to $58.5 billion in 2024. The firm reports full-year 2025 results on Tuesday. 

Now, at a market cap of roughly $900 billion, JPMorgan is worth nearly as much as the next three largest U.S. banks combined: Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.

Besides running JPMorgan, Dimon has taken on an outsized role in global finance as a top voice explaining market gyrations or emerging risks and influencing regulators amid policy shifts. It was Dimon's recession warning on a Fox News segment in April that helped convince President Donald Trump to pivot on his trade policy, igniting a historic relief rally.

"It's just the aura he has, the credibility that he's built up in the markets," said Fitch Ratings analyst Chris Wolfe. "The minute you step out of that role, it's not like you can just hand that over, your successor doesn't automatically inherit that. I think that's the real challenge."

The question of who could take over for Dimon — who was already a cancer survivor when he nearly died in 2020 from a ruptured aorta — has been openly discussed among investors for more than a decade.

To investors, his most likely successor is currently Marianne Lake, head of the firm's giant consumer bank and former CFO of the company, followed by Doug Petno and Troy Rohrbaugh, the co-heads of the firm's commercial and investment bank.

Other contenders include asset and wealth management head Mary Erdoes and CFO Jeremy Barnum.

"If investors were to do a straw poll today, they'd probably pick Marianne," said Truist bank analyst Brian Foran.

"The running joke is that she's a human supercomputer when it comes to banking," Foran said. "Really, the only question mark people have about her is, she's so analytical, can she do the kind of 'rah-rah' stuff to inspire the sales force?"

Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo hypothesized that JPMorgan stock could immediately drop 5% if Dimon were to suddenly exit, regardless of the named replacement. (The bank has said Dimon would serve as chairman even after relinquishing the CEO role.)

It's a somewhat common occurrence on Wall Street for companies with iconic CEOs: The stock premium shrinks, at least for a period, when their longtime leaders announce their departures. For instance, Berkshire Hathaway shares trailed the S&P 500 last year after Warren Buffett said he was stepping down as CEO.

When asked about CEO succession, JPMorgan executives say that Dimon is as plugged in as ever, and unlikely to step down soon.

Depending on how long he sticks around, that means it's not necessarily his current direct reports like Lake, Petno and Rohrbaugh who are in line, but more junior executives now being groomed and evaluated for leadership roles, they told CNBC.

"There's a lot of work going into imagining that day without him," said a JPMorgan executive who asked not to be named speaking about his boss. "If he stays until he's 85, it's not his direct reports that are going to be next in line, its maybe one or two levels down from today."

"Does he leave a huge vacuum? Yes," said the executive. "It's not fatal, though, because we've been planning for it. I think there's combinations of people that together can create the same outcome."

The CEO of a commercial bank and former JPMorgan executive, who described Dimon as a mentor, also said he didn't think Dimon would step down soon.

"Jamie's never going to quit," said the CEO, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly. "What else would he do where he's as important as he is now? His friends are all people from work. He loves it."

Still, beyond the day-to-day management of a company with 318,000 employees, Dimon seems intent on setting up JPMorgan for a future without him.

In recent months, Dimon oversaw the completion of the bank's new $3 billion headquarters in midtown Manhattan and announced a $1.5 trillion initiative to bolster industries crucial to U.S. interests.

And, perhaps most crucially, he continues to instill his values into the firm's management team.

Last year, at a conference for JPMorgan's top 400 executives, Dimon rattled off a list of once-great companies that died though mismanagement. Finance is especially prone to this threat, because of the temptation to manipulate numbers for short-term gain, he said.

"Travelers blew up. Citi blew up, twice. Bear Stearns failed, Lehman failed, I'm here because Bank One screwed up a bunch of businesses," Dimon said, referring to a predecessor firm to JPMorgan.

"If you look at these things, it's complacency, it's bureaucracy, it's arrogance. A lot of it is dishonest numbers. Failure to set standards," Dimon said. "These are the cancers that kill companies."

Nobody knows when Dimon's last day as CEO will come, except to know that it is approaching. After adjusting his standard 5-year retirement answer to hint at a sooner departure, Dimon hasn't advanced that clock any further.

"As great as he is, he can't do this forever," said Barclays banking analyst Jason Goldberg. "Every day that passes, you're a day closer to the end."

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to sideline Exxon Mobil from Venezuela's energy market, saying he didn't like their response to his calls for oil companies to quickly reenter the South American country.

"I didn't like Exxon's response. You know we have so many that want it. I'd probably be inclined to keep Exxon out," Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One on Sunday. 

"They're playing too cute," he added. 

His comments come shortly after Exxon CEO Darren Woods made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is "uninvestable" in its current state. 

An Exxon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Exxon were down less than 1% in morning trading Monday.

Speaking alongside several other American oil executives on Friday, Woods said Exxon would need to see "some pretty significant changes" if it was to reenter the country for a third time. 

Venezuela seized Exxon's and ConocoPhillips' assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases. 

Woods said the company would need to see changes to commercial frameworks, the legal system and hydrocarbon laws, alongside what he described as "durable" investment protections.

"We're confident that with this administration and President Trump working hand‑in‑hand with the Venezuelan government that those changes can be put in place," Woods said.

He added that Exxon was prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets.

Trump has been pushing for U.S. oil companies to invest at least $100 billion in Venezuela's energy sector, pledging to support them with government security assistance.

The call follows an audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3 to depose Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. 

Asked by a reporter for clarity on the type of backstops and security guarantees that would be provided to oil companies, Trump did not provide specific details. 

"We are going to have guarantees," Trump said. "They had problems in the past because they didn't have Trump as a president," he added. 

U.S. oil firms acknowledged that Venezuela, which boasts the world's largest oil reserves, represents an intriguing opportunity but some have expressed caution about rushing to reenter.

Chevron is currently the only major American oil firm still operating in Venezuela.

Gold hit a fresh record high on Monday, extending a blistering rally as investors piled into havens amid a swirl of geopolitical and policy shocks in recent days.

Spot gold advanced 2% to hit over $4,600 an ounce for the first time, before paring gains slightly, data from LSEG showed. Prices have risen around 6% this year alone so far.

An investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and speculation over whether it could hasten a leadership change at the Fed has added a fresh layer of policy risk: "Especially if it results in him stepping down and then leaving the Fed earlier than scheduled and is replaced by someone more in favor of rate cuts," said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.

Federal prosecutors are examining a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters and Powell's testimony to Congress, Powell said Sunday night. The Fed Chair added that the investigation stems from President Donald Trump's long-running frustration with the Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates as aggressively or as quickly as he has urged.



The scenario that the appointment of a new Fed Chair may pave the way for faster interest-rate cuts, is traditionally supportive for gold. Lower interest rates tend to lift gold by reducing the opportunity cost of holding a metal that pays no yield. That effect has been amplified by recent U.S. economic data that pointed to a cooling labor market. 

Latest flashpoints involving Iran and Venezuela also further catalyzed gold's appeal as a safe haven.

Tensions with Iran have resurfaced after Washington signaled it is weighing options to respond to unrest in the country. The U.S. also launched a military operation in Venezuela at the start of the year that saw the capture of the country's president Nicolas Maduro last weekend.

"They all add to the narrative of heightened geopolitical uncertainty that led us to pick gold as one of highest conviction asset classes this year," said Rajat Bhattacharya, senior investment strategist at Standard Chartered.

While the U.S. action in Venezuela has appeared to reach a relatively swift resolution, the episode still highlights the persistence of geopolitical uncertainty and the risk of flare-ups across multiple regions, Bank of Singapore's Eli Lee similarly echoed.

In such an environment, Lee expects gold prices to see further support amid an ongoing backdrop of geopolitical unpredictability. Beyond geopolitics, the structural case for gold remains intact, the bank added, as investors reassess portfolio allocations following years of sanctions, geopolitical fragmentation and fiscal-monetary complexity. 

HSBC said trading momentum could carry prices to $5,000 an ounce in the first half of 2026, even as volatility remains elevated and pullbacks may become more frequent.

The London-headquartered bank attributed the rally to a combination of safe-haven demand, a weaker U.S. dollar and policy uncertainty, noting that its FX strategists expect the greenback to remain soft in 2026. 

"Mounting fiscal deficits in the U.S. and other nations are encouraging gold demand and may be a key factor going forward," the bank said.

Central banks are also expected to remain strong buyers this year as they diversify away from the dollar, although HSBC cautioned that purchases may fall below the peaks seen between 2022 and 2024 due to high prices.

Gold prices saw a nearly 65% yearly gain in 2025, the highest in decades.

Iran now appears to be next on President Donald Trump's list, after Venezuela and Greenland.

The backdrop is a wave of protests in Iran, now in their third week. What began as demonstrations over a sharp jump in inflation has evolved into nationwide, anti-government unrest. More than 500 people have been killed as Iran's government moved aggressively to suppress dissent, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.

Trump weighed in Friday with a Truth Social post declaring that "the United States of America will come to their rescue," referring to the protestors. 

Those weren't empty words. White House officials have since outlined potential options for him, with briefings scheduled this week on possible responses that could include military, cyber and economic measures, according to MS Now and other media outlets. No decisions have been announced.

Any escalation would carry major consequences. Iran is not only a major oil producer, but also wields influence over the Strait of Hormuz, a vital artery for global crude. Disruption there would almost certainly ripple through energy markets.

"The complete closure of the Strait that can result in a $10 to $20 per barrel spike," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.

Analysts caution that Iran presents far greater risks than previous U.S. targets. "Iran is far more capable of retaliating against the U.S., especially by attacking regional energy infrastructure," said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research.

Iranian officials have echoed that warning. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf warned of potential retaliation if the U.S. strikes the country. "In the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all U.S. bases and ships will be our legitimate target," Qalibaf said, according to a Reuters report.

The Strait of Hormuz back in focus. Industry experts cautioned that a U.S.-Iran conflict could prompt Tehran to block the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway through which nearly a third of the world's seaborne crude flows. Here's what a U.S. intervention in Iran could look like. 

Fed Chair Powell says he's under investigation. Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation of Powell, focused on the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters, he said on Sunday evening, adding that it's the result of the Fed's refusal to cut rates as quickly as Trump has demanded.

Cuba will not receive Venezuelan oil, Trump says. The Caribbean island, however, pushed back against Trump's threat to make a deal with the U.S. Separately, Trump on Friday signed an executive order aimed at blocking the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.

[PRO] Where Chinese consumers will spend. One sector of China's economy is starting to show spending trends, and stock analysts are picking out the names they expect to be winners.

China's AI and robotics push isn't enough to kickstart its economy, leaving growth more exposed to trade risks

From 2023 to 2025, new industries such as artificial intelligence, robotics and electric cars added just 0.8 percentage points to economic output, while real estate and other traditional sectors saw a combined 6 percentage point decline, U.S.-based research firm Rhodium Group said in a report Monday.

While Beijing has prioritized high-tech development, it has taken fewer steps to address a yearslong slump in real estate. The sector once accounted for more than a quarter of the economy. New home sales by floor area last year fell to levels not seen since 2009, according to a report last week by the China Real Estate Information Corp.

U.S. President Donald Trump is readying for a likely intervention in Iran, as the country cracks down on protestors, with several hundreds reportedly killed and internet access cut off.   

The possible next steps could include boosting antigovernment sources online, deploying cyber weapons against the Iranian military and civilian sites, placing more sanctions on the regime as well as military strikes, The Wall Street Journal reported. Trump's aides are set to brief him on Tuesday on a possible intervention.

The options being presented to Trump range from targeted strikes inside Iran to offensive cyber attacks, Politico also reported, citing an unnamed official familiar with the ongoing development. 

"If the U.S. decides it needs to act to protect personnel or assets, or to protect energy flows, then it has a range of tools, from cyber and sabotage, to drones and missile strikes from air and sea," said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research.  

The U.S. could also attack nuclear or military infrastructure or government facilities to reduce the regime's abilities and "deter the regime from disruptive actions," Gertken added.  

The unrest in Iran, which started in late December over soaring prices and the collapse of Iran's currency, has intensified and morphed into wider antigovernment protests that threaten the Islamic regime. 

Tehran has over the weekend stepped up action against protestors, with more the 500 people killed,  according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Iran has warned the U.S. and Israel against any intervention, with President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday, blaming them for fueling the unrest. 

"Iran is far more capable of retaliating against the U.S., especially by attacking regional energy infrastructure," Gertken said, adding that the Trump administration was "not necessarily eager to destroy the regime" unless it deteriorates "so significantly that the U.S. finds it cannot pass up the opportunity to intervene to force a change of regime." 

Trump's administration's playbook often "changes day by day," but his threats still carry weight as Iran has long been on his agenda and the unrest swells into the "deepest and most widespread protest" in years that the regime does not have under control, Dan Yergin, vice chairman at S&P Global, told CNBC's "Access Middle East." 

Trump has openly backed Iranian protestors and telegraphed his interest in intervening several times on his Truth Social platform, saying that the U.S. would come to the "rescue" of Iranians if the authorities there continued to kill protesters. "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!" Trump said in a social media post Saturday. 

"We're looking at it very seriously. The military is looking at it, and we're looking at some very strong options," Trump told reporters Sunday on Air Force One as he returned to Washington from his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida. "We'll make a determination." 

Trump is also considering non-kinetic measures including cyber and covert action, according to Politico, noting the U.S. President was not expected to send American forces into the country and there has been no major movement of U.S. military assets. 

The U.S. is looking at restoring internet communications in Iran as its leaders have cut off internet and phone services in the country. "We may get the internet going, if that's possible," Trump told reporters. "We may speak to Elon Musk. I'm going to call him as soon as I'm finished with you." Iran has reportedly jammed Musk's Starlink during the latest protests. 

Even if the U.S. administration considers a "symbolic" kinetic strike, it could trigger a "much broader escalation," said Danny Citrinowicz, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies.  

"The dilemma is at its peak: a strong strike could potentially undermine the regime's repression efforts, but at the same time it might lead to greater cohesion within the regime and a broader escalation," Citrinowicz said. 

"Given the absence of leadership in the opposition, such a strike may achieve an operational success but not a strategic one," he added. 

Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Iranian Parliament speaker, warned during a session broadcast live by state television that Israel and "all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets" if the U.S. attacks Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said last Friday that Iran's government will "not back down" amid the protests. 

The unrest comes as the Islamic republic has been increasingly vulnerable with leaders facing mounting internal and domestic strains and a population growing angrier over a deepening economic crisis. Its official currency rial has lost half of its value over the past year, plunging to record-lows of about 1 million rials per U.S. dollar, according to LSEG data. 

"These protests, whatever the outcome, will further damage an already fractured legitimacy for a state system that is at the end of its life," said Sanam Vakil, director of Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House.

The Strait of Hormuz is once again back in focus as a possible U.S. intervention in Iran raises the risk of Tehran disrupting one of the world's most critical energy chokepoints.

U.S. President Donald Trump is considering a range of options against Iran, according to multiple media reports on Sunday, as it cracks down on domestic protests. 

Industry experts cautioned that a military confrontation could provoke Iran to choke off the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway that that connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea and through which nearly a third of the world's seaborne crude flows.

"A disruption through the Strait of Hormuz could cause a global oil and gas crisis" especially when considering the "desperate and ill advised lengths the current Iranian regime may go to" should they find themselves increasingly backed into a corner with their power and lives at stake, said Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Marquee. 

About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, accounting for roughly 31% of global seaborne crude flows, data provided by market intelligence firm Kpler showed. The risk of the waterway being blocked had also surfaced during the flare-up between Washington and Tehran in June last year.

As Iran's production and exports are far larger than Venezuela's, the global market would inevitably feel stronger ripple effects, said Muyu Xu, senior crude analyst at Kpler, adding that Chinese refiners could be forced to seek alternatives.

Unlike Venezuela, any military action involving Iran carries "materially higher risks" given the volume of crude and refined product supply and transit exposure, said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, who sees a 70% likelihood of selective U.S. strikes on Iran.In an extreme escalation scenario, where tankers are unable to pass or energy infrastructure is damaged, oil prices could surge by double digits, said analysts."The fear of a closure will cause the price of oil to rise a few dollars per barrel, but it is the complete closure of the Strait that can result in a $10 to $20 per barrel spike," said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.

Kavonic sees an "immediate oil price spike" in the wake of any U.S. attack on Iran, but that will soften on any sign of the disruption being temporary. 

Global benchmark Brent last hovered around $63 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures held at $59 per barrel.

Most analysts stress that any catastrophic outcomes still remain low-probability events.

While Iran can always threaten to close the Strait of Hormuz, they may not want to do so given the complexity of power dynamics in the region and may not have the capability to fully close it given how the U.S. Navy is patrolling the area, said Kpler's Xu.

Even in a scenario where Iran attempts a temporary disruption, such as harassing tankers or briefly blocking transit, the physical impact on supply would be limited. 

Kpler estimates the oil market is currently tilting toward oversupply, with roughly 2.5 million barrels per day of excess supply in January and over 3 million barrels per day in February and March.

Additionally, any closure will likely be met with a show of force by the U.S. and allies to restore flows again, Kavonic said.

Still, experts cautioned against drawing direct parallels between Iran and Venezuela, where the Trump administration used sanctions, seizures to exert pressure on the Venezuelan regime, before capturing President Nicolás Maduro.

It would be very difficult for the U.S. to adopt a strategy toward Iran similar to Venezuela, because Iran is far from U.S. soil and the geopolitical situation in the Middle East is a lot more complex than in Latin America, Xu said. "Plus, Trump's priority right now appears to be consolidating U.S. power in the Western Hemisphere."

Lipow echoed that view, saying a Venezuela-style playbook in Iran is more likely to involve sanctions and enforcement rather than military occupation or attacks on infrastructure.

Gold hit a record above $4,600 per ounce on Monday and silver reached a fresh peak as investors piled into safe-haven assets after uncertainty deepened over a Trump administration criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Spot gold was up 2.5% at $4,620.56 per ounce, after earlier hitting a record high of $4,627.27. U.S. gold futures for February delivery gained 2.9% to $4,631.30.

"Elevated uncertainty plays directly into the gold market, (and) every week we seem to have another area of uncertainty added," said Michael Haigh, global head of commodities research at Societe Generale.

The backdrop underpinning the rally looked unlikely to reverse anytime soon, he added. Gold surged more than 64% last year, its best performance since 1979, while silver logged its strongest year on record with a 146.8% gain.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has intensified pressure on the Fed, threatening to indict Chair Jerome Powell over his comments on a building renovation project, an act Powell called a "pretext" to gain control over rate cuts Trump seeks.

Powell's term ends in May. The Trump administration is expected to interview BlackRock's Rick Rieder as a potential candidate to succeed him, Fox News reported.

The Fed is expected to hold rates steady at its January 27–28 meeting, after cutting them by 75 basis points last year. However, markets are still pricing in two further rate cuts later this year, boosting appetite for non-yielding assets like gold.

Geopolitical tensions also remained elevated as Trump weighed potential responses to a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran, following his removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and floating the idea of acquiring Greenland.

Spot silver hit an all-time high of $85.75, and was later up 6.9% at $85.437 per ounce.

Gold and silver "go together", said Ned Naylor-Leyland, gold and silver fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management, but "when silver captures flow, (it) really runs because it's a smaller channel and it's more sensitive to the flows in and out".

Spot platinum climbed 3.5% to $2,351.78 per ounce, while palladium gained 3.3% to $1,875.68.

Senator Husted supports a bill prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency.

Senator Husted supports Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: On January 12, 2026, Senator Jon Husted (R-Ohio) announced his backing of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act alongside several Republican senators. The proposed legislation aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which Husted argues would infringe on financial privacy.

Concerns regarding governmental oversight: Husted stated, “The Federal Reserve has no business monitoring the transactions of Ohioans or any other law-abiding American.” Other supporters, like Senator Ted Cruz, emphasized that a CBDC could impose surveillance threats and undermine individual financial freedom. They collectively expressed the need to protect citizens from potential governmental overreach.

Support from financial organizations: The bill has garnered support from organizations like the Club for Growth and the American Bankers Association. Critics of a CBDC warn it could disrupt the financial system, reduce private investment, and lead to increased volatility in financial markets.

Mezo's "Bring Bitcoin Home" initiative targets billions in wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum, offering MEZO token rewards to participants who migrate BTC liquidity back to its home network.

NEW YORK, Jan. 12, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Mezo, a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure protocol, today announced the allocation of up to 2.5% of the total MEZO token supply to incentivize early depositors in its "Bring Bitcoin Home" pre-deposit vaults. The vaults target the more than $11 billion in wrapped Bitcoin currently sitting on Ethereum DeFi.

Starting today, users can deposit tBTC, cbBTC, WBTC, or USDT into Ethereum-based vaults. At the end of January, assets migrate automatically to Mezo's Bitcoin-native infrastructure—fixed-rate borrowing, a fully Bitcoin-backed stablecoin, and yield from real onchain activity.

"Sixteen years ago today, Hal Finney ran the second Bitcoin node and began articulating a vision of Bitcoin-backed banks—an entire financial system built on hard money," said Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis, the venture studio behind Mezo. "Mezo is a Bitcoin-first system designed to support borrowing, saving, and yield directly against BTC, without custodians, wrappers, or variable-rate markets."

Since its inception, the protocol has launched:

Fixed-rate Bitcoin-backed loans on mainnet

A fully Bitcoin-backed stablecoin, MUSD

BTC-denominated transaction fees

Yield generated from real Bitcoin activity

Bitcoin-native incentive mechanics that reward onchain participation

Direct fiat on-ramps for MUSD

No reliance on wrapped token custodians or variable-rate markets

The system reflects early Bitcoin design principles, including concepts proposed by Hal Finney around Bitcoin-backed banking and redeemable digital currency.

Reward Structure

Up to 2.5% of the total MEZO supply has been allocated to Bring Bitcoin Home. Early depositors earn boosted MEZO rewards starting at 5% incentive APR (~7% estimated total APR including base yield). Rewards are distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.

Key Dates

Today (Jan 12): Vaults open. First deposits get ~7% total APR.

January 26th: Vaults lock, migration to Mezo begins

March 23rd: Vaults unlock on Mezo, depositors get MEZO.

Additional details on the MEZO token and earn mechanics are available in the Mezo Earn whitepaper.

Pre-deposit vaults are live at comehome.mezo.org.

Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have nearly erased the gains they've logged since the start of the year.

According to a new report from digital asset manager CoinShares, during a four-day losing streak, the funds lost $1.3 billion of their collective $1.5 billion worth of inflows since the start of January. Over the last full week, $454 million worth of assets have left crypto exchange-traded products.

"Bitcoin bore the brunt of the negative sentiment, seeing $405 million outflows last week, although we also saw $9.2 million outflows from short-Bitcoin [funds], sending mixed signals as to the general market sentiment for the asset," wrote James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares.

Bitcoin recently traded for $91,722 after having gained 1% in the past day, according to crypto price aggregator CoinGecko.

He added that the shift in sentiment is mainly due to lower Fed rate cut expectations for March. The Federal Open Markets Committee will next meet to decide federal interest rates on January 27-28. Futures trading activity shows investors think there's a 95% chance that regulators will leave rates unchanged at their next meeting.

A week ago, futures data indicated that traders thought there was a 44% chance the FOMC would lower rates in March. But that's since dropped to 26.2%. Futures trading now indicates there's a 72.7% chance that rates will again be left the same in March.

Users on Myriad, a prediction market platform owned by Decrypt parent company Dastan, still think there's a good chance the Fed will cut rates—but it may not happen for a couple months. Predictors believe there's a 59% chance the FOMC will enact a 25-basis point cut before this July.

But while Bitcoin and Ethereum saw assets leave funds, altcoin products saw the opposite.

"Positive sentiment persisted for XRP, Solana, and Sui, drawing inflows of $45.8 million, $32.8 million, and $7.6 million, respectively," Butterfill wrote in the Monday report.

At the time of writing, the XRP and Sui had each lost just under 1% in the past day and were trading for $2.07 and $1.80, respectively. Meanwhile, Solana had gained 2.2% since Sunday and was changing hands for about $142.

Seventy European economists have called on EU lawmakers to prioritize public interest over private-sector lobbying in shaping the digital euro, warning that poor design choices could leave Europe dependent on foreign payment systems and dollar-backed stablecoins.

The open letter, published Sunday by Utrecht University's Sustainable Finance Lab, comes as the European Parliament prepares to finalize legislation that will determine whether the digital currency becomes a meaningful alternative to private money or a “symbolic compromise.”

The academics argue that Europe's payment infrastructure has become dangerously concentrated in non-European hands, with thirteen euro area countries now relying entirely on international card schemes for basic retail transactions.

“This dependence on foreign (US) payment providers exposes European citizens, businesses, and governments to geopolitical leverage, foreign commercial interests, and systemic risks beyond Europe's control,” the letter states, adding that U.S.-backed private digital currencies are gaining ground while Europe deliberates.

The signatories, including former central bank governors and prominent economists such as Thomas Piketty and Paul De Grauwe, demand three core features.

The digital euro must function as “the backbone of a sovereign, resilient European payment infrastructure based on domestic providers adopting the highest privacy standards,” serve as “public digital money accessible to all Europeans, supporting financial inclusion,” and offer “a credible store of value through a generous and gradually rising holding limit.“

Without these elements, the economists warn that the project will fail.

“If a large part of European companies is excluded or allowed to refuse it, or if holding limits remain so low that citizens cannot use it as a serious store of value, then the digital euro will fail to realise its potential,” they write.

The letter describes the stakes in stark terms, asking whether Europeans will “assert control over their money in the digital age, or do we allow others to control it for us?“

ECB Executive Board member Philip Lane reinforced the strategic case in a January 9 speech to the Danish Economic Society, framing the digital euro within broader efforts to strengthen Europe's financial architecture.

Lane argued that structural changes, including geopolitical shifts, digitalization, and climate change, represent common shocks best handled through monetary union, with the digital euro providing “retail central bank money in digital form” as transaction systems evolve.

Lane also addressed Europe's shortage of safe assets, noting that the German Bund alone cannot meet global demand for euro-denominated securities.

He outlined potential solutions, including expanded common bonds for European public goods and the “blue bond/red bond” reform, where member states would ring-fence tax revenues to back jointly issued securities.

“The shared pay-off would be the reduction in debt servicing costs generated by the safe asset services provided by an expanded stock of common debt,” Lane said.

Technical preparations are nearing completion following the ECB's October decision to move into the readiness phase.

ECB President Christine Lagarde confirmed last month that “we have done our work, we have carried the water,” placing responsibility on EU institutions to finalize legislation.

Board member Piero Cipollone previously indicated that pilot transactions could begin mid-2027, with the first issuance possible in 2029 if lawmakers approve the framework next year.

Last month, the EU Council also agreed on its negotiating position, establishing a framework that includes both online and offline payment options.

The offline version would allow device-to-device transactions without internet access, offering privacy comparable to cash for low-value payments while maintaining anti-money laundering compliance for wallet funding.

Lagarde emphasized that the digital euro would complement physical currency under Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, describing MiCA-compliant stablecoins as “an alternative form of payment” that can be “regarded as safe.”

Public acceptance remains uncertain, with recent ECB surveys showing many Europeans see limited need for the new payment option despite official assurances.

Weaker-than-expected Bitcoin performance will enable Ethereum to outperform the top crypto and hit $40,000 by 2030, according to Standard Chartered's latest forecast.

The major British multinational bank published the prediction in a research note on January 12. 

“2026 will be the year of Ethereum, much like 2021 was,” Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research and author of the note, said.

He argues that an improvement in Ethereum's prospects relative to Bitcoin means the price ratio between the two assets could return to its 2021 high.

At that time, the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio hit a high of around 0.08, meaning that the price of one Ether token was 8% the value of one Bitcoin. 

However in the years since, Ethereum has lagged behind, and the ratio has dropped to around 0.03.For context, if the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio rose to around 0.16, the two crypto assets would trade at an equal market value. 

Standard Chartered's prediction highlights how traditional financial firms are growing more and more bullish on stablecoins and tokenisation — taking real world assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate, and conferring ownership of them digitally on a blockchain.

Ethereum is currently the biggest blockchain for tokenisation, hosting more than $10 billion worth of crypto and real world assets. It also hosts the majority of all stablecoins, which are often backed by US Treasury bonds.

These factors, the bank says, put Ethereum in a strong position to take advantage of the increased interest in onchain finance.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, was not designed to accommodate programmable smart contracts, and therefore has a comparatively tiny onchain ecosystem. 

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicts stablecoins could grow into a $3 trillion industry by 2030. The value of all tokenised assets on blockchains could surpass $19 trillion by 2033, according to an April report from Ripple and Boston Consulting Group. 

Onchain finance isn't the only reason Standard Chartered sees a brighter future for Ethereum than Bitcoin.

Investment through exchange-traded funds and digital asset treasuries is less important for Ethereum's price performance than Bitcoin's, the bank said. 

Investors have pulled over $1.9 billion out of Ethereum ETFs since November, according to DefiLlama data. In the same time, Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $4.6 billion in outflows.

Even so, while crypto ETF flows have weakened overall, “they are more constructive for ETH than for BTC at present,” Kendrick wrote.

Additionally, Ethereum developers are working on increasing the blockchain's transaction throughput by a factor of 10 over the next two to three years. If they're successful, this should also give Ethereum a sizable boost. 

Finally, passage of the US' Clarity Act, a proposed crypto market structure bill, also bodes well for Ethereum and the vast onchain ecosystem it accommodates. 

The bill, should it get signed into law, will provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for decentralised finance, giving traditional financial firms more confidence to integrate blockchain technology into their offerings. 

Standard Chartered said it expects the clarity Act to be passed in the first quarter of 2026.

To be sure, the bank is still bullish on Bitcoin, too. 

The note reiterated its Bitcoin price prediction of $500,000 by 2030, while also lowering its near-term Ethereum price targets for 2026 from $12,000 to 7,500, and from $18,000 to $15,000 for 2027. 

“We expect Clarity Act passage, along with solid US equity-market performance, to push BTC to a fresh all-time high in H1, defying fears of further price declines at this stage of the Bitcoin ‘halving' cycle,” Kendrick said.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says the network should eventually become more independent, arguing that the blockchain should remain usable and resilient even without constant updates.

In an extended X post today, Buterin framed this as a long-term test of Ethereum's durability, calling it the “walkaway test,” and noting that Ethereum is “meant to be a home for trustless and trust-minimized applications, whether in finance, governance or elsewhere.”

As Buterin explained, Ethereum should host applications that work more like tools, “the hammer that once you buy it's yours,” rather than like services that stop functioning if the vendor abandons them. He added that the network should reach a point where it can “ossify if we want to,” meaning the network's core rules could remain stable for years without requiring constant upgrades.

“We do not have to stop making changes to the protocol, but we must get to a place where Ethereum's value proposition does not strictly depend on any features that are not in the protocol already,” Ethereum's co-founder wrote.

To reach that milestone, Buterin outlined several technical priorities, including quantum-resistant cryptography, a scalable architecture using zero-knowledge proofs, and a proof-of-stake model that “can last and remain decentralized for decades.” He added:

“Ideally, we do the hard work over the next few years, to get to a point where in the future almost all future innovation can happen through client optimization, and get reflected in the protocol through parameter changes.”

Buterin's suggestion comes just a week after Zcash faced a governance shakeup, when the entire team at the Electric Coin Company (ECC), the for-profit company that oversaw Zcash development, announced they were leaving, following a dispute tied to the nonprofit, Bootstrap, that supports the project.

Josh Swihart, the now-former CEO of ECC, said in an X post that the team was “constructively discharged” after a majority of the Bootstrap board changed employment terms. He added that the changes made it impossible for the team to carry out its work “effectively and with integrity.” Despite the fact that the entire team announced it would continue to work on Zcash, just as part of a new company, the price of ZEC dropped by 20% in a day.

A notification popped up on my LinkedIn the other day. Africans were doing a traditional celebratory dance at the Africa Stablecoin summit in Johannesburg. 

The picture gave me a sinking feeling.

Why? While stablecoins can advance financial inclusion in Africa, could this celebration mark the potential transfer of monetary sovereignty from African economies to the economy issuing the most coveted currency-denominated stablecoin? 

Stablecoins are crypto-assets or digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a reference asset such as a national currency (like US dollars), a commodity (like gold) or a basket of assets.

The use of stablecoins in Africa is on the rise, particularly in Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. This rise is driven by currency volatility, inflation and limited access to stable foreign currency through traditional banking. Those problems prompt some people to adopt US dollar-denominated stablecoins for saving, hedging and remittances. 

Part of their appeal is that they can be moved across borders more quickly, cheaply and efficiently than conventional assets. In South Africa, a well developed regulatory and financial infrastructure has increased institutional confidence, expanding stablecoin use beyond retail into business payments, remittances and other business-to-business transactions.

Their stability is usually achieved through reserves, collateral, or algorithmic mechanisms that prevent large price swings.

My book, Financial Technology Law and Regulation in Africa, looked at their operation as a crypto-asset in African states. I raised concerns about their potential impact on emerging economies, including African countries, in 2019 and 2020. A recent International Monetary Fund paper has echoed these concerns.

Stablecoins emerged in 2014 to reduce the volatility of crypto-assets for crypto-holders who wanted to cash out of a high-value crypto-asset before it crashed. Crypto-asset values crash easily because they are highly speculative, sentiment-driven, and can be sold instantly at scale, allowing fear to trigger rapid sell-offs.

The most popular ones are US dollar-denominated USDT and USDC issued by private companies Tether and Circle, respectively. However, stablecoins were unregulated for about 10 to 11 years before the EU Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation in 2024 and the US Genius Act in 2025. During this period, there were no disclosure requirements governing these crypto-assets. 

As not all are subject to regulation, criticisms abound regarding the quality and opaque nature of the assets backing them and their robustness to withstand redemption runs or large cash redemption by holders of stablecoins. 

These criticisms arise as it is often unclear exactly how liquid, safe, and transparent the assets backing stablecoins are, raising doubts about whether unregulated issuers could meet large, sudden redemption demands without stress. This matters because the stablecoin market is worth approximately US$300 billion, so a loss of confidence could trigger mass redemptions and cause disruption well beyond the crypto-asset sector.

The rise in the use of stablecoins poses a risk of dollarisation, as US dollar-denominated stablecoins account for 99% of the stablecoin market. Dollarisation is the excessive use of the dollar in local African economies. It could be a threat to African states' monetary sovereignty and drive capital flight from African economies.

To avert this problem, African authorities and central banks would first need to be prepared to impose restrictions or limits on the amounts of these US dollar or foreign-denominated stablecoins that can circulate within their economies at any given time. This is to prevent the threat to monetary sovereignty. 

Secondly, African economies should also be prepared to put in place sound policy frameworks through which they can build credibility for their currencies and, therefore, avoid the risk of dollarisation. 

Thirdly, they can consider launching their own stablecoins. This can be in the form of a local currency stablecoin or a regional stablecoin. To prevent capital flight from the economies, these stablecoins can be backed by a commodity or a basket of commodities, from Africa's wealth of natural resources and minerals such as precious stones, gold, diamonds, crude oil and cobalt. To have a global edge, a dollar value can be derived from these commodities. 

Since the proposed African backed stablecoin would be a local currency with a US dollar value, it could be used to settle domestic, regional and global transactions without the need for US dollars, whose backing assets are held outside the country and in the US. 

Fourthly, they could also consider issuing their own retail central bank digital currency, as this would have exactly the same effect as fiat but in digital form. It would have the same credibility status as fiat, which would need to be built to avoid the risk of dollarisation. 

As US dollar-denominated stablecoins account for 99% of the stablecoins market, the rise of their use in Africa indicates stablecoins have heightened dollarisation.

Dollarisation already exists and is widespread across Africa. It ranges from partial and informal to deep and systemic, depending on country conditions, but stablecoins accelerate and reinforce it. Traditional dollarisation (people and firms informally using US dollars for savings and trade) remains constrained by physical cash, bank access and foreign exchange controls. 

Stablecoins make dollar-denominated liquidity instantly accessible on a mobile phone, bypassing banks, foreign exchange restrictions and domestic currency infrastructure. They become “digital dollars”, circulating outside the supervisory perimeter of central banks. 

The US Genius Act brings issuers under US regulatory oversight. It guarantees that US dollar-denominated stablecoins will be safe, liquid and institutionally backed, making them more attractive than many African domestic currencies, especially in inflationary environments. 

Consequently, what was once an informal hedge becomes a formal, globally credible digital alternative to local currency, accelerating capital flight, weakening deposit creation, and undermining domestic monetary policy.

This has direct monetary sovereignty implications for countries such as Nigeria and Kenya. In Nigeria, persistent foreign exchange shortages and naira volatility have pushed households and small enterprises into Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) as working capital and savings instruments. 

Post-Genius Act, these instruments will become more institutionally robust, increasing dependence on US-dollar-based payment and settlement systems located and governed outside the country's financial system and reducing the Central Bank of Nigeria's ability to influence liquidity, lending and inflation. 

In Kenya, where digital finance is already deeply embedded through M-Pesa, US dollar-stablecoins offer a hedge against the shilling, bypassing local credit creation and weakening the Central Bank of Kenya's monetary transmission mechanism. 

In both cases, the US Genius Act effectively shifts monetary authority away from African central banks and towards US regulators and private issuers – not by design, but through market incentives. Stablecoins thus do not merely mirror existing dollarisation; they legalise it at scale, embedding it into Africa's digital financial systems. 

There is also the risk of capital flight from African economies to the jurisdictions where the denominated stablecoins are backed.

In summary, stablecoins can truly advance financial inclusion in Africa, but heavy reliance on foreign-denominated stablecoins risks deepening dollarisation and weakening monetary sovereignty. 

To deal with these risks, African economies need stronger policy frameworks to build currency credibility and reduce the risk of dollarisation. This means that the fiscal deficit must be contained – meaning that governments must not spend far more than they earn. Current account balances must be managed, and foreign exchange, bank and corporate sector balances must be closely monitored.

My take on this issue is that central banks should be at the forefront of these developments, and this could also involve issuing their own central bank-issued tokenised money or digital currencies. This can co-exist alongside stablecoins rather than allowing privately issued, foreign-denominated stablecoins to become the dominant digital currency in circulation in a state. 

So, while the dance at the stablecoin summit was commendable, I am concerned that only one dimension, looking at the benefits of stablecoins to facilitate payments and financial inclusion, is being put forward. 

Policymakers must clearly articulate the implications of foreign-denominated stablecoins and prepare appropriate responses.

The XRP Ledger (XRPL) has just experienced one of its biggest crashes this year, as on-chain data shows that activity on the Ripple blockchain has dropped by 99%. While this might look like a major red flag, the decline has yet to significantly impact the XRP price, suggesting that the situation may not be as alarming as it seems.

Overview Of Ripple's XRP Ledger 99% Crash

Over the weekend, XRP Ledger transaction activity dropped sharply, falling by approximately 99% within 48 hours. On closer inspection, the decline appears primarily due to timing rather than any major technical issue in the ledger. Usually, cryptocurrency transaction volumes decline over weekends. This is because many institutional traders and market makers reduce their trading or stop entirely on weekends, leading to thinner liquidity and lower payment volumes on the ledger. 

Notably, on-chain data from XRPScans revealed that XRPL's payment volume between accounts declined from over 1.09 billion on Thursday, January 8, to 166.99 million on Saturday. This represents a massive drop in network usage, showing just how much activity can decrease over a weekend. Payment volume is also yet to recover, falling further to around 137.40 million as of January 11. 

In addition to volume decline, the number of transactions executed on the XRP Ledger during that time frame also reduced. XRPScans showed that transactions fell from over 2 million on Thursday to 1.8 million on Saturday. This decline in both volume and transfers shows that even small reductions in participation by large accounts or institutional users can significantly affect network metrics. 

It's worth noting that the XRP price is still trading above $2 and remains somewhat unaffected by the recent decline in network activity. Although CoinMarketCap data shows its value dropped by more than 4% over the past week, there's no clear evidence linking this to the recent 99% decline in the ledger. 

Interestingly, just days before the crash, the XRP Ledger recorded a major increase in whale transactions, each valued at $100,000 or more. This suggests that, despite temporary network fluctuations, the XRP network continues to experience substantial activity and engagement from major holders. 

XRPL Developer Shares New Update For Ledger

Vet, an XRPL dUNL validator and developer, has shared a new update on the XRP Ledger, revealing that a large batch of fixes and amendments is now nearing its activation timer. This marks a critical step for the blockchain network, promising to enhance functionality and security for developers and users. 

Vet has stated that the upcoming changes cover several important features, including TokenEscrow, AMMClawback, Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPT), and Price Oracle. He emphasized that the XRP development team remains committed to maintaining the ledger at its highest performance. He added that the team is also working diligently to ensure all features operate smoothly, independent of XRP's current market price.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has published updated guidance on data subject access requests (DSARs), reflecting both changes brought in by the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (DUA Act) and recent case law developments. Timed to coincide with the DUA Act's latest set of commencement regulations expected later this month (and which should include the changes relating to DSARs), the new guidance clarifies several practical aspects of DSAR management for organisations.

Key DUA Act changes reflected in the ICO guidance 

Other changes reflected in the ICO guidance

Overall, the updated guidance balances new operational flexibilities against stricter transparency requirements. On the one hand, clarifications aligned with the DUA Act should improve the day-to-day management of DSARs. On the other hand, the case law-driven requirement to disclose specific recipients by default raises the bar for transparency and record-keeping. Organisations may need to invest in adapting their processes, for example by mapping data disclosures accurately and updating transparency and exemption frameworks, but doing so is likely to make DSAR handling more predictable and defensible in the longer term.

Team Secret has joined the Checkmate Ecosystem, a Web3 gaming network based on the CHECK token. The network includes Anichess, a chess-based game backed by Chess.com and Magnus Carlsen.

As part of this, Team Secret is set to launch a Web3 membership NFT pass, which will unlock many engagement opportunities for fans.

“At Team Secret, we've always been about striving for excellence and innovation,” said John Yao, CEO of Team Secret. “Joining Checkmate Ecosystem is a game-changer for digital engagement.”

The Team Secret Membership Pass is a non-fungible token (NFT) that serves as a membership pass. Holders of this NFT will have access to VIP ticket opportunities, community tournaments, and AMA sessions with Team Secret's players across Dota 2, VALORANT, and Rainbow Six Siege X.

“By launching our Membership Pass NFT and adopting the CHECK token, we are moving toward a future where our fans have a direct stake in our ecosystem, from immediate utility in merchandise to unprecedented access to our players and global events,” added Yao.

Team Secret will also incorporate the CHECK token as a payment and participation token. This means that fans will be able to purchase merchandise with it and also participate in paid tournaments. The organisation will also reward the token through select events.

In a release, the Checkmate Ecosystem said that Team Secret will also be hosting ‘high-profile' Anichess tournaments.

“Anichess and Team Secret are not just looking at a one-off campaign; we are building a long-term infrastructure for fan empowerment through membership NFTs and tokenised rewards that will redefine the esports experience for years to come,” said Chevan Tin, Head of Anichess.

Anichess is like traditional chess, but incorporates a new twist with several magical spells. These include Imposter (swap with an opponent's piece) and Bis-hop 2.0 (the Bishop can leap over one piece).

$FRNT 最具颠覆性的部分可能是它开创的先例，即“公共资金”可以在本地积累。

撰文：Andjela Radmilac

编译：Luffy，Foresight News

多年来，稳定币一直是加密领域最实用的发明，却也是最尴尬的存在。说它实用，是因为它将区块链变成了全天候运转的美元支付通道；说它尴尬，是因为尽管其愿景简单直白，想要建立信任却绝非易事。

对非加密领域的人来说，一枚价值恰好等于 1 美元的数字代币听起来似乎十分可靠，直到有人追问：背后的美元储备究竟在哪里？

如今，美国怀俄明州打算用最古老的 「信用背书妙招」 来回答这个问题：州政府印章。

Frontier Stable Token（FRNT） 是怀俄明州推出的可兑换美元的全新稳定币，依据州成文法框架发行，该稳定币由怀俄明州稳定代币委员会监管。这同时也是一份直白的政治声明，只不过用的是采购规则、公开会议、储备金要求这类毫无噱头的官方语言。硅谷向来擅长用光鲜的话术描绘未来，而怀俄明州却偏偏选择用 「附带委员会会议记录」 的方式推出稳定币。

按照该委员会的说法，这款代币的核心定位是公共效用：实现更透明的资金流转、更快速的交易结算，打造一套不依赖于某一任州长的个人热情、也不依附于某家企业商业模式的可持续发展的稳定币。同时，他们也希望通过这一设计，回应外界对稳定币最强烈的诟病：透明度不足。

这是官方的营销说辞，但更值得深究的问题是：正当美国联邦政府仍在纠结 「数字美元该有怎样的形态」 时，这款代币揭示了货币经济与货币政治的哪些深层变化？

怀俄明州的 FRNT 采用 100% 储备金制度，受州成文法管辖，且与美联储发行的任何数字货币完全脱钩。2025 年，该州通过了《HB0264 法案》，进一步强化了这一立场：禁止州政府机构接受央行数字货币用于州级支付，也不得动用公共资金支持央行数字货币的测试或落地。

这一界定至关重要，因为央行数字货币如今已成为两种社会焦虑的代名词。一种是经济层面的焦虑：如果人们可以直接持有央行发行的货币，商业银行将何去何从？另一种是文化层面的焦虑：监控、管制，以及一种愈发强烈的预感，你名下的所有资金，或许都将被附上 「使用许可」的标签。

怀俄明州显然更看重文化层面的诉求。其出台的央行数字货币禁令中，包含了立法机构的调查结论，明确警示了央行数字货币可能带来的监控风险与消费限制问题。即便你不认同这一前提，也能看清其背后的战略考量。

怀俄明州想要传递的信号是：如果民众想要在本州使用数字美元，那必须通过州政府可监督、可诉诸法律、且能在月度公开会议上被讨论的机制来实现。

委员会工作人员对 FRNT 的定位表述十分谨慎，他们称：「FRNT 与央行数字货币有着本质区别，因为它采用 100% 储备金制度，且并非由央行发行。」

这一点绝非无关紧要。该委员会表示，FRNT 的治理过程全程公开，关键决策均在月度会议上做出，相关机构规则的制定也必须经过法定的公众意见征集阶段。

在加密领域，治理往往意味着凌晨 3 点在 Discord 社群里的投票。而怀俄明州则提供了一种更贴近传统的模式：行政法框架下的治理，这种模式利弊共存。

这一治理逻辑也决定了 FRNT 可被用于任何合法用途，州政府机构不会因政治风向的变化，就限制代币的合法使用场景。

他们解释称，任何对代币使用的干预措施，都必须基于法院指令等合法授权，而非主观的道德评判。这一立场既符合公民自由原则，也具备现实操作性：带有 「使用限制清单」 的货币注定会成为政治攻击的目标，而遵循现有法律程序的货币或许显得平淡无奇，但恰恰是这种平淡，才具备规模化推广的可能。

接下来，便是这款代币融入现代金融体系的创新点：发行与流通渠道。

委员会表示，FRNT 的设计兼顾了零售与机构用户的需求。零售端的应用场景很好想象，尤其是与 Rain 这类平台的整合，让稳定币可以像借记卡一样被使用。如果用户能在所有支持 Visa 支付的场所消费这款代币，那么区块链以及其他加密领域的专业术语就变得无关紧要。

而机构与公共部门的使用场景，更能体现怀俄明州的特色。委员会希望公共机构通过使用 FRNT，提升资金流转的透明度与效率。

他们举例称，2025 年 7 月，怀俄明州曾通过其数字货币系统，向政府承包商完成了近乎即时的付款测试。该州称，这一功能在灾难发生时将展现出巨大优势。毕竟在这类场景下，支付速度与资金流动性至关重要。

或许你会觉得这只是一个小众应用场景，但要知道，所有新的支付通道最初都是从小众场景起步，直至成为主流。

一款能服务于交易者的稳定币，只是入门级的要求；而一款能用于薪资发放、承包商付款与应急响应的稳定币，已然具备了基础设施的属性。

稳定币往往被宣传为一种支付技术，但其经济逻辑却更贴近银行：吸纳美元存款，持有低风险资产，赚取利息收益。

怀俄明州毫不避讳地表明了对这笔利息收益的规划。在其发布的《情况说明书》中，委员会详细描述了法定的储备金结构：其中包含超额抵押要求，而超出储备金要求所产生的投资收益，将被用于公共福利事业，包括资助该州的教育基金。这才是此举中被低估的政治意义所在。

该州试图将稳定币的「铸币税」转化为公共福利：这笔资金利息将助力教育事业发展。

如果你关注过美国联邦政府关于稳定币的争论，就会明白这一举措的重要性。关于 「谁有权发行稳定币」 的整个争论，本质上就是一场 「谁能掌控这笔浮息收益」 的争夺战：银行、金融科技公司、加密发行方，或是政府。

怀俄明州则给出了一个全新的答案。公共机构完全可以辩称，其使命是实现公共利益，而非为股东创造回报。

这也是联邦政策与州级试验产生碰撞的地方。委员会表示，他们预计 FRNT 将与联邦稳定币规则共存，并援引《天才法案》中对 「个人」 的定义，辩称公共机构不在该法案的管辖范围内。

他们更核心的主张则上升到了哲学层面：由私人实体在联邦监管框架下发行的稳定币，与由公共机构发行的稳定币，遵循的激励机制截然不同。

当被问及联邦规则是否会将他们排除在外时，委员会的回应显得颇为轻松：「我们预计双方将共存。」

他们的论据是，公共发行方处于不同的赛道：「依据《天才法案》发行的私人稳定币，其使命是为股东创造利润；而公共机构发行的稳定币，使命是实现公共利益。」

美国联邦政府最终是否会接受这种清晰的界限划分，仍是一个未知数。议员们向来厌恶漏洞，尤其是带有州政府标志的漏洞。但委员会的立场，恰恰揭示了美国联邦制的核心矛盾：各州本是政策试验的实验室，可一旦这个实验室开始打造看似具备货币属性的产品，一切就都变了。

此外，稳定币讨论中还有一个很少被提及的矛盾点：发行与流通的话语权。

一款稳定币的生死，取决于其获取与使用渠道。如果它能在主流加密交易所上线，就会融入更广泛的加密流动性体系；如果它能像借记卡一样被使用，就有机会改变消费者的支付习惯；如果它能跨多个区块链网络流通，就会成为开发者与机构的优选资产。

怀俄明州稳定代币委员会对流通渠道的规划，显然兼顾了两类受众：加密领域的受众关注流动性与可获得性，公共部门的受众则看重抗风险能力与可审计性。一方追求速度，另一方则看重可追溯的交易记录。

怀俄明州承诺将同时满足这两类需求，这一目标固然宏大，也略带矛盾。

但这份宏大的野心，恰恰是问题的关键。怀俄明州向来有争当先行者的传统：从早期推动女性投票权扩张，到以亲商法律环境闻名，皆是如此。

这款稳定币，正是这种先锋精神在数字时代的延续：利用小州的灵活优势，试水那些因政治风险过高、联邦机构不敢触碰的领域。

如果其他州纷纷效仿，美元体系将迎来全新的层级。

最大的问题，并非怀俄明州是否有能力运营一款稳定币，其技术实力与对创新的历史追求，早已给出了肯定的答案。真正的问题是：如果该州让 「地方发行公共货币」 这一理念变得清晰可落地，其他州会作何反应？

委员会表示，希望其他州如果计划发行州级稳定代币，能与怀俄明州展开合作，并强调互操作性将是首要原则。这种执念，或许会带来最具价值的成果。

如果 50 个州各自发行的代币无法互通，最终将形成一个个相互隔绝的 「围墙花园」，每个州的代币都有自己的规则、合作方与政治雷区。而互操作性，将是让州级试验产生网络效应的关键，也将让州级稳定币从 「小众的地方项目」，转变为 「全国性的谈判筹码」。

怀俄明州正明确欢迎其他州效仿，只是附带了一个条件：「我们希望其他州能与怀俄明州开展合作。」 委员会向 CryptoSlate 表示，并补充称，代币与区块链网络之间的互操作性应被视为优先事项。

不妨想象这样一个近未来：数个州都发行了自己的稳定代币，均以公共福利项目为名义，均将美国国债作为储备资产，均具备某种形式的链上可审计性，均通过交易所与银行卡支付网络进行流通。届时，两种结果将变得可能。

第一种结果是市场竞争。私人稳定币发行方面临新的行业标杆：公开会议、信息披露，以及州政府用实际行动证明 「公共机构也能建立信任」 的尴尬象征。即便怀俄明州的代币从未发展成主流，这一竞争也将推动整个市场朝着更高的透明度迈进。有时候，竞争威胁本身，就是最有价值的产品。

第二种结果则关乎政治博弈，而且是最直白的政治博弈。如果稳定币被广泛用于支付与结算，那么代币的发行方，将成为货币金融体系的核心利益相关者。一款能将收益注入公共基金、或实现公共资金快速拨付的州级稳定代币，必将赢得支持者，也会招来批评者。

支持者会称其为创新，批评者则会指责这是 「披着金融科技外衣的政府越权」；而双方的观点，在各自的立场上都站得住脚。

怀俄明州的这一举措，也悄然重塑了央行数字货币的争论框架。在美国，关于央行数字货币的讨论，似乎总在两个极端之间摇摆：要么认为 「央行数字货币等同于监控」，要么认为 「央行数字货币是金融现代化的必然」。

而怀俄明州则提出了第三条道路：由州政府发行数字美元，受成文法管辖，通过私人渠道流通，且受公共程序约束。这一模式让联邦政府退出了发行环节，却仍让政府置身于数字货币的赛道之中。

这给美国联邦政府出了一道难题：如果美国民众终究要接纳数字美元，那么真正的核心问题，就变成了 「由哪些机构构建支付通道，由哪些法律设定监管约束」。

联邦政府可以选择禁止、认可或监管；各州可以选择自主打造；企业则会竞相抢占流通渠道。最终的赢家，很可能不是技术最先进的一方，而是那些能协调各方利益、赢得公众信任，并能熬过下一轮选举周期的主体。

怀俄明州押下了三重赌注：公共利益可以成为一种具备竞争力的商业模式，透明度可以成为一种流通策略，而稳定币的价值，远不止于交易工具。该州也深知其中的讽刺之处：加密技术最不浪漫的应用场景，或许恰恰是让它真正产生社会价值的场景。

一枚刻有牛仔徽章的数字美元代币，或许无法一夜之间改写金融体系，但它将做出更具颠覆性的举动：让美元的未来更本土化、更具争议性，并且出奇地贴近生活。

Data protection legal insight at the speed of technology

The ICO has kicked off 2026 with sharing its early thoughts on the data protection implications of agentic AI in its ICO tech futures: Agentic AI report. The report considers the novel data protection risks presented by agentic AI. It also considers how adoption could impact the risks and the effect that will have on the ICO's work and priorities. It signals potential challenges and compliance obligations under the UK GDPR that continue to apply, but does not look to set out detailed or prescriptive thoughts on mitigations at this stage.

The ICO also looks to encourage opportunities for innovation within agentic AI that support data protection and information rights.

For the purposes of this report, the ICO uses the terms:

Data protection and privacy risks

The ICO considers the specific data protection and privacy risks agentic AI could pose:

Agentic AI's opportunities arise from being able to connect systems, tools, and data, and being adaptable to a range of tasks. However, these characteristics could also present challenges from a data protection perspective. For example, organisations might be tempted to set purposes too broadly or grant unfettered access to data and systems. The agentic AI system might also misinterpret human instructions, or act in unexpected ways even where complying with the instructions. These issues would raise concerns around transparency, fairness, purpose limitation, and data minimisation.

Similarly, the complexity of data flows may mean that it is challenging to identify data about a particular individual or amend it, meaning that it is difficult to comply with individual rights requests. Hallucinations or other inaccurate information could ‘cascade' across tools, databases, and other agents, presenting challenges with complying with the accuracy principle. New attack surfaces also present new cybersecurity risks.

Choices such as the data and tools that a system can access and which governance and control measures to put in place will be key in managing and mitigating these risks.

Innovation opportunities

The ICO notes that agentic AI could present solutions for data protection compliance as well as creating challenges. It would like to identify, encourage, and support opportunities for innovation within agentic AI that support data protection and information rights. It notes that Data Protection Officers and governance teams are likely to face an evolving and challenging role as organisations experiment with agents. It suggests that organisations may need a standalone monitoring system to monitor logs, interpret them, and intervene if necessary. Agentic AI could even lead to ‘virtual employees' supporting the human DPO.

How agentic AI could be adopted and the impact on risks

The ICO considers various scenarios around adoption, which will determine how it will regulate.  These are likely to be of interest to organisations to flag regulatory focus, as well as providing insight into potential risks. The ICO flags that high adoption is not inevitable. Similarly, there is a wide spectrum of capabilities we might see in practice. At one end, we might see AI agents that are not much more sophisticated than current chatbots and ADM tools.  At the other, we might see highly capable agents that can handle more complex problems, act with more autonomy, and in a wider range of contexts.

The ICO sets out four possible scenarios:

The two scenarios dealing with high adoption, scenarios two and four, are likely to be of greatest interest to organisations.

Under scenario two (low capability, high adoption – just good enough to be everywhere), the ICO emphasises the potential for harms around failures of agentic AI or ill-considered deployment. This could lead to misinterpreted tasks, superficial approaches to tasks or failures on edge cases.

In scenario four (high capability, low adoption), harms could arise from agents working as intended, for example, accessing large amounts of personal and special category data, and loss of privacy where agents search for and collate information from multiple sources.

Our take

The ICO's analysis is perhaps the most comprehensive regulatory commentary to date on this complex topic. The ICO has flagged the areas that will need attention when organisations are building and deploying agents, and given a flavour of the challenges that may arise depending on how agents are adopted. Detailed guidance on specific mitigations was, understandably, beyond the scope of the current report.

In terms of next steps, the ICO:

In the meantime, building and deploying agents will require careful consideration of the data protection implications in context, as well as the wider legal implications.

Blockchain's next leap won't be powered by code alone: It will be shaped by regulation. Drawing on Europe's experience as home to the world's most comprehensive digital-asset framework to date, this Tracker examines how evolving guidance is beginning to create the foundations for safe, scalable blockchain adoption. It explores the trust architecture emerging where policy and technology converge. It also looks at the implementation challenges that continue to complicate progress. Regulatory clarity is not arriving all at once, but it will ultimately determine how quickly blockchain moves from experimentation to widespread deployment.

We examine regulatory developments in Europe through three lenses:

 





















Regulators are turning blockchain from a gray zone into a defined playing field.

While blockchain rulemaking is progressing at a rapid pace, the practical implementation of these rules is a challenge all its own.

The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) introduced the European Union's first unified regime, MiCA, for blockchain-based digital assets. It established harmonized licensing, disclosure, reserve and governance rules for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), asset-referenced tokens and eMoney tokens. MiCA's phased rollout, entering into force in 2023, adding stablecoin obligations in 2024 and implementing full applicability by December 2024, means the framework is now actively shaping product design, compliance architecture and cross-border scaling decisions.

Regulators are advancing formal legal definitions of tokens, property rights and control. The United Kingdom Law Commission's “data objects” work and PwC's commentary show why these definitions matter: They clarify settlement finality, custody responsibilities and bankruptcy treatment. For banks, that clarity is essential to building tokenized instruments that behave predictably within existing financial-market infrastructure.

The United States remains a multi-regulator patchwork, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), while the EU is pushing toward a single comprehensive regime. The U.K., Singapore and Hong Kong are advancing sandboxes or targeted digital-asset frameworks. Even as strategies diverge, common threads appear: stronger reserve rules, clearer custody requirements and increasingly explicit consumer-protection standards.

Yet while regulatory promulgation is progressing at a rapid pace, the practical implementation of these rules is a challenge all its own, one that increasingly shapes how institutions approach tokenization and digital-asset design.

 





















Regulation is the key that will turn tokenization pilots into production-grade products.

MiCA's stablecoin and eMoney token framework introduces one-to-one reserve requirements, caps for large tokens used in payments, whitepaper and disclosure obligations, complaints handling and governance standards. These provisions influence how banks design tokenized deposits and digital cash, shifting experimentation into regulated production environments aligned with prudential expectations: in other words, regulatory and risk-management requirements.

Even as regulatory clarity expands, institutions must navigate a maze of evolving interpretations and ambiguities—challenges that shape operating models as much as the regulations themselves.

Designing a token without understanding its legal category is no longer possible. Classification (whether security, eMoney, utility or other digital asset) determines which license applies, how capital rules are triggered and what investor protections are required. PwC's “digital assets in law” guidance underscores that this classification is increasingly the starting point, a design brief around which product, custody and operational controls are built.

Banks must reconcile tokenized-asset design with rules governing asset segregation, client-fund protections, operational resilience and record-keeping. Decisions about whether books and records are maintained on-chain, off-chain or in hybrid models directly affect regulatory compliance. As a result, technology, risk and legal teams are embedding regulatory interpretation into architecture decisions from the outset.

However, even as regulatory clarity expands, institutions must still navigate a maze of evolving interpretations, multi-jurisdiction constraints and transitional ambiguities, challenges that shape operating models as much as the regulations themselves.

 





















Institutions are building operating models that turn regulatory complexity into a manageable roadmap, but to unlock adoption at scale, gaps in regulatory clarity must be resolved.

Clarity gaps reflect a regime maturing in real time, but perceived opacity limits the exact benefit MiCA was designed to deliver: a unified European market that accelerates compliant innovation and reduces operational friction across borders.

Europe is experiencing one of the most active periods of digital-asset rulemaking since MiCA's passage. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and national regulators are steadily issuing technical standards, Q&As and supervisory guidance intended to formalize how MiCA operates in practice, from stablecoin governance to liquidity management to CASP obligations. This progress should, in theory, unlock broader institutional participation by reducing compliance uncertainty.

Yet industry reporting shows persistent inconsistencies across EU jurisdictions, including divergent interpretations of token classifications, transitional periods and the determination of liable entities. These gaps reflect a regime maturing in real time, not regulatory failure. Still, perceived opacity limits the exact benefit MiCA was designed to deliver: a unified European market that accelerates compliant innovation and reduces operational friction across borders. Full adoption will depend on synchronized implementation and harmonized enforcement.

Different token classifications can trigger different regulatory regimes even within a single market. Global firms must reconcile EU MiCA rules with U.K. frameworks, U.S. enforcement-led approaches and Asia-Pacific (APAC) sandboxes. Even within the EU, open questions remain, such as the treatment of multi-issuance stablecoins and the fungibility of tokens issued inside versus outside the bloc.

Banks are forming cross-functional “regulatory design squads” that combine legal, risk, product and technology functions. These groups interpret evolving rules and translate them into reference architectures, control libraries and governance frameworks. PwC's taxonomy approach shows how leading institutions are mapping tokens to regulatory categories internally to streamline repeatable product development.

Institutions aim to build infrastructure that respects local licensing, disclosure and reserve rules while enabling cross-border digital-asset interoperability. The upcoming challenge is to design platforms that satisfy national differences but run on shared digital rails, a core theme for multinational financial institutions (FIs).

 





















Regulation is redefining the blockchain conversation from disruption to design. As global authorities formalize standards for tokenization, custody, stablecoins and digital identity, FIs have an opportunity to turn compliance into competitive advantage. Those that treat MiCA/MiCAR and similar regimes as blueprints, building for transparency, interoperability and resilience by design, will be best positioned to scale blockchain safely. But to unlock that future, institutions must anticipate, and strategically navigate, the remaining pockets of regulatory ambiguity. The winners will be those that build for clarity even before clarity fully arrives.

Scientists at the University of Adelaide's Davies Livestock Research Centre (DLRC) have unveiled the most comprehensive cattle genome ever assembled, a breakthrough expected to improve Wagyu breeding and enhance beef marbling. The research delivers a clearer picture of cattle genetics than any previous reference.

"We have presented a near complete cattle genome that is 16 percent longer than the current reference genome," said Dr. Lloyd Low, a senior author of the study and researcher at the DLRC. The findings were published in Nature Communications.

"This new Wagyu genome provides a much more complete and accurate view of the genetic blueprint behind one of the world's most prized beef breeds," said study co-lead author Paulene Pineda from the University of Adelaide.

Unlocking the Genetics of Beef Quality and Profit

Beyond scientific insight, the discovery carries clear economic potential for the beef industry. By revealing more of the Wagyu genetic makeup, researchers have created a powerful tool for identifying traits that influence quality and profitability.

"The Wagyu genome provides a foundational genetic resource to identify variants responsible for marbling and other traits affecting profit," said Professor Wayne Pitchford, Director of the University of Adelaide's Davies Livestock Research Centre and a co-author of the study.

Using the new genome, the team identified hundreds of previously unknown genes and uncovered far more structural genetic variants than earlier reference genomes allowed.

"These structural variants are an untapped genetic resource and some of them may be key to some of the prized traits of cattle. Moreover, they highlight the hidden diversity present within a seemingly homogeneous breed," said Dr. Callum MacPhillamy, a co-lead author from CSIRO.

Benefits Extend Beyond Wagyu

Researchers say the impact of this work goes well beyond Wagyu cattle. The improved genome offers breeders across the industry a more precise way to select animals for desirable traits.

Associate Professor Cynthia Bottema, a co-author of the study from the DLRC, said the advance gives breeders greater control over outcomes.

"Our new cattle genome means breeders now have a better tool that will allow for greater precision when identifying and selecting for traits like marbling, fertility and disease resistance -- not only in Wagyu, but other cattle breeds as well," she said.

The findings arrive at a time when Australia's beef sector continues to grow. Beef production reached 706,296 tonnes in the quarter ending June 2025, while the gross value of cattle and calves slaughtered totaled $4.9 billion. Recent export data shows the industry is now worth more than $1 billion.

International Collaboration and Future Goals

The study was conducted in collaboration with the United States Department for Agriculture (USDA), building on a long-standing research partnership with the University of Adelaide.

"Work completed jointly by the University of Adelaide and the USDA has led to the assembly of some of the world's most complete livestock genomes," Dr. Low said.

"Together, we pioneered the trio binning method for genome assembly. This approach was also published in Nature Communications."

While the new genome offers unprecedented detail, researchers say there is still more work ahead.

"In this study, we successfully assembled the first complete cattle X chromosome and four autosomes. However, assembling the remaining chromosomes to the same level of completeness remains an aim for future work," Dr. Low said.

"Our next goal is to combine the Wagyu assembly with other high-quality cattle genomes to build a pangenome graph that better represents the full spectrum of genetic diversity in the species."

Google is making a key push into AI-powered shopping with the unveiling of Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), a new open technical standard aimed at letting shoppers buy products directly through AI chatbots and search interfaces. The protocol has backing from major retailers and payment players including Walmart, Target, Shopify, and Etsy.

Notably, there was one e-commerce giant not included in Sunday's announcement: Amazon.

The Seattle-based company has long controlled the infrastructure of online shopping. But UCP offers an alternative pathway that could bypass Amazon, potentially steering shoppers to competitors at the critical moment of product discovery.

Announced over the weekend at the National Retail Federation conference in New York City, Google pitched UCP as a foundation for “agentic commerce,” a fast-emerging concept in which AI agents help shoppers carry out multi-step tasks on their behalf.

“AI agents will be a big part of how we shop in the not-so-distant future,” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on X. 

As AI chatbots increasingly influence shopping decisions, retailers face pressure to build custom integrations for each AI platform. UCP aims to eliminate that complexity by creating a shared “language” that lets AI agents securely access product catalogs, pricing, availability, promotions, loyalty programs, and checkout flows.

We spoke to industry analysts about UCP and the potential impact to Amazon's grip on online retail.

UCP might not threaten Amazon's logistics empire. But it could challenge the idea that shopping must begin inside Amazon's app or website, said Maju Kuruvilla, CEO and founder of Seattle-based agentic commerce startup Spangle.

“This doesn't change Amazon's core advantage — price, selection, and convenience,” Kuruvilla said. “This is more of an additional discovery channel.”

Data suggests AI is already influencing online shopping behavior. A new report from Adobe Digital Insights found that AI-driven traffic to retail sites surged 693% year-over-year during the 2025 holiday season, with AI-referred visitors converting at higher rates and spending more time on sites than non-AI traffic.

But analysts caution that traffic growth and checkout partnerships do not equal behavior change.

Juozas Kaziukenas, an independent e-commerce analyst, said many forecasts around agentic commerce assume unrealistically fast adoption. He pointed to OpenAI research showing that only 37% of products returned by ChatGPT's regular shopping results are relevant, calling that “shockingly low.”

“Product discovery, curation, personalization, and recommendations are still barebones on most AI tools,” he said.

Some argue that even if agentic commerce does take off, Amazon is unlikely to be displaced.

“It's proven that consumers are drawn to general merchandise retailers that offer value, selection, and convenience,” said Scott Devitt, an analyst at Wedbush. “AI will have implications for retail, but those tenets won't change. I think Amazon and Walmart will continue to do well.”

Ironically, an agentic commerce boom could actually give Amazon more leverage, said Sucharita Kodali, a retail industry analyst with Forrester.

“If, big if, there does appear to be a winner — and that would be years away — the winner will likely pay Amazon billions for its feed and cooperation, like Google pays Apple,” she said.

Kaziukenas said the growing wave of partnerships reflects a familiar dynamic: an anti-Amazon alliance. 

“Everyone is forming partnerships with everyone else — everyone except Amazon,” he said, adding that the trend reflects Amazon's position in the market. “They can ignore this for now. But it also shows how eager everyone else is to be part of something new to challenge Amazon.”

Amazon has been experimenting with its own AI-powered shopping features, including its Rufus assistant and the “Buy for Me” initiative. The company has not publicly announced support for open agentic commerce standards like UCP. 

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged on a recent earnings call that agentic commerce “has a chance to be really good for e-commerce” and said that he expects the company to partner with third-party agents over time. But he also said agents “aren't very good” at personalization and often display incorrect pricing and delivery estimates.

“So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value,” Jassy said. 

In November, Amazon sued Perplexity to stop the startup from using its AI browser agent to make purchases on its marketplace.

We reached out to Amazon for comment on UCP, and we'll update this story if we hear back. 

Google said that starting soon, shoppers using Google's AI Mode in Search or the Gemini app will see buy buttons on eligible products from participating U.S. retailers. They can check out using payment details already saved in Google Wallet, with PayPal support coming later. Google says retailers remain “the seller of record” and maintain control over customer relationships.

Google's announcement follows similar moves by other large tech companies. Last week, Microsoft debuted Copilot Checkout, allowing users to complete purchases directly inside its AI assistant. OpenAI, working with Stripe, has developed the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) for completing transactions within ChatGPT. 

Emily Pfeiffer, a principal analyst at Forrester, said she's encouraged to see companies pushing for standards — but stressed that it's “still very early, the experiences are pretty poor, and adoption is very low.”

“We won't say that forever, but behavior change takes time and it won't happen if the shopping experiences don't improve,” she said.

Washington state lawmakers are taking another run at regulating artificial intelligence, rolling out a slate of bills this session aimed at curbing discrimination, limiting AI use in schools, and imposing new obligations on companies building emotionally responsive AI products.

The state has passed narrow AI-related laws in the past — including limits on facial recognition and distributing deepfakes — but broader efforts have often stalled, including proposals last year focused on AI development transparency and disclosure.

This year's bills focus on children, mental health, and high-stakes decisions like hiring, housing, and lending. The bills could affect HR software vendors, ed-tech companies, mental health startups, and generative AI platforms operating in Washington.

The proposals come as Congress continues to debate AI oversight with little concrete action, leaving states to experiment with their own guardrails. An interim report issued recently by the Washington state AI Task Force notes that the federal government's “hands-off approach” to AI has created “a crucial regulatory gap that leaves Washingtonians vulnerable.”

Here's a look at five AI-related bills that were pre-filed before the official start of the legislative session, which kicks off Monday.

HB 2157

This sweeping bill would regulate so-called high-risk AI systems used to make or significantly influence decisions about employment, housing, credit, health care, education, insurance, and parole. 

Companies that develop or deploy these systems in Washington would be required to assess and mitigate discrimination risks, disclose when people are interacting with AI, and explain how AI contributed to adverse decisions. Consumers could also receive explanations for decisions influenced by AI.

The proposal would not apply to low-risk tools like spam filters or basic customer-service chatbots, nor to AI used strictly for research. Still, it could affect a wide range of tech companies, including HR software vendors, fintech firms, insurance platforms, and large employers using automated screening tools. The bill would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2027.

SB 5984

This bill, requested by Gov. Bob Ferguson, focuses on AI companion chatbots and would require repeated disclosures that an AI chatbot is not human, prohibit sexually explicit content for minors, and mandate suicide-prevention protocols. Violations would fall under Washington's Consumer Protection Act.

The bill's findings warn that AI companion chatbots can blur the line between human and artificial interaction and may contribute to emotional dependency or reinforce harmful ideation, including self-harm, particularly among minors. 

These rules could directly impact mental health and wellness startups experimenting with AI-driven therapy or emotional support tools — including companies exploring AI-based mental health services, such as Seattle startup NewDays.

Babak Parviz, CEO of NewDays and a former leader at Amazon, said he believes the bill has good intentions but added that it would be difficult to enforce as “building a long-term relationship is so vaguely defined here.”

Parviz said it's important to examine systems that interact with minors to make sure they don't cause harm. “For critical AI systems that interact with people, it's important to have a layer of human supervision,” he said. “For example, our AI system in clinic use is under the supervision of an expert human clinician.”

OpenAI and Common Sense Media are partnering on a ballot initiative in California also focused on chatbots and minors.

SB 5870

A related bill goes even further, creating a potential civil liability when an AI system is alleged to have contributed to a person's suicide.

Under this bill, companies could face lawsuits if their AI system encouraged self-harm, provided instructions, or failed to direct users to crisis resources — and would be barred from arguing that the harm was caused solely by autonomous AI behavior.

If enacted, the measure would explicitly link AI system design and operation to wrongful-death claims. The bill comes amid growing legal scrutiny of companion-style chatbots, including lawsuits involving Character.AI and OpenAI.

SB 5956

Targets AI use in K–12 schools, banning predictive “risk scores” that label students as likely troublemakers and prohibiting real-time biometric surveillance such as facial recognition.

Schools would also be barred from using AI as the sole basis for suspensions, expulsions, or referrals to law enforcement, reinforcing that human judgment must remain central to discipline decisions. 

Educators and civil rights advocates have raised alarms about predictive tools that can amplify disparities in discipline.

SB 5886

This proposal updates Washington's right-of-publicity law to explicitly cover AI-generated forged digital likenesses, including convincing voice clones and synthetic images.

Using someone's AI-generated likeness for commercial purposes without consent could expose companies to liability, reinforcing that existing identity protections apply in the AI era — and not just for celebrities and public figures.

Due to the popularity of this product, the listed MSI Aegis ZS2 C9NVZ-1632US gaming desktop featured in this post is now sold out. There are alternative desktop gaming PCs on the MSI store with large discounts on both RTX 5090 and RTX 5080-powered rigs. Check out these alternate Aegis prebuilt PC deals with savings up to $1160 on the top-end Aegis R2 C14NVZ9-1442US gaming desktop with 5090, 96GB of RAM, and a 4TB SSD. 

An interesting spot today on a very high-end gaming PC from MSI. This high-power rig sports the most powerful gaming graphics card available, but what's really interesting is that this entire PC build is the same price as the cheapest individual RTX 5090 GPU available to buy right now. You can purchase the MSI Aegis ZS2 C9NVZ-1632US directly from MSI for $3599. When we check RTX 5090 GPU prices at PC Partpicker, we can see that the lowest price of an available-to-buy RTX 5090 is $3599, which also happens to be an MSI Gaming Trio 5090 card. The MSRP of the 5090 should be around the $2000 mark, but initial shortages of the cheaper cards and high demand have caused prices to surge.

The MSI Aegis ZS2 C9NVZ-1632US features a combination of hardware components designed to deliver exceptional performance across a wide range of game titles. Inside this ultra-powerful PC is, first off, an Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU, an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X processor, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage. There's also liquid cooling with a 360mm AIO cooler for the CPU, and a 1300 Watt 80 Plus Gold-rated power supply providing the juice for that 5090.

MSI's top-tier gaming rig, the MSI Aegis ZS2 C9NVZ-1632US, comes packed with all the hardware components you need to dominate the competition, including the world's most powerful consumer graphics card. Inside the case is the RTX 5090 GPU, an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X CPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB of SSD storage. 

No need to worry about sourcing all your separate components, as this MSI gaming rig comes prebuilt with some of the world's most powerful components already installed and ready to game as soon as you connect the PC to a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The standout piece of hardware in this prebuilt is the super-powerful RTX 5090 graphics card, which dominates all the competition in gaming.

In our review of Nvidia's RTX 5090, we benchmarked the card against our suite of 16 games and compared the performance against the competition, and also previous generations of Nvidia and AMD GPUs. The RTX 5090 ends up 25% faster than the RTX 4090 across our rasterization suite at 4K ultra. In individual games, it ranges from 6% faster to 43% faster. Where this card really shines is in the higher resolutions, where the power of the GB202 chip shines, and the 32GB of ultrafast GDDR7 runs 33% faster than the GDDR6X memory used on the previous generations RTX 4090.

It won't get new capacity up and running until 2028


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


For the first time since announcing its seismic decision to kill its consumer SSD and memory brand Crucial, Micron has addressed the notion that it is leaving consumers behind in a new interview. The company also warned that despite breaking ground on new memory fabs, we shouldn't expect to see meaningful output impacting memory supply until at least 2028.

Micron's push back against the criticism of its decision to shutter Crucial comes by way of a WCCFTech interview with Christopher Moore, Micron's VP of Marketing, Mobile and Client Business Unit. The outlet wasted no time pressing Moore in Micron's controversial, but not entirely unexpected, decision to shutter the Crucial brand late last year. In early December, the company said that it plans to wind down its consumer business by the end of next month (January), reallocating its output and time to enterprise-grade DRAM and SSDs for AI buildouts.

Moore was asked if memory suppliers were inclined towards catering to the AI sector, "leaving consumers behind" as a result. "Well, first I would want to try to help everybody understand that the perception may not be exactly correct, at least from our point of view," Moore said. He stated that while he would "never want to tell someone what to think or that they're wrong... our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world." Moore then cited Micron's sizeable businesses in the client and mobile market. Moore hinted that Micron is still technically serving consumers by supplying LPDDR5 to OEMs like Dell and Asus for inclusion in laptops, amongst other things. While this is technically correct, the news will be of little comfort to the DIY community and enthusiasts facing colossal price increases.

While the report claims Micron is in contact with "every single PC brand out there", the company simply cannot afford to ignore AI demand.

Some hope on the horizon for PC builders and the consumer sector is increased DRAM capacity in the supply chain. Micron recently announced it would begin work on a $100 billion New York 'megafab', where it plans to produce 40% of the company's overall DRAM output by the 2040s. Moore also noted its upcoming ID1 facility in Idaho, which is scheduled to come online in mid-2027. However, he warned that it will be 2028 before we see "real output, meaningful output," in its DRAM supply chain. Don't forget that Micron can't even keep up with current demand. Its CEO said in December that it can only meet half to two-thirds of demand, meaning that even the upcoming new capacity will initially go towards making up shortfalls for existing demand. As such, while 2028 might mark the first meaningful dent Micron makes in DRAM supply, it could be months more before consumers start to see any shift in pricing for PC builds.

If you produce a product that causes harm, and there are steps that could be taken to prevent that harm, you should be held responsible for it. Before the trump admin dropped the Boeing case, Boeing was going to be held liable for design defects in its Max planes that caused crashes. The government wasn't going after Boeing bc a plane crashed, but bc Boeing did not take adequate steps from preventing that from happening.

reply

This is wholly unrealistic. Any product can be used to cause harm and there are always steps that could be taken to prevent that. E.g. ceasing sales. But that would often do more harm than it prevents.

reply

You can't go after a company that makes kitchen knives if those are used to harm bc there's nothing reasonable they could have done to prevent that harm, and there's a legitimate use case for knives for cooking.In this case, my understanding is other companies (OpenAI and Anthropic) have done more to limit harm, whereas XAI hasn't.

Ironic that the minister who spearheaded that awful bill (Peter Kyle) as Tech minister is now being the government spokesperson for this debacle as Business Minister. The UK needs someone who knows how tech and business works to tackle this, and that's not Peter Kyle.A platform suspension in the UK should have been swift, with clear terms for how X can be reinstated. As much as it appears Musk is doubling down on letting Grok produce CSAM as some form of free speech, the UK government should treat it as a limited breach or bug that the vendor needs to resolve, whilst taking action to block the site causing harm until they've fixed it.Letting X and Grok continue to do harm, and get free PR, is just the worst case scenario for all involved.

I'm referring to the Act's powers to compel companies to actually do things in my original comment.

Peter Kyle is the minister who delivered the measures from the bill that a lot of people are angry about and this latest issue on X is just another red flag that the bill is poorly worded and thought out putting too much emphasis on ID age checks for citizens than actually stopping any abuse. Peter Kyle is the one who called out objections to the bill as being on the "side of predators". Peter Kyle is now the one, despite having moved department, who is somehow commenting on this issue.Totally happy to call out the Tories, and prior ministers who worked on the Bill/Act but Kyle implemented it, made reckless comments about, and now is trying to look proactive about an issue it covers that it's so ineffectively applying to.

If you believe in democracy, and the rule of law, and citizenship, then the responsibility obviously lies with people who create and publish pictures, not the makers of tools.Think of it. You can use a phone camera to produce illegal pictures. What kind of a world would we live in if Apple was required to run an AI filter on your pics to determine whether they comply with the laws?A different question is if X actually hosts generated pictures that are illegal in the UK. In that case, X acts as a publisher, and you can sue them along with the creator for removal.

Submission titles should be the original article titles, as long as those aren't problematic.

I agree this is problematic, but I am inclined to see it as an opportunity to discuss the problem and illustrate how widespread it is. We can also mention real issues, such as about half of all domestic abuse victims in the UK are male (if you count emotional abuse, otherwise its still 40%), more than half of rapes in the US are of men (because of the huge number of prison rapes), etc.

After five years of building an edtech company, Nathan Nwachuku, 22, realized that Africa was at a crossroads. The continent is undergoing rapid industrialization, he told TechCrunch. There is money, opportunity, and a young, driven population. He figured, soon enough, the continent was on the “edge of an industrial revolution.” 

“At the same time,” he said, he felt the continent still struggled to address what was one of its biggest Achilles' heels: “Terrorism and insecurity.” Africa has more terror-related deaths than any region in the world, and it is this problem that could slow down — or even stop completely — the growth of the region, Nwachuku said. 

He teamed up with a friend, Maxwell Maduka, 24, and launched Terra Industries, a defense company that designs infrastructure and autonomous systems to help governments and organizations monitor and respond to threats. The company announced Monday that it emerged from stealth with an $11.75 million round led by Joe Lonsdale's 8VC. 

Others in the round include Valor Equity Partners, Lux Capital, SV Angel, and Nova Global. The company previously raised an $800,000 pre-seed round, and Nwachuku said others took much interest in the company after it appeared on CNN. African investors in the company include Tofino Capital, Kaleo Ventures, and DFS Lab. 

“The goal is to build Africa's first defense prime, to build autonomous defense systems and other systems to protect our critical infrastructure and resources from armed attacks,” Nwachuku, the company's CEO, said. Maduka serves as the company's CTO. 

The team is stacked with military experience: 40% of its engineers held the same role in the Nigerian military; 8VC's Alex Moore, who specializes in defense investing, is also on the board, and Nigeria's Vice Air Marshal Ayo Jolasinmi serves as an advisor. Maduka also served as an engineer in the Nigerian Navy and founded a drone company at 19.

The company, based in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, took a multi-domain approach to product development, considering how to protect critical infrastructure from the ground, water, and air. For the air, the company produces long-range and short-range drones. On the ground, it has surveillance towers and ground drones. The company is still working on developing maritime technology to help protect infrastructure such as offshore rigs and underwater pipelines. 

Terra powers its tech with its proprietary software, ArtemisOS, which collects, analyzes, and synthesizes data in real time. Once threats are spotted, they alert response forces (such as security agencies) so they can intercept them. “We want to geofence all of Africa's critical infrastructure and resources,” Nwachuku said, adding that the problem is not lack of firepower (many African armies already have that).

Instead, it's a lack of sovereign intelligence, as much of the intelligence that African countries depend on comes from Western powers, China, and Russia. 

“We want to take the defense of our continent's resources and infrastructure into Africa's own hands,” Nwachuku continued. “We are the first truly Pan-African defense company.” 

Terra recently won its first federal contract, though it said it cannot provide more details. The company makes money when governments and commercial customers place orders for Terra systems and then pay an annual fee for data processing and storage. Nwachuku said the company has generated more than $2.5 million in commercial revenue so far and is protecting assets valued at around $11 billion. 

Commercial revenue comes from protecting private infrastructure, like gold mines or power plants. Terra said it is protecting at least two hydro power plants and several smaller mines, with most of the company's clientele coming from Nigeria. 

The company hopes to use the fresh capital to help expand and build more defense factories across Africa. It also wants to further expand its software capabilities and grow its AI team. It will open software offices in San Francisco and London, but the company said manufacturing will remain in Africa, with more factories opening across the continent to boost job creation. 

“It's clear Africa today is undergoing what I see as an epic struggle for its very survival,” Nwachuku said. “The only way for us to truly break ourselves from the shackles that have held us back for the last decade or two is ensuring the core resources, the core infrastructures of the continent, are entirely protected.”

Young adults today are digital natives-naturally fluent with devices and online platforms-so some of their most effective behavioral-health interventions will likely arrive in their pockets via text, app, or other mobile medium. Now, new research shows that such interventions for alcohol and cannabis use among young adults show potential to reduce harms, according to three reports in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.

Heavy drinking and cannabis use among young adults continue to exact a great cost from individuals and society, bringing such risks and consequences as fatal car accidents, assaults, and unintentional injuries. With the use of smartphones, individuals can provide large amounts of data in real-time while in their natural environment. These data collected from daily or "ecological momentary assessments" can then be used in mobile-health interventions to help support behavior change and addiction prevention-as highlighted in these studies.

Our motivation was to show how daily and ecological momentary assessment data can be used creatively with individuals reporting on their experiences up to several times a day over a certain time period."

Anne M. Fairlie, research associate professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Washington School of Medicine

Fairlie co-authored two of the three studies as well as an editorial summarizing the research.

"Placing these three research articles together makes clear that similar data can be incorporated into different types of interventions in unique ways," adds Fairlie. 

In one study, Traci M. Kennedy, of the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues, studied a mobile-health intervention specifically tailored toward young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at high risk for heavy drinking. Participants received frequent check-ins via their smartphones to help identify patterns in ADHD symptoms and their drinking. Based on their responses, participants got tailored feedback to improve self-awareness and reduce alcohol intake.

In a second article, investigators led by Melissa A. Lewis of the University of Texas at Arlington describe the development of a web-based intervention-followed by text messages delivered three times a week for eight weeks-for young adults at risk for alcohol and cannabis use. Their study demonstrated that understanding people's motivations and barriers regarding substance use through their responses can help investigators tailor messages about "protective behavioral strategies" (that is, strategies to moderate use and reduce risk) to reduce harms.

The third study, by Fairlie and colleagues, examines the use of ecological momentary assessment to gather real-time data from young adults experiencing a craving to drink alcohol in response to various cues and situational factors. Participants completed multiple daily surveys over 17 days before receiving a one-time personalized feedback intervention based on their aggregated data, designed to allow them to better recognize triggers for their use.

"One clear theme across the studies was the importance of tailoring interventions, even though each used a distinct approach," says Fairlie. "Together, they illustrate multiple pathways to meaningful personalization and reinforce the idea that ecological momentary assessment is a flexible tool rather than a fixed approach. It was encouraging to see that adaptability across studies."

Ultimately, concludes Fairlie, "There are many ways to translate daily and ecological momentary assessment data into personalized intervention content, which is important for advancing innovation while still grounding the work in strong methodology."

Fairlie notes that, as this type of research progresses, we can look forward to more novel and creative digital interventions tailored to support healthier choices and behaviors among different at-risk, young-adult groups.

A new study from Karolinska Institutet, published in Nature Communications, reveals how rhythmic brain waves known as alpha oscillations help us distinguish between our own body and the external world. The findings offer new insights into how the brain integrates sensory signals to create a coherent sense of bodily self.

What makes you feel that your hand is yours? It might seem obvious, but the brain's ability to tell self from non-self is a complex process.

Using a combination of behavioral experiments, brain recordings (EEG), brain stimulation, and computational modelling with a total of 106 participants, researchers from Karolinska Institutet investigated how the brain combines visual and tactile signals to create the feeling that a body part belongs to oneself – a phenomenon known as the sense of body ownership. Their experiments showed that the frequency of alpha waves in the parietal cortex, the brain region that processes sensory information from the body, determines how precisely we perceive our body as our own.

We have identified a fundamental brain process that shapes our continuous experience of being embodied. The findings may provide new insights into psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, where the sense of self is disturbed."

Mariano D'Angelo, lead author, researcher at the Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet

Participants took part in the rubber hand illusion, a classic method for studying the sense of body ownership. When touches on a visible rubber hand and the participant's hidden real hand were synchronised, many reported feeling that the rubber hand was part of their body. But when the timing was off, that feeling faded.

The study found that individuals with faster alpha frequencies were more sensitive to timing differences between the seen and felt touches. They noted smaller timing differences, as if their brains operated at higher temporal resolution, resulting in a more precise sense of body ownership.

In contrast, slower alpha frequencies were linked to a broader 'temporal binding window,' causing the brain to treat more asynchronous visual and tactile signals as if they occurred together. This reduced temporal precision made it harder to separate self-related sensations from external ones, weakening the distinction between body and world.

To test whether alpha frequency directly causes these perceptual effects, the researchers used non-invasive electrical brain stimulation to slightly speed up or slow down participants' alpha waves. The results showed that adjusting the alpha frequency in this way also changed how precisely people experienced body ownership and how precisely they perceived visual and tactile stimuli as simultaneous. Computational models showed that alpha frequency influences how precisely the brain judges the timing of sensory signals, meaning that these brain waves regulate the temporal precision of perception and thereby help shape our sense of bodily self.

"Our findings help explain how the brain solves the challenge of integrating signals from the body to create a coherent sense of self," says Henrik Ehrsson, professor at the Department of Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, and last author of the study. "This can contribute to the development of better prosthetic limbs and more realistic virtual reality experiences."

The study was a collaboration between Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Aix-Marseille Université in France. It was funded by the European Research Council (ERC), the Swedish Research Council, VINNOVA, StratNeuro and A*Midex.

A previously unknown mechanism that makes it possible for aggressive so-called triple-negative breast cancer to fine-tune its production of proteins has been discovered by researchers at Umeå University, Sweden. The discovery increases our understanding of how tumors grow and adapt, and it opens up for research into new future treatments.

"We have found a critical control point that, when disturbed, can tip the balance against cancer," says Francesca Aguilo, associate professor at the Department of Molecular Biology at Umeå University and who has led the current study.

All cells in the body use ribosomes, small molecular factories, to translate genetic information from RNA into proteins. Ribosomes are complex structures made up of ribosomal RNA and proteins, and they have built-in control systems that ensure that everything works as it should. When these systems are disrupted, diseases such as cancer can occur.

Ribosomal RNA is rich in chemical modifications that help the ribosome function optimally. One such modification is 2′-O-methylation, Nm, which is controlled by the enzyme fibrillarin. The new study shows that fibrillarin plays a key role in how ribosomes are built and which proteins are made.

The researchers discovered that fibrillarin collaborates with the ribosome protein RPS28 to create specialized ribosomes with unique properties. When fibrillarin is missing, RPS28 also disappears, leading to a mixture of different ribosome types - so-called ribosomal heterogeneity. This imbalance affects which proteins are produced and can drive the development of cancer.

Cancer is not only about mutated genes, but also about how cells control the amount and type of proteins that are produced."

Francesca Aguilo, Associate Professor, Department of Molecular Biology, Umeå University

Although more research is needed before the results can be translated into treatments, the study points to a new direction for research on treatments; to attack cancer as a disease of misregulated protein production.

The study has been conducted in collaboration with several European universities and published in the scientific journal Cancer Letters. It has been funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg and Kempe Foundations, among others.

To make cancer care smoother and more effective, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology has introduced a new clinical trial for people with gastrointestinal cancers, such as cancers of the stomach, colon, and esophagus. The PAGODA trial (Alliance A232402CD) will test a proactive approach to chemotherapy dose adjustments, aiming to minimize treatment interruptions and help patients complete their chemotherapy as planned.

Unplanned chemotherapy interruptions can be stressful, time consuming, and may affect how well treatment works. Our trial will test a new approach that uses a clear, step-by-step plan to adjust chemotherapy doses before problems occur rather than waiting until side effects happen."

Gabriel Brooks, MD, MPH, study chair, Associate Professor of Medicine, Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine

While some treatment delays are necessary due to new or worsening medical problems, many delays are triggered by asymptomatic changes that are only found in routine blood work. These unplanned delays are disruptive for patients and their caregivers because they lead to additional travel, blood draws, clinic visits, and time away from home and work-a phenomenon increasingly recognized as time toxicity.

Unplanned delays are also inefficient for clinical teams, resulting in unused treatment capacity at the time of the delay and duplicative future clinic visits and laboratory testing. Lastly, delays that lead to reduced chemotherapy dose-intensity can have a negative effect on cancer treatment outcomes 

This trial will test PAGODA, the Proactive Graduated Dose Modification Algorithm. It's a structured plan that helps doctors make small, proactive changes to chemotherapy doses to prevent treatment delays. Instead of reacting after severe side effects occur, PAGODA guides doctors to act early, keeping patients on schedule and reducing stress and delays.

The trial plans to enroll about 400 patients with cancer of the esophagus, gastroesophageal junction, stomach, small intestine, appendix, colon, rectum, and cancers of unknown primary with suspected GI origin. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

o Standard care: Doctors adjust chemotherapy doses as they normally would.

o PAGODA approach: Doctors follow the algorithm to guide dose changes.

Both groups receive the same chemotherapy drugs commonly used for GI cancers.

"This study is about improving experience for patients and their loved ones," added Dr. Brooks. "We want to reduce the uncertainty and interruptions that come with traditional dosing methods and give patients a smoother, more predictable treatment journey. If PAGODA proves successful, it could change how we manage chemotherapy for gastrointestinal cancers-making care more consistent and less burdensome."

Rates of multiple myeloma (MM), the second most common blood cancer in the United States, are increasing and are twice as high in men than in women. A new study published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society, provides insights that may help to explain this disparity.

To investigate the sex difference in MM, researchers analyzed data on 850 patients with newly diagnosed MM enrolled in the Integrative Molecular And Genetic Epidemiology (IMAGE) study at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Compared with female patients, male patients were more likely to have advanced (International Staging System stage III) disease at the time of diagnosis. Males were also more likely to have high myeloma load-serum monoclonal protein (an abnormal protein produced by cancerous blood cells), more organ failure (especially kidney failure), and bone damage. Men were less likely than women to have low bone mineral density, and myeloma-defining features tended to differ between the two sexes. These differences were apparent even after taking numerous factors into account-including race, age, body mass index, education, income, smoking, and alcohol use.

Analyses suggested that certain chromosomal abnormalities that lead to initiation of myeloma occurring more often in younger males may help to explain some of the differences seen in this study.

This research suggests that sex-specific mechanisms promote multiple myeloma pathogenesis, which may account for the excess risk seen in men. These findings may be used to improve risk stratification, diagnosis, and tailored treatments for both men and women with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma or related early precursor conditions."

In about 5–10% of colorectal cancer patients, hereditary factors play a role, with higher percentages among younger patients. Research from Radboud university medical center and university hospital Bonn (UKB) in collaboration with researchers from Munich and Barcelona, shows that DNA analysis of colorectal polyps provides important additional information on the development of these polyps and colorectal cancer. This DNA analysis leads to better diagnostics and treatment and offers patients and their family members greater clarity. The results have now been published in Gastroenterology.

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers in the Western world (WHO fact sheet). It is estimated that hereditary factors play a role in about 5–10% of these cases, with a higher prevalence of hereditary factors in younger patients. A large number of colorectal polyps are considered potential precursors to cancer: at least 10 polyps in people under 60 and more than 20 in those under 70. These individuals can undergo genetic testing through blood DNA analysis. In about one-quarter of cases, a genetic cause is identified. These patients and the mutation carriers among their relatives qualify for regular screenings to detect and treat colorectal cancer at an early stage.

However, in the remaining three-quarter patients, no genetic cause of the disease can be uncovered, even when there is strong suspicion of hereditary risk, explains Richarda de Voer, lead researcher at Radboudumc. "For example, because they have a large number of polyps or relatives diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In this group, we performed extensive genetic analysis on the DNA of the polyps themselves. We wanted to know whether this could provide more information, such as how a polyp develops."

Together with an international team within the Solve-RD consortium, the research groups analyzed 333 polyps from 180 individuals across Europe who had no genetic cause detected by analysis from blood-derived DNA. A clear picture emerged. Eighty individuals had adenomatous polyps. These polyps were mainly caused by non-hereditary mutations in the APC gene, but in at least 20% of individuals, there was APC mutational mosaicism. This means that the predisposition is not present in all body cells, but for example, restricted to cells of the large intestine.

We already know for some time that this predisposition for polyps and colorectal cancer exists, but it is not yet routinely analyzed across all centers in Europe." 

Stefan Aretz, lead researcher and member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area "Life & Health", University of Bonn

 Furthermore, this study suggests that in the development of adenomatous polyps without hereditary predisposition, APC is likely the only gene where mosaicism plays a role. "If a blood test is negative, DNA analysis of polyps is the way to detect this form of genetic predisposition. This is important because siblings of someone with this form of predisposition are not at increased risk, but their offspring may be" De Voer completes. Moreover, the study provided valuable insights into the early genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract.

About sixty individuals had so-called serrated polyps. Almost all of these showed a non-hereditary mutation in the BRAF gene. Detailed genetic analysis revealed that these polyps genetically resemble an overgrowth of normal intestinal tissue. De Voer: "We want to investigate this further, because at this point, we cannot say whether these polyps will always develop into colorectal cancer."

With this research, the teams from De Voer, Aretz, and their colleagues have provided clarity to a large group of patients, demonstrating the added value of making DNA analysis of polyps using advanced technologies a standard part of diagnostics in Europe. "In particular the identification of APC mosaicism due to the implementation of a more comprehensive work-up in routine care enables not only diagnostic clarity to the patients but relieves their relatives and can exclude a risk in the majority of their children", said Aretz. 

In the Netherlands, about 12,000 people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year. Everyone aged 55 to 75 receives an invitation for colorectal cancer screening every two years. Participation is voluntary and helps detect cancer early. If follow-up tests reveal a few polyps (e.g., 2 or 3), this usually does not indicate a substantially increased risk. Only in cases of numerous polyps (10 under age 60 or 20 under age 70) or symptoms such as unexplained abdominal pain or blood in the stool may additional testing be necessary. If you are unsure or have symptoms, always contact your GP.

A whole-genome sequencing approach shows early promise over current commercial methods for identifying more patients likely to benefit from PARP inhibitor cancer treatments, according to a study led by Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian investigators. The findings suggest further development of this approach is merited.

In the study, published Jan. 12 in Communications Medicine, the researchers performed whole-genome sequencing analysis on hundreds of tumor samples obtained by informed consent as part of a precision medicine initiative by Weill Cornell, NewYork-Presbyterian and Illumina, Inc., a biotechnology company known for its DNA sequencing technology. They used the results to train and validate an algorithm that detects homologous recombination deficiency, a type of DNA-repair defect. Tumors with this defect are vulnerable to PARP inhibitors, which further disrupt DNA repair, causing cancer cells to accumulate DNA damage and die. Platinum-based chemotherapies, which also damage DNA, tend to work better in these cases. An initial test suggested that the algorithm is more accurate in predicting PARP-inhibitor treatment responses compared with existing methods.

A comprehensive analysis of the entire genome has advantages compared with traditional, targeted detection strategies for predicting homologous recombination deficiency."

Dr. Juan Miguel Mosquera, study senior author, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine and director of research pathology at the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine at Weill Cornell and a pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center

Dr. Mosquera is also a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell.

The study was a collaboration with the medical diagnostics company Isabl, Inc.

Until now, clinicians have focused primarily on BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the most frequent drivers of this DNA-repair defect, to determine if patients will benefit from PARP inhibitors. These mutations can be found most frequently in patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers. However, research shows that many other gene mutations can also disrupt this repair process-and in recent years, whole-genome sequencing, which can detect these broader changes, has become affordable enough for routine use.

The team used 305 samples from Weill Cornell and NewYork-Presbyterian patients with various cancers to train an algorithm that was developed by Isabl. The algorithm looks for a genome-wide variety of DNA defects that are known to be associated with homologous recombination repair deficiency. They then validated the algorithm using a cohort of 556 cancers and tested it against commercial methods using an additional 212 tumor samples.

The algorithm detected the DNA-repair deficiency in many of the samples, including 21% of breast tumors, 20% of pancreatic and bile duct tumors, and 17% of gynecological tumors. Notably, 24% of the detected cases did not involve BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, highlighting the diversity of the underlying genetic mutations.

In several cases, the algorithm appeared to flag "false negative" and "false positive" predictions from the commercial method that didn't match patient outcomes.

The team plans to conduct larger studies of the new detection algorithm as a general tool to guide cancer treatment.

Researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have led the first clinical trial in the world to show that cancer drug treatments can be safely and effectively personalized based on the unique DNA of a patient's tumor.

The study results, published in the January 8, 2026 online edition of Journal of Clinical Oncology found that individualizing multi-drug treatments to each patient's specific tumor mutations using molecular testing can significantly enhance treatment success.

Every patient and every cancer is unique, and so should how we treat for them. Our findings demonstrate that precision oncology at the individual level is achievable. When every patient's treatment is guided by their tumor's distinctive DNA, we can treat cancer with better accuracy."

Jason Sicklick, MD, senior author of the study, professor of surgery and pharmacology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and surgical oncologist at UC San Diego Health

The clinical trial, known as Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy (I-PREDICT), used advanced genomic sequencing to identify the genomic changes driving each person's cancer. Clinicians then developed personalized treatment plans using FDA-approved drugs, with doses carefully adjusted for each patient to precisely target those molecular alterations - the opposite of a one-size-fits-all approach.

Among a cohort of 210 patients with advanced cancers that were treated, nearly 95% had distinct tumor DNA profiles - no two cancers were alike. This led to 157 different treatment regimens, including 103 new drug pairings that had never been tested together before. Patients whose therapies were most closely matched to their tumor mutations experienced better treatment results, improving their chances for response and survival. Importantly, those who received new drug combinations did not experience more severe side effects than patients receiving standard therapies.

The study also found that starting new drug mixes at lower doses and carefully increasing them over time kept treatments safe, even with therapies that had never been used together before.

"The I-PREDICT study shows what's possible when we let a patient's biology guide their treatment," said Shumei Kato, MD, associate professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine and medical oncologist at UC San Diego Health. "By using biomarkers to select drugs and adjust doses, we can design combinations that precisely target the drivers of each person's cancer."

"Innovative clinical trial design is a central part of what we do at Moores Cancer Center," said Diane Simeone, MD, director of Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health. "This study reflects the strength of our multi-disciplinary team-based approach, combining scientific leadership, clinical trial expertise and the infrastructure needed to bring discoveries directly to patients. It's a powerful example of how we're shaping the future of precision oncology and placing the patient at the center of every decision."

Both Sicklick and Kato are members of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, which served as a key partner in supporting the clinical trial.

Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health is the region's only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. They are consistently ranked among the top 50 in the nation for cancer care by U.S. News & World Report.

Sicklick, who is also co-leader of the structural and functional genomics program at Moores Cancer Center, adds that this research marks a turning point for cancer treatment.

"Instead of a one-size-fits-all, we're moving toward one-size-fits-one," said Sicklick.

The research builds upon earlier findings published in Nature Medicine (2019) and Genome Medicine (2022) that analyzed subsets of the I-PREDICT cohort. The new publication expands this work, including more patients and longer follow-up, while offering detailed guidance on how other organizations can replicate precision cancer care strategies.

This study lays the groundwork for a future randomized trial designed to confirm the benefits of this personalized precision oncology approach.

Additional co-authors of the study include Daisuke Nishizaki, Hirotaka Miyashita, Ryosuke Okamura, Michael E. Hahn, Mina Nikanjam, Paul T. Fanta, David E. Piccioni, Hitendra Patel, Ramez N. Eskander, Rana R. McKay, Jeffrey S. Ross, J. Jack Lee, Scott M. Lippman, Shumei Kato, and Razelle Kurzrock, MD, all at UC San Diego.

Funding support for the study came, in part, from Foundation Medicine, the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Foundation, Jon Strong, and the National Institutes of Health (P30 CA023100).

Adding yoga to standard care for opioid use disorder (OUD) may speed up recovery from opioid withdrawal and improve nervous system regulation, results from a new randomized clinical trial suggested.

Among male patients with OUD, those who received buprenorphine and completed 10 supervised yoga classes recovered from opioid withdrawal 4 days faster than those who received buprenorphine alone. Yoga was also associated with improved measures of anxiety, sleep, and pain.

“These findings support integrating yoga into withdrawal protocols as a neurobiologically informed intervention addressing core regulatory processes beyond symptom management,” wrote lead investigator Pratima Murthy, MD, director of the National Institute of Mental Health and NeuroSciences, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India, and colleagues.

The study was published online on January 7 in JAMA Psychiatry.

The opioid epidemic is currently considered a public health crisis, with 76% of US drug overdose deaths in 2023 involving opioids.

While drug treatments for OUD, such as buprenorphine, help manage opioid withdrawal symptoms, they don't fully address the disruption of nervous system activity that has been linked to a greater risk for relapse, the investigators noted. 

They wanted to know if adding yoga to standard treatment might aid autonomic regulation and speed up withdrawal recovery.

For the randomized, blinded clinical trial, a total of 59 male participants (mean age, 26 years) with OUD who had mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms received treatment with buprenorphine plus yoga (n = 30) or buprenorphine alone (n = 29).

Patients who had severe withdrawal symptoms, neurological disorders affecting autonomic function, and severe psychiatric conditions were excluded from the analysis. Those who had undertaken yoga classes for OUD in the past 6 months were also excluded.

Buprenorphine dosage was determined by each participant's psychiatrist based on the patient's withdrawal symptoms.

The yoga group completed up to 10 supervised sessions of yoga (45 minutes each) for 2 weeks. The yoga classes were designed to address withdrawal symptoms and consisted of various breathing techniques and mindful poses.

One of the primary outcomes was the time to recover from opioid withdrawal, measured by the daily Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score. Recovery was defined as the first day a patient's COWS score fell below 4 (indicating minimal or no withdrawal symptoms) and remained at that level.

Autonomic nervous system regulation was assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) and analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.

Secondary outcomes assessed were anxiety, measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale; sleep latency based on participants' self-reported time to fall asleep; and pain, assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory questionnaire.

Investigators found that withdrawal symptoms stabilized significantly faster in the yoga group, with a median time to stabilization of 5 days compared to 9 days for the control group (hazard ratio [HR], 4.40; P < .001). There was no significant difference in total doses of buprenorphine between the groups.

The yoga group also showed improved autonomic regulation compared to those in the control group, with statistically significant effects on measures of HRV.

Researchers reported that parasympathetic activity was associated with yoga's effect on withdrawal, accounting for an estimated 23% of the treatment effect (indirect HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-2.03).

Those in the yoga group showed a significant decrease in anxiety scores (P < .001) and moderate benefits for pain and sleep latency.

Limitations included the male-only sample, single-center design, and short intervention period.

“By targeting parasympathetic restoration, yoga may fill a critical therapeutic gap in standard OUD care, supporting integration into withdrawal protocols as a neurobiologically informed intervention with potential economic benefits,” the investigators wrote.

Kevin Hill, MD, reported receiving other fees from Hazelden Publishing and Wolters Kluwer outside of this study. This research was supported by the DBT/Wellcome Trust India Alliance Fellowship.

Physical exercise is one of the main recommendations for maintaining good health. However, when practiced compulsively and without control, it can become a problem: exercise addiction.

An international study led by Miguel Hernández University of Elche (UMH) and the Institute for Health and Biomedical Research of Alicante (ISABIAL) has identified perfectionism and competitive sports practice as two factors most strongly associated with the risk of developing this behavior.The research, published in the journal Addictive Behaviors, analyzed more than 1,000 young adults (average age 25, 65% male), including both athletes and non-athletes. Participants completed questionnaires about exercise habits, personality traits, and motivations related to physical activity. To interpret the data, researchers applied artificial intelligence techniques capable of identifying complex patterns among psychological and behavioral variables.

We know exercise is key for health, but when it becomes obsessive, it can have serious physical, psychological, and social consequences. We found that perfectionism and certain goals linked to body image - such as losing weight or gaining muscle - predict a higher risk of exercise dependence, particularly among those involved in competitive sports."

Thomas Zandonai, Ramón y Cajal Researcher, Department of Pharmacology, Pediatrics, and Organic Chemistry at UMH

The results show that perfectionism is the most consistent predictor, followed by the desire to lose weight, build muscle, and variables associated with sports intensity, among 27 analyzed factors. This pattern holds for both professional and amateur athletes, although signs of risk are already more frequent among amateurs than in those who exercise only recreationally. In contrast, the study found no significant differences between men and women.Exercise addiction shares features with other addictive behaviors but is also connected to conditions like eating disorders and compulsive exercise, which complicates diagnosis. The authors emphasize that the findings represent population-level risk models, not individual diagnoses: not all perfectionist or competitive athletes will develop dependence, but the information can help identify those who may need support to maintain a healthy relationship with exercise."What we detect are phenotypes or risk patterns, not individual diagnoses," notes Ana María Peiró, UMH professor and coauthor. She notes that the concept of perfectionism in everyday language does not always align with what validated psychological tests measure. However, Peiró advises that "if exercising causes distress or interferes with daily life, consulting health professionals is recommended."The study was funded by the Spanish Government Delegation for the National Plan on Drugs through the MORPHEO project (2023I031) and carried out in collaboration with the Addiction Science Laboratory at the University of Trento (Italy), a leading center in behavioral addiction research. It also served as a foundation for several undergraduate and master's theses, as well as part of a doctoral dissertation at UMH, where students applied these methodologies to explore different aspects of exercise addiction.

Researchers at VIB and KU Leuven have identified a molecular process that allows motor neurons to maintain protein production, a process that fails in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, reveals an early weakness in neurodegeneration and highlights a potential target for future therapies.

Motor neurons depend on local protein production within their axons to support their long-distance connections to muscles. Using advanced spatial transcriptomics, scientists at the VIB-KU Leuven Center for Brain & Disease Research analyzed gene expression separately in neuron cell bodies and axons in adult mice. They found that axons contain unexpectedly high levels of the molecular machinery needed to make proteins.

In ALS models carrying disease-causing mutations in the RNA-binding protein FUS, this local protein production system was severely disrupted. The researchers traced the problem to Eif5a, a protein required for translation that must undergo a chemical modification called hypusination to function properly. In mutant neurons, the active form of Eif5a was specifically lost from axons, leading to reduced local protein synthesis.

"We showed that local translation depends on the protein levels of Dohh, an enzyme essential for Eif5a hypusination," says Dr. Diana Piol (VIB-KU Leuven, now at the University of Padova), first author of the study, "When we supplied axons with spermidine, a naturally occurring molecule needed for this modification, they were able to restore Eif5a activity. In turn, this improved local protein production, strengthened axonal structure, and enhanced neuronal activity."These defects in protein production start locally in axons, long before the neurons themselves degenerate," says senior author Prof. Sandrine Da Cruz (VIB-KU Leuven). "By restoring protein synthesis in axons, we were able to reduce disease-related damage in several ALS models. This discovery was enabled by the pioneering use of spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression within neuronal subcellular compartments, highlighting the critical role of distal axon homeostasis as a promising therapeutic target."Spermidine treatment also reduced toxicity in fruit fly models of ALS linked to both FUS and TDP-43, suggesting that this pathway may be relevant across multiple forms of the disease.Although these findings do not yet lead directly to a treatment, they identify Eif5a hypusination as a promising therapeutic target and demonstrate how spatial analysis can reveal early, compartment-specific mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease.

People of normal weight may also be at risk of diabetes and similar diseases. A study from the University of Gothenburg reveals that those with an unexpectedly high so-called metabolic BMI have up to a five times higher risk level.

Conventional BMI offers too limited a view to accurately assess the risks of metabolic diseases, such as cardiometabolic diseases. BMI is based solely on a person's height and weight and provides a value to divide into the categories: underweight, normal weight, overweight or obesity.

Metabolic BMI (MetBMI), on the other hand, identifies obesity-linked changes in metabolism that can be present even at normal weight. The current study, published in Nature Medicine, identifies the magnitude of the risks faced by people whose metabolic BMI is higher than their conventional BMI.

The results show that unexpectedly high metabolic BMI is linked to a two to five times higher risk of a range of diseases and conditions: fatty liver, diabetes, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and even predicts poor/limited weight loss following bariatric surgery.

Our metBMI uncovers a hidden metabolic disorder that is not always visible on the scale. Two people with the same BMI can have completely different risk profiles depending on how their metabolism and adipose tissue function."

Rima Chakaroun, researcher at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg and first author of the study

The metabolic BMI developed by the researchers is based on advanced metabolomic analyses - comprehensive measurements of hundreds of small molecules in the blood that reflect cell metabolism. The measurement provides a far more accurate picture of an individual's metabolic health and cardiovascular disease risk than traditional BMI. The study analyzed 1,408 participants.

A key finding of the study is a strong link between metBMI and the composition of bacteria in the gut, the gut microbiota. People with higher metBMI had a gut microbiota with reduced diversity and lower potential to break down dietary fiber into butyric acid, which has previously been linked to inflammation and increased disease risk.

The researchers suggest that metBMI could become a tool for identifying people with metabolically unhealthy obesity, even if they do not meet traditional BMI thresholds. Fredrik Bäckhed is a Professor at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg:

"The traditional BMI often misses people who have normal weight but high metabolic risk. metBMI can contribute to a fairer and more accurate assessment of disease risk and thus pave the way for more personalized prevention and treatment."

The study also highlights that genetic factors are less important for metBMI than lifestyle and environment, pointing to the possibility of influencing one's metabolic health through diet, physical activity and gut microbiota composition.

"The metabolites that heavily contribute to the metBMI prediction are in fact modulated or produced by the gut microbiota, making it something of a metabolic dial, says Bäckhed.

Veteran male athletes who have spent years training at high intensity may be at greater risk of serious heart problems while exercising, new University of Leeds research shows. 

Published today and funded by the British Heart Foundation, the study shows that male endurance athletes aged over 50 may be more likely to experience abnormal heart rhythms during training if they already have scarring in their heart. 

Nine in 10 sudden cardiac deaths during sport occur in older male athletes. 

The researchers' aim was to establish whether doing more exercise could cause a potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular tachycardia in this group of athletes. 

They found that the athletes who experienced these rhythms were not exercising more or at greater intensity – but three quarters of them had heart scarring. 

The team says this shows that exercise itself is not dangerous - but the findings suggest that the presence of scar tissue in the heart increases the risk of potentially dangerous heart problems during physical activity. 

Importantly, the researchers were only aware that these athletes had heart scarring because of their participation in the study – highlighting the importance of regular heart health checks for veteran male endurance athletes to ensure they are not at risk of complications while training. 

Scarring may be caused by heart attacks, disease, and exertion from lots of high intensity exercise over many years. 

Our study shows that exercise was only associated with a risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms in those who were already high risk due to heart scarring. 

Athletes who developed abnormal heart rhythms were not exercising more or harder than athletes without abnormal heart rhythms. This suggests that exercise itself is not the cause, but could act as a trigger for dangerous heart rhythms in those athletes already with an underlying heart issue. 

Exercise is safe and has immense benefits – but athletes in this group should have regular health checks to make sure they stay healthy." 

Dr. Wasim Javed, Lead Author, Research Fellow in the University of Leeds' School of Medicine and Specialist Registrar, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust

The paper is a follow up to the team's VENTOUX study, published earlier this year, which showed that older male endurance athletes who had spent decades training and competing were more likely than non-athletes to have scarring in their hearts. This scarring was closely linked to the abnormal heart rhythms detected by participants' implantable loop recorders, which are small devices inserted under the skin. 

The new trial aimed to investigate whether abnormal heart rhythms were affected by exercise, and when this occurred. 

The 106 participants were healthy male endurance athletes aged over 50, doing more than 10 hours' of running or cycling every week for at least the past 15 years. 

The researchers tracked participants' physical activity using wearable tech, such as smart watches and heart rate monitors, to log all their training activity. The researchers then compared the data from the trackers and the implantable loop recorders to exactly match participants' heart rhythms with their physical activity. 

Over the two years of the study, around one in four participants experienced ventricular tachycardia during or just after exercising. The majority experienced non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which is shorter and usually less dangerous - but may serve as a warning sign for longer, more dangerous events. 

However, three in four of the athletes who had these episodes had heart scarring. 

There were three longer and potentially more serious episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. These occurred during exercise, and all were in athletes with heart scarring. 

The researchers say their findings support the use of wearable tech for any athlete who wants to monitor their heart rate for unusual activity. Anyone noticing an over-elevated heart rate while feeling unwell should reduce their intensity or seek medical attention. 

Dr Javed said: "The three athletes who experienced dangerous heart rhythms had sudden spikes on their heart rate monitors, which confirmed to them that something wasn't right. Athletes can look out for this when training, along with any symptoms, and seek help or avoid pushing themselves if this happens." 

The team says theirs is the first study to use long-term wearable tech data with heart rhythm data. They say future studies on athletes and exercise should involve wearable tech, because it accurately records activity levels, whereas simply asking athletes about how much exercise they do is likely to give inaccurate results. They hope their study can pave the way for future research on different groups, such as women or younger athletes.

When a trio of Republican state lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would subject women who obtain abortions to decades in prison, some reproductive rights advocates feared South Carolina might pass the "most extreme" abortion ban in the United States.

Now, though, it seems unlikely to become state law. In November, a vote to advance the bill beyond a legislative subcommittee failed. Four out of six Republicans on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee subpanel refused to vote on the measure.

Republican state Sen. Jeff Zell said during a November subcommittee hearing that he wanted to help "move this pro-life football down the field and to save as many babies as we can." Still, he could not support the bill as written.

"What I am interested in is speaking on behalf of the South Carolinian," he said, "and they're not interested in this bill right now or this issue right now."

While that bill stalled, it signals that abortion will continue to loom large during 2026 legislative sessions. More than three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, measures related to abortion have already been prefiled in several states, including Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and Virginia.

Meanwhile, the South Carolina bill also exposed a rift among Republicans. Some GOP lawmakers are eager to appeal to their most conservative supporters by pursuing more restrictive abortion laws, despite the lack of support for such measures among most voters.

Until recently, the idea of charging women who obtain abortions with a crime was considered "politically toxic," said Steven Greene, a political science professor at North Carolina State University.

Yet at least 15 states introduced "abortion as homicide" bills during 2024-2025 legislative sessions, many of which included the death penalty as a potential sentence, according to Dana Sussman, senior vice president of Pregnancy Justice, an organization that tracks the criminalization of pregnancy outcomes.

Even though none of those bills was signed into law, Sussman called this "a hugely alarming trend."

"My fear is that one of these will end up passing," she said.

Less than a month after the bill stalled in South Carolina, another bill — which would create criminal penalties for "coercion to obtain an abortion" — was prefiled ahead of the Jan. 13 start of the state's legislative session.

"The issue is not going away. It's a moral issue," said state Sen. Richard Cash, who introduced the abortion bill that stalled in the subcommittee. "How far we can go, and what successes we can have, remain to be seen."

Florida law already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. But a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill in October proposing civil liability for the "wrongful death" of a fetus. If enacted, the measure will allow parents to sue for the death of an unborn child, making them eligible for compensation, including damages for mental pain and suffering.

The bill says neither the mother nor a medical provider giving "lawful" care could be sued. But anyone else deemed to have acted with "negligence," including someone who helps procure abortion-inducing pills or a doctor who performs an abortion after six weeks, could be sued by one of the parents.

In Missouri, a constitutional amendment to legalize abortion passed in 2024 with 51.6% of the vote. In 2026, state lawmakers are asking voters to repeal the amendment they just passed. A new proposed amendment would effectively reinstate the state's ban on most abortions, with new exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and medical emergencies.

"I think that's a middle-of-the-road, common sense proposal that most Missourians will agree with," said Ed Lewis, a Republican state representative who sponsored the legislation to put the measure on the ballot.

Lewis said the 2024 amendment went too far in allowing a legal basis to challenge all of Missouri's abortion restrictions, sometimes called "targeted regulation of abortion providers," or TRAP, laws. Even before Missouri's outright ban, the number of abortions recorded in the state had dropped from 5,772 in 2011 to 150 in 2021.

Meanwhile, Lewis backed another proposed constitutional amendment that will appear on the 2026 ballot. That measure would make it harder for Missourians to amend the state constitution, by requiring any amendment to receive a majority of votes in each congressional district.

One analysis suggested as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure under the proposal. Lewis dismissed the analysis as a "Democratic talking point."

Republican lawmakers aren't necessarily aiming to pass abortion laws that appeal to the broadest swath of voters in their states.

Polling conducted ahead of Missouri's vote in 2024 showed 52% of the state's likely voters supported the constitutional amendment to protect access to abortion, a narrow majority that was consistent with the final vote.

In Texas, state law offers no exceptions for abortion in cases of rape or incest, even though a 2025 survey found 83% of Texans believe the procedure should be legal under those conditions.

In South Carolina, a 2024 poll found only 31% of respondents supported the state's existing six-week abortion ban, which prohibits the procedure in most cases after fetal cardiac activity can be detected.

But Republicans hold supermajorities in the South Carolina General Assembly, and some continue to push for a near-total abortion ban even though such a law would probably be broadly unpopular. That's because district lines have been drawn in such a way that politicians are more likely to be ousted by a more conservative member of their own party in a primary than defeated by a Democrat in a general election, said Scott Huffmon, director of the Center for Public Opinion & Policy Research at Winthrop University.

The South Carolina legislature is "so gerrymandered that more than half of the seats in both chambers were uncontested in the last general election. Whoever wins the primary wins the seat," Huffmon said. "The best way to win the primary — or, better yet, prevent a primary challenge at all — is to run to the far right and embrace the policies of the most conservative people in the district."

That's what some proposals, including the "abortion as homicide" bills, reflect, said Greene, the North Carolina State professor. Lawmakers could vote for such a measure and suffer "very minimal, if any," political backlash, he said.

"Most of the politicians passing these laws are more concerned with making the base happy than with actually dramatically reducing the number of abortions that take place within their jurisdiction," Greene said.

Yet the number of abortions performed in South Carolina has dropped dramatically — by 63% from 2023 to 2024, when the state enacted the existing ban, according to data published by the state's Department of Public Health.

Kimya Forouzan, a policy adviser with the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion legislation throughout the country and advocates for reproductive rights, said South Carolina's attempt to pass "the most extreme bill that we have seen" is "part of a pattern."

"I think the push for anti-abortion legislation exists throughout the country," she said. "There are a lot of battles that are brewing."

By reconstructing the early spread of COVID-19 and pandemic influenza, researchers reveal why chance events, travel hubs, and delayed detection make stopping new pandemics far harder than expected, and what surveillance strategies might help next time.

Pandemic respiratory viruses rapidly reach most metropolitan areas through distinct transmission pathways; however, unpredictable viral dynamics often limit their timely detection and containment. In a new study posted on the medRxiv preprint server, researchers use high-resolution disease data to reconstruct the spatial spread of pandemic respiratory viruses across metropolitan areas throughout the United States.

Several viral outbreaks have occurred in recent years due to the emergence of novel respiratory pathogens, such as A/H1N1 (H1N1pdm) influenza and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which have significantly increased morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic disruption worldwide. Pandemic respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can rapidly adapt and spread, often crossing species barriers and geographic boundaries, thereby emphasizing the importance of early detection, surveillance, and coordinated public health responses.

Understanding how novel respiratory pathogens spread geographically is crucial for effective pandemic preparedness and response. Human mobility, including both long-distance air travel and short-range commuting, is critically involved in viral transmission rates; therefore, combining data on viral genetics and population movements could clarify global, national, and local trends.

In the United States, several factors influence the spread of both influenza and COVID-19. However, limited case reporting combined with the lack of detailed surveillance data makes it challenging to fully understand the early spread of these viruses at more granular geographic scales, particularly during the earliest stages of a pandemic when under-ascertainment is substantial.

Researchers combined city-level influenza-like illness (ILI) records from medical claims with estimates of daily SARS-CoV-2 infections at the county level. This included both reported and unreported cases to reconstruct the transmission pathways of H1N1pdm influenza and SARS-CoV-2 across U.S. metropolitan areas. 

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), as densely populated regions with strong social and economic connections, functioned as effective units for analyzing how respiratory pathogens spread. By mapping transmission networks among MSAs, spatial spread patterns of both viruses could be compared.

Although human mobility is directly implicated in the introduction of infections, the realized transmission network, which comprises the actual chain of who infected whom, represents only one of many ways an outbreak can develop. To quantify any uncertainty in early spatial dynamics, the current study proposed a process-based stochastic transmission model that incorporates inter-MSA air travel, commuting patterns, and pathogen superspreading potential.

A hypothetical novel respiratory virus originating in Minnesota was simulated for the current analysis to evaluate how stochastic transmission dynamics influence early spatial spread. For each MSA, the onset time of local transmission was estimated, and infection sources were identified based on the number of infections introduced from other MSAs.

Transmission links were based on identified infection sources and categorized by the dominant mobility mode. The simulated transmission network exhibited a hub-and-spoke structure, which is consistent with previous simulation studies.

To assess variability in transmission network structure, 100 simulations were performed, and transmission links were grouped by occurrence probability. The onset of the outbreak at the epidemic origin occurred after a median of three weeks, resulting in 670 infections.

Of 994 distinct transmission links, 56.9 % appeared in less than 20 % of simulations, indicating significant variation. In a single realization, 71.1 % of links were stable and present in over 80 % of simulations. Variability increased with lower transmissibility and greater superspreading potential.

A prediction-based inference framework for spatial infectious disease spread was validated using a simulated outbreak with known transmission networks. Due to model randomness, 100 independent inference realizations were performed to capture uncertainty.

The algorithm achieved 79.3 % precision and 78.2 % recall in identifying true transmission links for individual inference realizations. By aggregating results across inference runs and selecting transmission links based on their occurrence probability, overall inference performance improved substantially, with inference accuracy increasing as link occurrence frequency increased.

The inferred SARS-CoV-2 transmission network consisted of 304 links, featuring a hub-and-spoke pattern, with Seattle and New York identified as key sources of national spread through air travel. Nevertheless, regional areas like Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, and San Francisco facilitated local dissemination. Most inferred inter-metropolitan transmission events occurred between late February and mid-March 2020.

Network structure remained consistent across different thresholds, origins, and immunity durations. Pandemic influenza activity was measured by multiplying weekly local ILI incidence with A/H1N1pdm lab positivity rates to create the ILI+ metric. For pandemic influenza, early seeding locations were assumed to be San Diego, San Antonio, and New York, based on initial confirmed cases.

The reconstructed pandemic influenza network differed structurally from SARS-CoV-2 but shared a hub-and-spoke pattern. Most highly connected locations were considered major international travel centers. However, some MSAs with high international travel, like Miami and Los Angeles, were not major transmission sources, suggesting that international travel volume alone does not predict spatial spread. Compared with SARS-CoV-2, fewer high-confidence transmission links could be inferred for H1N1pdm influenza, likely due to the coarser temporal resolution and sparsity of available surveillance data.

Pandemic respiratory pathogens can rapidly establish widespread local transmission, often before detection or intervention is possible. Despite differences in transmission pathways, both pandemics analyzed in the current study occurred through common transmission areas and stochastic factors that complicated containment efforts.

Simulation results further suggest that early detection strategies, such as airport wastewater surveillance, may be most effective when deployed across a broad set of metropolitan hubs rather than a small number of major airports. Importantly, the benefits of expanded surveillance depend on pairing detection with interventions that meaningfully reduce onward transmission once infections are identified. Future studies are needed to refine simulation models that incorporate greater social and demographic details, as well as evaluate pragmatic surveillance and intervention strategies to enable the development of effective responses to future pandemics and mitigate their societal impact.

A new study shows that whether families can reliably meet basic needs, not just how much they earn, may shape infants' brain development as early as the first year of life.

Among infants living in high rates of adversity, researchers in a recent PNAS study identify specific psychosocial factors that strongly correlate with altered brain development within the first year of life.

Brain development during infancy is characterized by rapid growth, accelerated synapse formation, and neural circuit maturation. These changes contribute to neuroplasticity, which refers to the ability of the brain to form new neural connections, a physiological process that can also be affected by early life experiences.

Exposure to trauma during infancy has been associated with structural and functional alterations in the brain that persist into childhood to impact cognitive development and educational achievement. Domestic abuse, maternal stress, high levels of stress, severe forms of neglect, and poverty are some examples of early psychosocial adversities that have been found to negatively affect child development.

Despite strong evidence confirming the deleterious effects of poverty on normal development, there remains a lack of widely adopted, practical screening strategies that can isolate specific, modifiable risk factors during infancy. The complexity of different socioeconomic status (SES) measurements, combined with the various environmental factors that contribute to both neurological development and poverty, further increases the difficulty of identifying specific components that can be targeted by prevention and intervention strategies.

The researchers of the current study used electroencephalography (EEG) data from the Baby Steps study, an ongoing investigation interested in identifying psychosocial factors during infancy that predict the detection of autism or developmental delay at two years of age. The Baby Steps study cohort comprised infants of families experiencing high levels of economic hardship and stress who were attending regular well visits at a large urban primary care clinic.

Infant visits occurred at four, nine, and twelve months of age, during which resting-state EEG was obtained, along with parent-provided data on household SES, stress, and available resources. A total of 667 EEGs from 293 infants were included in the final analysis.

Exploratory graph analysis (EGA) examined correlations between multiple SES- and stress-related adversity factors and early brain activity trajectories during the first year of life. This statistical method detects conditional associations between variables while minimizing the influence of weak or indirect correlations across multiple factors.

The EGA analysis comprised a network structured around three dimensions including those related to socioeconomic status, stress, income adequacy, and recent life events, as well as EEG measurements such as periodic slope estimate and 4-month (4 m) aperiodic power. Network modeling was also used to identify specific socioeconomic and psychological risk factors implicated in altered infant brain development.

Approximately 72 % of households in the study cohort used public insurance, whereas about 58 % were below the federal 200 % poverty line. Moderate to high levels of stress were observed among many of the families in this study, with 24.1 % reporting “never” or “rarely” having enough money to meet their family's daily needs.

EGA findings confirmed the highly influential role of income sufficiency in the association between SES and stress. Income sufficiency was strongly implicated in both objective income level and educational attainment, as mothers who reported never having sufficient income were more likely to have lower educational attainment and greater exposure to stressful life events. Notably, a substantial proportion of families reporting “always” or “usually” having enough income still fell below the federal poverty threshold, highlighting income sufficiency as a distinct and clinically relevant measure.

Income insufficiency also correlated with altered EEG developmental trajectories, particularly slower rates of change in periodic total power and alpha-related measures across infancy, with differences in periodic spectra becoming evident by nine months of age. Slower maturation of EEG power may predict delayed cognitive maturation and behavioral disorders in childhood; however, this association must be investigated in future studies.

The study findings suggest that infants being raised in low-income households that are incapable of adequately supporting their family's needs are at greater risk of experiencing altered brain activity during their first year of life. These neurological alterations were characterized by lower total periodic power, as well as slower increases in alpha peak frequency and consistently lower beta periodic power, reflecting delayed maturation of neural activity.

To mitigate long-term developmental risk and improve outcomes in children facing socioeconomic adversity, various public health strategies have been proposed. For example, the Baby's First Years study has examined the potential benefits of providing monthly payments to mothers experiencing poverty during the first year of their child's life; however, additional research is needed to establish the magnitude and duration of financial support required to promote sustained healthy development.

Our network approach highlights the potential for a screening tool to identify vulnerable infants early and guide pathways for targeted interventions.

ATLANTA (Jan. 12, 2026) – On July 2 in the nation's capital, a relatively inexperienced U.S. Women's National Team dominated FIFA's No. 8-ranked Canada at a sold-out Allstate Continental Clásico. The USWNT's entertaining and dynamic performance to earn the 3-0 victory over Canada has been voted as the U.S. Soccer Game of the Year, presented by Michelob Ultra.

First half goals from defensive midfielder Sam Coffey, her third of the year and fourth all-time, and midfielder Claire Hutton, the first of her international career in just her sixth cap, led the Americans to their 54th all-time win over Canada in 67 matches. A late goal from Yazmeen Ryan in the 89th minute sealed the victory for the United States.

Both Avery Patterson and Tara Rudd recorded their second career assists, and Yazmeen Ryan's goal was her second in as many matches.

The high-energy match, played in front of more than 19,000 fans on Independence Day weekend, featured a raucous and patriotic environment, as well as a comprehensive performance on both sides of the ball against the USA's long-time regional rival.

Outshooting Canada 22-7, the U.S. maintained control through most of the match with goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, playing in just her second cap, stepping up to deny the the few Canadian opportunities. Dickey finished the night with three saves and her second straight clean sheet as a starter. Canada struggled to contain the United States all night as the young Americans showed flashes of creativity all over the field.

The USA played the match with a roster that did not include almost all of its European-based players, with defender and U.S. captain for the match, Naomia Girma, being the exception.

USA – SAM COFFEY (AVERY PATTERSON), 17th minute: Lavelle lofted a bending service into the penalty box on a direct free kick about 30 yards from goal on the left side. The ball took a bounce off a Canadien defender and then off Patterson. Coffey stepped to the free ball and from close range, delivered a low-driven strike with her right foot into the lower right side of the net for the opening goal. USA 1, CAN 0

USA – CLAIRE HUTTON (ROSE LAVELLE), 36th minute: The second goal of the night also arrived on a set piece. On a corner kick, Lavelle drove a left-footed kick into the box from the right side. Hutton's soared to put her header on frame from just inside the edge of the six-yard box. The ball took one bounce on its way into the left corner of the net. USA 2, CAN 0

USA – YAZMEEN RYAN (TARA McKEOWN), 89th minute: McKeown, playing in her club's home stadium, flew down the right wing on the dribble and then passed the ball off to Ryan in the center of the pitch. The forward had time to set up her shot then hit the ball with her left foot from the top of the 18-yard box. The low, firm strike bounced once and stuck into the right corner of the net. USA 3, CAN 0

Soccer fans around the globe have lodged their complaints about the high prices for tickets to 2026 World Cup matches in North America this summer.

However, in what may be a first, someone who will be playing in the tournament is also echoing their concerns.

USMNT winger Timothy Weah said he is “disappointed" in the pricing structure that places most all of the tickets beyond the price range of the average person.

"It is too expensive," Weah told French outlet Le Dauphiné. "Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show."

WORLD CUP TICKETS: How to buy them

In an effort to make some reasonably priced options available, FIFA is providing a selected number of tickets to national federations of the participating countries for them to distribute to loyal fans who have previously attended their nations' matches.

The "supporter entry tier" tickets − which cost $60 apiece − are extremely limited. Otherwise through FIFA's dynamic ticket pricing, the cheapest group stage games that did not involve host nations Canada, Mexico and the U.S. have ranged from $120 to $265, and from $4,185 to $8,680 for the July 19 championship match in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

"I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices," the Marseille winger added in the interview before Tuesday's French Cup match against Bayeux. "Lots of real fans will miss matches."

Currently on loan at Marseille from Juventus, Weah, 25, has scored seven goals and recorded five assists in 47 appearances for the U.S. men's national team. He is the son of 1995 Ballon d'Or winner and former president of Liberia, George Weah.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring soccer fans from around the world to the streets of Atlanta as eight matches are set for Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Officials for the tournament, which runs from June 11 to July 19, announced the group stage match-ups in December, allowing fans to purchase tickets knowing which teams are playing.

If you're still hoping for a chance to see your favorite team play in Atlanta, the random selection phase of ticketing is almost over. Here's your last chance to enter the draw.

The Random Selection Draw period, the third round of ticketing, opened Dec. 11 and will remain open until Jan. 13 at 11 a.m. ET.

When you enter the drawing during that time will not impact your chances of winning a chance to purchase tickets, officials said.

To enter the drawing, you can go to FIFA.com/tickets and create a FIFA account. You will then be asked to choose what team you root for, where you'd like to see a match and your contact information.

It's important to look at the ticket pricing before registering for the draw. If chosen, you will be automatically charged for the tickets you have been awarded.

"Fans will be able to select which match(es), respective ticket category(ies), and number of tickets per match they'd like to purchase, subject to household restrictions," FIFA officials said. "All successful and partially successful ticket applicants will receive communications via email and subsequently will be automatically charged for their tickets in February. A partially successful application indicates that a fan will receive the number of tickets requested to a match, but not all matches requested."

If you don't want to leave your World Cup dreams to chance, there are a few other options for purchasing tickets.

First, if you would only like to attend a game for a specific team, you may be eligible for a Participating Member Association. Each association has their own process of designating tickets, but members may be able to purchase tickets from a section of tickets pre-determined for supports of their team. Information about PMAs is available on the FIFA ticketing site.

Some fans can also purchase "premium, elevated matchday" ticket experiences through hospitality packages, found at FIFA.com/hospitality, or from On Location, the group curating the experiences for the World Cup.

Qatar Airways is also offering travel packages for out-of-town fans. The packages include match tickets in category 1 or 2, transport in the city and to and from the airport, hotel stays and domestic and international flights.

The FIFA Resale/Exchange Marketplace will be the last official outlet to buy match tickets. The marketplace will open on the FIFA ticketing site on Dec. 15.

Resale tickets may be available through other, unofficial outlets after that period.

Attendees at the Jan. 8 Leadership Perimeter Summit meeting were given an insider look at the upcoming FIFA World Cup matches in Atlanta and heard advice on how to effectively leverage the event for maximum results.

Atlanta takes the global stage as one of 16 North American host cities for the FIFA World Cup semifinals starting in June, with eight matches, including five group stage games, a Round of 32 match, a Round of 16 match, and one of the tournament's semifinals. 

A panel moderated by Discover Dunwoody Chief Marketing and Operating Officer Mark Galvin, included Dan Corso, the executive director of the Atlanta Sports Council, David Abes of Dash Hospitality, and Sherry Jackman, the executive director of Visit Decatur.  The trio, at a meeting held at Dunwoody Baptist Church,  shared global and local insights into how businesses can leverage the notoriety around the World Cup festivities into local revenue.

Corso said Atlanta is one of only two cities in the United States, along with Los Angeles, to have hosted both FIFA World Cup matches as well as the Olympics.

FIFA officials came to Atlanta in 1994 on a similar mission, but at the time, there were no grass stadiums with enough seating to accommodate the competition, Corso said. And although Atlanta scored some matches for the 2026 event, it did not qualify as a venue for the finals because Mercedes-Benz Stadium doesn't meet the mandated 80,000-seat capacity. 

“Eight matches were more than we expected,” Corso said. “But we just weren't quite there [to reach the 80,000-seat mandate].”

Mercedes-Benz can hold 71,000 for NFL games, and more than 75,000 for large events, like soccer matches and concerts. 

Corso estimated the economic impact of hosting the FIFA matches could exceed $500 million across the region, and possibly more, as the event runs for multiple days, rather than a single-day event like the NFL Super Bowl.

Jackman said Visit Decatur has been focusing on how to promote area events without infringing on the stringent ban that FIFA places on using its name or logo.

“We are very conscious not to infringe on the FIFA rules, while scheduling events every day in Decatur,” she said. “We see this not as a money-maker, but an investment in our future.  We want people to know that there's a lot to do, not only in Atlanta, but in Georgia.”

Decatur will kick off its 34-day celebration with a concert by Big Boi of OutKast fame, and conclude with a concert by Decatur-based Indigo Girls. All the events will be ticketed, but free to the public, she said. 

Abes said he believes that his Funwoody complex of restaurants, all of which face a large courtyard equipped with a large-screen television, already has the elements in place to attract FIFA fans. 

“I'm very excited about the games that will be out of town, because we can capitalize on what we already have – a place that's energetic and fun,” he said. “We just have to be focused on consistency and the product that we already have out there.”

Abes said the restaurants in the Funwoody complex, which includes Barn{n}, Morty's Meat Supply, Message in a Bottle, and the recently added Good Vibes Ice Cream Shop, will tweak their menus to include food and beverages familiar to the competing country team fans. 

Corso said FIFA has extremely strict rules about the use of its logo and associated images. For example, during the World Cup, Mercedes-Benz stadium will be known only as Atlanta Stadium, and its logo will be covered completely. 

“They are very protective of their partners,” Corso said. “For example, we developed a poster using all the guidelines, but it was rejected because we had a tiny plane in the background, and it was not the colors of Qatar Airways, which is their partner.”

Restaurants and bars having watch parties are forbidden from using FIFA's name, likeness and image. 

“It's important for everyone to find a way to enjoy the games and promote their businesses, but respect the rules,” Corso said. 

In other business, the group awarded three graduates with the Carolyn Axt Alumni Award – Sherwin Nelson Clemons ('14), Dr. Melody Kelley ('22), and Dr. Michael Stewart ('17). 

Clemons, a small business owner, serves on the Sandy Springs Planning Commission and the Sandy Springs Foundation. Kelley, an educator, is the District 2 representative on the Sandy Springs City Council. Stewart, an orthodontist, serves on the Sandy Springs Board of Trustees.

Xabi Alonso has left Real Madrid by mutual consent following their 3-2 defeat by Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final.

The club confirmed the decision on Monday evening.

A statement read: “Real Madrid CF announces that, by mutual agreement between the club and Xabi Alonso, it has been decided to end his time as first team coach.

“Xabi Alonso will always have the affection and admiration of all Madrid fans because he is a Real Madrid legend and has always represented the values ​​of our club. Real Madrid will always be his home.

“Our club thanks Xabi Alonso and his entire technical team for their work and dedication during this time, and wishes them the best of luck in this new stage of their lives.”

Former Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa, who played with Alonso at both Liverpool and Madrid, takes over the reins, the club has confirmed.

Arbeloa is currently the manager of Real's ‘Castilla' youth side, but has been immediately promoted to replace his ex-team-mate.

Real face Albacete in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday before hosting Levante in the league at the weekend.

Another statement released on Monday read: “Real Madrid CF announces that Alvaro Arbeloa is the new first-team coach.

“Alvaro Arbeloa has been the manager of Castilla since June 2025, and has spent his entire coaching career in Real Madrid's youth academy since 2020. He managed the Infantil A team in the 2020-2021 season, winning the league title, the Cadete A team in 2021-2022, and the Juvenil A team from 2022 to 2025. As Juvenil A manager, he achieved the treble in 2022-2023 (League, Copa del Rey, and Champions Cup) and the league title in the 2024-2025 season.

“As a player, Arbeloa was part of Real Madrid during one of the most successful periods in its history. He wore our shirt between 2009 and 2016, making 238 official appearances. During that time, he won eight titles: two Champions Leagues, one Club World Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one La Liga title, two Copa del Rey trophies, and one Spanish Super Cup.

“With the Spanish national team, Álvaro Arbeloa was also part of a historic era, winning the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and two European Championships (2008 and 2012). He earned 56 caps for Spain.”

Los Blancos were beaten by their rivals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in dramatic circumstances on Sunday night, with three goals scored in first-half stoppage time.

Raphinha opened the scoring on 36 minutes, before Vinicius Junior equalised two minutes into injury time.

Robert Lewandowski re-established Barca's lead, before Gonzalo Garcia cancelled that out in the 51st minute.

It was Raphinha who netted the winning goal - the only strike of the second half - in what would be the final goal that Madrid would concede under Alonso.

The Spaniard arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu ahead of the Club World Cup to great fanfare after his stellar work at Bayer Leverkusen, where he won Die Werkself's maiden Bundesliga title back in 2023, going the whole season unbeaten.

Bayern Munich wrestled the crown back off them the following campaign before Alonso moved to the Spanish capital.

Real were thrashed 4-0 in the semi-finals by Paris Saint-Germain at the Club World Cup, and find themselves four points adrift of Barca at the top of La Liga.

Tensions have been bubbling at the Bernabeu all season, with many reporting that Alonso had a strained relationship with many key players.

World Cup

FIFA's pricing for this summer's tournament has been criticized by fans, particularly in Europe Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images

Olympique de Marseille and USMNT winger Timothy Weah has said he is “disappointed” at the steep prices already seen for this summer's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, describing the tournament as out of reach for regular soccer fans.

The final window for the men's World Cup ticketing draw nears its close this week, and FIFA's pricing for the competition has been largely criticized by soccer fans, particularly in Europe.

“It is too expensive,” Weah, 25, told French outlet Le Dauphiné. “Football should still be enjoyed by everyone. It is the most popular sport. This World Cup will be good, but it will be more of a show.

“I am just a bit disappointed by the ticket prices. Lots of real fans will miss matches.”

Weah, son of 1995 Ballon d'Or winner and former Liberia president George Weah, spoke with the French outlet ahead of Tuesday's French Cup. The 25-year-old joined the club on loan from Juventus in August. For the U.S., Weah has scored 7 goals and recorded 5 assists for the USMNT across 47 appearances.

The Rosedale, New York, native was still at Juventus for last summer's FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S., seen largely as a test run for the 2026 men's World Cup. Weah was there for the team's bizarre press conference inside the White House with President Donald Trump, later telling reporters, “I just want to play football, man.”

The New York metro area will host eight World Cup matches next year, including the final, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. A lower-level ticket for the championship match was priced at $8,860 in December, nearly $2,000 more than its original price in October.

The 2026 World Cup is on track to be one of the most expensive editions of the FIFA competition to date. Ticket prices rose after the World Cup draw last month. Prices for hotel rooms also jumped by more than 300 per cent.

The astronomical costs received swift backlash, with Football Supporters Europe in December calling ticket prices a “monumental betrayal of the tradition of the World Cup.”

FIFA responded to the mounting backlash by adjusting its pricing categories to offer about 1,000 tickets per game for $60 for supporters of the two participating teams. For supporters of USMNT, those scarce tickets will be allocated to three independent supporters' groups, including the American Outlaws. FIFA has consistently said the revenue from the World Cup helps support soccer in many nations around the world.

Roberto De Zerbi says he will leave Marseille the day that sporting director Medhi Benatia does, after the former defender cast doubt on his future at the club.

Marseille suffered a heartbreaking penalty shoot-out loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Trophee des Champions on Thursday, having led 2-1 heading into the 95th minute.

Following that match in Kuwait, Benatia spoke to reporters in the mixed zone, saying: "You'll soon see that there will be others in our place, and we'll have to give them time to work because in Marseille, you never have time."

As such, there has been speculation that his time at Marseille could be nearing an end, having previously made similar hints last year.

Benatia's contract at Marseille runs to 2027, which is also when De Zerbi's deal is up, and the Italian says he cannot see a scenario where he stays beyond the Moroccan's tenure.

Asked about Benatia's comments ahead of Marseille's Coupe de France round-of-32 tie against Bayeux, De Zerbi said: "Benatia loves Marseille, perhaps even more than I do, since he was born and raised here.

"He's the one who brought me here. I'm a loyal and honest person. The day Benatia leaves, I'll leave too.

"I don't think he was referring to whether he was going to leave or not; that's something you'd have to ask him personally.

"I got here thanks to Medhi and Pablo [Longoria, Marseille president]. If one of those two is no longer here, given that they're the ones who brought me here… The day Benatia leaves, I'll leave too.

"Not because I can't work without him, because I've already done it. But to be fair, I don't think he was referring to leaving at the end of this season; he didn't mention it to me. But you'd have to ask him directly."

Injuries are always a fact of life for Americans Abroad, but players' health becomes increasingly important as a World Cup approaches.

This week saw differing fortunes for a handful of players, with one major injury taking place and two other players coming back after spells on the sideline.

This week's Five leads off with one particularly encouraging return after almost two years of injury hell.

It has been an extremely rough 18 months for Kevin Paredes, but the Wolfsburg winger is finally back on the pitch.

Paredes made his first appearance of the season on Sunday, Jan. 11, coming on in the 77th minute as Wolfsburg was demolished 8-1 at the hands of Bayern Munich.

The Virginia native looked like a big part of the USMNT's future during the 2023-24 campaign, as he made 28 Bundesliga appearances and scored three goals while still just 20 years old.

But Sunday's game was just the third for Paredes since that season, as a foot injury limited him to only two appearances last season. After a setback in preseason, Paredes underwent surgery on the same troublesome foot in August.

Still only 22, time is on the winger's side as he attempts to get his career back on track.

January has not been kind to Ricardo Pepi lately.

Last year, Pepi's sensational season was ended by a severe knee injury in January. Twelve months later, the PSV striker once again suffered a serious injury that will keep him sidelined for a while.

This one was particularly gruesome, if not as damaging as last year's. Pepi broke his forearm after scoring against Excelsior, a diagnosis that anyone with functioning eyes could have confirmed after seeing the state of his arm.

Pepi is set to miss two months, which is a major blow for PSV. The Texan has scored in five consecutive games and is the team's only out-and-out striker.

When it comes to the U.S. men's national team, Pepi seems to have dodged a bullet. With the U.S. not in action until late March, Pepi may not even miss a game if his recovery goes according to plan.

The most important thing for Chris Richards is that he's back on the field. But he wouldn't have wanted to return like this.

Crystal Palace was on the wrong end of the biggest shock in FA Cup history – by league position anyhow – on Saturday, Jan. 10. Sixth-tier Macclesfield stunned Palace 2-1, knocking out the defending champion in the third round.

Richards played fairly well, but it wasn't enough to prevent the Eagles from losing to a team 117 places above them in the English pyramid.

Still, when Richards went off on a stretcher against Arsenal on Dec. 23, missing just four games seemed almost impossible to fathom. But that ended up being the absence for a player who will be crucial as Palace looks to right the ship in the weeks ahead.

Joe Scally scored his first goal of the season on Sunday as Borussia Mönchengladbach hammered Augsburg 4-0 to kick off the second half of the season.

The defender turned in an excellent all-around display, earning a place on Kicker's team of the week.

Scally continues to be a fixture for Gladbach, which is up to 10th in the table after recovering from an awful 0W-3D-5L start.

Meanwhile, Gio Reyna only managed a five-minute cameo off the bench after he started three consecutive games prior to the Bundesliga's winter break. According to ESPN Bundesliga commentator Derek Rae, Reyna looks to have a real fight on his hands for minutes.

Josh Sargent may not be an American Abroad for much longer.

Amid reports of a bid from Toronto FC, the Norwich forward appears to be going on strike.

Sargent wasn't in the squad for Norwich 5-1 FA Cup victory over Walsall on Sunday. According to Canaries coach Philippe Clement, that was at the striker's request.

"Josh sent me a message (Saturday) evening saying he would not be available because of transfer things in his head," Clement said.

But the coach made it clear that his side wouldn't be pushed around so easily.

"This is obviously not something we want and will have consequences. It is something we need to speak about inside the club, but the club has made it really clear to Josh and his agent that he will not be leaving during this transfer window."

For a player already slipping out of the World Cup picture, a prolonged stand-off is the last thing he needs right now.

Is Giovanni Reyna, who grew up in Westchester County, in roster contention for the U.S. men's soccer team at this summer's World Cup?

Reyna's role has emerged among key U.S. squad questions for the cup the United States, Mexico and Canada will host June 11 to July 19.

Sports writers and commentators have been discussing what he could bring to the team. The Athletic reported in November 2025 that Reyna proved pivotal in the U.S.' 2-1 defeat of Paraguay in a friendly — soccer parlance for exhibition — match that month, scoring a goal and creating the second. Then, in December, the Athletic, in looking at the squad's roster battles, put it this way: “The question about the two attacking midfield roles has to begin with Gio Reyna's health, form and availability.”

A U.S. men's soccer team spokesperson could not be immediately reached for a response to questions from the Journal News/lohud.com.

Teams must submit provisional World Cup squads of 35 to 55 players by May 11, then a final list by June 1 to FIFA, world soccer's governing body.

Reyna, who grew up in the northern Westchester County town, plays pro soccer for Borussia Monchengladbach, which is competing in the top level of Germany's Bundesliga. A number of U.S. players are in Europe's best pro leagues, trying to lock up more playing time and perform well to capture U.S. team head coach Mauricio Pochettino's attention ahead of the cup, which will pit 48 national teams against each other. Perhaps the biggest national-team shoo-in at this point is Christian Pulisic, who plays for storied A.C. Milian in Italy's Serie A and is that league's second highest goal scorer this season so far.

“Borussia are a fantastic, big club," Reyna said of Monchengladbach in an August 2025 release announcing his move to the team from another German pro team, Borussia Dortmund. "I'm delighted that the transfer has been able to be completed and am looking forward to getting to know everyone here, as well as tackling the upcoming games together.”

Alexi Lalas, a 1994 World Cup U.S. team player who is now a soccer broadcast commentator and podcaster, said in a mid-December “State of the Union” podcast that “this is rarefied air for Gio Reyna," after Reyna had started three consecutive matches at that point for Borussia Monchengladbach.

“I couldn't be happier because this is, when we judge Gio Reyna, this is how we want to judge him and the context that we want to judge him in,” Lalas said on the podcast, adding: “Just starting, playing, hopefully playing well."

There was no prediction as to whether Reyna may be in the cup squad. But Lalas said in the podcast at the time that Reyna, if he continues like this, "will have done everything in his power to make a case for himself" and "he is doing everything that I think we want him to do."

After starting his fourth consecutive match for Monchengladbach, Reyna said in an interview shown on ESPN online that it "felt pretty good tonight, but just have to keep going now and working."

DENVER — United States Women's National Team captain and Colorado native Lindsey Heaps is coming home.

The accomplished midfielder will officially join Denver's new soccer team in June after completing her 2025-26 season with OL Lyonnes, the team announced Monday.

Heaps, 31, is signed with Denver Summit FC through the 2029 NWSL season.

“I'm incredibly excited to come home to Colorado and join Denver Summit FC,” Heaps said. “This club represents something special, not just for the league, but for this community and for the next generation of players growing up here. I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with OL Lyonnes, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.”

Heaps was born and raised in Golden, Colorado. She returns to her home state after a decorated professional career that has spanned the NWSL, UEFA Women's Champions League, and international football's biggest stages.

“Signing Lindsey Heaps is a defining moment for Denver Summit FC,” said Denver Summit FC General Manager Curt Johnson. “She represents the very highest level of excellence as a player, a leader, and a professional. To welcome her back home to Colorado and to have her help shape the identity of this club is incredibly meaningful.”

Heaps has made 170 appearances for the U.S. on the international stage, winning the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup, 2024 Olympic Gold, 2020 Olympic Bronze, and multiple CONCACAF titles. 

Heaps previously played with Portland Thorns FC, winning the 2017 NWSL Championship, NWSL Shield (2016, 2021), and NWSL Challenge Cup (2021), earning NWSL MVP honors in 2018. 

Denver Summit FC will play its inaugural home match of the 2026 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) season at Empower Field at Mile High on Saturday, March 28 at noon.

For the first time in 2026, it was a packed week for American players in Europe, as leagues in Germany, the Netherlands and other nations resumed following a lengthy winter break. Now, all eyes are on the sprint to the end of the season and the 2026 World Cup. 

Across the board, it was a mixed weekend for U.S. men's national team players as well. Chris Richards played a full 90 minutes for the first time since sustaining an injury in December, but it came in Crystal Palace's historic FA Cup loss to sixth-tier side Macclesfield FC. Meanwhile, Ricardo Pepi scored his 13th goal of the season, but sustained a fractured forearm, which will sideline him for two months. 

To say it was a memorable weekend would be an understatement, on both the positive and negative sides. Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top four performances of the week from Mauricio Pochettino's players across the globe.

𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢 𝐩𝐚𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞, Folarin Balogun a ouvert le score à la 𝟐𝟕' 🎯1️⃣-3️⃣ #USOASM pic.twitter.com/ktMkla4T12

The USMNT striker battle had quite the weekend, with Josh Sargent rumored to be moving to MLS with Toronto FC and Pepi picking up an injury that will keep him out of consideration for the March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal. Yet, Folarin Balogun continued to stand out. Already the frontrunner to start for Pochettino's side at the 2026 World Cup, Balogun netted his first goal of 2026 in a 3–1 French Cup win over third-tier side, US Orléans for his eighth goal across all competitions this season. It also marked his second goal contribution of 2026, after picking up an assist against Lyon on Jan. 3. The 27-year-old and Monaco are back in action on Friday against Lorient in Ligue 1, before looking towards their next Champions League match against Real Madrid on Jan. 20, with Balogun hoping for more individual success in those matches. “I'm still looking to be a lot more decisive in those games,” he told FIFA about his Champions League hopes. “I know I have the opportunity to make a bigger impact in those types of games ... I'm able to contribute with important goals that are helping us win games and help us potentially progress to the next round. I'm definitely content, but I definitely want to strive for more.”

If there was any team in the world that needed a big win this weekend, it was Celtic FC, after dismissing former MLS Coach of the Year Wilfried Nancy following a dismal eight-game spell. Luckily for the Scottish giants, they got just that with a 4–0 win over Dundee United, which included a standout performance at center back from American defender Auston Trusty. Trusty played the full 90 minutes and formed a strong partnership with fellow central defender Liam Scales, with the two combining for 12 defensive contributions and Trusty making 12 passes into the final third. The defender's efforts helped his side record its first clean sheet in its last nine matches. Plus, the win puts Celtic third in the table with 12 games remaining before the top six split off into the Championship Group after 33 matches.

The Bundesliga's return for the 2026 portion of the season saw Joe Scally hit the pitch for the first time in the new year. The USMNT right back impressed with the opening goal in a 4–0 win over Augsburg.The win snapped a three-match losing skid for Borussia Mönchengladbach and Scally was central to the victory. His goal came after a smart diagonal run into the box and he did well to take a second effort after his initial shooting attempt from an awkward angle ricocheted off a defender. Outside of the goal, he had two other shots and created an additional two chances, while making three recoveries in a dominant effort from his side. The win lofted his team to 10th in the Bundesliga table as well, ahead of its next match on Wednesday against Cole Campbell's TSG Hoffenheim. 

Brenden Aaronson's weekend wasn't too eventful, but his midweek action showcased his continued stellar form. The American bagged a brace in Leeds United's 4–3 loss to Newcastle United, bringing his tally to three goals in as many games; he found the back of the net in last weekend's draw with Manchester United as well. The 25-year-old played all 90 minutes to score his midweek brace to bring him to four goals and three assists in 20 Premier League appearances this season. At the weekend, Aaronson only logged a single minute off the bench in Leeds United's 3–1 win over Patrick Agyemang's Derby County in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite his brief cameo appearance, Aaronson's USMNT stock still rose in importance, with Pepi sustaining a concerning injury in the Netherlands. While Pepi is likely to return for the World Cup, Aaronson's form gives the USMNT hope that he can fill that void in offensive production, given his versatile attacking role in manager Daniel Farke's side.

Scally (left) and Pepi, with his injured arm Getty Images

There was agony for Ricardo Pepi, FA Cup embarrassment for a fit-again Chris Richards and a reassuring goal for Folarin Balogun as European clubs' USMNT stars were in action over the weekend.

It was so bad, even Ricardo Pepi's veteran coach admits he had to look away.

The USMNT striker's terrible luck with injury continued at the weekend with a setback that will see him sidelined once more.

This time, the in-form striker got hurt doing what he does best — scoring.

Pepi's poacher's instinct saw him net the second goal as PSV beat visitors Excelsior 5-1 in the top division of the Dutch league on Saturday, but after he lost his footing, the 23-year-old fell, breaking his left arm in a sickening manner.

“It didn't look good right away, and at such a moment you would prefer to look the other way,” said PSV head coach Peter Bosz to the club's website afterwards. “Last January, Ricardo was already out due to his knee injury. It won't last that long now, but unfortunately, we lost him again.

“All signs were green for a strong second half of the season, so this is incredibly disappointing. First and foremost for him, and obviously for us as well.”

Immediate inspection by medics revealed Pepi had badly fractured his forearm. It was painful, and terrible timing for him and his club; coming in his much-anticipated season as PSV's first-choice centre-forward after so long playing a supporting role to former captain Luuk de Jong.

As Bosz says, Pepi has continued his impressive scoring knack — he has 11 goals across the Eredivisie and Champions League this season. There had also been strong speculation, not for the first time, that Premier League clubs were interested in signing the Texan during this winter transfer window. Fulham had been most strongly linked.

His likely two-month absence while that arm heals will end that for now, and could mean he misses the USMNT's pre-World Cup friendlies against Belgium and Portugal in the international break at the end of March.

Given national-team head coach Mauricio Pochettino is not exactly overburdened with goalscoring centre-forwards among his options, it is a blow for him too. But as Bosz says, Pepi has had longer and more exacting setbacks before, most notably last term's knee injury, and has shown resilience and a knack for quickly getting back into the groove when he returns from them.

If Pepi's injury is a headache for club and country, at least Folarin Balogun is cruising along nicely.

The USMNT striker has had his own injury travails at Monaco of France's top-flight Ligue 1, especially last season, but he took his goal tally for them during this one to eight in all competitions at the weekend.

It may have only been in a routine 3-1 away win against third-tier Orleans in the French Cup's round of 32 but Balogun's confidently-struck goal keeps him ticking over after an assist in his most recent league game, a 3-1 loss to Lyon.

It was an even more upbeat weekend for USMNT defender Joe Scally.

The 23-year-old has struggled for games under Pochettino, although he returned to the starting line-up for November's 2-1 win against Paraguay. Now he is working at making his form in the German Bundesliga hard for his national-team coach to overlook.

Scally has been a virtual ever-present for Borussia Monchengladbach this season, and on Sunday he scored the opening goal as they beat visitors Augsburg 4-0.



He showed his flexibility at right wing-back, where he put in a lively attacking display, forcing Finn Dahmen into a string of saves.

Scally has previous for his ability to hit the back of the net — one need only remember his 2023 screamer in a game against Mainz. And he will need more performances like the one on Sunday to ensure himself a spot on the United States' roster for the tournament this summer.

Staying at Borussia Park, Scally's compatriot and club team-mate Gio Reyna did not start the Augsburg game after a previously encouraging spell back in the Gladbach first XI. He did make it onto the field for the final five minutes, though.

The good news was that Chris Richards was back. The bad was that it had to be in this game.

Crystal Palace made the headlines for all the wrong reasons on Saturday when, as the FA Cup holders, they fell victim to an all-time upset in their first match in that competition since lifting the trophy at Wembley in May.

On their artificial pitch, Macclesfield of English football's sixth tier beat their Premier League visitors 2-1 — a fairytale result for manager John Rooney (younger brother of former Manchester United and England striker Wayne, and once a midfielder for New York Red Bulls) and his players.

Richards has missed Palace's previous four fixtures after picking up a nasty foot injury against Leeds in the Premier League just before Christmas. But he was back and surprisingly busy on Saturday, making 14 clearances (more than any other defender who started the match).

In the end, the only positive was that the 25-year-old played the full game and did not seem in any discomfort.

(All kick-offs in Eastern Time)

Christian Pulisic didn't manage to stamp his usual influence on Milan's 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Sunday, which saw them drop points in the Serie A title race. By his high standards, he should have done better with at least one of the handful of chances he got at Stadio Artemio Franchi. But Pulisic is not the type of player to drop his level for long, so tune in to see if he can get back on track when Milan make the short trip to Como on Thursday (2:45pm, Paramount+).

In the Bundesliga, there could be an intriguing encounter for USMNT fans. If Gio Reyna can win back his starting place for Gladbach on Wednesday, he could go up against Hoffenheim's new loan signing from Borussia Dortmund, the promising 19-year-old Cole Campbell (2:30pm, ESPN+). Another potential match-up that afternoon could be James Sands and St Pauli against Wolfsburg, for whom another young prospect, Kevin Paredes, made his first appearance of the season on Sunday following a foot injury (12:30pm, ESPN+).

Then, at the weekend, there's another big U.S. match-up in the Premier League as the resurgent Brenden Aaronson will hope to shine again for Leeds at home against Antonee Robinson's Fulham (Saturday, 10am, Peacock Premium).

            The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said it would invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to secure the World Cup and events marking 250 years of American independence.
    


            The money will be overseen by a new DHS office focused on quickly buying and deploying drone and counter-drone technologies.
    


            It's a big bet on high-tech tools for a department under pressure to secure those high-profile events but also aiming to meet President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown demands. The news also comes as a response to the increasing technological sophistication of drug cartels, which have used their own drones and cyberattacks to help ship narcotics and surveil US officials.
    


            “Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.
    


            The announcement comes as drug cartels are increasing their technological sophistication, having used their own drones and cyberattacks to help ship narcotics and surveil US officials.
    


            Cheap and available online, drones have been a major security concern for public safety officials for years. A Baltimore man pleaded guilty last year after flying a drone over M&T Bank Stadium in the city during the 2025 NFL playoff game between the Ravens and Steelers. Separately, a series of drone sightings in New Jersey in 2024 raised public alarm and prompted calls from lawmakers for the executive branch to get a grip on the problem.
    


            The US co-hosting one of the biggest sporting events on the planet, the FIFA World Cup, this summer has intensified pressure on federal officials to do more to prevent drones from disrupting proceedings. Eleven US cities will host matches. Over a million international visitors are projected to come to the US for the tournament.
    


            The Federal Emergency Management Agency, a part of DHS, last month gave $250 million to 11 states hosting World Cup matches to buy counter-drone technology.
    


            The drug cartels that the Trump administration have declared terrorist groups have embraced drones for smuggling and surveillance. The possibility of equipping drones with lethal weaponry also has experts concerned.
    


            In the fight against the cartels, surveillance failures can cost lives.
    


            A Mexican drug cartel hired a hacker to surveil the movements of a senior FBI official in Mexico City in 2018 or earlier, gathering information from the city's camera system that allowed the cartel to kill potential FBI informants, the Justice Department inspector general said in a report last year.

...

After losing several U.S. stars overseas in recent years, the National Women's Soccer League welcomed one back Monday.

Lindsey Heaps, the national team captain, is returning stateside after four years in France, signing a four-year contract with the expansion Denver Summit. Terms were not disclosed.

The Colorado native will join her new team after completing her tenure with OL Lyonnes in May.

“This club represents something special, not just for the league, but for this community and for the next generation of players growing up here,” Heaps said. “I'm fully committed to finishing the season strong with Lyon, and I can't wait to begin this next chapter in Denver this summer.”

Heaps, who will turn 32 in May, has spent her entire career in France and the NWSL, signing with Paris Saint-Germain out of high school, then moving to the Portland Thorns and Lyonnes. She won the NWSL championship in 2017 and was the league MVP the following season.

Her return comes as the NWSL is attempting to retain U.S. standout Trinity Rodman, a highly sought free-agent forward from the Washington Spirit. This winter, the league loosened its salary-cap guidelines to allow teams greater flexibility to sign high-end players. It was not initially clear whether Heaps' contract falls under the new rule.

Another factor in the move was the distance from her husband of one year, Tyler, the sporting director and general manager of San Diego FC in Major League Soccer.

Heaps' return would buck a trend of U.S. players heading abroad, a group that includes Chelsea's Naomi Girma, Catarina Macario and Alyssa Thompson; Arsenal's Emily Fox, Aston Villa's Jenna Nighswonger; PSG's Crystal Dunn; and Lyonnes' Lily Yohannes and Korbin Shrader.

Also, Portland reportedly is in the process of selling U.S. midfielder Sam Coffey to Manchester City.

Heaps — from Golden, Colorado, 15 miles west of Denver — will become the centerpiece of Summit, which will accompany Boston Legacy as newcomers in the 13-year-old league. Their additions increases the number of teams to 16.

“She represents the very highest level of excellence as a player, a leader and a professional,” Summit general manager Curt Johnson said. “To welcome her back home to Colorado and to have her help shape the identity of this club is incredibly meaningful.”

Heaps has been with the national team since 2013, totaling 170 appearances and 38 goals. She is a World Cup and Olympic champion, in 2019 and 2024, respectively.

At Lyonnes, Heaps has scored 31 goals and been part of four league championships, plus the 2021-22 UEFA Women's Champions League trophy. This season, the club has won all 11 league matches by a 49-5 scoring margin and is 5-0-1 in the Champions League.

“Lindsey will bring a world-class level to our team and represents the ambition of this club on-and-off the field,” Summit Coach Nick Cushing said.

Summit investors include Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin and Pro Football Hall of Famer Peyton Manning.

The team plans to build a 14,500-seat stadium near downtown Denver in time for the 2028 season. Until then, it will make its home debut March 28 at Empower Field at Mile High (the NFL stadium) before settling into a temporary venue in Centennial, a suburb south of Denver.

adidas delivers fresh Scotland looks ahead of a long-awaited World Cup return.

Scotland's build-up to the FIFA World Cup 2026 is about more than goals and qualifiers - the Tartan Army now has fresh kits to rally behind as their nation prepares for a return to the global stage after 28 years. adidas has officially unveiled Scotland's new home shirt, and fans are buzzing with interest as the team books its place in the USA, Canada and Mexico showpiece.

From Saltire-inspired home colours to bold away kit leaks, Scotland's World Cup apparel mix tradition with a modern edge. With demand for the strip spiking dramatically since qualification, here's your complete breakdown of the Scotland home and away kits, their release timelines and what they'll cost you.

Scotland's 2026 World Cup home kit has officially landed. adidas and the Scottish FA unveiled the new dark navy design on 5 November 2025, with shirts hitting shelves and online stores on 6 November 2025.

The home jersey leans into national pride, with a deep blue base featuring embossed Saltire motifs, a bold nod to Scotland's famed flag, and a centralised crest that gives it a slightly retro edge. adidas has also thickened the famed Three Stripes on the shoulders, making this iteration feel fresh while staying rooted in tradition.

Already, search demand for Scotland's kit has soared following the team's qualification, with retailers reporting massive spikes in interest and enquiries for home tops and replicas.

Replica versions of the home shirt tend to sit around £75 in key markets, with youth and kids' sizes available for lower prices through official outlets, and options to add custom lettering at checkout.

While the home strip is live and selling fast, Scotland's 2026 World Cup away kit hasn't been officially released yet, but plenty of leaks have emerged to give fans a good look at what's coming. According to reports, the away shirt is expected to launch around March 2026, in line with adidas' typical World Cup rollout.

Early images circulating online show a striking ‘Trace Scarlet' (light coral) base colour paired with navy detailing and thin navy pinstripes, a fresh departure from the usual away palettes. The retro-inspired vibe, likened to Scotland's 1999 Umbro kit but through an adidas lens, has already sparked lively debate among supporters.

As with other teams' away releases, pricing is expected to mirror the home shirt's structure once official figures are confirmed, with retail tags likely set according to region and retailer. Keep an eye out in Spring 2026 for the full drop and pre-order options.

Manchester United's turbulent season has taken yet another dramatic twist with the sacking of Ruben Amorim, a decision that has inadvertently handed a massive lifeline to Kobbie Mainoo just as the midfielder appeared destined for a January exit. As the dust settles on Amorim's departure, club legend Dwight Yorke has issued a stark warning to the young midfielder, urging him to reject any potential loan moves and prove his worth at Old Trafford.

The past few months have arguably been the most testing of Mainoo's fledgling career to date. Having burst onto the scene as a promising talent under Erik ten Hag and starring for England at Euro 2024, the 20-year-old found himself surprisingly frozen out of the starting XI following Amorim's arrival. The Portuguese tactician's rigid adherence to a 3-4-2-1 system left Mainoo marginalised, with reports surfacing in December that the academy graduate was actively seeking a loan move away from the Theatre of Dreams to salvage his season and maintain his standing in the international setup.

However, the mood at Carrington shifted overnight. With Amorim dismissed a week ago after a tumultuous 14-month tenure that culminated in his public criticism of the board, the door has swung back open for Mainoo to reclaim his spot in the heart of United's midfield. It is a reversal of fortune that makes a temporary switch away from the club seem suddenly unnecessary, a sentiment strongly echoed by Treble-winner Yorke.

Speaking to PokerScout, Yorke reflected on the intense speculation surrounding Mainoo's future and offered a piece of advice rooted in his own illustrious career. The former striker believes that for a player of Mainoo's immense ceiling, a loan spell should not be on the cards. In Yorke's view, the truly elite talents are those who make themselves indispensable to the first team, regardless of the managerial situation or tactical shifts.

Yorke, who formed one of the deadliest strike partnerships in Premier League history during United's golden era, has questioned the modern trend of sending top prospects away for development. He argues that staying to fight for a place is the ultimate test of character and quality, and that being kept at the club is a badge of honour.

“Would I go on loan if I were Kobbie Mainoo? I've never been on loan, when you hear players go on loan,” Yorke told PokerScout. “Even as a young kid, the club never allowed me to go on loan. That's when you kind of realise how good you were.

“Normally a young kid who's not playing, you go on loan, but they didn't allow me to go on loan. So that speaks volumes. I had no other ambition but to be the best until over that period of time, and I managed to accomplish that.”

The primary driver behind Mainoo's recent struggles was undoubtedly tactical rather than a question of talent. Amorim arrived from Sporting CP with a reputation for high-intensity, structured football, but his specific demands for the midfield pivot roles did not align with Mainoo's natural game. Amorim favoured more physical, combative presences to protect his back three, often bypassing the technical progression through the middle that Mainoo excels at.

By December, the situation had deteriorated to the point where Serie A giants Napoli, led by Antonio Conte, were reportedly preparing a loan offer to bring Mainoo to Italy. The prospect of a loan move seemed increasingly likely as the player's camp grew frustrated with his lack of minutes.

However, the board's decision to sack Amorim has effectively scuppered those plans. With the tactical shackles of the previous regime removed, Mainoo is now expected to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the managerial change. The rigid structures that didn't suit his game are gone, likely to be replaced by a system that values his unique ability to carry the ball and dictate play from deep.

As United prepare for a crucial run of fixtures, the focus will be on stabilising a rocking ship. Interim manager Darren Fletcher has taken temporary charge, but the club is moving quickly to appoint a caretaker until the end of the season, with former midfielder Michael Carrick and ex-striker and coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer emerging as the frontrunners in the press. Carrick, in particular, possesses a deep understanding of the midfield role Mainoo occupies and would likely build the team around the youngster's passing range.

The warning from Yorke serves as a reminder of the standards expected at Old Trafford. While a loan to a Serie A or Premier League rival might have offered short-term relief from Amorim's bench, it would have been a concession of sorts. By staying put, Mainoo now has the chance to prove that his exclusion was a tactical error by the former manager rather than a reflection of his own ability. If he heeds Yorke's advice, he won't be looking for a loan move anytime soon, he'll be looking to make sure he never sits on the bench again.

The Gulf State is reportedly interested in hosting football's latest club competition, which is due to take place between January 5 and 30, 2028, after it was announced by FIFA last month

Qatar is in talks to stage the inaugural Women's Club World Cup, despite not having a FIFA-ranked ladies national team. 

The Gulf State is reportedly interested in hosting football's latest club competition, which is due to take place between January 5 and 30, 2028, after it was announced by FIFA last month. 

A formal bidding process for the tournament has yet to start, but eyebrows have been raised by a potential Qatar bid given the country's stance on LGBTQ+ rights and its lack of history of women's football.

Their national women's team played an initial burst of fixtures after being formed in 2009 but has not played an official match in 12 years.   

Despite this, Qatar would be seen as a favourite to host the landmark tournament, given its close relationship with FIFA, ready-made stadiums and warm winter climate. 

If Qatar does officially put its hat in the ring, it would be the latest in a long line of tournament bids after hosting the 2022 World Cup finals. 

The FIFA Intercontinental Cup was held in Al-Rayyan last month, while the second edition of the men's Finals between the European champions Spain and the South American champions Argentina will take place in Doha in March.  

Qatar had also expressed an interest in staging the men's Club World Cup in 2029, but were told by FIFA that the tournament will take place during the northern hemisphere summer. 

However, given the dates of the Women's Club World Cup, it seems inevitable it will take place somewhere in the Gulf. 

The tournament, which will take place every four years, is already expected to cause major disruption to domestic seasons, including in Europe. 

There will be no clash with the Champions League but many domestic European leagues will be forced to introduce a longer winter break. 

The Australian, Mexican and Japanese leagues are also likely to be impacted.

Fifa has yet to determine its entry criteria, but 16 teams will feature including at least from Europe and two each from Asia, Africa, South America and North America.

A club from each of those five confederations and one from Oceania will play in a qualifying tournament to determine the final three entrants.

ATLANTA — Food and family go hand-in-hand for Tana Bhamaraniyama, who goes by the nickname Bank. The Atlanta native co-owns Tyde Tate Kitchen in South Downtown, just minutes from Mercedes-Benz Stadium. He and several other family members run the restaurant that sits next to Spiller Park Coffee.

"We've done everything you can think of: cook, clean, somebody needs to scrub the toilet? That's us. Prepping, serving, bartending, sushi," Bhamaraniyama said. "We wanted to kind of be a jumpstart to something that was forgotten."

The area carries decades of blight and concern, but it wasn't always that way, according to Jon Birdsong. 

Birdsong is the CEO of SoDo Atlanta, a holding company of ten city blocks, 16 acres and more than 50 historic buildings in South Downtown Atlanta.

"Perception of safety is a massive challenge," Birdsong said. "It's not as well lit, there's not as many businesses, and we're doing everything we can to fix that." 

Rather than boarded buildings and other signs of abandonment, there's now an uptick in cranes and construction, along with new shops and more people walking down wider sidewalks. It's a sign investment is growing and businesses are buying into a new vision.

"These buildings have been forgotten for so long, they were even forgotten to be torn down," Birdsong said. "So now we're taking these unpolished jewels, adding a little shine to them and really turning it into a startup district wrapped around unique boutique and local retail and, of course, the most important piece, housing."

Birdsong noted that many of the new housing units that would be created downtown would not necessarily come with designated parking in an attempt to save some residents costs that could go toward rent. Birdsong said there are efforts to secure the new investment in South Downtown. Atlanta Police have 24-7 patrols in the area, and the community employs Verkada security system, Undaunted robotic security system and Flock safety cameras. 

To spur change downtown, SoDo Atlanta is turning to Northspyre to drive more efficient development through data and automation. Northspyre CEO William Sankey said the company helps condense hours of paperwork with hundreds of vendors. 

"That could take 30 to 40% of the mindshare and time and focus managing complexity," Sankey said. "They want to focus more on the strategic direction of the project. Now, this really unlocks them to create better places, create places that are more dynamic and can accommodate more tenants, build more buildings at a cost that's more predictable.”

Sankey said the end result of using data and automation to speed up projects is that more jobs will be available sooner to those who need them. Downtown has already begun a transformation through the Centennial Yards project and other developments, such as the Signia Hilton.

Bhamaraniyama calls Downtown the city's heartbeat. After opening up his family's first restaurant in West Midtown, he said he took a chance on the downtown location to pioneer a new opportunity for growth.

“When you looked around this area, it was always dark, cold, and the ambience wasn't there," Bhamaraniyama said. "It's kind of eerie. I think that's one thing we're still fighting through, but it's getting better. Everybody needs a little jolt in the heart sometimes. Downtown is like the heart, and they need it to be brought up and alive again."

Real Madrid's stance when it comes to the future of under-fire manager Xabi Alonso has been revealed. The World Cup-winning former Los Blancos midfielder only returned to the Bernabeu in the summer of 2025 as he succeeded legendary Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. He has endured a baptism of fire in the Spanish capital, leading to inevitable sack speculation being generated. 

Alonso, who guided Bayer Leverkusen to Bundesliga title glory in his previous post, was considered to be the perfect candidate to take Real forward - as he knows all about the demands of operating under the brightest of La Liga spotlights.

He was able to end Madrid's run of four consecutive losses to arch-rivals Barcelona when overseeing an eventful Clasico win in October 2025. Real did, however, come unstuck against the same opposition in the 2026 Spanish Super Cup final.

They lost that contest, which was played out in Saudi Arabia, 3-2. Vinicius Junior registered a stunning solo goal for the Blancos, but they came up short in another bid for major silverware - having seen off cross-city neighbours Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals.

Real have now suffered defeat in five of their last six meetings with Barca, and that is not a record that sits well with president Florentino Perez and the club's board. They have seen Alonso struggle to generate consistency this season.

He endured a run of two wins in eight between November 4 and December 10, leading to initial talk of a change in the dugout arising. That is back following another reversal against Barca, but it is claimed that Real are prepared to be patient before wielding any axe.

Jose Feliz Diaz reports for AS: “Despite the defeat against Barcelona, the manager's job is not in danger. It's a time for analysis and finding solutions to the team's problems.”

He added: “The Super Cup and Real Madrid's performance in it keep Xabi Alonso's job alive. At the club, defeats don't strengthen the team. Never, but the one in Jeddah against Flick's Barcelona gives the former Bayer Leverkusen coach a chance to remain at the helm.

“There was no ultimatum, because, as we've been saying for several weeks, it's all about the feeling, and as such, Real Madrid's performance in the final of the first title of the season opens the door to improved performance, rather than directly pointing the finger at the coach.”

Rather than force Alonso through the exits, Real intend to work with him. It is acknowledged that injuries have done his cause few favours this season. Diaz went on to say: “The first priority, without a doubt, is physical improvement and finally halting the haemorrhaging of injuries plaguing the Real Madrid squad.

“There isn't a single match where a player doesn't get injured. In the semi-final, [Ferland] Mendy was injured, and in the decisive match, it was [Dean] Huijsen who ended up with a serious muscle strain.

“Niko Mihic's return to the medical department won't be the only change to the Real Madrid first team. The coaching staff needs to find the right formula to improve the squad's fitness, and they'll do so with the club's support. At Valdebebas, they believe there's still time to have a good season, but that hinges on improving the team's physical condition.”

Real could seek a quick fix by dipping into the winter transfer market, but that is not an approach that they have historically favoured as value can be difficult to find in January windows.

Diaz said of plans in 2026: “For the moment, no one has mentioned entering the winter transfer market. It's a transfer period they don't believe in, just as they don't trust the youth academy.

“Some of them will feature in the Copa del Rey match against Albacete, but so far there ‘s been no indication that they're considering the younger players as a solution for this season, apart from Gonzalo [Garcia], who was already a first-team player.”

Real will be in cup action again when travelling to Albacete on Wednesday. They will return to home soil for a Liga meeting with Levante on Saturday and a Champions League clash with Ligue 1 giants Monaco.

Arsenal are the most recent holders of the Women's Champions League

Qatar are reportedly in talks with FIFA to host the inaugural Women's Club World Cup in 2028.

The Guardian have reported that Qatar is in talks with football's governing body to stage the Women's Club World Cup.

It would be a controversial move due to the country's stance on LGBTQ+ rights. Qatar also doesn't even have a place on the FIFA Women's rankings due to a lack of matches.

Qatar put together a women's national team in 2009, but as per The Guardian, they have not played an official match for 12 years.

However, with the tournament set to take place in the winter, Qatar does have an advantage due to its warm winter climate.

Qatar hosted the 2022 men's World Cup, but recently failed in their efforts to stage the men's Club World Cup in 2029.

Morocco and Spain are the most likely nations to host the men's tournament in 2029.

The Women's Club World Cup will run between January 5th and 30th in 2028.

This will likely result in a change to the WSL calendar, as the tournament will start just as the winter break in the WSL usually comes to an end.

The first Club World Cup will feature 16 teams, including at least five from Europe. While FIFA has yet to determine its entry criteria, Arsenal are likely to be involved after winning the Champions League.

Women's football fans expressed concerns about the tournament ahead of its introduction in 2028.

Deborah Dilworth, head of women's football for the Football Supporters' Association (FSA), sent a letter to WSL chief executive Nikki Doucet and FA CEO Mark Bullingham to express “serious concerns”.

The letter was co-signed by 34 supporter groups, including fans of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.

Dilworth wrote: “The FSA's Women's Game Network cares about the health, wealth and connectivity of the entire domestic game and we believe the WCWC could negatively affect the full pyramid of women's football in England.

“The concentration of money to a few is also of deep concern to women's football. Should a domestic team win the tournament the prize money windfall could further distort the landscape and affect sporting competitiveness.

Arsenal meanwhile are set to compete in the inaugural Women's Champions Cup which runs from January 28th to February 1st.

The Gunners will face Moroccan side AS FAR on January 28th, and should they win, will play either Gotham FC or Corinthians in the final on February 1st.

Unlike the Women's Club World Cup, the Champions Cup only features the champion clubs from each of the six continental confederations

Belinda Bencic was named the United Cup's most valuable player, finishing with a 9-1 record and a perfect 5-0 record in singles. Swiss captain Stan Wawrinka often said it was "Belinda's World," and Bencic could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season.

SYDNEY, Australia -- It all started after Switzerland's opening United Cup 3-0 win against France on Jan. 3 in Perth.

Belinda Bencic had just defeated Leolia Jeanjan in singles and then secured the sweep of the French alongside Jakub Paul in mixed doubles.

Asked for his initial thoughts, captain Stan Wawrinka uttered the following:

“It's been a great day for us thanks to Belinda to play so well and to show us the way. We are just living in Belinda's world, so we're enjoying that.”

What started as fun banter between the two Swiss foreshadowed what would ultimately be reality. Across Perth and Sydney, it was quite literally ‘Belinda's World,' as the Swiss No. 1 had her way throughout.

Bencic finished with a 9-1 record (5-0 in singles), recorded two top 10 wins and reentered the top 10 in the PIF WTA Rankings as she guided Switzerland to their first United Cup final. Her lone loss came in the deciding mixed doubles for the championship.

Justifiably, Bencic was named the United Cup's most valuable player, despite the team's loss to Poland in the championship. She could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season ahead of next week's Australian Open.

“[It's a] big confidence-booster,” Bencic said in her team's press conference. “You start the year, and you're just trying to get matches in. Obviously, it's been great playing match after match, but being pushed so much from everyone.

“Also super happy to be in the top 10 now. I think it's been a huge goal, maybe a huge ride after the whole comeback, to come back and prove this to myself, that it's possible. We keep on going.”

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Compared to a year ago, it's remarkable how quickly Bencic returned to a high-intensity level of play after her pregnancy and subsequent maternity leave. She entered the 2025 United Cup ranked No. 487 and suffered a double breadstick loss to Jasmine Paolini.

By year's end, after claiming her ninth and 10th WTA Tour titles in Abu Dhabi and Tokyo, she propelled to No. 11 and was named the 2025 WTA Comeback Player of the Year.

At the United Cup, Bencic was a dominant force, avenging that defeat to Paolini with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the then-No. 8. With a deciding mixed doubles win with Paul to secure the tie, Bencic sent the Swiss through to the quarterfinals.

“Well, [we're] living in Belinda's world again,” Wawrinka opened the post-tie press conference with a grin. “She's showing us why we're here again.”

At this point, the phrase became an embodiment of the Swiss team, so much that Wawrinka even received a graphic t-shirt with a “Belinda's World” design at a team trip to Kings Park and Botanical Garden in Perth. After Wawrinka didn't wear it during Bencic's straight sets win over Solana Sierra in the quarterfinals, Bencic made it known her expectations for the captain to sport it during her singles matches in Sydney. 

"It's the least I expect. I mean, how do you treat a gift like that," Bencic jokingly asked. 

Wawrinka's reply?

"You sure? Okay, done deal. I will be wearing it in Sydney when she's playing. No pressure, but now you have to keep playing that good."

A post shared by United Cup (@unitedcuptennis)

Simply put, Bencic fulfilled the task. As Wawrinka kept is word, and Bencic delivered the two grittiest and hard-fought wins of her United Cup. In the semifinals against Belgium, Elise Mertens was two points away from spoiling Bencic's run, but the Swiss won the last nine points to win the match 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (0).

The next day in the final, she earned her first victory over Iga Swiatek in more than four years, winning 12 of the final 15 games to capture the three-set win in a predominantly Polish-favoring crowd. 

The effort would not be enough to bring the title to Switzerland, which Bencic said was "bittersweet," but it rightly solidified any doubts of who the MVP trophy would be awarded to. 

At the trophy presentation, a selfless Bencic -- as she always is -- centered her MVP speech on congratulating Poland and thanking her Swiss compatriots. But when the captain took the microphone shortly after, Wawrinka -- who is on his final year on the ATP Tour -- summed it up best. 

"It was something really special that we [had] together, especially because of one person, Belinda," Wawrinka said. "We all know we're living in Belinda's world. Belinda, thank you for what you're doing on the court. Thank you for what you're doing off the court.

"You still came back so quick, so fast to that high level. This is so impressive to watch."

Belinda Bencic was named the United Cup's most valuable player, finishing with a 9-1 record and a perfect 5-0 record in singles. Swiss captain Stan Wawrinka often said it was "Belinda's World," and Bencic could not have asked for a better singles start to the 2026 season.

But Poland's decision to stick with two-time mixed doubles Grand Slam champion Zielinski and Kawa, who has won five WTA 125 titles in doubles, paid off. The duo finished 5-0 in mixed doubles for the tournament,In the first set, Kawa had a match-altering set point volley at the net on 40-40 deciding point leading 5-4."I think it always pays off when you're brave on the important points, especially in doubles," Kawa said to reporters. "It was like instinct decision. I just went for it. Yeah, I'm really happy that we sealed this set and we were able to get this match won."Bencic was nonetheless tabbed tournament MVP behind a sparkling 9-1 record, a moment she called "bittersweet."

"We did the best we could.

"I think it's really unique and amazing we showed how strong we are as a Polish country in tennis. To win that trophy, it tastes incredible. As you mentioned, we came very close two times.

But the big-serving Thornhill, Ontario native was slowed after his 2016 peak by various injuries, including to his hip, back, leg, knee and shoulder.

The last of which proved to be the injury that ended his career. Raonic last competed at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, where he represented Canada in both singles and doubles."I have been the luckiest person to get to live out and fulfill my dreams," he continued. "I got to show up every day and focus on just getting better, seeing where that will take me, and playing a game I was introduced to at 8 years old by complete luck. Somehow, this became my entire obsession and childhood, and then became my profession and life."Raonic says that he'll be as laser-focused in his next chapter, as he has no plans of "slowing down" in his post-tennis life."There is so much more life to live, and I am motivated and hungry as I was in 2011, when I broke through on tour," he added.

Now rising to No. 12 in the world, Elina Svitolina credits a refreshed mental approach and the support of her husband for her flawless run to the ASB Classic trophy.

The pressure Elina Svitolina felt to win Sunday's final at the ASB Classic came from a familiar source -- her husband, Gael Monfils.

“This was very special,” the top-seeded Svitolina acknowledged after defeating No. 7 Wang Xinyu 6-3, 7-6 (6). “My husband won the title here last year. He said, 'If you don't win this year, I don't know what to say.'"

Later, in a conversation with wtatennis.com, Svitolina elaborated.

“Before the tournament, he told me it would be amazing if we both won the same tournament,” she said, laughing. “He was not sure if this ever happened before. 

“Of course, I had it always in the back of my mind. It really motivated me but also [created] a little bit of pressure. I tried to do my very best to get this title.”

For a week at least, husband and wife are both reigning champions in Auckland. France's Monfils, ranked No. 64, plays Fabian Marozsan in a first-round match. No. 2 seed Casper Ruud awaits the winner in the second round. Monfils, 39, says he's playing his last season.

Svitolina and Monfils were already professional tennis' power couple, but this one puts them in the history books. More than a half century ago, Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors won the 1974 Wimbledon titles. They danced at the Champions' Dinner -- but they were merely engaged at the time.

On Sunday, Svitolina took the first set in 32 minutes but needed more than twice that time to emerge from the second against a determined Wang. Svitolina finished with seven aces and three double faults, winning 74 percent of her first serves.

In the crucial tiebreak, her last three serves were all unreturnable.

“I feel like I was serving really, really well today,” Svitolina said. “It kept me in the match in the second set, then really brought me the win at the end in the tiebreak. Staying tough, fighting for every single point, yeah, kept me in the match.”

The ultimate difference in this WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz matchup? Svitolina saved all four of the break points she faced. Wang was broken only once, in the sixth game of the first set, but it probably cost her the match.

This one was sweet for Svitolina, who lost the 2024 final here to Coco Gauff. She's now a sporty 9-1 in Auckland. This was Svitolina's third title since giving birth -- and her first outside France, following Strasbourg in 2023 and 2025 Rouen.

Svitolina moves up to No. 12 from No. 13 on Monday. She hasn't been ranked in the Top 10 since becoming a mother (2021) but is on the cusp again. Svitolina is one of five players aged or more, but only Jessica Pegula is older.

Here's more with Svitolina: 

Congratulations on winning your 19th WTA Tour title … in your mind, what was the difference today?

I think the little adjustments. I feel like all this week, it's been all about the adjustments, fighting against the wind, the really tricky opponents. For me, it was all about trying to find the little opportunities and to take them. 

You have won nine of 10 matches in Auckland ... what is it about New Zealand that agrees with your game?

I like this tournament a lot. I think the organization is great. The conditions, of course, can be sometimes tricky. But it's for both players, and you just have to put your head down and get back to work. I love playing here because of the crowd. Doesn't matter if you play the first match or very late, they are supporting, they are into tennis and very respectful. 

Your daughter Skai … at three years old is she old enough to understand what her mother does for a living?

[Laughing]. To be fair, we never bring her on site. She's in the city. This time she's not, she's back home in Europe. With a nanny and our parents. She understands that we play tennis. I don't know if she understands completely what we do for a living. But she knows that daddy and mommy sometimes have to play tennis. She plays already herself. It's great to see here grow up so quick.  

You have played in 23 finals and won 19 of them (83 percent), how do you explain that?

It's nice to have these statistics. Of course, I'm very sad for those losses. It gives lots of confidence going into the final. Every final is a new story, a new chapter. I always try to be extremely focused on those finals. I know they can be up and down. You might not be playing your best tennis because pressure is playing a big role in it. I try to keep my calm, try to do what I can, yeah, keep fighting, find the small opportunities -- and take them.

You haven't been Top 10 since you became a mother … but you're up to No. 12 … what are your goals and expectations for 2026?

It's to stay healthy. This is the main goal for this year because for the three seasons I had after pregnancy, three of them I didn't finish well. Two of them were because of my foot -- I had to have surgery -- then last year I was mentally drained, had no energy to continue. I've prioritized my mental health and my physicality. I think it's really important, those two aspects. They play a major role for a tennis player, and for me personally. I really count a lot on my fighting spirit and of course my fitness and strength. When they are good, I can challenge any player. At the back of my mind, I have the goal to be back in the Top 10, but this is not a main goal.

You made the quarterfinals at the Australian Open last year at the age of 30 -- how excited are you for this year's event in Melbourne?

Definitely excited. It's great to win a title just before and to have one week in between to recover. Melbourne's conditions are a bit different, but for me, it's a great week with lots of tough matches. It's nice to get through them. Just happy to leave New Zealand with the trophy.

Now rising to No. 12 in the world, Elina Svitolina credits a refreshed mental approach and the support of her husband for her flawless run to the ASB Classic trophy.

The sport prides itself on being at the forefront of innovation – and this year's shake up to the rules is one of the most significant revamps for more than a decade. You can find out more about the ins and outs of the new regulations here.

While that undoubtedly poses a challenge for every team on the grid, it also means the Formula 1 drivers have to get to grips with driving new – and different – machinery.

Former Renault driver Jolyon Palmer is joined by current Cadillac driver Valtteri Bottas and former F1 star Juan Pablo Montoya to explain how drivers adapt and get up to speed when a new set of regulations come into play.

Leonardo DiCaprio may have missed out on a performance prize at the Golden Globes, but a candid moment captured off-stage is winning the internet.


	The One Battle After Another star was filmed interacting animatedly with an unknown attendee at the Beverly Hilton on Sunday night.


	It's not totally clear what DiCaprio is saying — though some amateur lip readers have posted their speculation — but the actor appears to be jokingly impersonating his friend.


	During the clip, DiCaprio points in the direction of another guest, indicates that he was watching them by raising his fingers to his eyes, and then delivers what looks like a hammy impression.

	The Golden Globes TikTok account posted the full clip, with the caption: “Enjoy 30 seconds of Leonardo DiCaprio.”

	One of the more compelling lip-reader theories is that DiCaprio is saying: “I was watching you with the K-pop thing, you were like, ‘Is that, who is that, oh K-pop.'”


	The suspicion is that he is talking to his One Battle co-star Chase Infiniti after Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters won two awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for “Golden.” Infiniti is an unabashed K-pop fan.


	DiCaprio missed out on the Best Actor — Musical or Comedy prize to Timothée Chalamet, who won for Marty Supreme. The pair were filmed embracing and chatting at the Globes ceremony.

	Earlier in the evening, host Nikki Glaser said in a joke about DiCaprio: “What a career you've had, countless iconic performances, you've worked with every great director, you've won three Golden Globes, an Oscar and the most impressive thing is you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.”

John Mayer shared a short but poignant tribute to his late bandmate Bob Weir on Sunday. The musician, who performed with Weir in Dead & Company for several years, honored their collaboration. 


	“Okay Bob. I'll do it your way,” Mayer wrote on Instagram. “Fkn' A… Thanks for letting me ride alongside you. It sure was a pleasure. If you say it's not the end, then I'll believe you. I'll meet you in the music. Come find me anytime.”


	Mayer joined forces with Weir in 2015. While guest hosting The Late Late Show that February, Mayer invited Weir to join him for a studio performance. A collaboration evolved from there. Dead & Company embarked on numerous tours in the years that followed. 


	The group wrapped up a farewell tour in July 2023, but they continued to play residencies at Sphere in Las Vegas throughout 2024 and 2025. They came together one last time in August 2025 for three shows in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to celebrate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary. Throughout the three evenings, they were joined by Billy Strings, Trey Anastasio, Grahame Lesh, and Sturgill Simpson.

	Weir once said he hoped to see the band outlive him. “I had a little flash while we were playing one night,” Weir told Rolling Stone‘s David Fricke in 2016. “It was toward the end of the tour. I don't remember what city it was in. We were getting into the second set, setting up a tune. We were all playing, but the tune hadn't begun yet. We were all feeling out the groove, just playing with it. Suddenly I was 20 feet behind my own head, looking at this and kind of happy with the way the song was shaping up. I started looking around, and it was 20 years later. John's hair had turned gray. Oteil's had turned white. I looked back at the drummers, and it was a couple of new guys. I looked back at myself, the back of my head, and it was a new guy. It changed my entire perception of what it is we're up to.”

	











	Weir's family announced his death at 78 on Jan. 10 in a statement. A date of death was not immediately available. “It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” his family wrote. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”

Mark Ruffalo had strong words for Donald Trump on the red carpet of Golden Globes on Sunday night. The actor was asked about his pin, which read “Be Good,” and explained that he was wearing it to honor Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent last week. 


	“This is for Renee Nicole Good, who was murdered,” Ruffalo told reporters. He elaborated on his upset with the current situation in the U.S., noting, “We have a vice president who is lying about what's happening. We're in the middle of a war with Venezuela that we illegally invaded.”


	Ruffalo added of Trump, “He's telling the world that international law doesn't matter to him. The only thing that matters to him is his own morality, but the guy is a convicted felon; a convicted rapist. He's a pedophile. He's the worst human being in the world. If we're relying on this guy's morality for the most powerful country in the world, then we're all in a lot of trouble.”


	The actor explained that the pin, which was worn by several other attendees, including Wanda Skyes, was dedicated both to Good and to “the people in the United States who are terrorized and scared today.”

	“I know I'm one of them,” Ruffalo said. “I love this country. And what I'm seeing here happening is not America.”

Mark Ruffalo telling USA Today that the black-and-white pin he's wearing was in honor of Renee Good. He also speaks out against the war in Venezuela and calls Trump a pedophile and a rapist, 'the worst human being'


	He affirmed that he would prefer to attend a glamorous awards show and pretend like nothing is amiss. “I want to be here to celebrate and I am here to celebrate and I'm proud to have a Golden Globe nomination, but also this is not normal anymore,” he said. “So I don't know how I could be quiet.”

	











	Ruffalo was nominated at the Golden Globes for his performance in HBO crime drama series Task.

Mickey Hart, longtime drummer for Grateful Dead, shared his memories of Bob Weir following his death at 78. 


	“Bob Weir was a little brother to me for almost sixty years,” Hart wrote. He was my first friend in the Grateful Dead. We lived together, played together, and made music together that ended up changing the world.”


	He continued, “Bob had the ability to play unique chords that few others could. Long fingers, that's the difference. Jerry once told me that the harmonics Bob created became an inspiration for his own solos. When all of us were entrained, rhythm section, guitars, and voices… it was transcendent.”


	The drummer concluded, “What was a lifetime of adventure boils down to something simple — we were family and true to the music through it all. These photos show the bookends of our lives together. Still cannot believe he's gone. I miss you so much already, dear friend.”


	Hart played drums in Grateful Dead from 1967 through 1971 and again from 1974 through 1995, when the band performed their final show. In 2015, he joined Weir in Dead & Company, which kept the spirit of the Dead alive for another decade, culminating in a 2023 “Final Tour” and two stints at Las Vegas' Sphere.

A date of death was not immediately available. “It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” his family wrote. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.”

	“Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music,” the statement added. “His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them. Every chord he played, every word he sang was an integral part of the stories he wove. There was an invitation: to feel, to question, to wander, and to belong.”

Different than applause after a song, it sounded more like an ahhhhhh. All the peace and love in proximity generated a collective energy that was shared by all. Very rare stuff indeed.”

"We all keep having dreams about him. In the dreams, he is laughing," Jack Osbourne said.

	Jack Osbourne says his late father, Ozzy Osbourne, has been appearing to multiple family members in vivid, recurring dreams since his death last year.


	In a recent interview with Billy Morrison on SiriusXM, Jack Osbourne shared that he, his wife and his daughters have all independently experienced similar dreams involving the Black Sabbath frontman.

	“We all keep having dreams about him. In the dreams, he is laughing,” Jack Osbourne said. 


	“And he is saying, ‘Just stop f—ng crying'. He's laughing every time. Me and my wife, my daughters, all the same thing. We keep seeing him in our dreams, laughing.”

	











	Morrison, who was speaking with Osbourne during the broadcast, also said he had experienced a similar dream about Ozzy. “I've seen him. He's good, Jack. He's not in pain,” Morrison said, according to the interview.


Ozzy Osbourne died in July 2025 at age 76 after suffering a heart attack. He had faced a number of health challenges in recent years, including Parkinson's disease and coronary artery disease. His death came just 17 days after he played his final live performance in his hometown of Birmingham, England, a benefit concert that raised millions for children's charities and featured appearances from major figures across the rock and metal world.




	Following his passing, Sharon Osbourne publicly shared details about her final moments with her husband, recalling that he asked her to “kiss me” and “hug me tight” in the early hours of the morning before his death. She later said she continues to reflect on that moment and wishes she had held him longer.


	In the months since Ozzy's death, tributes have continued to pour in. 


	Fans launched a petition calling for Birmingham Airport to be renamed in his honour, which has garnered more than 75,000 signatures, while the late singer was also posthumously awarded the Birmingham Lord Mayor's Award on what would have been his 77th birthday.


	Osbourne co-founded Black Sabbath in 1968, helping define heavy metal through albums including Black Sabbath, Paranoid and Master of Reality, before launching a solo career that produced classics such as “Crazy Train” and “Mr. Crowley.”

The Hollywood Reporter's executive editor of awards coverage dissects Sunday night's results ahead of Monday morning's voting.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Unlike last year's Golden Globe Awards, this year's Globes, which took place on Sunday night, was not the first televised awards show of the awards season; that was the Critics Choice Awards, which took place last Sunday night. But this year's Globes will almost surely have a greater influence on the shape of the Oscar nominations than did last year's Globes or will this year's Critics Choice Awards, given that Oscar nomination voting starts bright and early on Monday — as in, tomorrow.


	So, who was helped the most by the results at the Globes, which, for the third year in a row, were determined by a post-HFPA group of several hundred entertainment journalists for non-American media outlets based all around the world?

					At the Golden Globes, a Warner Bros. Party, and a Hint of Worry		
			









1) Hamnet and One Battle After Another


	Focus' Hamnet prevailed over formidable competition — Warners' Sinners, Netflix's Frankenstein and Neon's It Was Just an Accident, The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value — to win best picture (drama), positioning it, at least in theory and a lot of media coverage, as the chief best picture Oscar challenger to Warners' One Battle After Another, which was always expected to win the other best picture award, best picture (musical/comedy), and did.


Steven Spielberg, as a producer of Hamnet, accepted that film's best picture prize (before turning over the mic to co-writer/director Chloé Zhao), which only further boosts the film's standing, given how revered Spielberg is in the business. Additionally, Hamnet's Jessie Buckley won best actress (drama), while One Battle's Paul Thomas Anderson won best director and best screenplay prizes to go with his producing honor.

	











2) The Secret Agent and Wagner Moura


	Unlike the SAG-AFTRA nominating committee that determined the Actor Awards nominations last week and shut out all films and film performances that were not in English, Globes voters have never had a problem rewarding work done in other languages, and they did a huge service to the Portuguese-language Brazilian film The Secret Agent by recognizing it with best non-English-language film (over the likes of France's It Was Just an Accident and Norway's Sentimental Value) and with best actor (drama) for Wagner Moura (over the likes of Sinners' Michael B. Jordan, Jeremy Allen White for 20th Century's Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere and Dwayne Johnson for A24's The Smashing Machine).


The Secret Agent's non-English-language film Globe win over two films that beat it at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, the fest's first-place winner (It Was Just an Accident) and runner-up (Sentimental Value), is a repeat of last week's result at the Critics Choice Awards, and calls into question the common wisdom that those other two are stronger contenders for not only a best international feature Oscar win but also best picture Oscar noms. (Last year, I'm Still Here became the first Brazilian film ever nominated for the top Oscar; The Secret Agent now looks primed to make it two in a row!)


	Meanwhile, I've long thought that Moura — who won Cannes' best actor prize and was my guest on THR's Awards Chatter podcast last week — could be a sleeper threat at the Oscars to presumptive frontrunners Timothée Chalamet (A24's Marty Supreme) and Leonardo DiCaprio (One Battle After Another), who competed against each other in the other best actor Globes category, best actor (musical/comedy), with Chalamet prevailing. Moura understood the assignment when he used his Globes acceptance speech to tease viewers about what The Secret Agent is about and why it matters.

	











3) If I Had Legs I'd Kick You's Rose Byrne


	A Globes win means more to some than to others. Rose Byrne's best actress (musical/comedy) victory for a challenging little indie about a woman in crisis, A24's If I Had Legs I'd Kick You — over the likes of One Battle After Another's Chase Infiniti and the stars of two Focus films, Song Sung Blue's Kate Hudson and Bugonia's Emma Stone — could be a game-changer for the versatile and well-liked performer.


	It is far from certain that Byrne's movie — which, as she joked, was made for “eight-and-a-half dollars” — has even been seen by enough members of the Academy's actors branch to make her competitive with other actresses from higher-profile films who are also vying for a best actress Oscar nom. But her Globes recognition makes it far likelier that straggling Academy members will prioritize checking it out before casting their ballot.


4) One Battle After Another's Teyana Taylor


	The best supporting actress Oscar race is looking as fluid as any at the moment. Ariana Grande was the early frontrunner for Universal's Wicked: For Good. But the critics awards were largely split between Amy Madigan for Warners' Weapons (New York Film Critics Circle) and Teyana Taylor for One Battle After Another (LA Film Critics Association and National Society of Film Critics), with Madigan winning the most visible critical laurel, the Critics Choice Award, last week.


	But on Sunday night, Taylor rebounded with a Globes win , for which she received a standing ovation — something not all acting winners received — and after which she read a moving speech. At the Actor Awards, at which all three ladies are again nominated, Taylor will now have some real wind behind her sails — to go with coattails from her film's best ensemble nominations, which the other two are lacking.

	











5) Sentimental Value's Stellan Skarsgård


	Considering that most pundits, including yours truly, have thought for months that Sentimental Value's Stellan Skarsgård was the man to beat in the best supporting actor Oscar race, given the popular veteran's great performance and overdue status, the past week had been pretty bad for him: he lost the Critics Choice Award to Frankenstein's Jacob Elordi in a huge upset, and then, even more surprisingly, wasn't even nominated for the SAG Award.


	But Skarsgård had a much-needed rebound on Sunday night, winning the best supporting actor Globe over Elordi, One Battle's Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn, Hamnet's Paul Mescal and Adam Sandler for Netflix's Jay Kelly — six years after he won a Globe for his work on TV's Chernobyl — and talked up his “small Norwegian film with no money for advertising.”


6) Sorry Baby's Eva Victor


	Nobody looked more surprised than Eva Victor, the writer/director/lead actress of A24's little indie Sorry, Baby, when Julia Roberts, the star of Amazon's After the Hunt — moments after receiving a show-stopping standing ovation and mid-way through announcing the best picture (musical/comedy) award — paused to shout out Victor, who, like Roberts, had just lost to Buckley in the best actress (drama) category.


	“Eva Victor is my hero,” Roberts gushed, adding the sort of publicity that money cannot buy: “Sorry, Baby — if you haven't seen it, see it!” Something like that could make a huge difference for Victor with Oscar voters, given that Sorry, Baby — a dark comedy about the aftermath of a sexual assault — is thought to be on the bubble for a nom in the best original screenplay Oscar race.

When Timothée Chalamet won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, a mini-debate broke out in IndieWire's Slack channel. What happened to his “Marty Supreme” swagger? Prior to Sunday night's ceremony, the King of Christmas had been making the marketing rounds practically in-character: Confident. Loud. Orange. But on the Globes stage in the Beverly Hilton ballroom, he was, as one colleague put it, “diminished.” 

“My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up: Always be grateful for what you have,” Chalamet said. “It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty-handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments didn't make this moment that much sweeter.” 

 








Related Stories Sound Editors Nominations Include ‘Kpop Demon Hunters,' ‘One Battle After Another' ‘Hamnet' Wins Best Picture, Drama, at 2026 Golden Globes 

Dressed in an all-black ensemble, Chalamet kept his voice even and expressions level, conveying sincerity without getting blubbery (it's just the Globes, after all) while earnestly acknowledging his director, Josh Safdie, co-stars (like Kevin O'Leary), and fellow nominees. With anything that could be construed as bragging confined to his closing line, the competitive drive fueling Chalamet for the past month was all but erased.

 










Was it a mistake, or a sign of maturity? Was it honest, or a calculated decision to dial things back? Some said they never found him more likable, while others compared his time onstage to a sleepy “wedding speech.”

Huh. OK. While yours truly believes Chalamet's speech is 100 percent in response to any perceived backlash to his brash PR blitz — with so many older Oscar voters still deciding how to rank their ballots, it never hurts to be humble — polite debates like the one I shared with my savvy IndieWire cohorts were as compelling as the Golden Globes got for those of us watching from home. 

Even for a “precursor” awards show, that's not saying much. 

At its best, the 2026 Golden Globes got out of its own way long enough to let the awards (and winners) speak for themselves. Great speeches from Rhea Seehorn, Rose Byrne, and the “Sinners” team were fun and/or sweet. Solid intros from presenters like Wanda Sykes, Don Cheadle, and Zoë Kravitz were memorable without overwhelming the honorees. It was a starry show (as it has to be), albeit one without a personality — which may not matter to general audiences in the here and now, but seems downright odd to veteran viewers and could spell trouble down the line. 

The 2026 Golden Globes certainly didn't bring back the “party” atmosphere so many past editions have bragged about, and with a Polymarket betting ticker popping up before every other commercial break (plus the Original Score award being handed out during one), it also wasn't a reputable presentation on the level of the Oscars, Emmys, or whatever serious organization prizes podcasts. (Las Culturistas?) Unforced errors surfaced far too often, from the Google Maps-ing of the ballroom (who cares where they're sitting? fill the screen with their faces!) to the inept color commentary offered while winners took the long walk to the stage. (With apologies to Kevin Frazier and Marc Malkin, you've got to have more to say while Chalamet takes the stage than, “Will he thank Kylie Jenner again tonight? We're about to find out!”)

 










It wasn't a disaster, like Jo Koy's effort, or a semi-success, like last year. It just… was. It happened. The celebrities showed up, and the audiences who weren't enamored with a 16-3 NFL game may have, too.  Scraping by may be enough for an awards show still getting back on its feet, but it's not enough to compete with everything else fighting for our attention on a Sunday night in January. (You should not have skipped “Industry” for this.)

The shrugs started with returning host Nikki Glaser, who feigned biting commentary with a CBS News joke (“America's newest place for B.S. news”) before largely falling back on easy gags. Stop me if you've heard any of these set-ups before: George Clooney's Nespresso ads. Kevin Hart's height (or lack thereof). Timothée Chalamet is skinny. “The White Lotus” Season 3's incest, and Leonardo DiCaprio's (very) young dates. 

It's not that the punchlines were disastrous or defamatory. (If anything, they were so safe the subjects didn't have to worry about blushing through their reaction shot.) It's that they struggled to lead Glaser's opening monologue anywhere exciting. She started with light topical touches (acknowledging the Warner Bros. elephant in the room, OK), gave a quick nod to the network (the aforementioned CBS joke), and then name-dropped celebrities, aka what the host does every year, taking us around the room for introductions, applause, and quick quips. 

 










Well, quick except for one. After becoming the 1,000,000th person to poke DiCaprio about his dating habits, Glaser kept going. She apologized for stooping to such a “cheap” joke, and then pivoted into defending it — not only for being low-brow, but for its familiar subject matter. 

“We don't know anything else about you!” Glaser said to the famously reclusive megastar. Glaser tried to find a different topic. She even did her research. But the best she could come up with was an old interview with Teen Beat magazine where DiCaprio said his favorite food was “pasta, pasta, and more pasta.” (Yes, it's real.)

In that all-too-brief moment, when the “One Battle After Another” star wasn't sure where Glaser's prodding was headed — and we didn't either — the Golden Globes felt alive. The show carried a charge only live TV can offer, ready to embrace the unknown with a great stand-up leading the charge. 

But then it was over, Glaser said Sean Penn looked like a sexy leather handbag, and things quieted down. 

Afterward, the night felt perfunctory. Sure, there were aberrations, like when Rose Byrne said her partner, Bobby Cannavale, missed her big win so he could attend a “reptile expo” in New Jersey, or when Teyana Taylor danced her way off stage after dedicating her trophy to “my brown sisters and little brown girls [who] belong in every room we walk into.” (And I'd be remiss to omit Glaser's extended repetition of a joke she made last year: I'm glad we got one verse of her “Marty Supreme”-inspired “Golden” parody! Progress!) But those spontaneous moments are all but guaranteed. It's an awards show. The production needs to heighten the speeches, not distract from them, and showrunners Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner struggled to make the Globes stand-out from the months-long parade of awards shows.

 










Granted, fading into the fray may be the best-case scenario for a show that kept encouraging its audience to place bets on the next round of winners and handed out yet another new award to a former host. (Amy Poehler won the inaugural Best Podcast award just two years after Ricky Gervais won the first Best Stand-Up trophy — which he won again this year.) But if the Golden Globes are ever going to establish an identity beyond “watch your favorite actors practice their speeches for future awards shows,” it'll need a lot more swagger than this. 

Dick Clark Productions, which owns and produces the Golden Globes, is a Penske Media company. PMC is also IndieWire's parent company.

The 83rd Annual Golden Globe Awards were held Sunday, January 11 at 8 p.m. ET in the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles, California. CBS and Paramount+ broadcast the ceremony.

Julia Roberts presented one of the final awards of the night at the Golden Globes and received a standing ovation.


	The Hollywood star took the stage at the Beverly Hilton and had everyone stand up for her as she was greeted with cheers from the audience.


	Some of the stars seen on screen cheering for Roberts were Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, Emma Stone, Ethan Hawke, Kate Hudson, Mark Ruffalo, among many others.


	“Emma Stone — she's like, ‘What the hell is going on right now?'” Roberts said on stage as the audience continued to applaud. 


	After the cheers subsided, Roberts said, “Wow. Thank you! I'm going to be impossible for at least a week.  I appreciate that.”

	Roberts was nominated in the Actress in a Drama Motion Picture category for her work on the psychological thriller After the Hunt. She shared the category with Tessa Thompson, Eva Victor, Renate Reinsve, Jennifer Lawrence, and Jessica Buckley, who took the award for her work in Hamnet.


	“What a great night. What a beautiful night to be an artist,” Roberts said before introducing the nominees for the Best Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy category. “This is 2026. We're going straight to the top on this.”


	Roberts ultimately presented One Battle After Another with the trophy, with the film winning over Blue Moon, Bugonia, Marty Supreme, No Other Choice, and Nouvelle Vague.

Buckley won best actress in a motion picture drama at the Golden Globes on Sunday.


							By 

	Beatrice Verhoeven


Awards Editor


	During her acceptance speech for best actress in a motion picture drama at Sunday's Golden Globes, Hamnet star Jessie Buckley took a moment to thank the “400 extras” from set.


	“This is not a normal feeling or situation to be in, but thank you Golden Globes, thank you Focus [Features] and everybody who supported this film,” Buckley told the audience. “Chloe, Paul, Maggie, Max, Emily, Jacobi, Joe, the 400 extras, I adore you. I would rave in that globe for the rest of my life with you. It was such an extraordinary set to be part of because we were telling the story of probably the most famous Brit that ever lived, and we had a Chinese director, a lot of Irish and mostly Polish crew.”

	She also honored her fellow nominees Julia Roberts (After the Hunt), Tessa Thompson (Hedda), Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value), Eva Victor (Sorry, Baby) and Jennifer Lawrence (Die My Love). “The incredible women I am honored to stand beside in this category. I mean, Julia Roberts, you are like a hero to us all. … You, Jennifer, Renata, Eva, Tessa… God, I'd watch you anytime, anywhere. You blow my mind.”

The 2026 Golden Globes nominations featured plenty of surprises, snubs, and the usually anointed suspects ahead of the January 11 ceremony. Did the winners? Find out below. In a post-Hollywood Foreign Press Association Golden Globes world, these nominees and winners taking place ahead of the Academy Awards have a rare chance to influence the Oscars.

Unlike the Screen Actors Guild's Actor Awards nominations, the Golden Globes feature a heavily international roll call, with multiple nods for “The Secret Agent,” “Sentimental Value,” “It Was Just an Accident,” and other international films that weren't released stateside by Neon.

Comedian Nikki Glaser once again hosted the ceremony, with high expectations upon her after her Hollywood-skewering opening monologue last year. (She didn't disappoint in yet another ribbing.) While “One Battle After Another” swept yet another awards show tonight, there were still some surprises (see “The Secret Agent's” strong taking), so we're hoping the Globes influence what has been a largely predictable awards season so far.

 










This year's presenters, in alphabetical order, are: Amanda Seyfried, Ana de Armas, Ayo Edebiri, Charli xcx, Chris Pine, Colman Domingo, Connor Storrie, Dakota Fanning, Dave Franco, Diane Lane, George Clooney, Hailee Steinfeld, Hudson Williams, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner, Joe Keery, Judd Apatow, Julia Roberts, Justin Hartley, Kathryn Hahn, Keegan-Michael Key, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Hart, Kyra Sedgwick, Lalisa Manobal, Luke Grimes, Macaulay Culkin, Marlon Wayans, Melissa McCarthy, Mila Kunis, Miley Cyrus, Minnie Driver, Orlando Bloom, Pamela Anderson, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Queen Latifah, Regina Hall, Sean Hayes, Snoop Dogg, Wanda Sykes, Will Arnett, and Zoë Kravitz.

Ditching a primary location is a time-honored TV tradition that dates back to I Love Lucy swapping Manhattan for the suburbs halfway through its sixth season. But Lucy and Ricky Ricardo are not who spring to mind when Pierpoint & Co.'s London trading floor was shuttered at the end of Industry's audacious third season. Whereas the propulsive HBO finance drama has little in common with Friday Night Lights beyond an impressive ensemble, the timing of this upheaval and its impact on the plotting are similar. Both FNL and Industry could've called it a day with those defining season-three finales. Thankfully, Industry continues to tell stories, and, much like the move to East Dillon High, losing Pierpoint as a central hub offers new avenues that creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay can fully explore.

Rather than gently guide us back into this cutthroat corporate world with familiar faces, the opening sequence turns to new characters while still maintaining its signature sleazy, debauched hallmarks, moving from a crowded bar to a pulsing, hedonistic nightclub and ending at an enviable abode. Music supervisor Oliver White's mood-setting is on point throughout the hour (there are needle drops from New Order, The Prodigy, and Beach House), as is Nathan Micay's euphoric score. 

Fresh from the conclusion of Stranger Things, we follow Charlie Heaton (now using his native British accent) as Jim Dyker, an investigative journalist who briefly borrows sartorial and shifty moves from You's Joe Goldberg. Jim specifically targets Haley Clay (Kiernan Shipka), a young assistant at the fintech company Tender, which has just opened offices in the swanky Canary Wharf. Drugs are shared; ethical lines crossed. Jim and Haley's introduction instantly pulls us into the murkiness by posing a question about Tender's practices. 

Whereas the first season gave Myha'la, Marisa Abela, David Jonsson, and Harry Lawtey breakout roles, recent additions are predominantly from high-profile shows such as Mad Men, The Handmaid's Tale, Ted Lasso, and the aforementioned Stranger Things. Thankfully, it only takes a beat to shake off any distraction. Last year, Kit Harington proved he could shed the vestiges of Jon Snow as the gloriously named Sir Henry Muck, whose green-tech energy company Lumi quickly fell off a financial cliff after a disastrous IPO. Still, I long for a few more rising stars like Miriam Petche's scene-stealing Sweetpea Golightly, who I am thrilled to see is back in season four. 

Before delving into the new significant business player on the market, the premiere “PayPal Of Bukkake” (a line describing Tender's current reputation) checks in with Harper Stern (Myha'la), striding into an office with gilded portraits covering the walls, underscoring the upper-class figures pulling the strings. It has been just over a year since Harper got into business with opportunistic Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay), and the wheels have come off. “I'm really tired of dancing around the fact that I was promised a fund and given what feels like a separately managed account with claustrophobic levels of oversight.” Otto has since retired, but his fingerprints remain on the shorts fund Harper is supposed to be managing.

Industry is not one for spoon-feeding plot or pausing to explain the technical jargon fired at machine-gun speed. Thankfully, you don't need to be fluent in banking vernacular to understand that Harper is pushed into a corner when investors start to pull their capital. Her lack of control leads her to press the nuclear option: an “emergency gate” on the fund. Even though Harper's short is working, sending a late-night client-wide email announcing that outflows from the fund are temporarily prohibited doesn't do her any favors. 

Rather than building to a confrontation with Otto later this season, Industry goes straight for the jugular, confidently opening with an irreparable rupture. In fact, the first episode back is a reset within a reset that places Harper closer to the heart of the action as she sets her sights on “adult content player” Siren, only to have her gaze drawn by FinDigest journalist Jim to the bigger target, Tender. The timing is impeccable as Harper has just slept with Tender co-founder Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella). 

While Harper was sidelined for a portion of the third season because she lacked overlap with the majority of the cast, this is far from the case in the premiere, which sees her as the needle threading old to new in her interactions with Whitney at a Yasmin-hosted soirée. The dinner party emphasizes Whitney's desire to schmooze with the right people. He refers to Yas as a dear friend, but has yet to meet Henry, which reads as a red flag. 

Minghella plays Whitney as controlled but slippery. Even a brief outburst at the office when he knocks over a chair is demonstrative. On the surface, Whitney's image is far cleaner and less crass than that of co-founder and Tender CEO Jonah Atterbury (Kal Penn). However, Whitney barking orders at his assistant, Haley, to pick up the chair, demonstrates that he wears a mask of an HR-compliant boss trying to save the company from Jonah's bad behavior. Everything is calculated: Whitney fancies himself a market leader, and his late-stage capitalism rant underscores his vision for Tender 2.0 that Jonah is blocking. Jonah's dismissal at the end of the premiere is another example of business trumping long-standing relationships while striving for a bigger piece of the pie.

As Industry has moved forward, the focus has shifted far beyond the trading floor, with government and journalism emerging as major players in depicting this sector, with the upper echelon pulling their strings. In doing so, the creative team continues to draw on the British and American regulatory and political landscapes to reflect the real world: Labour is in power, the right-wing Reform party has representation in Parliament, and Donald Trump is president again.

The latter isn't mentioned explicitly by name (other than “47”), but does make an appearance on the golf course, playing too slowly on the next hole for the still-retired Eric (Ken Leung) and his group of wealthy old white men. Is this too much reality seeping into the series? I'm not sure we needed a visual this obvious when Harper's confrontation with Otto says it all. Otto smugly announces to Harper that he has been anointed by the King in the House Of Lords and no longer has to watch his language because “woke shit no longer moves the needle in this new world.” While he doesn't use the words “DEI hire” when dismissing his need for a woman like Harper in 2026, she reads between the lines. (“You wanted to hire a puppet in Blackface so you could continue to be a crook.”) All this does is add fuel to Harper's fire, who calls her mentor, nemesis, and soon-to-be partner Eric.   

Considering everything that has gone down between Eric and Harper, I am not expecting an easy road ahead. Nor do I want it to be friction-free. However, there is something heartening about the way they hash out terms in person, with Myha'la and Leung firing on all emotional cylinders. “I can't be a punching bag for another man's fear,” she tells him. In the past, they have brought out the worst in each other, but reviving their mutual respect during this face-to-face conversation is a turning point. Of course, neither of them is content with their current circumstances. Eric can't help but philosophize about the inertia of experiencing heaven on earth, and Harper is in hedge-fund hell. Is it enough to make their venture a success? For now, yes. “It's really funny how honest communication can feel like a fucking exorcism,” Harper says. Still, I cannot wait to see the inevitable fireworks go off. Now that is a bet I am willing to make.

The singer-songwriter opened up about rejection and "redirection" in a candid speech.

KPop Demon Hunters isn't done changing culture just yet.


	On Sunday (Jan. 11) night at the 2026 Golden Globes, the film's signature smash “Golden” became the first K-pop song to win the Golden Globes for best original song, motion picture. Performed by HUNTR/X (EJAE, Audrey Nuna & REI AMI) with music by Joong Gyu Kwak, Yu Han Lee, Hee Dong Nam, Jeong Hoon Seo and Park Hong Jun and lyrics by Kim Eun-Jae (EJAE) and Mark Sonnenblick, “Golden” won the Golden Globe for its aforementioned songwriters.


	In her teary acceptance speech, EJAE (Kim Eun-Jae) opened up about rejection, “redirection” and finding her purpose. EJAE said she worked “tirelessly for 10 years” as a young girl to become a K-pop idol, but was “rejected and disappointed” when she was eventually told her “voice wasn't good enough.”

	“So I leaned on song and music to get through it and now I'm here as a singer-songwriter,” she continued. “It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone of all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.”


	EJAE added, “This award goes to people who had doors closed on them. I can confidently say rejection is redirection. It's never too late to shine like you were born to be.”


	“Golden” became one of the biggest surprise hits of 2025, topping the Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks. Toward the end of 2025, the singers of HUNTR/X talked to Billboard about their pinch-me moments of their breakout year.

Nikki Glaser kicked off the 83rd Golden Globes tonight by sort of addressing the various elephants in the room that is the United States in January 2026: “Yes, the Golden Globes — without a doubt the most important thing that's happening in the world right now.” While of course she didn't address everything going on—there would simply not be time for that—she did take some shots at the Trump administration and at CBS, which airs the ceremony. 

After starting the bidding for Warner Bros. at $5, Glaser joked that many of the people in the room were sex criminals. “There are so many A-listers here, and by A-listers I do mean people that are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” Glaser quipped before taking aim at the Justice Department. “Yes, and the Golden Globe for Best Editing goes to the Justice Department.” (Of course, there's no Golden Globe for Best Editing—how silly!) 

The jokes with perhaps the most teeth, however, came at the expense of CBS, the network airing the show. “The award for most editing goes to CBS News,” said Glaser. “Yes, CBS News: America's newest place to see BS news. We needed another!” Glaser also offered a pretty good bit about not actually knowing anything about Leonardo DiCaprio other than the fact that all his girlfriends are in their 20s and called the Wicked sequel Wicked: For Money. Check out her full monologue below.

Nikki Glaser returned to the Golden Globes stage with the confidence of someone who knows exactly how much trouble she can get away with, and then nudged just past it in another scathing monologue. Hosting the Golden Globe Awards for the second year in a row, Glaser opened the 83rd ceremony with a speech that blended industry gallows humor, political commentary, and her celebrity roast bonafides for an especially strong start to the celebration. 

She kicked things off by nodding to Hollywood's ongoing corporate anxiety, pretending to auction off Warner Bros. for spare change. “We'll start the bidding for Warner Bros. at five dollars,” she said, before adding, “Do I hear five dollars?” The joke landed as both a laugh line and a quiet acknowledgment of how unstable even the biggest entertainment players are right now. From there, she pivoted into even darker territory, invoking the Epstein files while scanning the crowd.

“I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight,” Glaser said. “There's so many A-listers — and by A-listers, I mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted.” The host followed it up with one of the night's biggest applause lines: “And the Golden Globe for Best Editing goes to… the Justice Department.” Not content to stop there, she added, “And the award for most editing goes to CBS News. Yes. CBS News: America's newest place to ‘See B.S. News.'”

 










Glaser's celebrity-themed jabs were equally pointed. Addressing “One Battle After Another” star Leonardo DiCaprio, Glaser praised his career before landing on the inevitable age-gap joke: “The most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.” She undercut herself, adding, “Leo, I'm sorry I made that joke. It is cheap. I tried not to, but we don't know anything else about you, man. There's nothing else. Open up!”

Elsewhere, part-time coffee salesman George Clooney gamely played along as Glaser asked him, deadpan, “My Nespressos keep coming out watery. Do you think it might be the filter?” And Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart were dubbed Glaser's “favorite comedy duo,” before she clarified: “You guys are like Steve Martin and Martin Short for people under 50 IQ.”

She poked fun at Martin and Short, too, quipping the “Only Murders in the Building” stars are living proof that “You are never too old to still need money!” Glaser also took aim at prestige TV, calling the latest season of “The White Lotus” “the first hit show to feature incest since ‘The Property Brothers.'”

Ruthless but self-aware, topical but not smug, Glaser completely delivered. It's obvious why she was invited back so quickly after her 2025 hosting debut, and in a year when awards shows are still fighting to feel relevant, she set the stage with messy fun — without pretending everything was just fine.

The actor-musician won for her celebrated role in One Battle After Another.

	Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another went into the 2026 Golden Globes as a favorite: it received nine nods, the most of any film nominated this year. But Teyana Taylor's win was far from a foregone conclusion. When it was revealed that the actor-musical artist had won her first Golden Globe — best performance by a female actor in a supporting role in any motion picture — on Sunday (Jan. 11) night, she was beside herself.

	“I almost didn't write a speech because I didn't think I'd win,” Taylor said, crying and even shaking a bit as she began her acceptance remarks. “My babies are upstairs watching – y'all better be off those damn phones and watching right now,” she joked.


	As her co-stars (and many others) gave her a standing ovation, Taylor thanked her director, calling him “Paul ‘Let Him Cook' Anderson” and thanking him for his “vision” of One Battle After Another, which he also co-wrote.


	After thanking her family, co-stars and team, she added an impactful message. “Last, but most importantly, to my Brown sisters and little Brown girls watching tonight. Our softness is not a liability. Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter and our dreams deserve space.”

	











	Taylor released her latest solo album, Escape Room, last fall. She told Billboard all about her new album in an episode of Takes Us Out.

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	With everyone anticipating Donald Trump‘s whims seemingly every second of his second term, the former Apprentice host just brought his thumb down hard on the scale of the bids to buy Warner Bros. – and it may have made David Ellison‘s day.


	Earlier Sunday, as Hollywood put on the spanx to fit into the frocks and tuxes for the 83rd Golden Globes, Trump retweeted a very unambitious One America News commentary decrying Netflix‘s currently WBD board approved $83 billion effort to buy Warner Bros' streaming and studio assets.


	Proclaiming “Stop The Netflix Cultural Takeover,” the December 12 opinion piece from John M. Pierce insists “the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission should treat this merger as a top-tier antitrust priority — not only for its market implications, but for what it means for free expression and America's cultural pluralism.” The missive from the MAGA lawyer, who has represented January 6 insurrectionists in the past, adds: “Netflix should compete, not conquer. And the United States has a responsibility to ensure that no corporation can dominate the national imagination through raw market power and ideological activism.

	











	Calling the Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters-run streamer a company “that has repeatedly used its global platform to elevate progressive narratives while suppressing dissenting viewpoints,” Pierce argues in favor of Paramount‘s still rebuffed $108 billion hostile takeover offer. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“It is time to say no to a woke media monopoly before the damage becomes impossible to reverse,” Pierce concludes, urging self-declared Ellison pal Trump and his crew to step in against Netflix.


	Meeting with “great person” Sarandos late last year, Trump has repeatedly expressed concern there “could be a problem” with the “huge market share” Netflix has, and will have even more of it if it has HBO Max and other WB assets in hand. Maintaining that a NetBros combo is “presumptively unlawful” in a letter to DC lawmakers last week, Ellison and Paramount are stepping up the pressure by going straight to shareholders and investors before its self-set January 21 deadline of take the money and run.

	











	To that, in the coming days, Paramount will be turning up the volume on its long-held contention that it will face far less regulatory hoops to jump through than Netflix.


	Looking at the deep and close relationship between the 79-year-old Trump and 81-year-old (and presently the fifth richest person on Earth) Larry Ellison, it has been assumed by all sides except the stock- suffering Sarandos and Peters that the man in the White House would at one point grease the wheels for his buddy and his son. Of course, Trump being Trump, the president has also complained that CBS has treated him even worse since Ellison took over last summer.


	Just days after Trump whined, CBS News Editor-in-chief Bari Weiss axed an already greenlit and promoted- 60 Minutes segment on the administration's harsh deportation of migrants to a violent El Salvador prison. Having defended her pre-Christmas action in the weeks since, Weiss killed the piece because she suddenly felt it needed to be “comprehensive and fair” and include already sought out voices from the White House and/or DHS. The since widely-praised segment made it to air on the edition of 60 Minutes that airs in Canada, but has yet to see the light of Sunday in the USA.


	Neither the White House, nor Paramount or Netflix responded to Deadline's request Sunday for comment on POTUS' online stance about who should own WB.

Hate to say, but agreed.

If Donald Trump ends up saving theaters I'm gonna flip.

If you think Trump wants to save Movie theaters, I have a bridge to sell you.

The DOJ and Trump need to stay out of this deal completely.

Of course Mr. Trump does not want Netflix to buy Warner. It does not take a Rocket Scientist to figure this one out….

Of course Mr. Trump is not agreeing to Netflex buying Warner! I does not take a Rocket Scientist to figure this one out….

The music world is mourning founding Grateful Dead member Bob Weir. Don Was, Weir's bandmate in Wolf Bros since 2018, wrote, “Night after night, he taught us how to approach music with fearlessness and unbridled soul—pushing us beyond what we thought was musically possible. Every show was a transcendent adventure into the unknown.”

Bruce Hornsby, who toured with the Dead during the late '80s and early '90s, paid tribute to Weir on Facebook. “Always a warm, jovial presence, but with a mischievous look in his eye, he was ready with banter, a quip, a wise-guy crack or bon mot most all the time,” Hornsby wrote. “I love you, Bob, and will always fondly remember our many moments, so often transcendent, throwing chords and notes around in space, through the air, together.”

Bravo host and noted Deadhead Andy Cohen said on Instagram, “Bob Weir wasn't The Other One, he was That Guy. I feel SO BLESSED to have gotten to know Bob and the equally wondrous Weir family through my friendship with John. He came on [Watch What Happens Live] a few times and when he talked about Jerry's passing he referred to it as “checkin' out”. That felt so graceful a way to put it, and a testament to the fluidity of all us in this world. Bob checked out but his music is going to live gloriously forever, and so will he. One of the absolute coolest and best to ever do it.”

Phish's Trey Anastasio penned a lengthy tribute to Weir:

Sad to hear that my friend Bobby has passed on. This one really hurts. I really loved him. He was a sweet, kind, gentle friend, and I never believed this would happen so soon.

I knew Bobby for many years, but it was in the lead-up to Fare Thee Well that we really became close. I went out to his beach house, and we spent three nights there alone, just the two of us: playing guitar, cooking scrambled eggs, listening to records, working out, talking, and walking on the beach.  We went out to dinner together, and he let me drive his new car. That was also when I first met Tascha, whom I love so much. Tascha, my heart is with you, Monet and Chloe today.

Bobby told me incredible stories about his life during those days at the beach house. He told me how he was still in high school when the first acid test happened. When it was over, the sun came out, and he had to do his math homework as he raced back to school on the train. He said after the second or third acid test, he looked down at his homework and said, “Nah.” And that was it. The rest of his life was on the road, in the Grateful Dead and other bands.

He told me stories about working on those classic Dead songs, what music the band was listening to as the songs were coming together. He said that when they were learning “Uncle John's Band,” they were listening to the first CSN album and trying to harmonize like them. When they were learning “Help on the Way,” they were trying to sound like the Mahavishnu Orchestra. I found all of that endlessly fascinating.

Bobby was completely allergic to compliments in the most endearing way. I'd say, “Man, that guitar riff you were doing on that song sounded really killer” and he'd respond, “Well, I'm sure I'll fuck it up next time.” I loved that about him.

Weir's Dead & Company bandmate John Mayer posted, “Okay Bob. I'll do it your way. Fkn' A… Thanks for letting me ride alongside you. It sure was a pleasure. If you say it's not the end, then I'll believe you. I'll meet you in the music. Come find me anytime.”

“We lost a champion today,” Primus' Les Claypool posted to Instagram, alongside a photo of himself and Weir on stage together. “Bob Weir, one of the nicest humans Ive ever met in the music world. A legend on many levels.”

“This guy was such a hero,” Heart's Nancy Wilson wrote. “The world is a sadder place without him in it. He spread a life time of magic around and always had that twinkle of good nature in his eyes. His good vibrations will never end. He gave such a gift to us all.

Mickey Hart said his bandmate “was a little brother to me for almost sixty years,” adding, “He was my first friend in the Grateful Dead. We lived together, played together, and made music together that ended up changing the world. Bob had the ability to play unique chords that few others could. Long fingers, that's the difference. Jerry once told me that the harmonics Bob created became an inspiration for his own solos. When all of us were entrained, rhythm section, guitars, and voices... it was transcendent. What was a lifetime of adventure boils down to something simple—we were family and true to the music through it all.”

Brandi Carlile shared, “Tonight I'm thinking about all our friends in music young and old and how @bobweir had time for all of us… he came to our shows, helped us write songs and got so many of us out on stage to jam and just stand in his light. What a nurturing way-paving soul…”

Margo Price described Weir as “a sage—a profoundly wise, musical guru who taught me so much about songs, art, melody, meditation and being in the moment. He was unlike most rock stars in that he was unpretentious, deep and rooted in knowing who he was. Bobby vibrated with magic. He was both ancient and young—he always had a twinkle in his eye. Like a barefoot philosopher or the Lorax, he was mystical. He spoke for the trees.”

Willie Nelson's son Micah Nelson—who records music as Particle Kid—compared Weir to “an imaginary character from some ancient cartoon, both fictional and hyper-real, a mystical song wizard, chiseled into reality rock…. ageless, like clouds or music or mountains…”

Billy Strings wrote, “I've never knew a person so in tune with the cosmos. Who was so mystical and smart and mysterious, alluring and radiant. He was a star wrangler .. a celestial skysage who traded fear for wonder. Now he is riding the northern lights and skipping barefoot between the constellations…”

Former Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder said, “I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship. I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on “Rock You” from American Rock and Roll. Until we meet again, amigo.​​​​​​​​”

Michael Franti wrote, “We shared the stage many times and he was always eager, wildly curious, and ready to try anything. The first time we played together was at a Peace Concert my team put on after the events of 9 11. We were joined by Flea on bass and Woody Harrelson on vocals. Bobby looked like a kid in a candy store playing with such a wonderfully odd crew. I could not believe that a true giant in music made time to stand in a park with a few hundred people and help us send a musical message of peace.

“Bob Weir was a true son of California who helped create the soundtrack of a generation,” California Governor Gavin Newsom posted on X. “He was — and will always be — a king of psychedelic rock. Bob will be deeply missed, and his music will forever live on.”

Elsewhere, Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo quoted the lyrics to the Grateful Dead's “Sugar Magnolia”; Sean Ono Lennon said “It was a great pleasure and a privilege to know you, brother”; “God bless Bob Weir,” declared Billy Corgan; Slash posted ” RIP #BobWeir 💔”; the Empire State Building was lit up in tie-dye; and Bob Dylan shared a photo of himself onstage with the Dead, flanked by Weir and Jerry Garcia.

      Sharing a collection of compelling UFO photographs capturing unexplained aerial phenomena from around the world. From glowing orbs to mysterious craft, these images spark curiosity and debate. Whether you're a skeptic or believer, these photos will leave you questioning what's really out there.
    


      The collection features a range of images. Some show strange lights in the sky, while others capture more defined shapes that defy explanation. Take a look and decide for yourself,  are these signs of extraterrestrial activity, or can they be explained by natural phenomena?
    


      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and debated cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging.
    


Credibility: The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and there's a documentary on YouTube detailing the children's consistent testimonies.
    


Quotes: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out."



Description: A Japanese pilot and his crew had a multi-hour encounter with a UFO that was also tracked by ground radar.
    


Credibility: The pilot's career was ended for speaking out, adding weight to his testimony.
    


Quotes: "JAL Flight 1628. This imo was just incredible. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well."



Description: Military personnel at a US Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in the forest.
    


Credibility: Multiple military witnesses, including a base commander, provided consistent accounts.
    


Quotes: "Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO."



Description: Thousands of people in Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights.
    


Credibility: The sheer number of witnesses and the consistency of their descriptions make this case compelling.
    


Quotes: "I was right under The Phoenix Lights, in fact I saw it mostly horizontally as I was on a hill and it was very low in the sky."



Description: US Navy pilots encountered a "tic tac" shaped UFO that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability.
    


Credibility: The incident was captured on FLIR footage and corroborated by multiple pilot testimonies.
    


Quotes: "For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs."



Description: Iranian military pilots attempted to intercept a UFO that caused their equipment to malfunction.
    


Credibility: Radar tracking and multiple military witnesses provide strong evidence.
    


Quotes: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO."



Description: Multiple witnesses in Nova Scotia, Canada, saw a large object crash into the water, followed by a military investigation.
    


Credibility: The incident was investigated by the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
    


Quotes: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident"



Description: A supposed crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico, which the government claimed was a weather balloon.
    


Credibility: Numerous eyewitness testimonies and the military's initial response suggest something more than a balloon.
    


Quotes: "I know it'll probably get me downvoted, but I'd say Roswell. We know an event took place. The military response proves that."



Description: Multiple UFOs were tracked on radar and seen by pilots and ground personnel over the nation's capital.
    


Credibility: The incident was confirmed by radar and multiple credible witnesses.
    


Quotes: "I say the best case would be the DC 1952 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident"



      While these sightings are among the most compelling, they still generate significant debate and skepticism. For more in-depth discussions and personal experiences, consider visiting these subreddits:

A home-grown, independent supernatural thriller that got a second life thanks in part to “Mystery Science Theater 3000” is about to claw its way into Mobile's Crescent Theater.

Fighting Owl Films recently released a trailer for “Demon Squad: Tooth and Claw” that features plenty of Mobile scenery. The filmmakers and the venue have announced a “special screening” for the sequel. 

“Demon Squad” is an ultra-low-budget supernatural noir filmed in Mobile: In it, Khristian Fulmer plays detective Nick Moon, who investigates a spooky threat with the help of a skeptical assistant (Erin Lilley) and a femme fatale (Leah Christine Johnson).

Initially released in 2019, “Demon Squad” got an unexpected round of exposure when the makers of the long-running sci-fi franchise made it a pick for their 13th season. That meant that in summer 2022, the flick would undergo a satirical vivisection by MST3K's host characters, but also that it would be seen by a huge group of new viewers.

That exposure, in turn, helped a crowdfunding effort to underwrite a sequel, with $30,000 in pledges. By spring 2024, core members of the Fighting Owl crew – including director and co-writer Thomas Smith, co-writer and actress Erin Lilley Smith, Fulmer and director of photography Kris Skoda – were at work filming “Tooth and Claw” in places like the Mobile Carnival Museum.

The trailer released in early January shows Moon on the trail of a supernatural menace, with the help of some allies just as dubious as the ones who helped him along in the first film. Accompanying information says that a bloodthirsty werewolf is on the loose, but as Moon investigates the killings he uncovers a dangerous conspiracy. 

In a November Facebook post, Fighting Owl Films notified fans that post-production work was finished and that distribution “is being figure out.” No release plans have been revealed, but the original score has been released. In early December, Fighting Owl notified Kickstarter.com backers that they could access digital downloads.

“Demon Squad: Tooth and Claw” will be shown at 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 27, at the Crescent Theater, 208 Dauphin St. Advance tickets can be ordered online and are $15, or $20.51 including fees and taxes.

BERLIN — Erich von Däniken, the Swiss author whose best-selling books about the extraterrestrial origins of ancient civilizations brought him fame among paranormal enthusiasts and scorn from the scientific community, has died. He was 90.

On Sunday, Von Däniken's representatives announced on his website that he had died the previous day in a hospital in central Switzerland.

Von Däniken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book, “Chariots of the Gods?,” in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids.

The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when, thanks to conventional science, humans were about to take their first steps on the Moon.

“Chariots of the Gods?” was followed by more than two dozen similar books, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence.

Public broadcaster SRF reported that Von Däniken's books had sold  almost 70 million copies in more than 30 languages, making him one of the most widely read Swiss authors.

While Von Däniken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin.

Born in 1935, the son of a clothing manufacturer in the northern Swiss town of Schaffhausen, Von Däniken is said to have rebelled against his father's strict Catholicism and the priests who instructed him at boarding school by developing his own alternatives to the biblical account of the origins of life.

After leaving school in 1954, Von Däniken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison.

In 1964, he was appointed manager of a hotel in the exclusive resort town of Davos and began writing his first book. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars.

By the time he left prison, “Chariots of the Gods?” was earning Von Däniken a fortune and a second book, “Gods from Outer Space,” was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover.

“Chariots of the Gods?” was made into a film in 1970 and was a huge box-office success, especially at drive-ins in the United States. It also received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature, despite criticism of its pseudoscience and largely unsubstantiated claims about “ancient astronauts.” 

Throughout the 1970s, Von Däniken undertook countless field trips to Egypt, India, and above all, Latin America, whose ancient cultures held a particular fascination for the amateur archaeologist.

He lectured widely and set up societies devoted to promoting his theories, later pioneering the use of video and multimedia to reach out to ever-larger audiences hungry for a different account of history.

No amount of criticism dissuaded him and his fans from believing that Earth has been visited repeatedly by beings from Outer Space, and will be again in the future.

Von Däniken gained the damning accolade of being the first recipient of the “Ig Nobel” prize for literature in 1991 — for raising the public awareness of science through questionable experiments or claims.

 World & Nation 

A researcher who studied fingernail growth and a group that explored whether painting zebra-like stripes on cows reduced fly bites are among the winners of this year's Ig Nobels.

Even when confronted with fabricated evidence in a British television documentary — supposedly ancient pots were shown to be almost new — Von Däniken insisted that, minor discrepancies aside, his theories were essentially sound.

In 1985, Von Däniken wrote “Neue Erinnerungen an die Zukunft” — “New Memories of the Future” — ostensibly to address his many critics: “I have admitted [my mistakes], but not one of the foundations of my theories has yet been brought down.”

Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, Von Däniken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including “In Search of …” and “The X-Files,” which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries, as well as the long-running cable series “Ancient Aliens.”

In 1998, Von Däniken revisited the subject in the book “Arrival of the Gods,” focusing on Peru's mysterious Nazca lines. “‘Arrival of the Gods' is a grotesque parody of scientific inquiry devoid of any intellectual credibility or literary merit whatsoever,” wrote British anthropologist and UC Santa Barbara professor Brian Fagan in a review for The Times. “The book is typical of the genre, with its haphazard and uncritical use of an astonishing range of sources from all parts of the world in order to fashion an implausible jigsaw puzzle the author claims is science.”

Von Däniken's last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest. The “Mystery Park” still stands, its man-made pyramids and otherworldly domes rotting as tourists prefer to explore the charms of the nearby town of Interlaken and the imposing Swiss Alps that surround it.

Erich von Däniken is survived by his wife of 65 years, Elisabeth Skaja; a daughter, Cornelia; and two grandchildren.

      When it comes to the most convincing UFO sightings ever reported, opinions on Reddit are varied and passionate. Here are some of the most frequently mentioned and debated cases:
    


Description: Over 60 children in Ruwa, Zimbabwe, witnessed a craft landing in their schoolyard and several beings emerging.
    


Credibility: The incident was investigated by a well-known psychologist, and there's a documentary on YouTube detailing the children's consistent testimonies.
    


Quotes: "The Ariel school incident in Africa is my favourite. Surprised it hasn't been mentioned. 60 plus children apparently witnessed a craft landing in the schoolyard and a few beings came out."



Description: A Japanese pilot and his crew had a multi-hour encounter with a UFO that was also tracked by ground radar.
    


Credibility: The pilot's career was ended for speaking out, adding weight to his testimony.
    


Quotes: "JAL Flight 1628. This imo was just incredible. What the pilot and co-pilot saw that day was also being tracked by ground radar as well."



Description: Military personnel at a US Air Force base in England reported seeing strange lights and a craft in the forest.
    


Credibility: Multiple military witnesses, including a base commander, provided consistent accounts.
    


Quotes: "Rendelsham Forest or Shag Harbour. When it comes to Rendelsham, I am confident in thinking a crew of military men as they were would not have mistaken a light house for a UFO."



Description: Thousands of people in Arizona, including the governor, witnessed a massive V-shaped formation of lights.
    


Credibility: The sheer number of witnesses and the consistency of their descriptions make this case compelling.
    


Quotes: "I was right under The Phoenix Lights, in fact I saw it mostly horizontally as I was on a hill and it was very low in the sky."



Description: US Navy pilots encountered a "tic tac" shaped UFO that displayed incredible speed and maneuverability.
    


Credibility: The incident was captured on FLIR footage and corroborated by multiple pilot testimonies.
    


Quotes: "For me, it's the eyewitness testimony of David Fraver, the fighter pilot who described his interactions with the 'tic tac' ufo off the coast of California during his training runs."



Description: Iranian military pilots attempted to intercept a UFO that caused their equipment to malfunction.
    


Credibility: Radar tracking and multiple military witnesses provide strong evidence.
    


Quotes: "1976 Tehran UFO incident: Nothing beats this one. Military personals, radars and civilian plane encountered the UFO."



Description: Multiple witnesses in Nova Scotia, Canada, saw a large object crash into the water, followed by a military investigation.

Quotes: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shag_Harbour_UFO_incident"



Description: A supposed crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft in Roswell, New Mexico, which the government claimed was a weather balloon.
    


Credibility: Numerous eyewitness testimonies and the military's initial response suggest something more than a balloon.
    


Quotes: "I know it'll probably get me downvoted, but I'd say Roswell. We know an event took place. The military response proves that."



Description: Multiple UFOs were tracked on radar and seen by pilots and ground personnel over the nation's capital.
    


Credibility: The incident was confirmed by radar and multiple credible witnesses.
    


Quotes: "I say the best case would be the DC 1952 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_Washington,_D.C._UFO_incident"



      While these sightings are among the most compelling, they still generate significant debate and skepticism. For more in-depth discussions and personal experiences, consider visiting these subreddits:

Chris Bledsoe has quite the story to tell. He's become a best-selling author on Amazon for his book titled "UFO of God." Chris tells his story in the book about his UFO experience and the way it completely changed his life. He's become well known in the paranormal and spiritual community. He says he experiences visitations from orbs nearly every night, often filming them and sharing the mysterious videos.

It all started for Chris in 2007, when he was on a fishing trip along the Cape Fear River with his son and some colleagues. He witnessed multiple orbs and experienced loss of time. He's been experiencing a strange phenomenon ever since. He believes the UFOs are spiritual beings and claims to have had visions and experiences with entities.

He's been featured on podcasts, and he is well known and respected in the paranormal community, and even in government circles. He's said he's worked with NASA to understand the UAP phenomenon.

Chris Bledsoe has also been featured on News Nation episodes with Russ Coulthart, the Shawn Ryan show, and many others.

He's the headliner at the 2026 Contact Modalities XPO in May. It's a weekend event where attendees can learn techniques aimed at facilitating communication and connection with non-physical entities "beyond the veil." Using spiritual, psychological, and scientific approaches, people can broaden their human awareness and perception.

Chris will be doing skywatch all three nights of the event. Groups of people gather with positive intentions and energy and look to the sky. Sometimes hundreds of orbs appear in the sky, often changing colors or flashing.

The Contact Modalities event takes place May 1- 3rd in Devan, Wisconsin. Tickets and more information are available online at contactmodalitiesxpo.com.

The Netflix goliath may have finally reached its conclusion, but there are still plenty of similarly addictive series out there to binge your way through

After nine years, five seasons and plenty of intrigue (not to mention lashings of gore and gallons of spilled blood), Stranger Things has finally closed the door on the Upside Down.

The Duffer Brothers' '80s-based sci-fi epic, which made household names of its cast including Millie Bobby Brown and Natalia Dyer, came to its hotly anticipated conclusion earlier this month. While the two hour finale received mixed reviews (and has even prompted conspiracy theories that there may be a ‘secret' new episode on the way from Netflix), the powerhouse performances from its actors, in addition to the rich mystery and mythology that propelled the plot forward, has resulted in Stranger Things' end leaving a distinct and gaping hole in our bingeing schedules.

However, fear not – there are many Mind Flayer-flavoured series to delve in to now Hawkins is no longer at threat. While these series may not have reached the same universal heights of success as Stranger Things did, they are no less compelling – you may well find your new favourite series to spool through during these bleak winter evenings…

Another series based on a comic book (written by none other than rockstar Gerard Way from emo godfathers My Chemical Romance), The Umbrella Academy is an offbeat treat for those who enjoy mind-mangling plots and glib, snappy dialogue.

The series is set in an alternative universe where 43 children are born simultaneously to women who had previously shown no signs of being pregnant until their labour began. Seven are adopted by an eccentric billionaire who decides to use mould them into the ultimate superhero team after discovering they have powers. Fast-forward to the present day, and the ‘siblings' are fractured – reunited only when one returns from the future and warns of an impending global apocalypse. 

Initially a huge hit for Netflix, the first season attracted more than 45 million viewers (likely aided by its impressive cast, including Elliot Page, Tom Hopper and Robert Sheehan) – but its final season attracted more mixed reviews. The second season of The Umbrella Academy is by far the best; the group find themselves scattered across 1960s Dallas, minutes before a nuclear doomsday inextricably linked to the assassination of JFK (we told you it's offbeat).

The distinctly Stranger Things flavour here in this is not accidental; this teen tale comes from the producers behind the huge sci-fi smash. 

Based on Charles Forsman's graphic novel of the same name (some may recognise his work from cult Channel 4 series The End of the F***ing World), I Am Not Okay With This follows teenager Sydney Novak, who is grappling with the deep trauma of her father's suicide alongside the general angst of growing up.

Feeling increasingly abandoned by her best friend Dina, who now has a perfectly punchable jock boyfriend, and distant from her aloof mother who has started working more shifts to make ends meet, Sydney is understandably a tornado of emotions with no real outlet. That is, until her emotional turmoil spills over and manifests as telekinetic powers (comparisons to Stranger Things' Eleven are invited). 

While I Am Not Okay With This doesn't reach the same dark depths tonally as the earlier series of Stranger Things, nor does it feature any of the epic battles with supernatural abominations of the latter seasons, it's slightly more adult when it comes to handling difficult themes such as grief and identity. It's thanks to Sophia Lillis's beautiful portrayal of her complex character that this is the case (you might recognise her from All Her Fault); viewers will want to both hug her and smack her simultaneously as she contends with horrific trauma alongside the difficult mundanity of puberty.

The series is sadly only a tight seven episodes – I Am Not Okay With This was tragically a victim of the pandemic, and shelved after its 2020 release due to budgeting constraints. It's a real shame; it had all the potential to be Stranger Things' natural successor, but is still well worth a watch.

While Stranger Things had huge success, quickly becoming one of the world's most popular TV series (and rightly so), some criticism of the series is that its tone (particularly in the later series) becomes too childlike and Marvel-esque. German-language whodunnit Dark has often been touted as a more adult version of Stranger Things, and it's clear to see similarities between the two; both set in the '80s, both focusing on a disappearance, and both exploring the role of a secretive government facility in a small town. However, Dark is very secure in taking a more adult tone; in its opening few scenes, viewers witness a suicide and a teenager rootling around for drugs before it confidently plunges into its supernatural themes. It's a slow burn, but one with a deeply satisfying conclusion.

Arguably the blueprint for Stranger Things, David Lynch's small-screen outing faced renewed interest and adoration following the tragic passing of the director last year. The death of homecoming queen Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks (the Hawkins of its day) sees FBI Agent Dale Cooper (the much-loved Kyle MacLachlan) investigating the sleepy and idyllic town. However, the case gets increasingly surreal the more Cooper uncovers. In typical Lynchian style, Palmer's death is an infinitely deep mystery that only gets stranger as the series progresses, with the grief of this small town spiderwebbing beyond its picket-fence borders.

Described by The Guardian as “Stranger Things meets The Missing meets Twin Peaks meets Glee meets Westworld”, this genre-bending series was a hit for Netflix upon its 2016 release. Brit Marling plays Prarie Johnson, a blind young woman who returns after missing for seven years with scars on her back and her sight restored. Now calling herself ‘the OA' (which stands of ‘Original Angel', Prarie tells four high school students and a teacher that she was actually captured by a scientist and subjected to study near death experiences as a bid to study other dimensions (though, thankfully, none as terrifying as The Upside Down).

While some of the lines of dialogue are cringe-inducing, The OA is a hugely ambitious and deeply fascinating premise exploring ethics, consciousness and alternative realties. Initially intended to have a seven series run, The OA was cancelled after season two – leaving a cliffhanger ending. That doesn't mean it should be disregarded; the series has a cult following (some of which who are still desperately campaigning for the show to be revived).

Dual narratives are at the heart of this horror series that deserved far more fanfare when it was first released on Netflix in 2022. In the present-day, film archivist Dan Turner has been hired by unsettling businessman Virgil Davenport to restore some fire-damaged videotapes from 1994. The tapes tell the story of documentary filmmaker Melody Pendras, who was investigating a supposed cult at the Visser apartment building. Melody's story is told to the audience through Blair Witch Project-style found footage, giving Archive 81 a distinctly creepy tone. Dan, who must work from an isolated compound in order to earn his substantial fee, quickly sees parallels between himself and Melody – and quickly descends into obsession with her story.

The pacy eight-part series offers viewers lashings of supernatural intrigue, complex conspiracies and plenty of jump-scares that will leave even the hardiest of hearts racing – the Mind Flayer has nothing on what lurks within Archive 81.

Receiving critical praise upon its release in 2021, those who are yet to sink their teeth into Yellowjackets are set to be enthralled. The series follows the headstrong teenagers of Wiskayok High School female football team, who find themselves stranded following a plane crash in 1996. The opening scenes set Yellowjacket's brazen and ferocious tone; viewers see a wintry landscape stained with blood, a body impaled and the primal screams of girls adorning animal skins. A typical coming-of-age drama this is not. 

Yellowjackets straddles the gory events of that time with the modern day, where the survivors, now middle-aged women, are still processing the trauma that they have kept under wraps for all these years, hiding the true extent of their ordeal from loved ones, the press and even themselves.

While it's more Lord of the Flies than Stranger Things, Yellowjackets is a fascinating exploration into the taboo. Never mind the supernatural; the series suggests that there is nothing more terrifying or horrific than humanity itself when pushed to the limits of survival. The much-anticipated fourth and final season is set to hit screens later this year.

With echoes of Stranger Things in its teenage cast and a period setting (the series is set in the 1990s and wants you to be aware of this), The Midnight Club is based in a hospice of terminally ill young people who come together at night to tell each other horror stories. The group also make a pact to try and communicate with one another from beyond the grave when their time comes. It's an unusual (but perfectly watchable) combination of a Black Mirror-style anthology, and bleak teen drama. 

The premise hardly makes The Midnight Club seem laugh-a-minute, but it is the unusual patchwork of characters and the dynamics between them that makes the show work. Viewers are initially lured into thinking the line-up of characters belong to the tired or cliched stereotypes of teen dramas (the idealist, the wise-cracker and the brain-box all feature), but as the series progresses, The Midnight Club asserts itself away from tired, schlocky tropes. Ruth Codd (who recently appeared in The Celebrity Traitor) is the series standout, as misanthropist, rebel-without-a-cause Anya.

It is a common situation: At a family party, an uncle or cousin starts talking about some wild conspiracy theory they picked up on an online chat group. Other family members roll their eyes, thinking, “Not again!” and a heated discussion commences. Psychological research has shown again and again that believing in conspiracy theories that are clearly not backed up by facts can do a lot of damage to relationships with family members and friends. This can go to the point where the person believing in conspiracy theories is simply not invited to future family meetings or parties. What is, however, largely unclear from a scientific point of view is to what extent believing in conspiracy theories can hurt the development of new relationships. For example, when online dating, posting conspiracy theories may drive away most people, but may also attract other people who share a belief in conspiracy theories.

A new study entitled “Conspiracy Theories and Online Dating: It's a (Mis)match!”, just published in the scientific journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, focused on investigating the consequences of positing conspiracy theories on online dating profiles (Green and co-workers, 2026). The research team, led by scientist Ricky Green from the School of Psychology at the University of Kent in the United Kingdom, conducted three different experiments on conspiracy theories and online dating.

In the first experiment (Experiment 1a and 1b), volunteers viewed online dating profiles that included beliefs supporting conspiracy theories or contradicting them, or that did not mention conspiracy theories at all (control group). The volunteers were also asked to rate the holders of the fake dating profiles across a number of psychological variables, including honesty, trustworthiness, sociability, intelligence, kindness, friendliness, respectability, and uniqueness.

In Experiment 2, volunteers viewed online dating profiles that included beliefs supporting conspiracy theories that were more or less plausible or did not mention conspiracy theories at all (control group). The volunteers were also asked to rate the holders of the fake dating profiles across the same psychological dimension as in Experiment 1.

In Experiment 3, the scientists created a mock dating app in which volunteers could indicate their interest in a profile by swiping. They were shown fake profiles that included beliefs in various conspiracy theories or did not mention conspiracy theories at all.

The results of Experiment 1a and 1b showed that people were less interested in dating other people who believed in conspiracy theories in comparison to people who did not believe in conspiracy theories or did not mention conspiracy theories at all. People who believed in conspiracy theories were rated as more unique, but less honest, trustworthy, sociable, intelligent, kind, friendly, and respected. Similar results were also found in Experiment 2 for the people who believed in an implausible conspiracy theory. In Experiment 3, analyses of volunteers' swiping behavior showed that, compared to a profile with no conspiracy theories, most profiles including conspiracy theories were less likely to be rated positively.

The results of the study were clear: Across all three experiments, posting conspiracy theories in an online dating profile had a strong negative effect on dating success. Thus, it is a bad idea to post about conspiracy theories on online dating platforms.

Lesner Cardenas studied to become a firefighter before his disappearance in May, 2025

REDDING, Calif. - The mystery of 21-year-old Lesner Cardenas' disappearance continues to baffle the community. Cardenas vanished after a car crash in Redding in May of 2025.

Police reported that following the crash, Cardenas went to his apartment on Trudie Trail in Redding. He then took a cab to the Wells Fargo bank, then took the cab to Avalanche Gulch in the Mount Shasta area, telling the driver he intended to hike.  Despite efforts by the Siskiyou County Search and Rescue team, Cardenas remains missing.

Lesner Cardenas disappeared in May 2025.

Lesner Cardenas was a wrestler at Simpson University and studied firefighting at Shasta College. Brian Kyncy, whose son was friends with Cardenas, shared insights into his disappearance.

Lesner Cardenas (right) studied firefighting at Shasta College. He was also a wrestler at Simpson University.

Kyncy said Cardenas was on a student visa from Honduras and described him as very naive. He speculated that Cardenas may have fled due to confusion or fear of deportation after the crash.

"The strange thing about it was you just got in a wreck, literally hours earlier, you get a cab to a bank. You grab your backpack from the apartment, change and get your fire boots on and your jeans and grab your backpack. Get a cab, get dropped off at the base of Mount Shasta. And you tell the cab driver that you've got to beat the guy to the top. In our minds, it's one of two things. He was either running scared, thinking that if he gets caught, he's getting exported or going to an El Salvador prison because of all the press. Or he had a traumatic brain injury and couldn't think right, and that's where it ends," Kyncy said.

Lesner Cardenas was studying in Redding at the time of his disappearance. His friend said he was on a student visa from Honduras.

Kyncy fears that Cardenas may have died on the mountain. Tragically, since Cardenas disappeared, his mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and passed away two months ago,  without knowing what happened to her son.

Kyncy said he wanted Cardenas to know that he is not in trouble with the law and immigration is not looking for him. Kyncy said he and some friends used 'find my phone' and followed Cardenas' cell phone to an apartment near Mt. Shasta. Kyncy said he knocked on the door of the residence, but no one there had information about Cardenas.

Cardenas is described as 5 feet 7 inches tall, weighing 145 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes.  He is listed as a missing person on the California Department of Justice website.  Anyone with information is urged to call the Redding Police Department at (530) 225-4200.

High school can be challenging enough, never mind having to attend classes you hate in the afterlife. But if you've been on the lookout for a great new show to binge, and could do with a teen-drama-meets-supernatural combo, you'll want to check out "School Spirits" on Paramount+.

Fans of Netflix's "Cobra Kai" series will recognize the main talent, Peyton List, who stars as Maddie Nears, a teen who wakes up one day as a ghost. Funny enough, she has zero recollection of how she actually died, unlike all the other students at Split River High School who have passed on. Taking matters into her own hands, Maddie begins investigating her mysterious death with the help of some fellow ghosts — and a handful of friends that haven't kicked the bucket yet.

Developed by Megan Trinrud and Nate Trinrud, "Spirits" premiered on Paramount+ on March 9, 2023, and was renewed for a second season that hit the platform on January 30, 2025. A third series is set to premiere on January 28, 2026. Additional cast members include Kristian Ventura, Milo Manheim, and Spencer McPherson, among other players.

The series puts Peyton's acting chops on full display, as she's forced to contend with her supernatural fate. Combining drama and thriller elements with a touch of comedy, "School Spirits" is the kind of show that wears multiple genre hats and manages to get each one to fit nicely — for the most part.

On Rotten Tomatoes, "School Spirits" earned a 91% on the Tomatometer, as well as a 92% score for users. On Metacritic, the series scored 69 out of 100 based on eight critic reviews.

Delivering a positive review for Variety, critic Daniel D'Addario said, "Without losing sight of the sorrow of Maddie's story, 'School Spirits' manages to be surprisingly sparky and fun—proof positive that there are new stories to tell about the institution no one would ever want to be stuck in for their entire afterlife."

Some critical reception was a bit more mixed. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Fienberg called the show "middling." He also claims that "Spirits" doesn't reinvent the wheel for the genre.

When Diana Ross met with new producers to begin work on her 11th studio album, the Motown legend knew it was time for a change. She released Diana in 1980, and the album's first single, “Upside Down”, gave new life to one of pop music's biggest stars.

The idea for the song began with Ross explaining to Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards that she wanted a reinvention. Blending R&B and disco, “Upside Down” transformed her solo career. And 45 years later, it delivers yet another comeback. This time, via the sci-fi Netflix series, Stranger Things.

Rodgers and Edwards wrote and produced the track. Rodgers said the title came from Ross. “She said that she just wanted to turn her whole career upside down, and that was in our notes. But we thought that it would be more powerful in a romantic setting, so we wrote ‘Upside down, boy you turn me.' And she flipped when she heard it,” he said.

I said upside down, you're turning meYou're giving love instinctivelyRound and round, you're turning me.

Though Ross is smitten in “Upside Down”, she's aware her partner isn't faithful. Still, sometimes the heart wants what the brain knows is bad for you. Even a Supreme can't resist a bad romance. But she's been here before, and the situation recalls The Supremes' classic “Stop! In The Name Of Love”.

However, Ross is wiser here. “Stop! In The Name Of Love” was released in 1965. But this is 1980, and she's not asking her partner to “think it over.” Instead, his charm and appeal are worth the price of cheating.

Instinctively, you give to me the love that I needI cherish the moments with youRespectfully, I say to theeI'm aware that you're cheatingWhen no one makes me feel like you do.

Ross's hit shares its name with the alternate dimension in Stranger Things. In the series, scientists at the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana, a fictional town, conduct research for the U.S. Department of Energy. The secret experiments taking place at the lab open a portal to The Upside Down, a mysterious realm that soon changes the lives of the town's residents.

“Upside Down” is featured in Season 5 amid a looming threat in both dimensions. But one doesn't need to experience the paranormal to feel a groove this deep.

I know you got charm and appealYou always play the fieldI'm crazy to think you're all mineAs long as the sun continues to shineThere's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line.

The legendary "Wow!" radio signal from space, recorded almost 50 years ago, turned out to be significantly stronger. A new
analysis of data from the "Big Ear" telescope showed a peak signal density of over 250 Janskys and refined its frequency.

The legendary radio signal from deep space, recorded almost 50 years ago, turned out to be significantly stronger than previously thought. A new digital analysis of 75,000 pages of archived data from the "Big Ear" telescope allowed scientists to recalculate the intensity of the burst and refine its characteristics. This is reported by Indian Defense Review, writes UNN.

A research team led by Abel Mendez from the University of Puerto Rico carried out monumental work to digitize the 1977 paper printouts. Thanks to modern computational methods, it was established that the peak signal density exceeded 250 Jansky. This makes it one of the most powerful narrowband bursts ever recorded within the hydrogen line (1420 MHz).

The updated analysis also refined the signal frequency to 1420.726 MHz. This almost perfectly matches the hydrogen line, which astronomers have long considered the most likely channel for interstellar communication due to its universality in the Universe.

Despite narrowing down the probable coordinates of the source in the constellation Sagittarius, scientists still cannot explain the nature of the signal. The study confirmed that "Wow!" had a perfect Gaussian profile, which is characteristic of a signal from a distant cosmic source, and not of random terrestrial noise or interference from satellites.

Scientists ruled out the possibility of radio wave reflection from the Moon or accidental hardware failures. The signal lasted 72 seconds and never recurred. The preservation of the original printouts by volunteers for decades allowed science in 2026 to revisit the question: was this burst the first recorded message from an extraterrestrial civilization.
