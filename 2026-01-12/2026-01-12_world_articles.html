                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ICE's approval rating among Americans currently sits at -13-points, a recent poll revealed. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. More Americans support abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency than at any point since it was established in 2003, new polling shows. Polling indicates Americans are opposed to Trump's tactics on immigration, despite it once being an issue Trump viewed as popular during the 2024 presidential campaign. Conversely, 60 percent disapprove of how he's performed on the issue. A Pew Research poll from October asked respondents their views on deportation in general. More recently, in the wake of an ICE agent shooting and killing Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good last week, polling from YouGov shows that most Americans are upset with the federal agency, with a snap poll conducted on the day of her death finding 52 percent disapproving of ICE and 39 percent approving. Additional polling from YouGov that day found that 51 percent of Americans believe the tactics used by ICE agents are too forceful, with only a quarter of respondents (27 percent) believing they are about right. As data journalist G. Elliott Morris explained, the reason for Americans' shift in opinion is simple. The Trump administration's tactics have horrified persuadable voters and made even some Republicans uncomfortable. “This is what happens when an extreme president enacts an extreme agenda,” Morris elaborated, “when the consequences of that extremity are visual, visceral, and plastered across the news and social media on a daily basis.” …We ask that you take just a second to read this message. We are up against a far-reaching, wide-scale attack on press freedom coming from the Trump administration. Since his inauguration last year, we've seen frightening censorship, a right-wing takeover of the news industry, and worsening financial conditions for progressive nonprofits across the board. We can only resist Trump's agenda by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. We need your help to sustain the fight against authoritarianism in 2026. He can be found on most social media platforms under the handle @thatchriswalker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leftwing leader rallies his supporters as US president accuses him of drug trafficking and threatens military action A leftwing South American firebrand calls for his followers to rally in public squares nationwide to defend his country's sovereignty and decry verbal attacks from Donald Trump. The US president accuses the leader of personally flooding American streets with illegal drugs and imposes sanctions against him and his wife. Threats of military action are followed by a phone conversation between the two leaders. One might imagine that this is a description of the buildup of tensions that led to the 3 January special forces raid on Caracas to capture the Venezuelan leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, to face several criminal charges in New York. But a similar script has been playing out in Colombia for the past year, leading to a volley of insults and threats between Trump and the Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, the country's first ever leftwing leader. Sandra Borda, a political analyst with the University of the Andes, said: “Trump has been doing to Petro the same thing that he did with Maduro, which is to link him directly as a person with drug trafficking.” While Maduro is widely believed to have stolen last year's election from the opposition, Petro's electoral win in 2022 has never been questioned. Maduro was indicted in a US federal court; Petro has no such charges against him. Even so, tensions between Colombia and the US reached their peak this week when Trump threatened military action against Colombia similar to the operation in Caracas and claimed Petro was a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States”. In response, Petro, a former guerrilla, said: “I swore not to touch a weapon again … but for the homeland I will.” Cynthia Arnson, a lecturer at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on Colombia-US relations, said: “It's taken herculean efforts by diplomats on the Colombian and the US side to keep the relationship from imploding.” Days after Trump took office in January 2025, Petro said his government would refuse to accept US military planes transporting deported Colombian citizens, demanding they be treated with “dignity and respect”. Trump shot back, imposing a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods and revoking the US visas of some government officials. A week later, during the UN general assembly, Petro stood on a New York street, megaphone in hand, addressing a pro-Palestine rally and called on American soldiers to disobey any illegal orders from their commanders. In response, the United States revoked his US visa. In October, it placed financial sanctions on Petro, his wife, his son and the interior minister, Armando Benedetti, for what the treasury department claimed was “their involvement in the global illicit drug trade”. Petro's government has seized unprecedented amounts of cocaine – 836.8 tonnes between January and October 2025 – but these successes have been eclipsed by growing coca cultivation and potential for cocaine production, which the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reportedly estimated at 3,000 tonnes in 2024, although the official numbers have not yet been made public. Until the call between the presidents, Petro's brash demeanour had made him a lightning rod for Trump and members of his administration. The Colombian president seems to thrive on conflict, as he enjoys posting long rants on social media and giving lengthy, often rambling speeches. Though many of Latin America's left-leaning leaders, including Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil, have clashed with Trump, Petro is “in his own category”, said Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America, an NGO. “This is a leader who is every day saying what he thinks about Trump and using very strong language,” he said. He was detained by the army in 1985 for possessing weapons – which he said were planted – and subjected to four days of torture by the army. The M-19 was of the first guerrilla groups to demobilise in 1990 and seek a role in traditional politics after peace talks. From his congressional seat, Petro presented evidence of collusion between politicians and rightwing paramilitary leaders that implicated allies of the then president, Álvaro Uribe. Petro was elected mayor of the Colombian capital, Bogotá, in 2011 for a tumultuous four-year term during which he was briefly removed from office by the country's inspector general. “If Petro insists on provoking Trump, it will become more costly politically in terms of the domestic political process,” she said. Isacson said a belligerent US stance toward Colombia could boost the leftwing candidate, Iván Cepeda. “This sort of new aggressive United States – that is a perfect issue for the left,” he said. We will beat [Petro] and his heirs with votes at the ballot boxes … without intervention from anyone.” The animosity between Petro and Trump will probably not have disappeared with one telephone call, and Maduro spoke with Trump less than two months before his capture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Occasionally, history generates smooth changes from one era to another. More commonly, such shifts occur only gradually and untidily. Sometimes, as former Downing Street foreign policy adviser John Bew puts it in The New Statesman, history unfolds “in a series of flashes and bangs.” The capture of former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has precedents in US policy. However, discerning a wider new pattern from the kidnapping is not easy, especially at this early stage. The US' historic allies are still struggling to understand these changes. Events such as those in Caracas raise stark questions of power. They embody the exact same reality that Trump delights in celebrating. The British government should not be condemned for each hesitation. Many would disagree with this sweeping dismissal of international rules and its insistence on transatlantic realpolitik, perhaps because of its author. Officials, advisers, academics and commentators of every stripe are also trying to make larger sense of the US' transformation from necessary power to rogue state. First, an increased US willingness to use executive power for swift military action. Third, at least as promoted by the US Department of State, a turn to a hemispheric approach, implying perhaps that China and Russia would be given freer rein in other regions. We can, should and do regret these emerging shifts. Countries such as Britain have to decide what economic and technological adaptations they should make in this new world to protect their interests and people. No one can pretend that is easy, but it is a debate that involves us all, with implications that would affect us all, and therefore one in which all must have a voice. Jan. 1 marks a decade since China repealed its one-child policy. Just 10 days before, Peng Peiyun (彭珮雲), who long oversaw the often-brutal enforcement of China's family-planning rules, died at the age of 96, having never been held accountable for her actions. Obituaries praised Peng for being “reform-minded,” even though, in practice, she only perpetuated an utterly inhumane policy, whose consequences have barely begun to materialize. It was Vice Premier Chen Muhua (陳慕華) who first proposed the one-child policy in 1979, with the endorsement of China's then-top leaders, Chen Yun (陳雲) and Deng Xiaoping (鄧小平), as a means of avoiding the The immediate response in Taiwan to the extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by the US over the weekend was to say that it was an example of violence by a major power against a smaller nation and that, as such, it gave Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) carte blanche to invade Taiwan. That assessment is vastly oversimplistic and, on more sober reflection, likely incorrect. Generally speaking, there are three basic interpretations from commentators in Taiwan. A recent piece of international news has drawn surprisingly little attention, yet it deserves far closer scrutiny. German industrial heavyweight Siemens Mobility has reportedly outmaneuvered long-entrenched Chinese competitors in Southeast Asian infrastructure to secure a strategic partnership with Vietnam's largest private conglomerate, Vingroup. German media were blunt in their assessment: This was not merely a commercial win, but has symbolic significance in “reshaping geopolitical influence.” At first glance, this might look like a routine outcome of corporate bidding. The last foreign delegation Nicolas Maduro met before he went to bed Friday night (January 2) was led by China's top Latin America diplomat. “I had a pleasant meeting with Qiu Xiaoqi (邱小琪), Special Envoy of President Xi Jinping (習近平),” Venezuela's soon-to-be ex-president tweeted on Telegram, “and we reaffirmed our commitment to the strategic relationship that is progressing and strengthening in various areas for building a multipolar world of development and peace.” Judging by how minutely the Central Intelligence Agency was monitoring Maduro's every move on Friday, President Trump himself was certainly aware of Maduro's felicitations to his Chinese guest.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine entered its  1,418th day on Jan. 11, the same number of days that the Soviet Union fought Nazi Germany during World War II, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address. Zelensky compared Russia's tactics in Ukraine to those of the Nazis, saying Moscow is replicating 20th-century fascism. "Russia's large-scale war against Ukraine has been going on for as long as Nazi Germany's war against the Soviet Union," the president said. "Today marks the 1,418th day of Russia's war against Ukraine. Despite Russia's years-long campaign of aggression, the Kremlin has failed to achieve its military goals, Zelensky said. "They want to lie again that they have taken Kupiansk, are dying endlessly in the fields of Zaporizhzhia, and are still fighting against a united Ukraine. ...This says a lot about the system (Russian President Vladimir) Putin has built." Russia has also lost over 35,000 artillery systems, 11,500 tanks, 430 aircraft, and 28 ships, according to the General Staff. "Every day of war is a reminder that the world cannot protect itself from madmen," he said. Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the Soviet Union, on June 22, 1941. While Ukrainian officials have been working closely with U.S. representatives in recent weeks on a draft peace agreement including postwar security guarantees, Russia has consistently refused to budge on its maximalist aims. Abbey Fenbert is a senior news editor at the Kyiv Independent. She is a freelance writer, editor, and playwright with an MFA from Boston University. Abbey served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ukraine from 2008-2011. "Ensuring that people can keep warm, cook food, and live reasonably normal lives is vital in enabling them to persevere in this war — a war that they are fighting on behalf of us all," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. "The wet dreams of British perverts," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Russian forces struck an ambulance in the town of Semenivka in Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 11, injuring two medical workers, a local official reported. The U.K. has launched Project Nightfall, a competition to rapidly develop new long-range ballistic missiles for Ukraine. The missiles will be able to travel 500 km (310 miles) and come equipped with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In their quest to undo Donald Trump's grip on voters, Democrats have staked their hopes on one word above all others: affordability. When Democrats don't like something that Trump does – a frequent occurrence – their counter-argument is that Americans would have been better off if the president instead concentrated on making life less expensive. “Democrats in the House and Senate [are] focusing on lowering your costs, dealing with affordability. Republicans, led by Donald Trump, are focused on spending treasure and, God forbid, lives on military adventurism overseas,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week, just before the chamber voted to advance a resolution halting further attacks on Venezuela without congressional permission. Trump returned to the White House after a campaign spent insisting that he could lower prices on “day one”. “It's a weakness for Republicans, because Republicans did say, hey, look, man, you put us in charge, and we're going to make this better, and prices are going to go down. “That's an Achilles heel, and Democrats are well-served to take advantage of it.” The latest indication of the GOP's jitters arrived on Thursday, when 17 House Republicans broke with their party's leaders and joined Democrats to pass a three-year reinstatement of premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans. It was a turnaround from October, when Democrats sparked a record-long government shutdown by refusing to vote for funding bills unless the subsidies were extended, noting that people who purchase insurance through the ACA exchanges would see significant price increases without the aid. “It left us with two options - either expiration or clean extension. And clean extension is a far better option, in my view, and that's why I proceeded down the path that I did,” Republican congressman Brian Fitzpatrick, one of the main players in the revolt, said in an interview with NPR. Yet the data underscores why Americans remain worried about their livelihoods. Schumer doubled down at his recent press conference, promising that “Democrats are going to make healthcare and other high costs, the high cost of living, the No 1 issue for all of 2026”. They are set to be joined in the campaign by outside groups that have already spent big to put the issue on voters' radar. “One vote won't undo all they've done to make life more expensive for everyday Americans, like the historic healthcare cuts they have already made. But it's safe to say they have heard their constituents' complaints,” she said. Republicans, by contrast, have banked that their political fortunes will reverse during the upcoming tax season, thanks to policies enacted as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed last summer, which they have now rebranded as the “Working Families Tax Cut”. “Those provisions will hit American households and wallets, and you're going to see all boats begin to rise,” Johnson said this week. Republicans are otherwise sticking to what Hetherington described as a familiar playbook, by seeking to divert voters' attention elsewhere, such as to Trump's successful raid on Venezuela, or his allegations of widespread fraud in childcare spending. “The political science would suggest that whoever happens to be in charge, whether they are responsible for the inflation or not, they tend to get punished for it,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's led to an escalating stand-off between the United States and European Union that could increasingly weigh on their relationship. The president has pushed the European Union and other foreign governments to pull back on regulating US tech firms, while also promoting fewer guardrails domestically. His administration intensified those efforts last month by threatening to penalize European tech firms and seeking to block prominent tech safety researchers and a regulator from entering the United States. The United States has taken a largely hands-off approach. Republicans, now controlling the US government, have in recent years framed content moderation efforts as “censorship.” And US tech companies — chafing at having to comply with new EU requirements or face fines — may now be seizing an opportunity to push back. It's a conflict that could put Silicon Valley in the crosshairs of wider US-EU trade negotiations this year, especially as the Trump administration views unfettered advancement in artificial intelligence as crucial for the economy and national security. The US-EU fight over regulating tech dates back to Trump's first administration. American officials sharply criticized the EU's General Data Protection Regulation after it went into effect in 2018. US tech companies had also lobbied against the law. EU antitrust actions against American tech firms also prompted discrimination claims, which European officials denied. The laws imposed sweeping new rules around social media moderation, targeted advertising and interoperability between major platforms, as well as costly fines for tech giants that violated the laws. Trump lays bare his contempt for Europe in blistering new national security plan Experts note that the laws were in some ways intended to make life easier for the tech companies, preventing them from having to comply with different laws from the EU's 27 member states. (Trump has encouraged a similar approach in the United States regarding AI regulation.) As Trump prepared for his second term, tech CEOs including Zuckerberg and Apple's Tim Cook sought to curry favor with him and raised concerns about European regulations. Vice President JD Vance in February used his speech at the Munich Security Conference to rail against European “censorship.” The same month, Trump signed a memo saying his administration would investigate and consider imposing tariffs on foreign governments that tax US tech companies or impose policies that “incentivize … censorship.” For its part, European officials have pushed back on the notion that their rules unfairly target American firms. “As we have made clear many times, our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,” Thomas Regnier, the European Commission's spokesperson for tech sovereignty, said in a statement to CNN. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination.” In September, Trump threatened the EU with a tariff investigation after it fined Google $3.45 billion for violating its antitrust laws. Later that month, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer threatened European tech companies including SAP, Spotify and Mistral with “fees or restrictions” if the EU didn't back down on regulatory actions against American firms. “If the EU and EU Member States insist on continuing to restrict, limit, and deter the competitiveness of U.S. service providers through discriminatory means, the United States will have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” Greer said in an X post. Days later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced visa sanctions against Thierry Breton, a former European commissioner involved in the DSA, as well as four employees of organizations that combat online disinformation and hate, for alleged censorship. Regnier condemned the travel restrictions and said the European Commission denies that its laws “amount to any form of censorship,” adding that the rules “ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.” Breton responded in an X post noting the DSA's broad support among European lawmakers and saying: “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn't where you think it is. The Trump administration's claims of “censorship” by Europe comes even as the president himself has taken actions that could chill free speech domestically, such as targeting journalists and seeking to deport non-citizen professors and students who have spoken in support of Palestinians. The fight could become a linchpin in broader negotiations this year. The agreement included a commitment to address “non-tariff barriers” to trade, which Gorman said “was kind of a wink and a nod to the digital regulations, but it didn't get resolved.” State Department imposes sanctions on former EU official, disinformation group leaders for ‘censorship' The EU does not appear to be backing down. The Commission announced new investigations in December into potential anticompetitive behavior by both Meta and Google. But not all officials agree that regulation hurts innovation. The proposal also didn't seem to satisfy American officials; after it was introduced, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick called for further rules rollbacks in exchange for lower tariffs. The conflict underscores the need for Europe to build its own technologies and reduce its reliance on Silicon Valley, said Giorgos Verdi, a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine seeks to stall talks by staging provocations against Russia; Donald Trump takes control of Venezuela; and more US strikes on Iran may spark a regional war. Kiev carried out a whole series of terrorist attacks in the past two weeks, including a strike on civilians in the Kherson Region and an attempted attack on one of the Russian president's state residences. The Ukrainians' actions did not go unanswered, with Russia once again using its Oreshnik intermediate-range missile system, this time to hit sites in the Lvov Region. Miroshnik believes that Kiev's main objective is "to impact the negotiation process by trying to provoke Russia to act inappropriately, preferably in an emotional manner, and violate international humanitarian law, which Kiev could portray in a negative light in the US eyes" According to the Russian diplomat, these activities have definitely been agreed on with Kiev's European partners and accomplices. "By taking such action, Kiev primarily aims to demonstrate to its Western partners that Ukraine is not the loser as it maintains resistance. So there is no reason to say that Kiev is ready to accept the terms of a peace agreement," political scientist Denis Denisov noted. It seems that the resumption of direct bilateral talks with Russia either on the political or at least a technical level is not under consideration, Valdai International Discussion Club expert Andrey Kortunov pointed out. Had it been so, "we would probably have seen some steps aimed at easing the conflict," he explained. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that "secures Venezuelan oil revenue for the good of the American and Venezuelan people." He also held a meeting with the executives of the biggest US oil companies, urging them to step up investment in Venezuela's energy sector, Vedomosti reports. Trump wants to go down in history as a great president, which is the main objective that needs to be understood, particularly when analyzing the recent US operation against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, said Vladimir Vasilyev, senior research fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for US and Canadian Studies. Besides, in the expert's view, Trump's sudden foreign policy moves are also directly linked to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. "If there are no foreign policy shocks, there may be some domestic ones, which could affect a significant part of the American ruling class," the expert observed. China, Russia, the European Union, and India remain quite active in Latin America. "China's positions are still very strong, even though Trump has been able to push it back a bit. Beijing is the main trading partner for a number of countries," Rozental pointed out. Meanwhile, when it comes to Venezuela, the US authorities seem to rely on small enterprises rather than major oil giants. "Extracting Venezuelan oil requires long and costly exploration efforts, which may even produce no results at all. It also requires certain conditions on the global market, including high oil prices and a quick rise in demand, which would make it possible to supply this high-cost oil to the market without having to fear a drop in prices. There is a lot of doubt that American companies will be able to significantly increase oil production in Venezuela," the expert concluded. Experts don't rule out that the US could target both military and nuclear facilities, as well as Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's residence. If such a scenario materializes, Iran's potential retaliation would affect other Middle Eastern countries, including Israel, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, Izvestia notes. However, others are confident the time has come," he noted. If Washington opts for military action, Tehran will see Israel and US military and naval bases as "legitimate targets," Iranian Parliament Chairman Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf warned. So far, Trump's statements about strikes on Iran appear to relate to psychological pressure that can be regarded as part of an information campaign against Tehran, American studies expert Malek Dudakov stressed. He believes that the main goal pursued by the US and Israel is to bring a pro-US government to power in Tehran. Trump appears inclined to take ever more risky foreign policy steps. External forces, including US and Israeli intelligence agencies, are fueling more protests, particularly through a media promotion campaign for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the Iranian shah overthrown in 1979, Lyamin believes. NATO continues its military buildup in the northern latitudes, adding to tensions in the Arctic region, Russian Ambassador to Copenhagen Vladimir Barbin told Izvestia. Simultaneously, the US is increasing pressure on Denmark, with analysts predicting that Washington will be given exclusive rights to use Greenland's resources and build additional bases on the island. "In order to achieve its goals, the Trump team may use diplomatic and economic levers to put pressure on Denmark. In the expert's opinion, Denmark will have to make concessions at some point, particularly by granting the US exclusive access to rare earth, oil and gas deposits, as well as expanding Washington's rights to set up military bases in Greenland. This would allow the United States to ensure long-term access to commodities and strengthen its position in the Western Hemisphere. Russian oil companies may boost supplies to independent refineries in China, which are likely to face disruptions in Venezuelan oil purchases, analysts from Kpler and Argus pointed out. A blockade on Venezuelan exports and the seizure of tankers by US forces have brought shipments to China almost to a halt. An increasing number of market participants expect that Venezuelan oil supplies to China will drop following the January 3 arrest of President Nicolas Maduro and US leader Donald Trump's statements about Washington's control of the Latin American country, Argus experts noted. Kpler experts see Nicolas Maduro's arrest as "a turning point" for Venezuela's oil industry and the global heavy oil market. According to him, the main commodity flows will be redirected to the US market, which will boost Russia's competitiveness on Asian markets. In the expert's view, tanker seizures are unlikely to become a regular practice that could significantly change supply routes or lead to higher insurance risks. Maxim Shaposhnikov, advisor to the Industrial Code fund manager, expects China to reach an agreement with the US on preserving Venezuelan supplies, but this will require time. Besides, in Shaposhnikov's words, China won't be able to fully restore Venezuelan supplies at the same prices. That said, Chinese refineries will have an interest in Russian oil, which could result in reduced discounts for Russian crude.

MOSCOW, January 12. /TASS/. The loss of Belogorye in the Zaporozhye Region will weaken the Ukrainian army's defenses near the city of Zaporozhye, a source in Russian defense circles told TASS.

Russia's Defense Ministry reported on January 11 that its Battlegroup Dnepr had liberated the settlement of Belogorye.

"Belogorye played an important role in the enemy's defensive lines in the Zaporozhye direction. Its seizure opens an operational way for Russian troops to develop an offensive towards one of the Ukrainian army's key areas of defense - the town of Orekhov. The loss of that stronghold may seriously complicate the enemy's ability to keep sustainable defenses at approaches to the city of Zaporozhye," the defense source said.

Russian unmanned systems troops played an important role in liberating Belogorye. Drone teams thwarted the rotation of Ukrainian forces several days before the assault, which considerably facilitated the Russian army's advance on the ground, he specified.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova lashed out on Jan. 11 at British Defense Secretary John Healey after he said he would detain Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes, calling the remarks "the wet dreams of British perverts." Asked which world leader he would choose to kidnap if given the chance, Healey said he would "take (Russian President Vladimir) Putin into custody and hold him account for war crimes." While Healey's comments were hypothetical when made, they followed a shift in the international landscape after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, a move that raised questions about whether similar actions could follow. Healey's remarks came just one day after Russia launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across Ukraine overnight on Jan. 8–9, killing at least four people and injuring 24 others in Kyiv. Zakharova, a longtime fixture of Russia's foreign policy messaging, is widely known for using undiplomatic and provocative language. Trump, who has spent months attempting to broker a negotiated settlement between Moscow and Kyiv, earlier offered a sharply contrasting view when asked about the prospect of detaining Putin. Asked whether such a move might be necessary, Trump replied ambiguously, "Well, I don't think it's going to be necessary," adding, "I've always had a great relationship with (Putin)." Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia. Tim is fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. The move comes as London looks for stronger tools to disrupt illicit oil shipments that help fund Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as sanctioned exports linked to Iran and Venezuela. "Ensuring that people can keep warm, cook food, and live reasonably normal lives is vital in enabling them to persevere in this war — a war that they are fighting on behalf of us all," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said. "The wet dreams of British perverts," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. Russian forces struck an ambulance in the town of Semenivka in Chernihiv Oblast on Jan. 11, injuring two medical workers, a local official reported. The U.K. has launched Project Nightfall, a competition to rapidly develop new long-range ballistic missiles for Ukraine. The missiles will be able to travel 500 km (310 miles) and come equipped with a 200 kg (440 lb) warhead. The Tempest surface-to-air missile system is designed to engage drones, helicopters, and low-flying aircraft in all weather conditions. Its transfer to Ukraine was not publicly announced.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump officials view Greenland's underground riches as a way to loosen China's stranglehold over the rare-earth metals that are critical for everything from fighter jets and lasers to electric vehicles and MRI scanners. “We need Greenland … It's so strategic right now,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One earlier this month. “We are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not. Although Trump has recently downplayed Greenland's natural resources, his former national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News in 2024 that the administration's focus on Greenland was “about critical minerals” and “natural resources.” Researchers say it would be extremely difficult and expensive to extract Greenland's minerals because many of the island's mineral deposits are located in remote areas above the Arctic Circle, where there is a mile-thick polar ice sheet and darkness reigns much of the year. Not only that, but Greenland, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, lacks the infrastructure and manpower required to make this mining dream a reality. “The idea of turning Greenland into America's rare-earth factory is science fiction. It's just completely bonkers,” said Malte Humpert, founder and senior fellow at The Arctic Institute. Despite its name, approximately 80% of Greenland is covered with ice. And mineral extraction — or just about anything — in the Arctic can be five to 10 times more expensive than doing it elsewhere on the planet. Yet Trump's startling intervention in Venezuela and decision to take control of the South American nation's vast oil riches have refocused attention on his interest in Greenland. The chance that the United States takes control of any part of Greenland has surged to around 40% on prediction market Kalshi, up from about 20% in mid-2025. Of course, there are major differences between the situations in Venezuela and Greenland. Not only is Greenland a territory of NATO ally Denmark, but unlike Venezuela it is very much open to business that can operate there, and it has a long history of political stability. For years, if not decades, officials in Greenland have courted foreign direct investment. People in Greenland say they already are open to business opportunities without any belligerence. “I don't see a need for taking over Greenland. We're open to investment and working with Americans,” Christian Keldsen, managing director of the Greenland Business Association, told CNN in a phone interview. “If there was a ‘pot of gold' waiting at the end of the rainbow in Greenland, private businesses would have gone there already,” said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. However, Funk Kirkegaard, who previously worked with the Danish Ministry of Defense, said it's just “very difficult” to make a business case for the very large upfront investment that would be required. “If given enough taxpayer dollars, private business would be willing to do almost anything,” Funk Kirkegaard said. The climate crisis has caused melting ice and rapidly rising temperatures in the Arctic, leading some to hope for new economic opportunities. However, it's too early to say this will be enough of a game-changer to overcome the environmental challenges of mining in Greenland. While ice melt has opened up some shipping routes, it has also made the ground less stable to drill and raises the risk of landslides. This is not the Mediterranean or your bathtub. There's just less ice freeze,” said Humpert of The Arctic Institute. Relatedly, Greenland's stringent environmental regulations would add expense and difficulty to widespread mining. If the Trump administration somehow made those regulations disappear, it might prove deeply unpopular. “You could end up having a hostile local political situation,” Funk Kirkegaard said. Selling Greenland to the United States would likely require a referendum. Yet a poll published in January 2025 found that just 6% favor Greenland becoming part of the United States. The overwhelming majority of Greenlanders, 85%, said they do not want that to happen. Adam Lajeunesse, chair in Canadian and Arctic policy at St. Francis Xavier University, said the “bizarre rhetoric” about taking over Greenland risks undermining the economic and strategic objectives US officials by harming the relationship with Greenland and Denmark. “You could see the United States no longer viewed as a friend and partner but as a bully that should be resisted,” he said. To some extent, this may already be happening. “At the moment, everything American is a red flag,” he said. “Everyone is wondering, ‘Am I supporting someone taking over my country?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. COLIN H. KAHL is Director and Steven C. Hazy Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies. Neither America Nor China Can Achieve True Tech Dominance In July, the Trump administration released an artificial intelligence action plan titled “Winning the AI Race,” which framed global competition over AI in stark terms: whichever country achieves dominance in the technology will reap overwhelming economic, military, and geopolitical advantages. This outcome is even more likely in the wake of the Trump administration's decision to lift some export controls on advanced AI chips to China. In December, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. government would permit the sale of Nvidia's H200—the company's second most powerful AI chip—to approved customers in China. The decision reflects a belief that allowing China access to “good enough” computing power can generate revenue for U.S. companies and reinforce American technological standards without risking the United States' edge in AI innovation. But the danger of selling high-end U.S. chips to China is that it could lead to a more divided AI landscape—one in which U.S. firms maintain a lead in providing advanced AI-based services, but Chinese companies gain ground in disseminating their slightly less advanced but cheaper technology around the world and applying AI to machines, factories, and infrastructure. The most plausible outcome of the AI race, then, may not be decisive American or Chinese victory, but something more complex and more consequential: an asymmetric form of AI bipolarity. For now, the United States' most significant advantage lies not in models but in compute—the quality and quantity of computing resources to train and run AI models. This capacity allows U.S. companies to train larger and more capable models and absorb the enormous computational costs of customers making requests of models in ways that Chinese competitors cannot easily match. Export controls that were enacted during Trump's first term and dramatically strengthened under the Biden administration reinforced this advantage. Restrictions on advanced AI chips and on semiconductor manufacturing equipment have made it difficult for Chinese firms to acquire or produce sufficient quantities of leading-edge chips for AI, which has slowed China's ability to create the computing power required to train and deploy the most advanced models. China has still managed to make some decent chips. Although Chinese companies still won't have access to Nvidia's newest Blackwell generation or its forthcoming Rubin line, the H200 remains highly capable. It was released in 2024, is still used in major AI data centers run by U.S. companies, and is about ten times more powerful than the chips that could be sold to China under U.S. President Joe Biden's export regulations. The Trump administration has hinted that other U.S. chipmakers, including AMD and Intel, might also be permitted to sell advanced chips. The White House seems to believe that allowing the sale of powerful but not leading-edge chips will generate revenue for U.S. firms that can be put toward research and development while preserving U.S. leadership at the frontier of AI research. The Trump administration also reasons that continued Chinese reliance on U.S.-designed hardware and software—particularly Nvidia's CUDA platform—will enable the United States to influence programming frameworks, development tools, and data-center architectures used by Chinese AI firms. Another motivation seems to be the conviction that selling chips that outperform China's domestic alternatives could reduce Beijing's incentives to speed up indigenous development of advanced AI chips. Depending on the number of H200 chips that ultimately reach China and how efficiently they are used, the United States could lose its massive advantage in compute capacity. According to analysis by the Institute for Progress, if the United States exported no advanced chips to China, its compute capacity in 2026 would be more than ten times that of China's. In other words, with unrestricted H200 exports, Chinese AI labs could build supercomputers approaching the performance of top U.S. systems, albeit at a higher cost. Just as important, exporting H200s is unlikely to slow China's efforts at making its own advanced chips in the long run. Since Trump's December announcement, Chinese firms have already placed orders for more than two million H200s—far exceeding what Huawei or other Chinese companies can currently produce. Moreover, there are some signs that Beijing may require potential buyers of the H200 chips to justify why domestic alternatives will not suffice, suggesting that Chinese authorities are prepared to maintain artificial demand for homegrown chips through procurement mandates and restrictions on foreign hardware in sensitive sectors. Dutch officials are now asking why they should continue to limit exports of critical manufacturing equipment when U.S. firms are allowed to sell the finished chips produced using the same equipment. If the Netherlands or other key allies, such as Japan and South Korea, were to loosen their export controls, China's ability to domestically produce high-end chips could improve sharply—eventually undercutting not only Nvidia but also U.S. data center companies that rely on sustained hardware advantages. Even if Beijing restricts H200 imports for domestic use, these companies could deploy U.S.-designed chips overseas, offering subsidized, vertically integrated AI infrastructure bundled with power, connectivity, and talent programs. China is already skilled at disseminating its technology to other countries. U.S. labs typically rely on proprietary, closed-weight models that are accessed through cloud services. Chinese firms, by contrast, have embraced open-weight models, which are appealing because they are cheaper, can be more easily tailored to specific industries or languages, and can be run through local rather than U.S.-based cloud providers—which, in turn, reduces concerns about data localization and foreign dependence. The Trump administration is keen to promote the global diffusion of an American AI technology stack in which U.S. data centers, chips, and models are bundled together and the world remains dependent on U.S. hardware, software, and services. But in the wake of the H200 decision, Chinese firms are likely to build data centers in foreign countries using advanced U.S. chips running attractive Chinese open-weight models. This is because beyond models, compute, and diffusion lies another dimension of the race that may prove decisive: embodied AI. Unlike models that generate text or images, embodied AI systems integrate sensing, perception, control, and decision-making to operate in physical environments. They underpin industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent machines that learn by interacting with the world. Beijing has explicitly elevated embodied AI as a national priority. Central government plans have identified intelligent manufacturing and humanoid robotics as critical emerging industries, while local governments have offered grants, tax incentives, subsidized land, and preferential procurement to firms deploying AI-enabled automation. AI-enabled automation has helped Chinese factories reduce defect rates, shorten production cycles, and operate continuously with fewer workers. Some Chinese factories for electronics and electric cars are already operating with minimal human supervision. In the years to come, the benefits of AI will not only depend on making smarter models but also on turning bits into atoms—that is, translating the gains from greater intelligence into economic productivity, industrial competitiveness, and novel military capabilities. Taken together, these trends point toward an emerging end state that defies simple narratives of victory or defeat. Instead, the United States and China are competing in an AI decathlon and the United States must shift its strategy accordingly. As AI bipolarity comes into view, the United States must lean into its strengths where they matter most, disseminate its technology, and accept the necessity of sustained AI dialogue with Beijing even amid intensifying rivalry. For starters, Washington should avoid further eroding its advantages in computing power—the bedrock of global AI leadership. If the administration is unwilling to reverse its H200 decision, and Congress does not intervene, the Commerce Department should approve licenses for H200 exports slowly and apply heightened scrutiny to Chinese firms with close ties to China's national security agencies. At the same time, the Trump administration must follow through on the pledge it made in its AI action plan to rigorously enforce remaining export controls—most notably on high-bandwidth memory, advanced lithography equipment, and other critical semiconductor manufacturing and packaging tools needed to produce top-tier chips. These controls remain among the few ways Washington can influence the tempo and scale of China's progress in AI.To compete with China's “good enough” AI infrastructure and open-weight model strategy, the administration should direct the International Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to fund AI projects in countries across the so-called global South to compete with subsidized, state-backed Chinese alternatives—and work with Congress to secure expanded legal authorities and financial resources to do so. Absent such efforts, Chinese AI ecosystems are likely to become the default option in many developing countries, providing Beijing new levers of influence and entrenching AI models and standards that normalize surveillance and censorship.Simultaneously, the administration must work with Congress to prepare for the domestic economic shocks that AI bipolarity is likely to intensify. As the United States comes to dominate services on the frontier of AI, a growing number of white-collar jobs—particularly entry-level positions—will probably be displaced by machine intelligence. Meanwhile, China's dominance of the industrial applications of AI risks further hollowing out U.S. manufacturing and creating new dependencies on Chinese goods and supply chains. The administration should work with Congress to invest more in STEM education, vocational training, and midcareer retraining and should encourage the adoption of AI systems that complement rather than replace human labor. At the same time, reducing dependence on China will require supporting AI-enabled manufacturing in the United States, strengthening supply chains with trusted partners, and ensuring that productivity gains from automation translate into durable economic capacity at home. Although AI bipolarity will likely intensify tensions between the United States and China, it also strengthens the case for sustained superpower dialogue. Both countries therefore have strong incentives to manage those risks, including by coordinating efforts to prevent nonstate actors from using AI for catastrophic cyber or biological attacks—something Trump's AI action plan warns is a growing danger. They also share an interest in ensuring that increasingly advanced AI remains under human control, even if Washington and Beijing disagree profoundly on the values those systems should reflect. In a world where the AI race is multifaceted and where neither side is likely to emerge as a clear winner, avoiding a destabilizing race to the bottom remains more important than ever.
