                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leonardo DiCaprio may have missed out on a performance prize at the Golden Globes, but a candid moment captured off-stage is winning the internet. The One Battle After Another star was filmed interacting animatedly with an unknown attendee at the Beverly Hilton on Sunday night. It's not totally clear what DiCaprio is saying — though some amateur lip readers have posted their speculation — but the actor appears to be jokingly impersonating his friend. During the clip, DiCaprio points in the direction of another guest, indicates that he was watching them by raising his fingers to his eyes, and then delivers what looks like a hammy impression.

The suspicion is that he is talking to his One Battle co-star Chase Infiniti after Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters won two awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for “Golden.” Infiniti is an unabashed K-pop fan. DiCaprio missed out on the Best Actor — Musical or Comedy prize to Timothée Chalamet, who won for Marty Supreme. This Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet moment? Earlier in the evening, host Nikki Glaser said in a joke about DiCaprio: “What a career you've had, countless iconic performances, you've worked with every great director, you've won three Golden Globes, an Oscar and the most impressive thing is you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Mayer shared a short but poignant tribute to his late bandmate Bob Weir on Sunday. The musician, who performed with Weir in Dead & Company for several years, honored their collaboration. I'll do it your way,” Mayer wrote on Instagram. “Fkn' A… Thanks for letting me ride alongside you. Dead & Company embarked on numerous tours in the years that followed. The group wrapped up a farewell tour in July 2023, but they continued to play residencies at Sphere in Las Vegas throughout 2024 and 2025. They came together one last time in August 2025 for three shows in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park to celebrate the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary. Throughout the three evenings, they were joined by Billy Strings, Trey Anastasio, Grahame Lesh, and Sturgill Simpson. Golden Globe Awards 2026: See the Complete Winners List Weir once said he hoped to see the band outlive him. “I had a little flash while we were playing one night,” Weir told Rolling Stone‘s David Fricke in 2016. I don't remember what city it was in. We were getting into the second set, setting up a tune. We were all playing, but the tune hadn't begun yet. We were all feeling out the groove, just playing with it. Suddenly I was 20 feet behind my own head, looking at this and kind of happy with the way the song was shaping up. I started looking around, and it was 20 years later. I looked back at the drummers, and it was a couple of new guys. Weir's family announced his death at 78 on Jan. 10 in a statement. “It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,” his family wrote. “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could.

He elaborated on his upset with the current situation in the U.S., noting, “We have a vice president who is lying about what's happening. Ruffalo added of Trump, “He's telling the world that international law doesn't matter to him. The only thing that matters to him is his own morality, but the guy is a convicted felon; a convicted rapist.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the dreams, he is laughing," Jack Osbourne said. Jack Osbourne says his late father, Ozzy Osbourne, has been appearing to multiple family members in vivid, recurring dreams since his death last year. In a recent interview with Billy Morrison on SiriusXM, Jack Osbourne shared that he, his wife and his daughters have all independently experienced similar dreams involving the Black Sabbath frontman. Chet Faker Expands 'A Love for Strangers' Tour With New Australia Dates 'KPop Demon Hunters' & 'Sinners' Win in Music Categories at 2026 Golden Globes Snoop Dogg Presents Amy Poehler With Inaugural Best Podcast Award at 2026 Golden Globes: 'This Is Exactly How I Pictured It' In the dreams, he is laughing,” Jack Osbourne said. Morrison, who was speaking with Osbourne during the broadcast, also said he had experienced a similar dream about Ozzy. He's not in pain,” Morrison said, according to the interview. Ozzy Osbourne died in July 2025 at age 76 after suffering a heart attack. His death came just 17 days after he played his final live performance in his hometown of Birmingham, England, a benefit concert that raised millions for children's charities and featured appearances from major figures across the rock and metal world. Following his passing, Sharon Osbourne publicly shared details about her final moments with her husband, recalling that he asked her to “kiss me” and “hug me tight” in the early hours of the morning before his death. Fans launched a petition calling for Birmingham Airport to be renamed in his honour, which has garnered more than 75,000 signatures, while the late singer was also posthumously awarded the Birmingham Lord Mayor's Award on what would have been his 77th birthday. Osbourne co-founded Black Sabbath in 1968, helping define heavy metal through albums including Black Sabbath, Paranoid and Master of Reality, before launching a solo career that produced classics such as “Crazy Train” and “Mr. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But this year's Globes will almost surely have a greater influence on the shape of the Oscar nominations than did last year's Globes or will this year's Critics Choice Awards, given that Oscar nomination voting starts bright and early on Monday — as in, tomorrow. Most Memorable Golden Globe Moments, From Emotional Speeches and Nikki Glaser's Surprise Performance to Timothée Chalamet's Sweet Shoutout Focus' Hamnet prevailed over formidable competition — Warners' Sinners, Netflix's Frankenstein and Neon's It Was Just an Accident, The Secret Agent and Sentimental Value — to win best picture (drama), positioning it, at least in theory and a lot of media coverage, as the chief best picture Oscar challenger to Warners' One Battle After Another, which was always expected to win the other best picture award, best picture (musical/comedy), and did. Steven Spielberg, as a producer of Hamnet, accepted that film's best picture prize (before turning over the mic to co-writer/director Chloé Zhao), which only further boosts the film's standing, given how revered Spielberg is in the business. Unlike the SAG-AFTRA nominating committee that determined the Actor Awards nominations last week and shut out all films and film performances that were not in English, Globes voters have never had a problem rewarding work done in other languages, and they did a huge service to the Portuguese-language Brazilian film The Secret Agent by recognizing it with best non-English-language film (over the likes of France's It Was Just an Accident and Norway's Sentimental Value) and with best actor (drama) for Wagner Moura (over the likes of Sinners' Michael B. Jordan, Jeremy Allen White for 20th Century's Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere and Dwayne Johnson for A24's The Smashing Machine). The Secret Agent's non-English-language film Globe win over two films that beat it at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, the fest's first-place winner (It Was Just an Accident) and runner-up (Sentimental Value), is a repeat of last week's result at the Critics Choice Awards, and calls into question the common wisdom that those other two are stronger contenders for not only a best international feature Oscar win but also best picture Oscar noms. Meanwhile, I've long thought that Moura — who won Cannes' best actor prize and was my guest on THR's Awards Chatter podcast last week — could be a sleeper threat at the Oscars to presumptive frontrunners Timothée Chalamet (A24's Marty Supreme) and Leonardo DiCaprio (One Battle After Another), who competed against each other in the other best actor Globes category, best actor (musical/comedy), with Chalamet prevailing. Moura understood the assignment when he used his Globes acceptance speech to tease viewers about what The Secret Agent is about and why it matters. Rose Byrne's best actress (musical/comedy) victory for a challenging little indie about a woman in crisis, A24's If I Had Legs I'd Kick You — over the likes of One Battle After Another's Chase Infiniti and the stars of two Focus films, Song Sung Blue's Kate Hudson and Bugonia's Emma Stone — could be a game-changer for the versatile and well-liked performer. It is far from certain that Byrne's movie — which, as she joked, was made for “eight-and-a-half dollars” — has even been seen by enough members of the Academy's actors branch to make her competitive with other actresses from higher-profile films who are also vying for a best actress Oscar nom. But her Globes recognition makes it far likelier that straggling Academy members will prioritize checking it out before casting their ballot. At the Actor Awards, at which all three ladies are again nominated, Taylor will now have some real wind behind her sails — to go with coattails from her film's best ensemble nominations, which the other two are lacking. But Skarsgård had a much-needed rebound on Sunday night, winning the best supporting actor Globe over Elordi, One Battle's Benicio Del Toro and Sean Penn, Hamnet's Paul Mescal and Adam Sandler for Netflix's Jay Kelly — six years after he won a Globe for his work on TV's Chernobyl — and talked up his “small Norwegian film with no money for advertising.” “Eva Victor is my hero,” Roberts gushed, adding the sort of publicity that money cannot buy: “Sorry, Baby — if you haven't seen it, see it!” Something like that could make a huge difference for Victor with Oscar voters, given that Sorry, Baby — a dark comedy about the aftermath of a sexual assault — is thought to be on the bubble for a nom in the best original screenplay Oscar race.

When Timothée Chalamet won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, a mini-debate broke out in IndieWire's Slack channel. What happened to his “Marty Supreme” swagger? Prior to Sunday night's ceremony, the King of Christmas had been making the marketing rounds practically in-character: Confident. But on the Globes stage in the Beverly Hilton ballroom, he was, as one colleague put it, “diminished.” “My dad instilled in me a spirit of gratitude growing up: Always be grateful for what you have,” Chalamet said. “It's allowed me to leave this ceremony in the past empty-handed, my head held high, grateful just to be here. But I'd be lying if I didn't say those moments didn't make this moment that much sweeter.” Related Stories Sound Editors Nominations Include ‘Kpop Demon Hunters,' ‘One Battle After Another' ‘Hamnet' Wins Best Picture, Drama, at 2026 Golden Globes Dressed in an all-black ensemble, Chalamet kept his voice even and expressions level, conveying sincerity without getting blubbery (it's just the Globes, after all) while earnestly acknowledging his director, Josh Safdie, co-stars (like Kevin O'Leary), and fellow nominees. With anything that could be construed as bragging confined to his closing line, the competitive drive fueling Chalamet for the past month was all but erased. Was it honest, or a calculated decision to dial things back? Some said they never found him more likable, while others compared his time onstage to a sleepy “wedding speech.” While yours truly believes Chalamet's speech is 100 percent in response to any perceived backlash to his brash PR blitz — with so many older Oscar voters still deciding how to rank their ballots, it never hurts to be humble — polite debates like the one I shared with my savvy IndieWire cohorts were as compelling as the Golden Globes got for those of us watching from home. Even for a “precursor” awards show, that's not saying much. At its best, the 2026 Golden Globes got out of its own way long enough to let the awards (and winners) speak for themselves. Great speeches from Rhea Seehorn, Rose Byrne, and the “Sinners” team were fun and/or sweet. Solid intros from presenters like Wanda Sykes, Don Cheadle, and Zoë Kravitz were memorable without overwhelming the honorees. It was a starry show (as it has to be), albeit one without a personality — which may not matter to general audiences in the here and now, but seems downright odd to veteran viewers and could spell trouble down the line. The 2026 Golden Globes certainly didn't bring back the “party” atmosphere so many past editions have bragged about, and with a Polymarket betting ticker popping up before every other commercial break (plus the Original Score award being handed out during one), it also wasn't a reputable presentation on the level of the Oscars, Emmys, or whatever serious organization prizes podcasts. Unforced errors surfaced far too often, from the Google Maps-ing of the ballroom (who cares where they're sitting? The celebrities showed up, and the audiences who weren't enamored with a 16-3 NFL game may have, too. Scraping by may be enough for an awards show still getting back on its feet, but it's not enough to compete with everything else fighting for our attention on a Sunday night in January. (You should not have skipped “Industry” for this.) The shrugs started with returning host Nikki Glaser, who feigned biting commentary with a CBS News joke (“America's newest place for B.S. news”) before largely falling back on easy gags. Stop me if you've heard any of these set-ups before: George Clooney's Nespresso ads. “The White Lotus” Season 3's incest, and Leonardo DiCaprio's (very) young dates. It's not that the punchlines were disastrous or defamatory. (If anything, they were so safe the subjects didn't have to worry about blushing through their reaction shot.) It's that they struggled to lead Glaser's opening monologue anywhere exciting. After becoming the 1,000,000th person to poke DiCaprio about his dating habits, Glaser kept going. “We don't know anything else about you!” Glaser said to the famously reclusive megastar. Glaser tried to find a different topic. But the best she could come up with was an old interview with Teen Beat magazine where DiCaprio said his favorite food was “pasta, pasta, and more pasta.” (Yes, it's real.) In that all-too-brief moment, when the “One Battle After Another” star wasn't sure where Glaser's prodding was headed — and we didn't either — the Golden Globes felt alive. But then it was over, Glaser said Sean Penn looked like a sexy leather handbag, and things quieted down. Sure, there were aberrations, like when Rose Byrne said her partner, Bobby Cannavale, missed her big win so he could attend a “reptile expo” in New Jersey, or when Teyana Taylor danced her way off stage after dedicating her trophy to “my brown sisters and little brown girls [who] belong in every room we walk into.” (And I'd be remiss to omit Glaser's extended repetition of a joke she made last year: I'm glad we got one verse of her “Marty Supreme”-inspired “Golden” parody! Granted, fading into the fray may be the best-case scenario for a show that kept encouraging its audience to place bets on the next round of winners and handed out yet another new award to a former host. But if the Golden Globes are ever going to establish an identity beyond “watch your favorite actors practice their speeches for future awards shows,” it'll need a lot more swagger than this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ditching a primary location is a time-honored TV tradition that dates back to I Love Lucy swapping Manhattan for the suburbs halfway through its sixth season. But Lucy and Ricky Ricardo are not who spring to mind when Pierpoint & Co.'s London trading floor was shuttered at the end of Industry's audacious third season. Both FNL and Industry could've called it a day with those defining season-three finales. Thankfully, Industry continues to tell stories, and, much like the move to East Dillon High, losing Pierpoint as a central hub offers new avenues that creators Mickey Down and Konrad Kay can fully explore. Rather than gently guide us back into this cutthroat corporate world with familiar faces, the opening sequence turns to new characters while still maintaining its signature sleazy, debauched hallmarks, moving from a crowded bar to a pulsing, hedonistic nightclub and ending at an enviable abode. Music supervisor Oliver White's mood-setting is on point throughout the hour (there are needle drops from New Order, The Prodigy, and Beach House), as is Nathan Micay's euphoric score. Fresh from the conclusion of Stranger Things, we follow Charlie Heaton (now using his native British accent) as Jim Dyker, an investigative journalist who briefly borrows sartorial and shifty moves from You's Joe Goldberg. Jim specifically targets Haley Clay (Kiernan Shipka), a young assistant at the fintech company Tender, which has just opened offices in the swanky Canary Wharf. Jim and Haley's introduction instantly pulls us into the murkiness by posing a question about Tender's practices. Whereas the first season gave Myha'la, Marisa Abela, David Jonsson, and Harry Lawtey breakout roles, recent additions are predominantly from high-profile shows such as Mad Men, The Handmaid's Tale, Ted Lasso, and the aforementioned Stranger Things. Thankfully, it only takes a beat to shake off any distraction. Last year, Kit Harington proved he could shed the vestiges of Jon Snow as the gloriously named Sir Henry Muck, whose green-tech energy company Lumi quickly fell off a financial cliff after a disastrous IPO. Still, I long for a few more rising stars like Miriam Petche's scene-stealing Sweetpea Golightly, who I am thrilled to see is back in season four. It has been just over a year since Harper got into business with opportunistic Otto Mostyn (Roger Barclay), and the wheels have come off. “I'm really tired of dancing around the fact that I was promised a fund and given what feels like a separately managed account with claustrophobic levels of oversight.” Otto has since retired, but his fingerprints remain on the shorts fund Harper is supposed to be managing. Industry is not one for spoon-feeding plot or pausing to explain the technical jargon fired at machine-gun speed. Even though Harper's short is working, sending a late-night client-wide email announcing that outflows from the fund are temporarily prohibited doesn't do her any favors. Rather than building to a confrontation with Otto later this season, Industry goes straight for the jugular, confidently opening with an irreparable rupture. The timing is impeccable as Harper has just slept with Tender co-founder Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella). On the surface, Whitney's image is far cleaner and less crass than that of co-founder and Tender CEO Jonah Atterbury (Kal Penn). However, Whitney barking orders at his assistant, Haley, to pick up the chair, demonstrates that he wears a mask of an HR-compliant boss trying to save the company from Jonah's bad behavior. Everything is calculated: Whitney fancies himself a market leader, and his late-stage capitalism rant underscores his vision for Tender 2.0 that Jonah is blocking. Is this too much reality seeping into the series? I'm not sure we needed a visual this obvious when Harper's confrontation with Otto says it all. Otto smugly announces to Harper that he has been anointed by the King in the House Of Lords and no longer has to watch his language because “woke shit no longer moves the needle in this new world.” While he doesn't use the words “DEI hire” when dismissing his need for a woman like Harper in 2026, she reads between the lines. Considering everything that has gone down between Eric and Harper, I am not expecting an easy road ahead. However, there is something heartening about the way they hash out terms in person, with Myha'la and Leung firing on all emotional cylinders. “I can't be a punching bag for another man's fear,” she tells him. In the past, they have brought out the worst in each other, but reviving their mutual respect during this face-to-face conversation is a turning point. Eric can't help but philosophize about the inertia of experiencing heaven on earth, and Harper is in hedge-fund hell. Is it enough to make their venture a success? “It's really funny how honest communication can feel like a fucking exorcism,” Harper says. Still, I cannot wait to see the inevitable fireworks go off. Now that is a bet I am willing to make.

After starting the bidding for Warner Bros. at $5, Glaser joked that many of the people in the room were sex criminals. “There are so many A-listers here, and by A-listers I do mean people that are on a list that has been heavily redacted,” Glaser quipped before taking aim at the Justice Department. “Yes, and the Golden Globe for Best Editing goes to the Justice Department.” (Of course, there's no Golden Globe for Best Editing—how silly!) “The award for most editing goes to CBS News,” said Glaser. “Yes, CBS News: America's newest place to see BS news. We needed another!” Glaser also offered a pretty good bit about not actually knowing anything about Leonardo DiCaprio other than the fact that all his girlfriends are in their 20s and called the Wicked sequel Wicked: For Money.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The music world is mourning founding Grateful Dead member Bob Weir. Don Was, Weir's bandmate in Wolf Bros since 2018, wrote, “Night after night, he taught us how to approach music with fearlessness and unbridled soul—pushing us beyond what we thought was musically possible. Every show was a transcendent adventure into the unknown.” “I love you, Bob, and will always fondly remember our many moments, so often transcendent, throwing chords and notes around in space, through the air, together.” Bravo host and noted Deadhead Andy Cohen said on Instagram, “Bob Weir wasn't The Other One, he was That Guy. I feel SO BLESSED to have gotten to know Bob and the equally wondrous Weir family through my friendship with John. That felt so graceful a way to put it, and a testament to the fluidity of all us in this world. Bob checked out but his music is going to live gloriously forever, and so will he. One of the absolute coolest and best to ever do it.” Phish's Trey Anastasio penned a lengthy tribute to Weir: Sad to hear that my friend Bobby has passed on. He was a sweet, kind, gentle friend, and I never believed this would happen so soon. I knew Bobby for many years, but it was in the lead-up to Fare Thee Well that we really became close. I went out to his beach house, and we spent three nights there alone, just the two of us: playing guitar, cooking scrambled eggs, listening to records, working out, talking, and walking on the beach. We went out to dinner together, and he let me drive his new car. Tascha, my heart is with you, Monet and Chloe today. Bobby told me incredible stories about his life during those days at the beach house. When it was over, the sun came out, and he had to do his math homework as he raced back to school on the train. He said after the second or third acid test, he looked down at his homework and said, “Nah.” And that was it. He told me stories about working on those classic Dead songs, what music the band was listening to as the songs were coming together. He said that when they were learning “Uncle John's Band,” they were listening to the first CSN album and trying to harmonize like them. Bobby was completely allergic to compliments in the most endearing way. Weir's Dead & Company bandmate John Mayer posted, “Okay Bob. “We lost a champion today,” Primus' Les Claypool posted to Instagram, alongside a photo of himself and Weir on stage together. “This guy was such a hero,” Heart's Nancy Wilson wrote. “The world is a sadder place without him in it. Mickey Hart said his bandmate “was a little brother to me for almost sixty years,” adding, “He was my first friend in the Grateful Dead. Bob had the ability to play unique chords that few others could. Jerry once told me that the harmonics Bob created became an inspiration for his own solos. When all of us were entrained, rhythm section, guitars, and voices... it was transcendent. Brandi Carlile shared, “Tonight I'm thinking about all our friends in music young and old and how @bobweir had time for all of us… he came to our shows, helped us write songs and got so many of us out on stage to jam and just stand in his light. Margo Price described Weir as “a sage—a profoundly wise, musical guru who taught me so much about songs, art, melody, meditation and being in the moment. He was both ancient and young—he always had a twinkle in his eye. Like a barefoot philosopher or the Lorax, he was mystical. Willie Nelson's son Micah Nelson—who records music as Particle Kid—compared Weir to “an imaginary character from some ancient cartoon, both fictional and hyper-real, a mystical song wizard, chiseled into reality rock…. Billy Strings wrote, “I've never knew a person so in tune with the cosmos. Former Eagles lead guitarist Don Felder said, “I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship. I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on “Rock You” from American Rock and Roll. Michael Franti wrote, “We shared the stage many times and he was always eager, wildly curious, and ready to try anything. “Bob Weir was a true son of California who helped create the soundtrack of a generation,” California Governor Gavin Newsom posted on X. “He was — and will always be — a king of psychedelic rock. Elsewhere, Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo quoted the lyrics to the Grateful Dead's “Sugar Magnolia”; Sean Ono Lennon said “It was a great pleasure and a privilege to know you, brother”; “God bless Bob Weir,” declared Billy Corgan; Slash posted ” RIP #BobWeir 💔”; the Empire State Building was lit up in tie-dye; and Bob Dylan shared a photo of himself onstage with the Dead, flanked by Weir and Jerry Garcia.
