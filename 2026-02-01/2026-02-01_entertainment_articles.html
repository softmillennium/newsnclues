                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Travis Kelce's ex Kayla Nicole put on a showstopping performance while dancing with Toni Braxton to the singer's 2000 track “He Wasn't Man Enough.” The podcaster, who was accused of dissing Kelce's fiancée, Taylor Swift, when she performed the viral dance for Halloween last year, stepped out in a mini silver beaded dress at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, Calif., on Saturday night. In a separate video shared by Braxton, 58, the hitmaker could be heard saying into the microphone mid-dance, “Kayla, is he man enough?” Several people applauded Nicole's onstage performance, with one commenting under a video, “You're doing ✨amazing✨ Kayla 🫶🏾.” Nicole, 34, also shared a backstage video alongside the “Spanish Guitar” songstress, captioning it, “Still trying to find the words, but for now … T, THANK YOU.” Additionally, the media personality posted a behind-the-scenes clip of herself inside Braxton's dressing room.

Nicole, who dated Kelce from 2017 to 2022, was accused of taking a dig at Swift, 36, after she dressed as Braxton and recreated her “He Wasn't Man Enough” music video last October. Fans applauded Nicole's alleged diss, with one writing, “This is how you have the last laugh.” Braxton was later asked how she felt about Nicole dressing up as her for Halloween during an interview with “Entertainment Tonight.” Kelce, also 36, has been dating the “Fortnight” songstress since 2023.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As another round of files in the Jeffrey Epstein case drops, Casey Wasserman is apologizing for his correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell. On Sunday, the sports agent and LA Olympics chairman said in a statement that he's “terribly sorry” for associating with Maxwell back in 2002, years before she was arrested in 2020 and charged with assisting Epstein with his sexual abuse of minors. “I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,” said Wasserman. “I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.” Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on five counts of sex trafficking and abuse of minors, for which she was given 20 years in prison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The late Catherine O'Hara's “Wyatt Earp” co-star, Brett Cullen, visited her home a day after her heartbreaking passing. Cullen, who played Saddle Tramp in the 1994 biographical Western drama film, appeared somber as he stopped by O'Hara's residence on Saturday. In a photo shared by Page Six, the actor was spotted outside the late actress's home wearing a brown jacket and black jeans, along with a black baseball cap and dark sunglasses. The film earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography. In the wake of Catherine O'Hara's death, some mourners paid their respects outside her home to honor the beloved actress. Tributes also poured in on social media from fans and fellow celebrities. O'Hara's “Home Alone” son, Macaulay Culkin, shared a heartfelt message for his “mama.” I thought we had time,” the actor, 45, wrote on Instagram. But I had so much more to say. O'Hara's family is set to bid a final farewell following her tragic passing on January 30. Her representative confirmed in an obituary that a “private celebration of life will be held by the family.” Two weeks prior to her shocking death, O'Hara was reportedly in “great spirits” during one of her last outings. According to the Daily Mail, the actress appeared to be in good shape during a brief appearance at an event for Supermodels Unlimited magazine, held at Lisa Vanderpump's SUR restaurant in West Hollywood, on January 13. Meanwhile, Page Six reported that the actress experienced “breathing difficulty” when first responders were called to her home at 4:48 a.m. She was then rushed to the hospital in a “serious condition.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

And Maryna Er Gorbach, the Ukrainian director of Klondike, debuted her short Rotation at Rotterdam.Both shorts were backed by the Displacement Film Fund, a scheme unveiled last year by Cate Blanchett and IFFR's Hubert Bals Fund to provide five displaced directors with €100,000 ($120,000) grants. 'The Arab' Director on Moving From Docs to Fiction for the Story of an Unnamed Figure in Albert Camus' 'The Stranger': Rotterdam Oscar-Nominated 'The Secret Agent' Director Decries "Outdated" Casting Practices in Rotterdam Fest Talk: "It's Not About Good Looks" The 12-minute-long Rotation is about a therapeutic hypnosis ritual experienced by a young Ukrainian woman who shifted from civilian life to military service due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Er Gorbach tells THR that her film came “from this creative freedom we had, because there was no expectation for us. “Right now, I want to talk about the displacement of normality for people who were civilians and came into the army services. In her research, she talked to people with insight and learned a lot. “And sometimes they go to this therapeutic hypnosis where it is proposed that they forgive themselves for [the fact that] they could not save their friends or just say goodbye to them.” So, Rotation is not about physical but “metaphysical and emotional displacement.” “So, she's basically living this kind of rotation, going to the frontline, shooting, and all that.” “My team found one of the last film stocks somewhere in a shelter,” Er Gorbach recalls. So it was kind of a journey for us.” “They train at lunchtime behind closed doors, talking about body norms and their daily life,” reads a synopsis. They fled to Iran, and I was born in Iran,” where she experienced “racism against Afghan refugees and immigrants.” Actually, “I experienced a high dose of racism as a child before I understood what racism meant,” she recalls. So I was always trying my best to be Iranian. She lived there for 20 years, “and then, four years ago, when Kabil collapsed, a lot of people, including me and my family, evacuated to Germany,” recalls Sadat. “And I had a lot of friends [for whom] it was the first time to leave and really experience how life is for refugees. Sadat describes film as a form of therapy. “It is a therapy for finding my voice, finding myself, talking about things that matter in the way that I think they matter,” she shares. It doesn't matter what passport I'm holding. I'm a human being with the experience of living in different places. Super Afghan Gym also deals with questions of identity and home. “As a woman, I never really felt at home in my own body,” Sadat says. Social media reactions to news of her short film were divided. “A lot of Afghan men were attacking me, saying I was fabricating this experience. ‘Women are not going into the gym in Kabul. There are these gyms, and this is the only excitement. And there's no news of how the situation is going to end.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Send us a tip using our anonymous form.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I've become so accustomed to Saturday Night Live episodes needing to get over multiple humps of weak cold opens, monologues that are often more cute or functional than laugh-out-loud funny, and/or the heavy sigh of a leadoff game-show sketch that when an episode actually starts strong, it can produce an outsized elation and inflated expectations. 20 minutes into Alexander Skarsgård's first hosting gig, it seemed like it might be one of those weird cases where a relatively low-expectation host, in this case one where maybe you have to repeatedly look up which one is this guy and which one is his brother who also acts because they've both played vampires, winds up presiding over a season highlight. You know, sort of like a normie boyfriend unexpectedly delivering twisted jokes for every occasion! That's not even to say the cold open of this week's episode was an all-timer. But it wasn't Trump doing stand-up, and took some actual (if belated) shots at the poisonous ICE mentality, even if the writers—can we just be real and say Colin Jost here? In this case, it was Pete Davidson somewhat pointlessly playing border czar Tom Homan; Davidson is too naturally likable (and even, in his way, sensible) to be of much use as a guy currently best-known for being somewhat less overly Nazi-coded than his predecessor. Still: This required seemingly more effort than usual, and what a relief to see James Austin Johnson freed from the Trump shtick that's become his gift/curse, instead offering deadpan “probably wrong” answers to simple questions. Moreover, following a technically above-average cold open, the next few segments were top-notch, starting with a short, simple, and delightfully ridiculous monologue bit where Skarsgård, lacking some kind of immediately well-known persona to riff off, talked about wanting to put a spotlight on the house band for the show's 1,000th (!) From there, Skarsgård backed off to play a relatively quiet dad in an exceedingly well-acted lead-off sketch about a mom (Ashley Padilla) announcing to her family that she has maybe kinda-sorta finally come around on Trump being bad for the country—a potentially hoary premise that might have felt mistimed at any point in the past, what, decade? Yet here it was so well-written, and benefited so mightily from Padilla's patience as a performer, her willingness to delay a punchline for the sake of precision, that it landed near-perfectly. Sadly, that high didn't last, and the sketches got, well, sketchier after that—hit-and-miss within the sketches themselves, rather than just between them. After Skarsgård's free-floating, do-whatever goofiness earlier in the episode, it was a little surprising to see him circle back to check off stuff from his Wikipedia bio, even if the general audience might not remember that yes, he actually played Tarzan in a movie that, yes, was actually kind of a hit. And there was, naturally, one sketch treating his height as a sight gag. Skarsgård didn't fully return to his essential yet less persona-specific strangeness until the very end of the night, when he played a “funny” boyfriend cribbing his “random” quips from Cards Against Humanity. What lingered was the sense that the show doesn't need a legacy star or old cast member for an installment that feels vaguely like a throwback (complimentary). Besides, most comedies don't really hit their stride until they've done at least three thousand. As mentioned, that early stretch was terrific, including Wickline finally speaking for those of us who feel strongly that doing fast sports in the cold sounds, frankly, terrible. Again, I know she's divisive among some fans, but every time she's the focus of a segment like that, it's perfectly judged. While the Tarzan and Cards Against Humanity sketches weren't quite as great as the early stuff, they both had an agreeable early '90s vibe, especially Tarzan, even if you felt like Kevin Nealon would have played it better. It's hard to begrudge the show an occasional recurring sketch these days, given how infrequently they go there, but back-to-back returns of the Scandinavian Film Set and Immigrant Dad Talk Show, both featuring a droll cameo from the host's real-life dad Stellan Skarsgård, recalled a '90s episode in a bad way, and was maybe not the best strategy. Neither made me laugh much, but I'd give the edge in unfunniness to Immigrant Dad Talk Show. It's a much stronger recurring concept overall but already feels like it's running on fumes after three installments, even as the Skarsgård family brought in some minor variations. Also, the sketch featuring Skarsgård as the awkwardly tall and ill-tempered Iowa transplant Agnes alienating her young peers felt like it wasn't quite there. But there was also a nagging wateriness about how old these girls were supposed to be; I'm not saying there aren't any kinds who like both Olivia Rodrigo and Bluey (I know, everyone loves Bluey) but between those details, the dialogue, and the general playdate situation, it was hard to tell where between the vast 5-to-10 spectrum the “normal” characters were supposed to be, which throws off their contrast to the outlier character. That might sound astonishingly literal-minded for a sketch where adults dress-up like kids, but that kind of uncertainty can make an outlandish premise harder to sell. I was about ready to say that unless I spend the next month mainlining Heated Rivalry, Connor Storrie will rep the rare SNL host where his episode will be where I see him act for the first time. But I guess he was in the Joker sequel that I reviewed for this very website, so technically that isn't true. Meanwhile, this will be the fourth musical-guest appearance from Mumford & Sons.

In the film, his name is Moussa, and his story is told through the testimony of his aging brother Haroun to a journalist, making the film an exploration of memory, identity, and colonialism, given that Algeria was a French colony for 132 years until 1962.

It is a murder mystery without clear or easy answers. During a Q&A following the world premiere of The Arab, Bensmaïl was asked about moving from doc to fiction film. “I make no difference between documentaries and fiction,” he shared via an interpreter. “But what was especially interesting in this case was to pull out features that the actors already had and to show their own political, and maybe also psychological, features. “The mother actually becomes enthralled by this craziness of revenge,” said Bensmaïl.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update took on the new Melania Trump documentary and Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem's baseless claims about the Alex Pretti shooting. But, as co-anchor Colin Jost joked, a more fitting title would be “Wicked: For Real“—a play on last year's fantasy film co-starring Cynthia Erivo as the Wicked Witch of the West. Michael Che then noted that the documentary, which some of its crew members want nothing to do with, was directed by Rush Hour‘s Brett Ratner. “That explains this scene,” he said, rolling a clip of Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) badgering Jackie Chan's character—with Trump's face superimposed on him—about whether she speaks any English. Che then turned to the fatal shooting last week in Minneapolis of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. “Homeland Security's initial review of the Alex Pretti shooting does not say that he attacked officers, which contradicts Kristi Noem's claims,” Che said. Noem had insisted that officers were justifed in shooting Pretti ten times in the back while unarmed, claiming, “This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.” 'SNL' Cold Open: Bumbling ICE Agents Reveal Just How Bad They Are at Their Jobs Che joked about the DHS's finding: “None of that really matters to Kristi Noem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bernie Taupin has written dozens of hit songs across nearly six decades, so his tips about songwriting deserve close attention, by fledging songwriters and veterans alike. Taupin delivered them as he accepted a Trustees Award from the Recording Academy at their annual Special Merit Awards at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles on Monday (Jan. 31). “I've been waiting 57 years to get one of these,” Taupin said in accepting the honorary Grammy. Indeed, rather incredibly, Taupin has yet to win a Grammy in competition. But Taupin's warm and generous speech showed that, in the life of a songwriter, the work is its own reward. “From the first day that I ever wanted to write songs, it wasn't songs so much, I wanted to tell stories. Taupin's achievements have earned him the Gershwin Prize for Popular Song, a dozen Ivor Novello Awards, an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and a Commander of the British Empire honor. Taupin is this year's only Special Merit Award recipient who is also nominated for a competitive award at the 68th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday (Feb. 1). He and his longtime collaborator Elton John, along with Brandi Carlile and Andrew Watt, are nominated for best song written for visual media for co-writing “Never Too Late” from the music documentary Elton John: Never Too Late. And I'm going all the way back to people like Cole Porter and Duke Ellington, the great Merle Haggard, and then recently, my good friend Brian Wilson, one of the greats; one of the few people I might add who can be labelled a genius, along with one of the only people, I think, that can be called a poet, and that's Leonard Cohen. “This brings me to the opportunity to salute someone who actually isn't here tonight, but is getting one of these awards [a lifetime achievement award]. And for me, I was going to think that he's probably one of, but I think he is the greatest American songwriter alive – exquisite melodies, extraordinary lyrics and ideas that transcend the stars. So, while I'm happy to get this award tonight, I am absolutely thrilled to be the shadow of Paul Simon.

And I will forever be grateful,” Timberlake continued. Shortly after, he revealed doctors had diagnosed him Lyme Disease. “I've been battling some health issues, and was diagnosed with Lyme disease -— which I don't say so you feel bad for me –– but to shed some light on what I've been up against behind the scenes,” he said in a statement shared to his Instagram. The former NSYNC member added that Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection spread by ticks, “can be relentlessly debilitating, both mentally and physically.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Being diagnosed helped the “shocked” Grammy winner understand “why [he] would be onstage and in a massive amount of nerve pain or, just feeling crazy fatigue or sickness.” As a result, the “Mirrors” hitmaker was plagued with “a personal decision” — whether he would “stop touring” or “keep going and figure it out.” He ultimately decided to keep performing, saying that the “joy” his work brings him “far outweighs the fleeting stress my body was feeling.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Country singer Garth Brooks has publicly mourned the loss of his publicist, Nancy Seltzer, whom he cared for. Brooks honored Seltzer with a lengthy post on his official website. Titled “​​Nancy Seltzer Has Passed — Quiet Hollywood Giant Leaves Legacy of Integrity and Class,” the post features a photo of Seltzer and a comment about who she was and what she did. “Public relations legend Nancy Seltzer passed away after a brief hospital stay this week, leaving behind a legacy that shaped decades of entertainment history — often quietly, always with integrity, dogged determination, and purpose,” the statement reads. The statement commented on Seltzer's career and celebrity clients, who included Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Robert Downey Jr., and Whitney Houston. “She wore publicist black like a uniform and kept the focus exactly where she believed it belonged: on her clients,” the statement reads. Her wisdom, earned through decades of experience, was unmatched. Those who worked alongside her understood the gravitas that she carried — and the grace with which she carried it.” “Public relations is the hardest job in show business,” he said. “She always handled every situation with the utmost class.” It is unclear how much of the message on his website he wrote. However, it is clear that Seltzer meant enough to him to share the news of her passing with a message that is an undeniable celebration of her life and her career. The statement ends with a powerful message: “In an industry built on visibility, Nancy Seltzer chose discretion. In a business driven by ego, she led with loyalty. And in moments that demanded strength, she offered calm. Seltzer died on Wednesday, January 28, in Los Angeles, Variety reports. She created long lasting friendships with people from all over the world to whom she was also wonderful, kind, caring and fiercely loyal,” they shared.
