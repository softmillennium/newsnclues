                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Costa Rica heads to the polls this Sunday to pick a new president after an election season overshadowed by crime and political apathy. Amid persisting violence from criminal groups in a country long-considered a peaceful tourist hub, polling reveals that Costa Ricans are most concerned about security this year. Voters are also distressed by the decline in their quality of life, as well as the country's muddled political landscape – a fact indicated by the twenty candidates for president alone. If no one reaches that threshold, the top two head to a runoff. Second place is occupied by nobody at all – more than a quarter of those CIEP-UCR surveyed are undecided. What Costa Rica's rise in crime means for tourists seeking ‘pura vida' Costa Rica's struggle with criminal violence in recent years is a cruel irony. The country has long been a model for peace. It was the first nation to abolish its armed forces, a point of national pride in a region marked by political turmoil. Yet government figures show that the last three years have been some of the most violent in recent Costa Rican history, with 905 homicides in 2023, an all-time record. The region's struggle against crime is overshadowed by one government in particular: El Salvador and its self-described “dictator” Nayib Bukele. Bukele brought murder rates in El Salvador to historic lows through a gargantuan imprisonment campaign and police crackdown, but faces numerous allegations of human rights violations, especially regarding his notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT). Nonetheless, he remains extremely popular in Latin America. He's also sought to promote his brand of iron-fist rule in Costa Rica, where the government broke ground on a CECOT-style prison last month with Bukele's blessing. “Nayib Bukele's presence is important, legitimate, and honors us,” declared the retiring incumbent President Rodrigo Chaves at the groundbreaking ceremony. José Andrés Díaz González, political scientist at Costa Rica's National University in Heredia, told CNN that the security crisis is part and parcel with a decline in the country's social services. Díaz pointed out that Costa Rica faces the same demographic cliff as many other countries: the population is getting older, threatening further strain on a safety net already coming apart at the seams. “In 15 or 20 years, the pension system will be under greater pressure, there will be fewer contributors, less tax revenues and greater demands for care for the elderly population.” The country became the first in Central America to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2021, and that organization's latest reports on Costa Rica also paint a rosy initial picture: an “improved” fiscal situation with declining unemployment, declining debt and tech products making up a growing share of the country's exports. Among peer nations, OECD reported, Costa Rica's growth has been “more resilient and stronger.” “Costa Rica has economic growth that is disengaged from people's well-being,” Merino told CNN. He explained that much of the growth is concentrated in so-called “free trade zones,” which offer significant tax breaks and customs exemptions for investors. Leo XIV speaks out on ‘dictatorship' of economic inequality and support for migrants in first major text This wear and tear is also reflected in a marked political apathy among everyday Costa Ricans. According to Merino, three decades ago nearly every person in Costa Rica was affiliated with a political party. In 2022, Costa Rica registered the lowest voter turnout in its recent history, with two out of five eligible voters staying home on election day. Both Díaz and Merino agree that the Costa Rican social pact — built over more than a century — is at stake. Environmental concerns have held a central place in Costa Rica's identity for years, much like its lack of a standing army, and the country has set ambitious sustainability goals. The idea of a “green Costa Rica” coexists today with proposals for ending a two-decade-old ban on fossil fuel exploration and exploiting natural resources such as precious metals, gas and oil. If something is not done, the deterioration can continue,” said Díaz, “and so far no political party has considered this issue with the seriousness it requires.” Election day in Costa Rica will not just determine who holds political office. Will an army-less country known for its environmentalism become the next El Salvador?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cherub at landmark church causes ecclesiastical and political uproar with alleged resemblance to Italian PM Italy's culture minister and the diocese of Rome have launched investigations after claims were made that an angel in a landmark church in Rome was restored in the likeness of the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. The resemblance was first flagged by the newspaper La Repubblica, which noted that one of the two angels flanking a marble bust of Italy's last king in the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina now had “a familiar, astonishingly contemporary face”. It added: “Before the restoration, there was a generic cherub. The front-page story set off a flurry of reactions. They had been told to “establish the nature of the work carried out”, it said in a statement, and would “decide what action to take”. As before-and-after photos made the rounds on social media, Meloni weighed in, seemingly poking fun at the curious controversy. On Instagram, she posted a picture of the restored angel, adding: “No, I definitely do not look like an angel,” alongside a laughing emoji. The original painting dated back to the year 2000, meaning it was not under any sort of heritage protection, he added. Opposition politicians were swift to take aim. “What has emerged is unacceptable,” Irene Manzi, of the centre-left Partito Democratico, said in a statement that called for an investigation into whether the restoration breached heritage regulations. “We cannot allow art and culture to risk becoming a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister,” the party said. The Diocese of Rome said its vicar general, Baldassare Reina, had expressed “disappointment” over what had happened and would “immediately initiate the necessary investigations” to determine who was responsible. “It is firmly reiterated that images of sacred art and Christian tradition cannot be misused or exploited, as they are intended exclusively to support liturgical life and personal and communal prayer,” it said. “They asked me to fix it and I did,” said Bruno Valentinetti. “I worked on it for two years and finished the work a year ago.” I traced it and put the colour back in. He denied reports of being linked to rightwing politics in the past, saying he couldn't remember how long it had been since he had voted, and he repeatedly shot down any suggestion of a likeness to the prime minister. “I restored the faces to how they were 25 years ago.” In an interview with La Repubblica, Valentinetti noted that the swirling debate over the painting had come with an upside: “In the past years we've never seen so many people in this church.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But effort fell short of state surgeon general's promise to end Florida's immunization mandates altogether Republicans advanced a bill in the Florida legislature this week to weaken vaccine protections for children, but it fell well short of state surgeon general Joseph Ladapo's promise made last year to end immunization mandates. The proposed new law, introduced by Jacksonville state senator Clay Yarborough, and which narrowly passed the chamber's health policy committee on Monday in a 6-4 vote, seeks only to expand exemptions for parents who do not want their school-age children vaccinated. In September, Ladapo, a longtime vaccine skeptic appointed by Florida's hard-right governor, Ron DeSantis, caused outrage among public health experts when he declared children in the state would no longer be required to receive vaccines against a number of preventable diseases. Yarborough's bill would appear to indicate that Republicans have chosen, and their decision is not to support the surgeon general's sweeping anti-vaccine agenda, which was already showing signs of stress soon after he announced it. It will require medical providers to advise parents and caregivers of the “risks, benefits, safety and efficacy of each vaccine being administered” using materials provided by state-run medical boards. “We are about to go down a road that's going to create a major problem for children, but also for seniors and those who cannot be vaccinated,” Gayle Harrell, state senator for the city of Stuart, said, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Separately, Florida's health department is moving towards eliminating requirements for some vaccines that are not mandated by law. The department has not yet published a proposed rule. Florida's anti-vaccine drive has parallels in health secretary Robert F Kennedy's federal-level rejection of immunizations and pursuit of what many see as a science-free health agenda. Three cases of measles have been reported in Florida already this year. “The public is overwhelmingly supportive of children being vaccinated. They don't want their kids to get sick,” Rivkees said. “[But] so much distrust has been put in place that makes those of us in medicine less effective than we would have been even just six months ago.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was when trade talks between Delhi and Brussels were initiated for the first time. It would not be until this very week, almost 20 years later, that a deal was signed after a few final months of unusually rapid negotiations. On Tuesday last week, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, announced the “mother of all deals,” which promises to bring together about 2 billion consumers and a quarter of the world's GDP. The agreement opens parts of India's famously protectionist domestic market with a focus on exporting manufacturing and services. In return, middle-class Indian consumers should find it cheaper to buy European cars and wine. The answer has everything to do with US President Donald Trump. The original talks had proceeded slowly over differences on cars, alcohol, agriculture and dairy — and were abandoned entirely in 2013. They were resumed in 2022 as the post-pandemic world sought to “de-risk” and diversify supply chains beyond China. That a close ally was threatening territorial sovereignty prompted a widely shared sense of Europe being “home alone” amid frictions in the tightly woven transAtlantic relations. To add to the chaos, on his first day in office Trump imposed punishing tariffs on America's neighbors, Canada and Mexico — a move that culminated in the “liberation day” taxes levied on 90 countries across the world. “De-risking” and “decoupling” are back in vogue in Europe — except that the target is Trump's US, rather than China. The move by the French government to ban officials from using US video-conferencing software such as Zoom and instead promote its home-grown Visio platform is a case in point. The wide scope of the evolving India-EU partnership suggests a move toward greater convergence in terms of the commitment to multilateral institutions, and cooperation in a range of areas of security and defense, research, mobility and connectivity, including enhanced engagement in the Indo-Pacific region. The trade deal is the largest of its kind but is part of a growing trend as many nations attempt to forge new alliances. While ratification and implementation take time, and might even hit a roadblock or two (such as the delay in the EU-Mercosur deal), it suggests a shift that is unmistakable. The world many outside the west have long dreamed about — of multipolarity, strategic autonomy, even de-dollarization — is taking shape, first slowly and then rapidly. A day before the EU-India summit, EU leaders were for the first time guests of honor at India's Republic Day celebrations, invited to witness the military parade and colorful pageantry. That is a relatively modest sum for the effect on international perception, and At the end of last year, a diplomatic development with consequences reaching well beyond the regional level emerged. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Israel's recognition of Somaliland as a sovereign state, paving the way for political, economic and strategic cooperation with the African nation. The diplomatic breakthrough yields, above all, substantial and tangible benefits for the two countries, enhancing Somaliland's international posture, with a state prepared to champion its bid for broader legitimacy. With Israel's support, Somaliland might also benefit from the expertise of Israeli companies in fields such as mineral exploration and water management, as underscored by Israeli Minister of Chile has elected a new government that has the opportunity to take a fresh look at some key aspects of foreign economic policy, mainly a greater focus on Asia, including Taiwan. Still, in the great scheme of things, Chile is a small nation in Latin America, compared with giants such as Brazil and Mexico, or other major markets such as Colombia and Argentina. So why should Taiwan pay much attention to the new administration? Because the victory of Chilean president-elect Jose Antonio Kast, a right-of-center politician, can be seen as confirming that the continent is undergoing one of its periodic political shifts, On Sunday, elite free solo climber Alex Honnold — famous worldwide for scaling sheer rock faces without ropes — climbed Taipei 101, once the world's tallest building and still the most recognizable symbol of Taiwan's modern identity. Widespread media coverage not only promoted Taiwan, but also saw the Republic of China (ROC) flag fluttering beside the building, breaking through China's political constraints on Taiwan. That visual impact did not happen by accident.</p>

Nipah virus infection is to be officially listed as a category 5 notifiable infectious disease in Taiwan in March, while clinical treatment guidelines are being formulated, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday. With Nipah infections being reported in other countries and considering its relatively high fatality rate, the centers on Jan. 16 announced that it would be listed as a notifiable infectious disease to bolster the nation's systematic early warning system and increase public awareness, the CDC said. Bangladesh reported four fatal cases last year in separate districts, with three linked to raw date palm sap consumption, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Two Taiwanese prosecutors were questioned by Chinese security personnel at their hotel during a trip to China's Henan Province this month, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said yesterday. The officers had personal information on the prosecutors, including “when they were assigned to their posts, their work locations and job titles,” MAC Deputy Minister and spokesman Liang Wen-chieh (梁文傑) said. Reports of Taiwanese going missing, being detained or interrogated, or having their personal liberties restricted in China increased about fourfold annually last year, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said yesterday. Last year, 221 Taiwanese who traveled to China were reported missing, were detained and interrogated, or otherwise had their personal freedom restricted, up from 55 the previous year, the council said. Reopening group tours to China would be risky, as it would leave travelers with no way to seek help through official channels after Beijing shut down dialogue between the associations tasked with handling cross-strait tourism, the MAC said.

The UN Tourism Organization publication said that its focus has switched from whether a country has returned to pre-COVID-19 levels of tourism to the amount spent by a tourist during an overseas trip. The nation last year welcomed 8.57 million international tourists, about 9 percent more than in 2024, with most tourists coming from Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong and Macau, all of which accounted for at least 1 million tourists each.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans of President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have made “Melania” a breakout hit by box office standards. The documentary is on track to earn about $7 million in its opening weekend, with ticket sales reflecting a familiar red/blue divide in America. Then again, “Melania” also received a marketing rollout unlike any other documentary, complete with ads on buses and commemorative popcorn tins at theaters. The company that financed it, Amazon MGM Studios, still has a long way to go to break even. On Sunday, Kevin Wilson, the head of domestic theatrical distribution for the studio, said, “we are confident in the long-term value this rollout will deliver to customers both in theaters, and for years to come on Prime Video.” “The Daily Show” host Desi Lydic phrased it as a question on premiere night: “Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?” Amazon asserted that “we licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.” Professional reviewers — who weren't given a chance to screen the film in advance — have panned “Melania” as a vapid infomercial. “Melania” is not really a documentary at all, but rather a hagiographic “reality TV” special that “preaches to the faithful,” The Bulwark culture editor Sonny Bunch wrote. Bunch called it “fascinating to see so pure and naked an instrument of graft and propaganda deployed to great effect on an audience happy to lap it up.” Industry sources said the top-performing markets for “Melania” included Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, and West Palm Beach. Opinions about the film predictably broke along partisan lines. Trump critics shared screenshots of empty theaters in big liberal cites to mock “Melania” while Trump fans shared photos of group outings in conservative suburbs. 3 overall for the weekend, behind the Sam Raimi-directed horror adventure “Send Help” and YouTube star Markiplier's self-financed film “Iron Lung.” Given that “Melania” won't be in theaters for long, there is no way that Amazon will recoup its costs from the theatrical release. But box office figures are not the only way to measure success, since “Melania” and three companion TV episodes are going to stream on Prime Video, and the studio can eventually recoup more of its spend via advertising and Prime signups. A streaming premiere date has not yet been announced, but industry experts say most of the project's overall audience will come on Prime Video. “We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for ‘Melania' exceeding our expectations,” Wilson said. “This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.” A New York Times reporter asked President Trump about it at the premiere on Thursday in Washington, DC. “Amazon paid $75 million to make and market this film,” reporter Shawn McCreesh said. Many Americans think that this is maybe Jeff Bezos trying to get in good with you, and they would call it an act of corporate corruption.” President Trump interrupted and asked, “Who are you with?” After criticizing The Times, he sidestepped the topic, saying, “I'm not involved. Over the weekend, he played movie promoter on Truth Social, urging people to “check it out” and linking to Amazon's website for the film. This story hasd been updated with additional content.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump wants to go down in history as a peacemaker and is "trying to make that happen," Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev said in an interview with TASS, Reuters, and the Wargonzo project. "Trump, it is obvious, wants to go down in history as a peacemaker and he is trying. He is genuinely trying to do this," Medvedev noted. According to him, the chaos often used to describe the actions of US President Donald Trump in fact conceals a carefully thought-out policy. "He (Trump — TASS) is an emotional person, but on the other hand, that very chaos people like to talk about, which his actions are said to create, is not quite so. It is obvious that behind it lies a fully deliberate and well-calibrated line," the deputy head of the Security Council emphasized. Therefore, Medvedev added, Trump's style of governance is "original, but in some ways quite effective." Medvedev also noted that US President Donald Trump, as a former businessman, "acts forcefully," which is quite effective in dealings with many European countries. "As a former businessman — and there are no truly former businessmen, just as there are some other things that are never truly former — he always acts forcefully: I will scare you, then step back, and you will agree to half of my terms," Medvedev explained. The deputy head of the Security Council noted that "this is quite effective — in relations with the UK, with other European countries, and with many other countries as well.</p>

MOSCOW, February 1. /TASS/. Russian servicemen in the special military operation zone have liberated the settlements of Zelenoye in the Kharkov Region and Sukhetskoye in the Donetsk People's Republic, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

"Units of the North battlegroup, as a result of active operations, liberated the settlement of Zelenoye in the Kharkov Region. <…> Units of the Center battlegroup liberated the settlement of Sukhetskoye in the Donetsk People's Republic," the ministry said.

At the same time, total losses of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the special military operation zone over the past day amounted to about 1,085 servicemen.

Thus, in the area of responsibility of the North battlegroup, Ukrainian losses exceeded 130 servicemen; the West battlegroup — more than 150; the South battlegroup — up to 125; the Center battlegroup — over 375; the East battlegroup — up to 275; and the Dnepr battlegroup — up to 30 servicemen.</p>

Benedict Smith is a US Reporter based in Washington. He has covered stories on the Trump administration, Russia-Ukraine war and Epstein files. He joined through the paper's Editorial Graduate Programme and has previously worked at PA Media. Icebreakers, as these vessels are known, can weigh more than 30,000 tons and have become critical in moving cargo, supplying research stations and projecting military power in the region. Canada, which has a formidable array of icebreakers, plus the expertise to design and build them, could help Donald Trump assert his authority in the region. The president openly covets Greenland's mineral riches, which he may be able to exploit under a preliminary deal struck with Nato this month. Fortunately for him, he has inherited a pact from the previous administration, under which Canada and Finland agreed to use their maritime expertise to help design and build six of these ships for the US. Most of its military bases on Greenland, which Mr Trump recently suggested he could seize by force, were left to freeze over, and its icebreaker fleet was left to decline. Washington had little appetite for providing an extra billion dollars or so it would take to design and build another icebreaker, according to Adml Bill Baumgartner, who retired from the US Coast Guard in 2013. “Politically, many people were saying, ‘We really haven't had very much icebreaking capability for the last couple decades. Before that there were only two, “which was just abysmal”, Adml Baumgartner said. Of those, the Polar Star has been in service since 1976, and has been extended decades beyond its expected 30-year lifespan with millions of dollars spent on repairs. According to a congressional report, its equipment frequently breaks down, while fires have occurred onboard. But it's even lagging behind China, which in 2018 declared itself a “near-Arctic state”. The US believes it needs somewhere between eight or nine icebreakers to support its polar missions over the coming years, or risk surrendering its foothold to rival powers. A new class of 23,000-ton polar security cutters was expected to be completed by 2024, but that has been delayed repeatedly and now is not expected before 2030. Joe Biden, the former US president, struck a deal with Canada and Finland in 2024 to create a fleet of six vessels, which are meant to have a range of 12,000 nautical miles, operate for two months without resupply and break through 4ft of ice. The Telegraph understands that two of these Arctic security cutters, as they are known, will be built in Finland, while another four will be made in an American shipyard. Both Canada and Finland have decades of technical expertise in building icebreakers, which is now an important point of leverage when it comes to dealing with the Trump administration. Mr Trump, when he returned to office last January, declared he wanted 40 icebreakers – doubtless driven by a desire to equal Russian capabilities. But he also declared he could do it without the help of Canada, a country that has a vastly larger icebreaker fleet than the US, not to mention years of expertise in designing and building the ships. While many dismissed the president's threats as mere trolling, Ottawa has taken him seriously. So seriously, in fact, that last week it was reported its military had drawn up plans to respond to a US invasion, which predicted the country would be overrun in a matter of days. It is notable how the president, who occasionally rattles a sabre in Ottawa's general direction, has dropped his public attacks on the ICE Pact (Icebreaker Collaboration Effort), as Mr Biden's deal was known. Icebreakers, equipped with a rounded bow that allows them to mount an ice sheet before its enormous weight crashes through it, are subject to constant wear and tear that limits their natural lifespan. That means that the US is currently “at the mercy” of its allies if something goes wrong with its modest fleet, Adml Baumgartner said. “It is important… to have good relations” with countries like Canada and Finland because of this, he added. Breaking ice to keep America moving.Winter weather doesn't stop commerce, or the U.S. Coast Guard. Heather Conley, a former state department official, cast doubt on how willing Canadian leaders would be to exploit the ICE Pact for leverage and potentially hurt its own companies and shipyards in the process. Michael Byers, an expert in the Arctic with the University of British Columbia, cast doubt on whether Ottawa was willing to play its final “icebreaker card”. “If relations got really bad, then you could imagine saying, ‘Well, sorry, not this year.' And that would potentially put the Americans in a bind,” he said. Canada claims ownership of the waters, although this has never been accepted by Washington. “Finland has a strong reputation for icebreaker construction, and the US remains interested in potential vessel purchases from Helsinki... Canada is not out of the equation, however, given its own expertise in Arctic navigation and icebreakers,” he said. We quietly go about it, and we stay out of the direct limelight, and just allow ourselves to continue to work,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. “Everybody needs to be everybody's friend… this is one of those places where, yes, I do understand sovereignty, I do understand all those other different things, but there are deeper bonds.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities. Moscow and Kyiv rarely officially report their losses. The latest numbers come amid the publication of a new report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, indicating that Russia has suffered "more losses than any major power in any war since World War II." The Jan. 27 report estimates that Russian forces have sustained nearly 1.2 million casualties — including troops killed, wounded or missing — since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in Feb. 2022. The findings are also largely in line with estimates made by Western intelligence agencies. Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country In turn, Kyiv has faced increasingly serious manpower shortages, particularly among infantry units holding the front line. In a rare report, Ukraine's new Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said on Jan. 14 that two million Ukrainians are wanted for evading mobilization, and another 200,000 soldiers are absent without official leave (AWOL), as infantry units continue to struggle to refill heavy losses. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Russian troops launched two attacks on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Feb. 1, injuring at least nine people, including a child, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. Russia launched a mass attack, targeting mines of DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, the company said. One of the strikes hit a service bus in the town of Ternivka, which was transporting miners after their shift. Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said a system would soon be introduced to ensure only authorized terminals can operate in Ukraine. Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia are set to meet in Abu Dhabi on Feb. 4-5 for a new round of talks as part of ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace deal, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 1. Ukrainian forces downed 76 out of the 90 drones, including Shahed-type attack drones, launched by Russia overnight, the Air Force reported. Fourteen drones struck nine different locations, according to the statement. Polish authorities temporarily closed the airspace along the northern part of Poland's border with Belarus overnight on Jan. 30-31 after unidentified objects — believed to be Belarusian smuggling balloons — were detected in the region. Russian Envoy Kirill Dmitriev held "productive and constructive meetings" with U.S. officials in Miami, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Jan. 31. Russian State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin's threat comes a few days after Ukrainian, Russian, and U.S. officials held the latest round of peace talks in Abu Dhabi on Jan. 23-24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emails echo alleged efforts by former prince Andrew to dig up dirt on his accuser Ghislaine Maxwell tried to paint Virginia Giuffre as a disturbed teenager who was into witchcraft, new emails suggest. “GMAX”, a nickname and email handle for Maxwell, sent Epstein an email with the subject line: “Re: Vanity Fair MY IDEAAS [sic] IN CAPS BELOW” containing guidance on how to approach Giuffre's links with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former prince. Edward Klein, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, had emailed Epstein three days earlier, asking him to shed light on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's alleged ties to Giuffre for a planned profile piece on the royal. Giuffre said in her posthumously published memoir that she fled the US to avoid Epstein's abuse. The then prince reportedly told Buckingham Palace aide Ed Perkins, who at the time was Elizabeth II's deputy press secretary, that he had asked one of his personal protection officers to find information on Giuffre. “I have given her DoB [date of birth] and social security number for investigation with XXX, the on-duty ppo [personal protection officer].” The Metropolitan Police later said it looked into the repot but “has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct” that would warrant opening a criminal investigation. Separate documents published in the latest tranche of Epstein files on Friday show that federal authorities named Ms Groff in a spider diagram of Epstein's inner circle. Other featured names included Maxwell and Jean-Luc Brunel, who killed himself in 2022 while awaiting trial on rape charges. According to a statement her lawyers released in 2021, Ms Groff “never witnessed anything improper or illegal” and denies any wrongdoing. The subsequent Vanity Fair article published in the magazine's August 2011 issue did not contain any of Maxwell's claims, but concluded that Buckingham Palace had a growing “Andrew problem” on its hands. Other emails published on Friday also reveal new details about Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's reaction after he learned that claims about his encounters with Giuffre were set to be published. The former Duke of York sent an email to Epstein on February 25, 2011, saying that while he would pursue a “categorical denial of sexual relations” with Giuffre it was “possible that I met her in a group with others and possible there is a photograph”. Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has never publicly acknowledged that the photo of him with his arm around Giuffre is genuine, and claimed in a bombshell BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 that it might have been “doctored”. The former Duke stepped down from royal duties in 2019, and in 2022 paid millions to Giuffre to settle a civil sexual assault claim despite maintaining that the pair had never met. Epstein said he could arrange to introduce him to a woman named only as “Irina”, in an email sent in August 2010 – two years after the disgraced financier was convicted for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani won't pitch for Japan in the World Baseball Classic in March, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Saturday. Roberts said it was Ohtani's decision to focus solely on being the designated hitter for his native country. Ohtani's teammate and World Series MVP Yoshinobu Yamamoto will pitch for Japan in the WBC despite his heavy workload with the Dodgers last season. “Yoshi feels he wants to take it on and feels good, and we support him,” Roberts said at the team's fan fest. Ohtani tore his ulnar collateral ligament in August that year and later underwent elbow surgery, which kept him from pitching during his first season with the Dodgers in 2024, when he was their full-time designated hitter. He gradually returned to pitching last year and made four postseason starts during the Dodgers' run to their second straight World Series championship. Ohtani didn't confirm his decision not to pitch in the WBC when speaking with reporters before Roberts. The four-time MVP said through a translator that he had to “see how my body feels, feel the progression and see what happens.” He said there will be ample rest days in between starts and Ohtani won't be scheduled for any more two or three-inning starts. Ohtani, Yamamoto and Roki Sasaki were teammates on Japan's WBC title team in 2023. But Sasaki won't be pitching this time, coming off a rookie season filled with ups and downs that ended with him pitching out of the bullpen for the Dodgers. Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman said he won't play for Canada in the WBC because of what he described as a personal reason. “I told them why I wasn't going to be able to go out there and play in Puerto Rico and be that far from my family. Roberts is pondering his starting lineup ahead of the team reporting for spring training in Arizona on Feb. 13. I do feel great about having Will (Smith) in the 5 (spot) and then after that, I'm going to kind of read and react,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The documents were published under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law by US President Donald Trump in November last year, which requires the Justice Department to release federal records linked to investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his royal titles last year, appears in emails and photographs included in the cache released Friday. Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Starmer was asked whether the former prince should apologize and give evidence to US lawmakers if requested. “Firstly, I have always approached this question with the victims of Epstein in mind. Epstein's victims have to be the first priority. “But yes, in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that. The brother of King Charles III has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has previously claimed he ended his relationship with Epstein after the financier's first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008. The emails also feature Epstein proposing that Andrew have dinner with a “beautiful, trustworthy” 26-year-old Russian woman. Last year, the king stripped his brother of his royal titles and honors following renewed controversy linked to Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April. In 2022, Andrew settled a civil lawsuit with Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked to the then-Prince for non-consensual encounters while still a minor under New York law.
