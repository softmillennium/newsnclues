                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrat Christian Menefee won a Texas U.S. House seat in a special election Saturday that will narrow Republicans' already-slim majority, telling President Donald Trump that the Democratic district "topples corrupt presidencies." Menefee, the Harris County attorney, prevailed in a runoff against Amanda Edwards, a former Houston City Council member. He will replace the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, a former Houston mayor, who died in March 2025. The seat representing the heavily Democratic Houston-based district has been vacant for nearly a year. Greg Abbott didn't schedule the first round of voting until November. Menefee and Edwards were the top vote-getters in a 16-candidate, all-parties primary. Speaking to supporters at his victory party, Menefee promised to fight for universal health insurance, seek to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations and "tear ICE up from the roots." He also addressed Trump directly, noting that one of the district's most storied representatives, Democrat Barbara Jordan, was an eloquent voice for President Richard Nixon's impeachment before his 1974 resignation. "The results here tonight are a mandate for me to work as hard as I can to oppose your agenda, to fight back against where you're taking this country and to investigate your crimes," Menefee said. Menefee will fill the remainder of Turner's term, which ends when a new Congress is sworn in to office in January 2027. While campaigning Saturday, Edwards, 44, referenced the long vacancy in a video she posted to social media, saying voters have gone too long without a voice in Washington. Later, she told supporters at her watch party that the race "never was about winning a particular seat." "This journey has always been about creating a community where every single person in it, no matter what their background, no matter where they were from, no matter where they lived, would have the opportunity to thrive," she said. Menefee, 37, was endorsed by several prominent Texas Democrats, including former congressman Beto O'Rourke and Rep. Jasmine Crockett. He was joinedon  Saturday by Crockett, who is running for the U.S. Senate. Menefee ousted an incumbent in 2020 to become Harris County's first Black county attorney, representing the county in civil cases, and he has joined legal challenges to Trump's immigration executive orders. Edwards served four years on the Houston City Council starting in 2016. She unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee in the 2024 primary, and when Lee died that July, local Democrats narrowly nominated Turner over Edwards as Lee's replacement. Menefee finished ahead of Edwards in the primary, but Edwards picked up the endorsement of the third-place finisher, state Rep. Jolanda Jones, who said Edwards had skills "best suited to go against Trump." After Saturday, yet another election lies ahead in little over a month. Both Menefee and Edwards are on the ballot again on March 3, when they will face Democratic Rep. Al Green in another election — this one a Democratic primary in a newly drawn 18th congressional district, for the full term that starts in 2027. GOP lawmakers who control the Texas state government drew a new map last summer for this year's midterms, pushed by Trump to create five more winnable seats for Republicans to help preserve their majority.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo In today's K-shaped economy, lower-income consumers headed out to shop may be hitting Dollar General or a post-bankruptcy Big Lots, but affluent Americans are increasingly headed for the shopping center private club. Membership clubs are increasingly being seen as retail revitalizers, whether that's in a traditional mall, open-air shopping center, or as a stand-alone commercial real estate tenant. Like their country club cousins, private clubs require monthly dues and often an initiation fee. For instance, Dallas's Highland Park Village, which boasts shops like Hermès, Fendi and Brunello Cucinelli, is also home to Park House, a private club offering fine dining, a wine bar, and art experiences. The Moore House in Miami's open air Design District has a $5,000 initiation fee and monthly dues over $400. In addition to dining and product curation, it offers overnight accommodations if needed. Data is scarce because they are so new, but R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, says that the popularity of these clubs as part of existing shopping destinations is increasing and tracking with other trends in retail, such as malls that have been increasingly populating themselves with gyms, co-working spaces, and retail clubs with dues replacing discounts as the draw. Both street level retail and malls are discovering that memberships boost business and drive traffic to retail centers like Highland Park Village. The idea is it's another place, a status symbol. He added that in the post-Covid era, Placer.ai's research also shows more diners gravitating toward country clubs and fewer to restaurants. Private clubs offer a similar "safe space" for people to gather. Scheduled to open in November 2026, co-founder Jeff Lambert says it will help revitalize an area near downtown. Lambert, a local developer, was inspired by similar private clubs overseas or in larger U.S. cities, and he says mid-sized cities across the U.S. are seeing the biggest growth in the private club market. Even as recently as five years ago, he says, Grand Rapids would have had trouble supporting a private club, but the entrepreneurial class in the city has reached a critical mass. Developers, whether they are in a mall or elsewhere, have strong incentives to embrace membership-based businesses, according to Jia Li, associate professor of marketing at Wake Forest University. "Many malls face challenges filling vacant anchor spaces or underutilized upper floors. For high-end malls, private clubs are especially appealing because they allow owners to fill significant space without diluting the brand — and in many cases, enhance it. In some ways, that brings malls full circle to their original social purpose. "Although today we often associate malls primarily with shopping, early shopping malls in postwar suburban America were explicitly envisioned as 'community and civic centers,' not merely retail machines," Li said. Daniel Spiegel, senior vice president and managing director at Coldwell Banker Commercial, says while the private club concept has decades of history, they are gaining new traction. "Private social and dining clubs were very popular from the 1950s through the 1990s, and we may be seeing a comeback in different forms," Spiegel said. Some of the spaces Coldwell Banker represents are in very typical malls like Scottsdale, Arizona's Fashion Square, where clubs like Industrious serve as combination work and social spaces. "These membership-based operators offer landlords attractive characteristics like longer-term leases, consistent foot traffic during off-peak hours, and members with discretionary income that benefits the surrounding tenants," Spiegel said. "But it reflects a broader shift where successful retail properties are becoming destinations that offer experiences beyond traditional shopping," he added. "As malls and retail centers rethink their role post-ecommerce, these clubs introduce a built-in, high-frequency customer who values experience, community, and time spent on site – all things traditional retail has struggled to deliver on its own," Vise said. In addition to landlords looking for tenants that generate repeat visits, younger consumers prioritizing social connection over pure consumption and transactional footfall are driving the trend. "It creates a reason to return weekly, sometimes daily, and that spillover benefits surrounding food, wellness, and retail concepts," Vise said. He added that the club trend is already opening doors for digitally native brands and emerging concepts to test physical retail in high-engagement environments through buzz-generating pop-ups. "When executed well, private social clubs act as a catalyst, raising the bar for how surrounding retail engages customers and drives repeat visits," Vise said. The downside is that these clubs don't automatically translate to broader accessibility. "Retailers nearby need to be intentional about how they engage — aligning assortment, service, and in-store experience with a customer who expects curation and hospitality, not just convenience," Vise added. Clubs are prone to their own boom and bust cycles. Some of the most well-known club brands, including Soho House, have seen mixed results from recent expansion attempts. Since a 2021 initial public offering, Soho House has pursued plans to open more locations, including across the U.S. Now it is being taken private at a similar valuation to its five-year-old IPO price. "The more amount of time a human being stays on a property, the more money they will spend," said Charlie Koniver, a principal at Odyssey Retail Advisors, a New York City-based real estate consultant which works with luxury and contemporary retailers in creating upscale shopping destinations. A private club isn't necessarily a good candidate for an empty Sears box, and they often make for more appealing stand-alone retail destinations. The clubs tend to have smaller footprints, and when they are in malls or retail villages, they are seen as upscale mainstay tenants. "When they are part of the retail environment, they tend to be ones that don't have traditional anchors," Koniver said. The private club phenomenon is an extension of a consumer need that has existed all along, according to Greg Zakowicz, an ecommerce and retail advisor at Omnisend. "Let's not forget that high-end shoppers are often members of other private clubs, such as golf and swim clubs, and even airport lounges. Now brands are taking that model and applying it to retail by providing curated products and experiences in a high-end, private setting," Zakowicz said. In the current economic environment, with upper-income households continuing to spend, even as middle- and lower-income households reduce discretionary spending, it becomes even more important to capture these customers, Zakowicz said. But he doesn't believe this is critical across the retail landscape. David Loranger, assistant professor of fashion marketing and merchandising at Sacred Heart University, says the phenomenon is probably a byproduct of the K-shaped economy, with many Americans holding stock portfolios and in professional lines of work able to afford luxuries. "It might also be some type of Mar-a-Lago halo effect where those who see themselves in (or aspire to) the echelon of Trump, Bezos, and other CEO-types are becoming interested in belonging to such a club," Loranger said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Corporate earnings along with geopolitical concerns have swayed investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. But investors seeking consistent income against a volatile backdrop can always add attractive dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios. For discerning investors, top Wall Street analysts can help select the right stocks, backed by strong cash flows to support consistent dividend payments. Here are three dividend-paying stocks that are highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Viper Energy (VNOM), a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, primarily the Permian in West Texas. Considering the base and variable dividends paid over the past year, VNOM stock offers a dividend yield of 5.53%. Ahead of Viper's Q4 2025 results in February, Roth Capital analyst Leo Mariani reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock with a price target of $48. The analyst is bullish on VNOM based on its high "organic growth rate vs. peers, a solid and growing dividend, strong free cash flow even at lower oil prices and a multi-year line of sight on its operations not had by its peers." Mariani expects Viper Energy to deliver strong Q4 results with oil production of 66,552 barrels of oil per day (Bopd), about 1% above the Street estimate. He expects total production of 129,424 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) for Q4 2025, or almost 2% above the consensus estimate. Mariani also anticipates that Viper will report solid oil price realizations for Q4 2025, but weaker gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) realizations. The 5-star analyst expects Viper to announce a cash distribution to shareholders of $0.57 for Q4 2025, reflecting a sequential decline of 2%. But he expects $95 million worth of share buybacks in Q4 2025, up from $90 million in the third quarter. Mariani expects share buybacks to play a larger role in Viper's capital return plans, especially compared with a subdued oil backdrop. Mariani also describes Viper as more insulated than its peers if 2026 drilling and completion activity is cut due to weak oil prices. That's because Diamondback operates about 60% of its production and can scale back cut activity outside VNOM's mineral acreage, helping protect volumes. Moreover, VNOM's non-operated activity is led by top-tier operators like Exxon Mobil, Occidental, EOG Resources, ConocoPhillips, and Ovintiv, which lowers the risk of sharply lower activity, as they control about two-thirds of Viper's non-Diamondback acreage. 124 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Moreover, SLB announced a 3.5% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.295 per share. Following the Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on SLB and raised his price target to $54 from $43. The analyst noted that SLB's 2026 guidance was in line with consensus expectations, adding that encouraging insights from the earnings call reflect management's optimism about improvement in three international areas — Saudi Arabia, Mexico and deepwater — which hurt the company's 2025 performance. SLB is also expected to benefit from the revitalization of Venezuela's oil industry, as it's the only Western oil field services company currently operating in the country as part of Chevron's operating license. Meanwhile, SLB's Gulf of Mexico presence and growth in the Data Center Solutions segment are expected to drive revenue in North America. "The growth dynamics of Digital and Data Center Solutions remain key longer-term catalysts for SLB," said Jayaram. Overall, Jayaram expects SLB to deliver solid cash flow growth, driven by the company's international footprint, project integration capabilities and robust digital adoption. 673 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. The crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share. Ahead of Q4 earnings, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The analyst expects EOG to deliver upbeat Q4 results on both operational and financial fronts. Sorbara expects the company to report oil production of 545.7 Mbbls/d (thousand barrels per day), in line with the Street's estimate and within the company's guidance of 542.5 to 547.5 Mbbls/d. The 5-star analyst thinks that investors will focus on EOG's 2026 guidance and early updates on its international projects in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as management's commentary on capital efficiencies in the Utica Shale and Delaware Basin. "EOG stands out with the potential for peer-leading shareholder returns (at least 70% of FCF returned to shareholders annually) supported by its strong free cash flow generation and best-in-class balance sheet," said Sorbara. The analyst estimates $457.4 million in Q4 2025 share buybacks. Including the base dividend, Sorbara estimates $1.0 billion of total capital returns, reflecting 98.4% of EOG's free cash flow. 511 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OPEC+ agreed to keep its oil output unchanged for March at a meeting, the ‍producer group said on Sunday, even ‍after crude prices hit ‍six-month highs on concern the U.S. could launch a military strike on OPEC member Iran. The meeting of eight OPEC+ members comes as Brent crude futures settled at $70.69 a barrel, down 2 cents or 0.03%, on Friday, close to the six-month high of $71.89 it hit on Thursday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude finished at $65.21 a barrel, down 21 cents or 0.32%. The drop in prices came despite ‌speculation that a supply glut in 2026 would push prices lower. The ​eight producers — Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria and Oman — raised production quotas by about 2.9 million barrels per day from April through December 2025, roughly 3% of global demand. In November, they froze planned increases for January through March 2026 due to seasonally weaker consumption. Sunday's brief meeting reaffirmed that decision for March, after earlier gatherings did the same for January and February. Sunday's statement made no mention of what OPEC+ could decide for specific months beyond March, and the lack of forward guidance is significant, said Jorge Leon, a former OPEC official who now works as head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy. "With rising uncertainty around Iran and U.S. tensions, the group is keeping all options firmly on the table," he said. "OPEC's own numbers point to a lower call on OPEC+ crude in the second quarter, which could limit the scope for production increases," Leon added. A separate OPEC+ panel, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, also met on Sunday. The JMMC does not have decision-making authority on production policy. The JMMC stressed the importance of achieving full compliance with OPEC+ output agreements, according to a statement on OPEC's website. U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options on Iran that include targeted strikes ⁠against security forces and leaders, aiming to inspire protesters, multiple sources said on Thursday. Washington has imposed extensive sanctions on Tehran to choke off its oil revenue, a crucial source ‍of state funding. Both the U.S. and Iran have since signalled willingness to engage in dialogue, but Tehran on Friday said its defense capabilities should not be included in any talks. Oil prices have also been supported by supply losses in Kazakhstan, where the oil sector has suffered a series of disruptions in recent months. Kazakhstan said on Wednesday it was restarting the huge Tengiz oilfield in stages. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market. According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a "structural shift in consumer attention", with such content thriving in Latin America. Short dramas, also known as "micro", or "mini" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long. "The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department. First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others. Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC. Such content is often "easier to digest" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower. Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is "emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement" with these videos. Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah. Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia. Short drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah. While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate. Similarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025. ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market. Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report. While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix. While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete. Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market. "I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars," says Sensor Tower's Shah.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It wants a close relationship with the U.S., its biggest market, and the listing is intended to boost investment there. Meanwhile, innovation-friendly China is attracting pharma companies that urgently need to develop new medicines to replace blockbuster drugs whose patents are set to expire in the next few years. AstraZeneca has announced it's investing billions in China and partnering with a Chinese biotech on weight-loss drugs, just before its shares list in the U.S on Monday. On Thursday, AstraZeneca said it plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030 to expand both manufacturing and research and development, as Keir Starmer became the first UK prime minister to visit the country for eight years. In a separate announcement on Friday, the UK's largest company would partner up with Hong Kong-listed CSPC Pharmaceuticals to strengthen its obesity portfolio. The collaboration agreement includes eight of CSPC's preclinical and early-stage programs, including a once-monthly injectable. AstraZeneca will pay CSPC $1.2 billion upfront, and an additional $17.3 billion if certain regulatory, research and sales milestones are met, an AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Friday. The company declined to comment further on its geographic priorities. The announcements came just before the listing of AstraZeneca shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, as well as its recently announced $50 billion U.S. investment to waive off U.S. pharma tariffs. The U.S. is AstraZeneca's by far largest market, and the company said last year it would end its American depositary shares program to pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, keeping its listings also in London and Stockholm, saying it wanted a more global investor base. "It's the largest pharma company [in China] and when they decide to list in the U.S., there would always be a question about the commitment in the minds of some to China, and the fact that they had a few investigations last year," HSBC's Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research, told CNBC. In 2025, Astrazeneca faced several probes by Chinese regulators into unpaid import duties. "So they are, in effect, telling you very clearly that they are committed to China by this action," Kumar added. Oxhamre, whose fund has a large long position in Astra, added that the Chinese market would "continue to grow in importance over time, both in terms of revenue and research." And Astra isn't the only pharma company looking to China for new, innovative assets. London-listed GSK inked a deal with Hengrui Pharma worth up to $12 billion in July, most of it tied to achieving certain development and commercial milestones. Licensing deals between Big Pharma and Chinese biotechs, like the one between AstraZeneca and CSPC, have increased sharply in recent years, with 57 such deals in 2025, according to Biopharma Dive data. "These deals demonstrate the success of China's long-running effort to move up the biopharma value chain, from fast followers to differentiated assets that can compete globally," said PitchBook analysts in a report published last month. China's emergence as a leader in preclinical and early-stage development comes as biotech funding elsewhere has suffered in recent years, and is helped by the speed at which early human trials can be conducted there. A reverse brain drain, where Chinese scientists are returning to the country, is also helping the country's biotech sector, according to Kumar. "China's biopharma sector has reshaped itself around next-generation therapeutics paired with efficient clinical-trial infrastructure to de-risk these assets," the PitchBook analysts said. "Multinational and mid-cap biopharma companies are sourcing assets from China at growing rates, spanning both headline megadeals and smaller licensing deals. Importantly, this activity is skewing toward complex biologics rather than legacy modalities." A Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs report from June suggested "China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States in biotechnology" and that this could "quickly shift the global balance of power." But late 2025 saw a meaningful pickup in U.S. biotech funding. "There will always be innovation coming from both geographies," Kumar said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's government plans a modest improvement in its fiscal picture in the coming financial year, with reductions in the fiscal deficit and debt, while boosting manufacturing in sectors ranging from textiles to chips. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her ninth consecutive budget speech, said on Sunday that the government sees its fiscal deficit falling to 4.3% of GDP in the 2026-27 financial year, down from 4.4% in 2025-26. Sitharaman said the government expects India's debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 55.6% in the coming financial year from 56.1% in 2025-26. "Today, we face an external environment in which trade and multilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains are disrupted," Sitharaman said. "New technologies are transforming production systems while sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals." The government plans to encourage manufacturing in seven key sectors, including semiconductors, rare-earth magnets, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, capital goods, textiles and sports goods. India's benchmark Nifty 50 stock index was down about 1.7% shortly after Sitharaman's speech to parliament and closed 1.96% lower. In its economic survey for the financial year 2026 released on Thursday, India said it sees its economy growing between 6.8% to 7.2% in the fiscal year 2027, outpacing most other major economies. "As a growing economy with expanding trade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with global markets, exporting more and attracting stable long-term investment," Sitharaman said. Consultancy firm PwC India said the budget places the country "at a crossroads to push the nation into its next phase of transformation". "The Union Budget 2026-27 holds opportunities to set India's role towards financial stability, while boosting businesses to be future ready — especially as they navigate the opportunities of AI adoption alongside challenges around talent, infrastructure, governance and trust," PwC India said in an online commentary.

Bill Gates, through a spokesperson, issued a strongly worded denial Friday on the latest allegations to emerge about his relationship with disgraced financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. One of the emails, with the subject line "bill," suggests that Bill Gates had requested medication for a sexually transmitted disease to "surreptitiously" give to his now ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Another email said Boris had helped Bill Gates "get drugs," and helped facilitate "illicit trysts" between the billionaire Microsoft founder and "Russian girls" as well as "married women." "The only thing these documents demonstrate is Epstein's frustration that he did not have an ongoing relationship with Gates and the lengths he would go to entrap and defame." Since Epstein's 2019 suicide at a federal jail, Gates has faced questions about the extent of their relationship. In the past, Gates has said he attended several dinners with Epstein for philanthropic reasons and now regrets spending time with him. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 that Melinda Gates began seeking divorce counsel in 2019, around the time news of Bill's meetings with Epstein surfaced publicly. Correction: January 31, 2026 — An earlier version of this story indicated that Gates' philanthropic foundation issued a statement.</p>
