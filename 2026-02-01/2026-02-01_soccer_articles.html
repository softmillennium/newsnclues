                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lionel Messi recreated an iconic scorpion kick with legendary goalkeeper Rene Higuita ahead of Inter Miami's latest friendly outing. Javier Mascherano's side are working their way through a pre-season programme in South America. They suffered defeat in their first outing of 2026, but have now returned to winning ways. That is because they were able to battle past Atletico Nacional at Estadio Atanasio Girardot. Inter Miami fell behind in that fixture, but Luis Suarez restored parity 10 minutes into the second half and a stoppage-time own goal from Elkin Rivero settled the contest. Before a ball was kicked in anger, Messi - making his first trip to Medellin in 15 years - rubbed shoulders with iconic former Colombia international Higuita. He famously made headlines during a friendly outing against England in 1995 - delivering an acrobatic scorpion kick to clear a ball lofted forward by Three Lions midfielder Jamie Redknapp. Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi signed a ball for Higuita, before prodding another towards Higuita that allowed him to recreate his memorable moment from more than three decades ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United's winning start to life under Michael Carrick continued in dramatic fashion as Benjamin Sesko's stoppage-time strike secured a 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had the Red Devils cruising towards victory, only for late strikes from Raul Jimenez and Kevin to pull the visitors level. United made a bright start as Amad Diallo and Harry Maguire forced Bernd Leno into saves, though Senne Lammens had to show fine reactions to tip Joachim Andersen's close-range effort wide at the other end. Clear chances were few and far between thereafter, and it was not until the second half that United came close to doubling their lead when Leno smothered Bryan Mbeumo as he ran through on goal. Lammens then got down well to keep out a Harry Wilson free-kick before Cunha doubled the Red Devils' lead when he ran onto Casemiro's through-ball and lashed into the top corner. Fulham thought they had pulled a goal back when Jorge Cuenca found the net from inside the six-yard box, but Samuel Chukwueze was deemed to be offside in the build-up. Sesko then headed against the post with his first touch before Lammens again produced a fine save to keep Maguire from scoring an own goal. However, just as it seemed like Carrick's team would have to settle for a point, Sesko swivelled inside the penalty area and left Leno motionless to send the Theatre of Dreams wild. GOAL rates United's players from Old Trafford... Showed great reactions to keep out efforts from Andersen and Wilson, as well as a potential own goal from Maguire. Deserved a clean sheet but had no chance with either goal. Did, however, concede a penalty after almost scoring an own goal by misjudging a ball over the top. Did a solid job up against the dangerous Wilson. Not able to offer much going forward, though. United will miss performances like this when he leaves. Rose highest to open the scoring and then produced an outrageous no-look pass to create the second. Grew into the game after a couple of sloppy early passes. Showed good energy and the odd flash of quality. Very good defensively, too, as he won plenty of challenges when tracking back. Wasted a good early chance thanks to a poor first touch and then couldn't beat Leno after the break.

Didn't really help United defensively after replacing Dalot. The least impressive performance of his three games in charge, but another victory to add to his growing portfolio is all that will count.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham looks set for a spell on the sidelines after suffering a hamstring injury early in Sunday's La Liga game at home to Rayo Vallecano at the Bernabeu. Only nine minutes into the game, Bellingham ran forward onto a pass from Franco Mastantuono but pulled up mid-sprint holding his hand to the back of his upper left thigh. Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa immediately called Brahim Diaz from the bench to enter as a replacement. The injury comes at a difficult moment for both Bellingham and Madrid — with the England international among those who were whistled by a Bernabeu crowd still upset after recent poor displays including Wednesday's 4-2 Champions League group defeat at Benfica. On Sunday, his teammates did not appear to miss him too badly, with Vinicius Jr scoring a superb solo goal to put his team 1-0 on 15 minutes. Next up for Madrid — who sit second in the La Liga standings behind Barcelona — are domestic league games at Valencia and at home to Real Sociedad. Personally for Bellingham the injury is likely to cause frustration, given how he had been looking to return to his best form and win over his critics among the Madrid fanbase, who appear to hold him partly responsible for the team's poor performances under previous coach Xabi Alonso. Bellingham's previous appearance at the Bernabeu had been the 6-1 Champions League group stage win over Monaco, where he had celebrated a goal (his only strike in nine club games in 2026) with a ‘drinking' message to the crowd responding to social media rumours about his personal life. Dermot joined The Athletic in 2020 and has been our main La Liga Correspondent up until now. Irish-born, he has spent more than a decade living in Madrid and writing about Spanish football for ESPN, the UK Independent and the Irish Examiner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nations considering a boycott of the 2026 World Cup over disagreements with the Donald Trump administration could face the prospect of being banned from future competitions due to a little-known FIFA rule. Preparations for the showpiece tournament of the beautiful game have repeatedly been thrown into uncertainty amid a tense political climate. Then came wider safety worries following airstrikes and subsequent kidnappings in Colombia, while Trump also drew attention for comments about the potential purchase of Greenland - territory owned by NATO country Denmark - which he suggested he would be willing to use “excessive force” to take control of. European nations had already shown hesitation about travelling across the Atlantic to support their teams due to Trump's divisive policies, even before tensions rose further in recent weeks. However, the threat of potential sanctions could deter players and football associations themselves from following through with any boycott. Donald Trump's actions have threatened to cause major disruption to this summer's World Cups as major nations mull over a boycott. The Dutch government was recently forced to respond to a petition calling for the Netherlands to withdraw from the World Cup, while Germany, England and Spain are among other nations to have considered the idea for various reasons. As cited in a 2018 Sky Sports News report ahead of the World Cup in Russia, FIFA's rules at the time stated that the governing body could exclude boycotting nations from future competitions, and they could also be subject to liability claims. Regulations for the 2026 World Cup similarly state that if a participating member withdraws or is excluded from the tournament, FIFA may “take whatever action is deemed necessary.” FIFA also reserves the right to replace that member association with another. Professor Simon Chadwick, who has previously worked as an advisor to FIFA and Barcelona, explained to SPORTbible how commercial agreements with partners, sponsors and broadcasters may also discourage nations from boycotting the tournament. FIFA regulations state that the body “has the right to cancel, reschedule or relocate” matches at its sole discretion, including in cases of force majeure - unforeseeable circumstances that prevent a party from fulfilling a contract. But after Infantino previously said he “cannot solve geopolitical problems” following calls for Israel to be banned from FIFA-sanctioned events in October 2025, it seems unlikely he would go through the hassle of relocating the competition with just five months to go.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An East Rutherford hotel near MetLife Stadium is getting a $100 million redevelopment ahead of the World Cup this summer. The World of Blue hotel, previously operated as a Sheraton and Hilton, is being transformed into an independent destination that developers say will benefit the Meadowlands region long after the 2026 FIFA World Cup concludes, according to a news release. “We're building something designed to last well beyond a single event, but there's no doubt that the World Cup created urgency and clarity around what the Meadowlands can become, and what East Rutherford deserves,” said Harvey Rosenblatt, CEO of P3 Properties, the real estate firm that purchased the property three weeks ago. Rosenblatt told NJ Advance Media that every square inch of the facility will be redeveloped — from its 427 rooms to its large event center that hosts weddings and galas. For the upcoming World Cup, Rosenblatt said the hotel will host live watch parties and offer a shuttle to MetLife Stadium, which is slated to have eight matches in June and July. P3 Properties, which focuses on investing in “undervalued, forgotten” real estate, paid what Roseblatt described as a “steep discount” at $32 million to secure the property. “Having the World cup here, which we envision will be quite profitable, allowed us the confidence to go ahead and invest and offset the upfront cost that we're putting out,” he said. May will be reserved for construction projects. “We're delighted that somebody's going to come in and invest, reinvigorate that property,” Kirkos told NJ Advance Media. “Projects like this show what's possible when the business community stays engaged — and we encourage more local partners to step forward, invest, and help shape the region's future,” Kirkos said in the news release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With four months left before FIFA World Cup 2026 arrives in North Texas, Dallas officials say transportation coordination, community engagement and Fair Park activations are moving into high gear. TRANSPORTATION: Assistant City Manager Robin Bentley, in a memo Friday, said the city is coordinating with regional partners and Dallas Area Rapid Transit on World Cup transportation. That includes pedestrian routes and alternative mobility options linking Arlington matches with Dallas events such as the Fair Park Fan Fest. A regional transportation plan will be submitted to FIFA by the end of March. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: Residents and groups are being directed to the North Texas FWC Organizing Committee's Community Playbook at dallasfwc26.com for volunteer, business and other opportunities. The city also has shared a list of Dallas-area businesses and advocacy groups with FIFA to connect local firms to tournament-related work. FAIR PARK: City officials are exploring World Cup-related activations at Fair Park and nearby South Dallas areas, with a focus on community benefit and economic opportunity. Park staff will assess additional spaces, including the Midway, and potential programming with existing tenants. We welcome your thoughts on this topic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>History is guaranteed at Emirates Stadium on Sunday as Arsenal host Brazil's Corinthians in the first Women's Champions Cup final. Arsenal go into the final as favourites, having booked their place in the title clash by dismantling African champions AS FAR Rabat of Morocco 6-0 on Wednesday. Dutch manager Renee Slegers guided Arsenal to Champions League glory last season Having secured their first Champions League title in 18 years by stunning European giants Barcelona last May, the Gunners have failed to capitalise on a rare chance as serial winners Chelsea have faltered this season. Having been knocked out in the League Cup semi-finals by Manchester United, in the Women's Super League they find themselves 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City, though they moved one point behind Chelsea with a 2-0 win over the defending champions last weekend. Renee Slegers had to manage her squad carefully during the semi-final victory over AS FAR, which came four days after their triumph at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal may be favourites on home turf, but they face a Corinthians side who know exactly how to win trophies. Known as Timao, which translates to 'the Great Team', they are the undisputed queens of Brazilian football and won the league title seven times, including six in a row between 2020 and 2025. Corinthians have already proven their quality by knocking out a star-studded Gotham side who boasted the likes of America legend Rose Lavelle and England defender Jess Carter in their starting line-up. For a South American club, the economics that Champions Cup offers would be transformative. However, question marks remain over the tournament's timing with concerns about fixture congestion and player welfare.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Homeowners across Missouri and Kansas are looking at making hundreds to thousands of extra dollars this summer by hosting FIFA World Cup visitors. KC2026 expects 650,000 people to visit for the six World Cup matches in Kansas City this summer. With all of those visitors, some cities are making it easier for homeowners to open their houses as short-term rentals. The KC Short Term Rental Alliance and the MO Vacation Home Alliance are holding a crash course on what potential hosts should know. Susan Brown, the president of the KC Short Term Rental Alliance, said the first course in late 2025 was very successful, and they've only had more people interested in being short-term rental hosts since. Brown stopped by the KMBC9 studio Saturday morning to talk about what people can learn from the course and the huge demand for short-term rentals. The workshop will cover key topics such as guest screening, compliance with local ordinances, property safety, pricing strategy, neighborhood relations and maximizing guest experiences. There will also be more information for people interested in hosting on the Kansas side of the metro. You're asked to register ahead of time at the Missouri Vacation Home Alliance website.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gabi Zanotti celebrates with Corinthians fans in their semifinal. On a cold Wednesday morning on the River Thames, where Brentford touches Kew Bridge, the clock ticks past 10:30 a.m., and the typical leafy riverside neighborhood in west London meets its visitors. Geese and seagulls mudlark on the bank. Then suddenly, drums and flags fill the air. A mosaic of São Paulo soccer culture has arrived. It is still two hours before Corinthians kick off against NJ/NY Gotham FC in the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup semifinals at the Gtech Community Stadium, a short six-minute walk away. The atmosphere is building as more fans congregate, pinning up their flags and banners, and joining in with the chorus of chants. Holding a 12-foot pole with the Corinthians flag at the top proudly flying high, Deborah, who lives in London but was born and raised in Brazil, says that around 400-500 Corinthians supporters are expected to be at the semifinal. Corinthians is everything for us,” she said. This is also not Corinthians' first rodeo. As many fans in London were keen to share, at the 2012 men's Club World Cup, they said more than 20,000 Corinthians traveled to Yokohama, Japan, to watch their 1-0 win over Chelsea in the final. There is a small traveling contingent of Corinthians' largest supporters group from São Paulo, Gaviões da Fiel, founded in 1969, but the vast majority of the group attending the Women's Champions Cup are expats who have joined or created international chapters of Fiel. “There are fans from Europe, London, São Paulo, Dublin, Porto and Lisbon in Portugal, some people from Malta, a lot of places,” Deborah said. Deborah and her cohort showed off another enormous banner, printed for this particular crusade, that read “As Brabas in London” (The fierce ones in London). Brabas is a popular Brazilian slang word referring to empowered women. A Corinthians fan since birth, over the last few years, Deborah has become a keen follower of the women's team. On her hat is printed “Minas do Timão,” which translates loosely to a very local São Paulo slang word for “girls of the big team.” This is also the name of a popular fan-led media group that closely covers the Corinthians women's team. A post shared by Rádio Coringão (@radiocoringao) Meanwhile, Joao, a Corinthians fan who travelled especially for the game that morning from Dublin, Ireland, had never attended a women's match before and struggled to see the men's team while living in Europe. He said he wasn't going to miss his chance to support his team, no matter who adorned the crest. “It doesn't matter if it's basketball or football, women's or men's, I'm a Corinthian supporter,” he said. “It's so special for me because Corinthians coming to play in Europe is so hard (rare).” Many of the faithful are like Joao. They have taken a vow to Corinthians many years ago but for the first time are taking to the streets and a stadium for the women's team. For me, it's just a train ride away,” said Natalia, based in London. I watched the men in Brazil two years ago. Watching the women, it's my very first time.” But there's more than one supporter group represented at the inaugural women's club competition. Camisas 12, which translates to the “shirts 12,” akin to the concept of a 12th player, is another Corinthians supporters group, founded in 1971, with members adorning custom white bomber jackets, complete with a small stitching of a young man and the number 12. They give their lives for this support.” No matter the chapter, no matter the group, in London everything swells together like a great Brazilian monochromatic gumbo. Fiels' banners are all on black fabric with white lettering in yin and yang harmony with the white banners and black lettering that reads, “Fiel Torcida Jovem Camisa 12.” The streets outside the stadium are filled with a chorus of “Eu Nunca Vou Te Abandonar” (I will never abandon you), as the fan groups stop and perform. While the players on the pitch show plenty of rust, this patchwork tapestry of supporters groups, who are coalescing for the first time, appears orchestral. There is unwavering support from the Corinthians fans. Steady drums, chants and adoration roll for 90 minutes. Certain big tackles, hopeful shots and fouls draw the odd reactive shriek, but this is a group that has come to sing for 90 minutes off the same hymn sheet. The love for this team,” said Deborah, when asked how she felt when Zanotti scored the only goal. She's the best woman in football now.” After the full-time whistle, Zanotti and her teammates paid homage to the hundreds of Corinthians fans. They celebrated among them, took selfies, sang songs, all while Zanotti stood on the advertising hoardings, arms stretched out, like some sort of prodigal conductor. “It had to be her, she is our queen,” said Sabrina, a Brazilian living in Munich, Germany. The loudest noise, of course, came for Zanotti. One of the dedicated fans waiting was Nayara. She is one of the minority of fans who has not only traveled from São Paulo to see Corinthians but is also already invested in the women's team. While Nayara is not surprised to see such tremendous support for Corinthians, she was moved by just how many chapters turned up. “They are amazing, the most passionate fans in Brazil. While many expat Brazilians traveled in groups based on their respective supporters groups, some fans came alone and soon made friends with strangers who shared the same passion for Corinthians. The two had many things in common. Both have been following Corinthians and the women's team for many years. Neither felt they could miss the chance to be at the FIFA Women's Champions Cup, even if it meant traveling thousands of miles alone. Doesn't matter where or when, it's even one of our chants,” said Tainara. Now fast friends, Tainara and Sabrina are looking forward to spending the rest of the week exploring London and preparing for Sunday's final against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. “It would be proof of what's happening in women's football South America,” said Tainara. The Fiels believe there will be thousands of Corinthians fans marching to the Emirates on Sunday. Theo Lloyd-Hughes  is a Contributor for The Athletic based in London, UK.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Philadelphia is ready to take centre stage as the FIFA World Cup arrives, combining world-class football with rich American history and unmatched fan energy. As one of the 16 North American host cities, it offers seamless connectivity, affordable stays, and a vibrant sports culture that turns every match into a celebration. From stadium thrills to historic landmarks, the Birthplace of America promises an unforgettable experience on and off the pitch As qualifying teams prepare for the FIFA World Cup, all 16 North American host cities are gearing up with their unique appeal, but Philadelphia stands out with unmatched connectivity, affordability, and an undying passion for sports. The city will host five Group Stage matches and one Round of 16 game between June 14 and July 4 at Lincoln Financial Field, renamed Philadelphia Stadium, ultimately culminating in another milestone celebration: America's 250th anniversary. From attending games and being a part of the city's electric sports culture to exploring its endless attractions and witnessing the nation's historic birth celebration, that too in the Birthplace of America, there are more than enough reasons to visit Philadelphia this season. Philadelphia International Airport welcomed more than 30 million passengers last year, making it one of the busiest airports in the US. You can find direct service from a range of European destinations such as London, Paris, Rome, Frankfurt, Athens, Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, and Dublin, along with direct service from Doha, and any other airports within the country, such as New York or Boston, as well as rail connectivity with Amtrak. Even if you do not have a ticket, you will still want to follow the crowds to NRG Station (the last stop) to be part of the energy: Stateside Live!, the epicentre of entertainment in Philadelphia's stadium district, offering a range of pubs and beer halls, along with live music. High-end luxury accommodations like the Ritz-Carlton on Broad Street, budget-friendly boutique escapes like the Motto by Hilton in Rittenhouse Square, converted old row homes, brand new buildings and more — Philadelphia offers more than 14,400 hotel rooms that meet the needs of every type of traveller. Casino and Hotel and the Courtyard Marriott at Navy Yard are within walking distance of the stadium. For waterfront views, reserve a room at the Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing on the Delaware River. Philadelphia's enduring love for sports runs deep, from celebrating touchdowns on a frigid December night for an Eagles game (the defending Super Bowl champions of the other kind of football) to home runs on a steamy July afternoon at a Phillies game; every day of the year here is an excuse to get out and cheer for a victory. Bars like Brauhaus Schmitz, Tir na Nog and McGillin's Old Ale House will all be packed to the brim with other fans. If you are looking for the roar of a bigger crowd, head to Lemon Hill in Fairmount Park, the site of Philly's FIFA Fan Festival. When you reach the stadium, expect to be part of Philadelphia's beloved tailgating culture with pre-match celebrations throughout many of the parking lots. In addition to knowing how to enjoy your time during the game, be ready with the after-match plans. If you plan to hang around to enjoy the crowd, check out walkable destinations with food, drinks, and fun near the sports complex: Chickie's and Pete's, a local sports bar chain with world-famous Crabfries® or Philadium, a South Philly institution since 1971 that serves up pub eats and plenty of cheers. Stroll through America's Most Historic Square Mile, home to Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell, Carpenters' Hall, the President's House Site, and more iconic landmarks. Then, run up the iconic Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art before exploring its world-class collection of art or stop by Robert Indiana's iconic LOVE sculpture. Also, do not forget to taste the classic Philly Cheesesteak sandwich at one of many Philadelphia institutions, such as Geno's, Pat's, or Jim's.</p>
