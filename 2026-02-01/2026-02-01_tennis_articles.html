                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The belief that more major success lies ahead still burns brightly for Novak Djokovic, despite the Serbian suffering his first Australian Open final defeat on Sunday. The 38-year-old had beaten Jannik Sinner in a gruelling five-set semi-final, but ultimately could not overcome Carlos Alcaraz, who became the youngest man in history to complete the Career Grand Slam. “I always believe I can,” Djokovic said when asked about whether he feels he can win a 25th Slam. It's great that I was able to beat Jannik in five and really battle Carlos in four close sets. That's sport, but of course, when you draw a line and you make an assessment of what happened over the last couple of weeks, it's an incredible achievement for me to be able to play finals, be couple of sets away maybe to win a championship. But nevertheless, I have to be content with this result.” Djokovic last won a major at the US Open in 2023. He explained how adjusting his mindset in recent years has helped him manage the pressures of elite competition. “I lowered my expectations the last couple of years, which also, I think, allows me to be able to let go of some of that unnecessary additional stress,” Djokovic explained. “It also feels good a little bit not being always the main favourite to win Slams. I think that kind of gives you a little bit of that extra motivation, I guess, when it comes down to the last rounds of the Slam.” The Serbian won the opening set and stayed with Alcaraz for large periods of the fourth set before eventually falling after three hours and two minutes in Sunday's final. Alcaraz has now levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 5-5, having won the three major finals they've played. “Then I kind of regained my energy back and momentum in mid-fourth. I asked the crowd to get involved. “Just bad miss at 4-4 and break point, and that forehand, I had a good look at that forehand. Djokovic had won all 10 of his previous Australian Open finals. The 101-time tour-level titlist, who is up to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, enjoyed a unique route to the last four, having received a fourth-round walkover from Jakub Mensik and benefitted from a quarter-final retirement from Lorenzo Musetti, who was leading Djokovic by two sets. “Overall, for sure it's been a fantastic tournament,” Djokovic said. “I knew that I'd probably have to beat two of them on the way to the title. I beat one, which is great, so it's a step further than I have gone in Grand Slams than last year. By triumphing in Melbourne, Alcaraz captured his seventh major and completed the Career Grand Slam. Djokovic was full of praise for the 22-year-old Spaniard. “The results are a testament to his already stellar career. I can't think of any other superlatives about him,” Djokovic said. “He deserves every bit of the praise that he gets from his peers, but also the whole tennis community.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in the championship match of the Australian Open on Sunday to extend his lead over his great rival Jannik Sinner in their Big Titles battle. The Spaniard kick-started his 2026 season by defeating record 10-time Melbourne champion Novak Djokovic for his maiden Australian Open crown. It is Alcaraz's 15th Big Title — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals. Alcaraz now leads Sinner by four Big Titles as they quickly add to their totals. With his Melbourne victory, Alcaraz moved into joint seventh on the all-time list of Grand Slam men's singles titles won in the Open Era. The Spaniard moved clear of his fellow ATP No. 1 Club members Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg (six titles each) to level with John McEnroe and Mats Wilander. Alcaraz has now won three more Grand Slam trophies than the Italian (7-4). Only Djokovic (3.3) and Rafael Nadal (3.5) have won the tournaments at a higher rate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz forged a Melbourne milestone to secure tennis history on Sunday night at the Australian Open. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings overcame a shaky start to defeat Novak Djokovic 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 and claim his maiden title at the hard-court major in Melbourne. “Preseason was a little bit of a rollercoaster emotionally… [My team] was just pushing me to do the right things every day, so I have to say I'm really grateful for everyone I have in my corner right now.” You May Also Like: Carlos Alcaraz's Career Grand Slam: Daring tennis, defining triumph After an uncharacteristically flat opening set in which Djokovic came out firing, Alcaraz locked in from the baseline to take control of his first Australian Open final. The Spaniard broke his rival's serve twice en route to the second set and appeared back to his free-flowing best in a third set featuring several stunning all-court exchanges. But the 38-year-old was unable to counter and maintain his perfect championship-match record on Rod Laver Arena. Alcaraz broke decisively in the 12th game of the fourth set to seal a three-hour, two-minute win and ensure Djokovic's wait for an all-time record 25th Grand Slam title goes on. So I'm sure we will be seeing each other many more times in the next 10 years.” You talk about me doing amazing things, but what you are doing is really inspiring, not just for tennis players but athletes around the world. Just putting in the right work every day with your team at every tournament you go to, and playing such great tennis… For me it is an honour to share the locker room and the court [with you], and watching you play. Carlos Alcaraz becomes the youngest man to complete the career Grand Slam, capturing his first Australian Open title and his 7th Grand Slam 👑#AustralianOpen | #Alcaraz pic.twitter.com/3rH0InSC4C Read More From Melbourne Park: Alcaraz stretches Big Titles lead over Sinner with AO win Nadal, Safin, McEnroe among ATP No. 1 Club members at final Alcaraz vs Djokovic: The Rivalry Alcaraz is now a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, moving him level with his fellow ATP No. 1 Club member John McEnroe and Mats Wilander on the all-time list. “For me it's a little bit weird seeing Rafa in the stands. It's such an honour playing in front of you. We had great battles on the court… Now seeing you watch my match, it's just a privilege.” Most Grand Slam Men's Singles Titles (Open Era) With Sunday's victory, Alcaraz levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 5-5, and he has now won all three major title matches he has played against Djokovic. Appearing fresh despite his marathon five-set semi-final victory against 2024 and 2025 champion Jannik Sinner on Friday night, Djokovic pummelled the ball aggressively from the first game inside Rod Laver Arena. The 38-year-old, who was bidding to lift an all-time record 25th Grand Slam trophy and also become the oldest men's singles titlist at a major in the Open Era, barely put a foot wrong in a statement opening-set display. Although Alcaraz held his nerve to fend off the first two, Djokovic prevailed in an extended baseline rally on the third to gain an early advantage. Alcaraz himself contested the longest semi-final in tournament history on Friday against Alexander Zverev, and he did not show his typical high energy in the opening set. Djokovic expertly capitalised on his momentum by breaking his opponent's serve again in the eighth game to clinch a set in which he dropped just two points behind serve, according to Infosys Stats. Showing no signs of fatigue from his semi-final exertions against Zverev, the Spaniard relentlessly hared around the court to repel much of what Djokovic threw at him. The crowd was on its feet after Alcaraz won an electric first point of the fourth game, during which he barely believably returned a Djokovic around-the-net shot, and the top seed went on to win five in six games to move within a set of victory. He fended off six break points to hold serve in a marathon second game of the fourth set to the delight of his raucous fans, but he was unable to deny Alcaraz at 5-6. Djokovic fired a forehand long on Alcaraz's first match point to send the Spaniard tumbling to the ground with joy. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The draw in southern France also includes Stan Wawrinka, competing in the final year of his career, and Top 30 stars Flavio Cobolli, Tallon Griekspoor and Tomas Machac. Meanwhile home favourite Arthur Fils makes his return to competitive action for the first time since last July. ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch this week. 8 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Auger-Aliassime will aim to bounce back quickly after being forced to retire from his first-round match at the Australian Open due to cramp. The 25-year-old has plenty to be confident about in Montpellier: he is the defending champion there, and he has won seven of his eight ATP Tour crowns indoors. Auger-Aliassime's opening opponent in France will be Wawrinka or Hamad Medjedovic. 2) Fils returns after six months out: Home fans will welcome back one of France's top stars in Montpellier, where Arthur Fils will make his return to ATP Tour action after six months out due to a back injury. He takes on countryman Valentin Royer in the first round. The 21-year-old Fils reached the semi-finals on his only previous appearance in Montpellier in 2023, before he fell to eventual champion Jannik Sinner. 3 Wawrinka now heads to Montpellier, where he will compete as a wild card and takes on Serbia's Medjedovic first up. Hubert Hurkacz, another former Top 10 star who went 4-1 in singles play to help Poland lift the United Cup, starts against a qualifier.

Their rivals in the doubles draw include second seeds Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner, while Wawrinka teams with big-serving home favourite Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.
