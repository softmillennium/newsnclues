                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ant McPartlin has said that a psychic was about to make him "cry" during a rather unusual chat(Image: ITV) Ant McPartlin has said that a psychic was about to make him "cry" during a rather unusual chat about his personal life. In a recent instalment of his and long-time co-host Declan Donnelly's new podcast series, Hanging Out, on Monday, January 26, the beloved Geordie duo chatted to psychic Jayne Wallace. Before they started, she asked him how personal he would like the reading to be, to which he replied, “As personal as you want.” She said: "The little one there's like an amethyst, so that's using your intuition more. Ant recently took part in a psychic reading (Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images) "So you're kinda getting time out where you think, 'Right, I just wanna learn to breathe again', which is good. Opalite is more about joyfulness, child-like energy, but it's also knowing that you don't always have to be childish." Dec interjected by saying "yes", as Ant erupted into laughter in the background before presenting another crystal for Jayne to analyse. So you've had a roller-coaster of a hell, and I don't think anyone really knows what you've been through,” to which Ant replied: “Yeah.” Ant responded that she was going to make him “cry”. Jayne then concluded her reading, saying that Ant knows “everything” now, but Dec jumped in, saying not to tell him that for “God's sake”. Jayne clarified that Ant knows where his "priorities lie" (Image: Getty Images) It comes after Ant revealed on a separate podcast episode that he has had to "curb" a certain habit at home, as he keeps getting "told off" by his partner, Anne-Marie Corbett. Speaking to Fearne Cotton on the Happy Place podcast, Ant, who has a son named Wilder, said: "Well, my little one is 19 months now, so he's... all his words are starting to come slowly, but then... and I'm getting told off a lot for swearing in the house, so I have to curb the swearing." He added: "So, what I'm not going to do, Fearne, is start swearing on a podcast. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

Earlier in the week, Reigns made a guest appearance on The Pat McAfee Show in a bit of foreshadowing where he put the WWE creative and roster on notice, that in his absence, they were not getting things done since none of the young guy's stepped up, so now he needs to step back in and right this wrong. Now, he has his pick of which WWE champion to face at WrestleMania 42 in Las Vegas come April. The hooded figure to us was slighter in build than potential suspects: Seth Rollins, Adam Pearce or even Austin Theory, who were all suspect. However, what if it is the ‘Vision's' own Logan Paul? Brock Lesnar came out accompanied by his former manager, Paul Heyman. Although, the two in Lesnar's recent appearances seem to have aligned. Femi, who has tossed out the first several participants easily, came up against the “Beast Incarnate” and went to Suplex City and was then eliminated. Eventually, Lesnar was taken out by L.A. Knight and Cody Rhodes. Speaking of Roman Reigns, he was all for himself, eliminating his own cousins, Jey Uso and Jacob Fatu. Now, Cody's only current way back to WrestleMania is a win at the ‘Elimination Chamber' later this month Kudos to former NXT star Je'Von Evans who has now been called up to the main WWE Men's roster for a solid first Rumble performance. While they never really went “at” each other, things took a turn during the Rumble when Flair accidentally eliminated Bliss. After two previous second-place finishes, Morgan is heading to WrestleMania with a title shot in the very near future. In addition, props have to go to Sol Ruca, who wound up in the final three with Morgan and Stratton, and delivered her patented Sol Snatcher, only for it to fall apart from there when she was eliminated by Stratton. Along with her sister, Nikki, they eliminated Bayley and Lyra Valkyria. Will the Bellas make another run for tag team gold? However, most everyone thought the #30 entrant would turn out to be Bianca Belair. The EST did not appear, raising questions and concerns if she will ever be able to be cleared to wrestle again, or if the WWE is holding her back for a huge pop on an upcoming RAW or SmackDown, or if she will be in Chicago later this month at Elimination Chamber. AJ Styles, just like the Taylor Swift song lyric from her hit song, Style, says “Will Never Go Out of Style,” and that holds true for the Phenomenal One. In a shocker, Style came too and was told by the ref, he lost. However, this did not feel like the “official” end to Styles career. When it was time for him to remove his wrestling gloves or boots, as is customary when a wrestler says farewell and is retiring from in-ring performance, Styles stopped himself short of doing that. Time will tell if he moves on for another run at TNA or comes to AEW, or if some other thing is at play here. It should be noted that multiple WWE superstars past and present took to social media including Cena himself, acknowledging Styles incredible work or how emotional it was backstage at the Rumble after he lost to Gunther. Then let us know, what did you think of Roman Reigns and Liv Morgan as this year's Royal Rumble winners? What was your high and low point of this year's card? GENERAL HOSPITAL: Britt Tells Jason The Whole Truth; Josslyn Finds Evidence That Cullum's Behind Anna's Disappearance WWE ‘Monday Night Raw' 1-Year Anniversary on Netflix ‘Stranger Things'-Themed Preview, Plus is Tonight the Return of Chris Jericho? ‘WWE UnReal' Season Two: Who's Featured, What Stories and More Images Revealed WWE ‘Monday Night Raw': Gunther Gloats He Made John Cena Tap Out; Masked Man Revealed as Austin Theory John Cena Loses to Gunther in Final WWE Match of Historic In-Ring Career on ‘Saturday Night's Main Event' On General Hospital, the Friday, January 30 episode showed some relationships finally being honest with each other, while others continued to deceive one another. First, after Lulu (Alexa Havins Bruening) and Nathan (Ryan Paevey) share their first kiss, in a moment of realization, Lulu breaks the smooch, and tells Nathan that if her bestie, Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) knew about this, she would kill her. Lulu points out that's only because she thought her husband was dead. Next, Lulu informs Nathan that Maxie never stopped loving him. Nathan brings up Dante (Dominic Zamprogna), which is another problem they share since Nathan works for him at the PCPD and he was married to Lulu. She explains that waking up from her coma after four years, they just couldn't get their relationship back on track. Lulu tells Nathan she sure enjoyed their kiss, but they have to keep it between them. She is certain no one will come out in this weather to the house and find him here, but Jack shows up at the door! Carly covers saying she poured it expecting Jason (Steve Burton) to stop by. When Jack gets a call on WSB business, he walks into the other room. We think she finds Valentin far more intriguing at the moment. When she asks about the novel, Cullum denies knowing Ann. To pass the time, Josslyn says she is going to read the book as he scowls at her while she sits back at her chair. She tells Jason the only reason she's alive is because they want her to finish Faison's final project and Cullum works for the WSB. Next, Britt tells Jason she saw Sidwell (Carlo Rota) shoot and kill Henry Dalton right in front of her and how dangerous the men involved are. How long will it take when Maxie wakes up out of her coma for her to figure out that Lulu and Nathan are into each other? The Thursday, January 29 episode of General Hospital had social media abuzz, after who wound up in a smooch, plus gave us some bread crumbs for potential pairings that could shake up the canvas as the Port Charles blizzard continued to strand everyone from Spoon Island and everywhere in between. The two embroiled sworn enemies put their gloves down, sort of, and found common ground. From the well-written dialog in their scenes, it's clear to us that Martin and Tracy may just have a shot at romance, if things continue to thaw between them. In story, while stuck at Drew's, Martin goes at Tracy for breaking up his relationship with Lucy Coe and making him believe she cheated on him with Scott Baldwin, which she wound up doing, anyways. Tracy points out Martin's ability to pick the wrong type of women who bleed him try. Tracy admits it may have started that way, but then laments about Luke. Tracy recalled, “Later (in our relationship), we both realized that what we had was worth more than money and was worth fighting for. he theorized that Tracy and Martin would make an excellent pairing, because when you hate someone so much on the soaps, it must be love! Charlotte (Bluesy Burke) and Danny (Asher Antonyzyn) end up at the gatehouse at the Q's, since it was too stormy to get to Carly's. Next, Charlotte gets a text from Lulu and let's her mom know she's safe. Immediately, GH fans on X were outraged shouting that the two are actually cousins. However, when you look at their lineage, they are actually second cousins once removed. Still, will fans want to see them in a relationship together? After hearing that Charlotte is safe, Lulu (Alexa Havins) and Nathan (Ryan Paevey) decide to wait out the storm together. Clearing covering something up, Nathan says his dad pushed him into science, but that he lost interest when he wasn't smart enough to follow in his footsteps. Suddenly, the two hold hands when Lulu thanks Nathan for everything he did for her tonight and then the two share a passionate lip-lock. We kind of liked these two the best, because they shared a bond over it being unbearable to never see your child again, which Carly (Laura Wright) has experienced. It would be very unexpected if they paired Valentin and Carly together, and more juicy because of Brennan's feelings for her, plus what if Anna Devane gets out of captivity and Valentin fell for Carly, would he still run to help Anna? At that point, Jason says he really wants to help her as Britt says she's been lying to him this whole time, which Jason was prepared for. Now awaiting an explanation of what she had been dealing with, Britt tells Jason she's being forced to complete Faison's last project otherwise they'll let her die from Huntington's. Jason wants to know who “they” are and Britt looks concerned. We won't know till Friday as they episode came to its conclusion. Previously, this week's GH spoilers shared that on tomorrow's Thursday, January 29 airshow a couple shares a kiss for the first time, but who will it be? Let's take a look at who is with whom: First, Tracy (Jane Elliot) snuck into Drew's house only to find her sworn enemy Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight) staying there. Tracy wants to move out her family heirlooms tonight while Martin says that she won't make it very far given the roads are closed. Eventually, Martin offered to let Tracy stay, if she asked him nicely. In a recent interview on the Michael Fairman Channel, Michael E. Knight shared that it is not so far-fetched to believe that Tracy and Martin could actually end up falling for each other. The smart money has been on Nathan (Ryan Paevey) and Lulu (Alexa Havins Bruening) who are now stuck at his old mechanic garage. Then, there is Valentin (James Patrick Stuart) and Carly (Laura Wright). After all, she's been hiding him in her attic and secretly working with him to bring down her current beau, Jack Brennan (Chris McKenna). With Valentin and Brennan hating each other guts, it would be a pretty good move to have Valentin and Carly share a kiss making the whole ‘taking down Brennan' story more juicy than it currently is! Now alone at the Q's, they are spending time together. Later, Rocco (Finn Carr) walks in and sees Charlotte's sneakers and scarf by the fireplace, not knowing she took them off previously because of them being wet from the snow. Elsewhere, Josslyn (Eden McCoy) has herself in hot water at Wyndemere after cutting power to the mansion. When a nervous Joss tell him, “What you see is what you get,” he responds, “Now why do I find that hard to believe?” And how will Joss get out of her situation with Cullum? ‘General Hospital' Unveils Anthony Geary Montage with Remembrances by Genie Francis, Nancy Lee Grahn, and Laura Wright Jacob Young Talks On the Loss of Anthony Geary, Susan Flannery and Landing Role of Lucky Spencer, ‘All My Children' Reboot and Latest Film (Exclusive) Is ‘General Hospital”s Marco Rios Becoming the Biggest Turncoat of Them All?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At first glance, the $19 billion liquidity wipeout on Oct. 10 looked routine: a rapid chain of liquidations, or forced closures of trading positions, across major exchanges as bitcoin BTC$78,358.92, the largest cryptocurrency, tumbled. Whether because of Binance's scale, its dominance in derivatives trading or the lack of clarity about exactly what happened, on any given day, social media sports multiple accusations claiming the exchange was the biggest reason Oct. 10 (now known to many as 10/10) occurred. The company did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment on this article. Still, without someone owning the narrative, it's easy to see why such an event has traders on edge. Now, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has added her voice to the clamor, attributing bitcoin's weakness to “a Binance software glitch.” Star Xu, the founder of rival exchange OXK, wrote that  Oct. 10 caused “real and lasting damage to the industry.” While he didn't refer to Binance, his comments were widely interpreted as a pointed critique of his rival's role. Binance maintains that Oct. 10 was not the result of an internal systems issue. During an ask-me-anything event on Friday, co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ" Zhao said suggestions that Binance caused the crash were “far-fetched.” Binance said its core systems remained operational and it paid roughly $283 million in compensation to affected users. For some, that explanation isn't enough, particularly given the scale of liquidations, and the $19 billion figure has taken on an outsized symbolic weight. “This is a f***ing joke,” wrote the pseudonymous Bitcoin Realist on X. “You…liquidated 19 billion on 10/10 alone… This is like spitting in our faces.” The anger reflects something broader than a single volatility event. Not everyone agrees Binance deserves the role of villain, however. “10/10 was very obviously not a ‘software glitch,'” Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO of market maker Wintermute, wrote on X. Market makers widen spreads or step back entirely during stress. What's missing is a public review and official narrative. Critics argue that the absence of a detailed inquiry leaves room for speculation to snowball. Salman Banaei, a former regulator at the U.S.'s Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), suggested Oct. 10 warrants investigation, even without alleging wrongdoing. “Whether you love or hate crypto, there should be an investigation by regulators into Oct 10, 2025,” Banaei wrote, comparing it to the May 6, 2010, stock market flash crash. But the broader point is that crypto markets lack the formal post-mortems that traditional finance relies on after systemic shocks. One trader, known as Flood, insinuated that a major exchange had been “relentlessly selling altcoins since 10/10,” feeding conspiracy theories about inventory overhang. Whether true or not, such claims tend to flourish when liquidity disappears and confidence erodes. In a bull market, order books are thick, leverage builds quietly, and liquidity is abundant. Liquidity thins, market makers retreat, volatility concentrates, and the next shock breaks through faster than expected. Referring to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022, Ether.fi CEO Mike Silagadze wrote on X that “this seems so much worse than the post FTX landscape. The fundamentals in some ways are stronger than ever, but price action has zero bids.” Crypto liquidity remains dependent on leverage, conditional market making and confidence, all of which have been lost in a void over the past four months. "I don't know if Binance played a role in deliberately ruining the market in October, I would probably veer more towards the obvious which is; high amounts of leverage, low amounts of liquidity, generally useless or unwanted altcoin “technologies” is a recipe for a massacre and thats exactly what happened," said Eric Crown, former options trader at NYSE Arca. "It was always a question of when, not if."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From the very first episode of Supernatural, it was clear that Sam and John did not get along. After all, Sam had been effectively cut off for going to college. As the show progressed, the difficult dynamic between father and son only became even clearer, and although Sam eventually grew to understand his father better and even forgive him, that didn't change how painful parts of his childhood, and certainly his relationship with his father, had been. Yet, Supernatural almost gave Sam a brand-new way of seeing both himself and his father, only for the scene to ultimately be cut. On the Supernatural Then and Now podcast, hosted by Rob Benedict, who played Chuck/God, and Richard Speight Jr., who played Loki/the Trickster/Gabriel, it was revealed that John's own father, Henry Winchester, would have told Sam that he was more like John than Dean was. What is particularly notable about this is not only that this would have come from John's dad, who knew him long before he got into hunting and who therefore would have had a unique perspective on John as a boy, but also that Henry was going to say Sam was more like John than Dean was. Beyond just saying Sam was similar to John, this scene would have meant that Sam, who was frequently treated as an outsider in the Winchester family, had more in common with John than Dean did, despite the fact that Dean was often seen as emulating his father and following in his footsteps in so many ways. Yet, in this cut scene, John's own dad would have seen so much of John in him that it warranted this comment. This is also interesting because Henry only knew John when he was young, not when he was a teenager or older, so this would have meant similarities between Sam and John before John ever became a hunter obsessed with tracking down the yellow-eyed demon, which is a version of John that Sam never got to see. While this Supernatural scene wouldn't have addressed all the issues with Sam and John's relationship, about which audiences have plenty to say (primarily regarding the widespread sentiment in the fanbase that John was a bad father), it would have given Sam a new way of looking at himself, his father, and their father-son dynamic, and thus would have been profound.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're a horror fan, and you'd rather stick pokers in your eyes than watch the romantic drama Finding Her Edge, have no interest in The Upshaws, and might think the Kevin Bacon-led series The Following is less horror, more psychological thriller. Then, we suggest a series that combines murder, kidnapping, a 1938 Rolls-Royce, an immortal antagonist that feeds on the souls of children, and Christmas: NOS4A2, a largely forgotten supernatural horror show that has garnered 39.5M+ hours on Netflix. Based on the Joe Hill novel, the name "NOS4A2" is purposeful, alluding to its modern reinterpretation of vampire lore. New concepts are also introduced, like personalized dreamscapes called "Inscapes," accessed by Strong Creatives through "Knives," personal objects that cut through the real world and into their Inscapes. The series introduces Charlie Manx (Zachary Quinto), an immortal 135-year-old "supernatural vampire." He kidnaps children from those he deems as unworthy parents, and takes them to his Inscape: Christmasland, where it's Christmas every day and unhappiness is against the law. The children are brought there via Charlie's Knife, a 1938 Rolls-Royce Wraith, where he keeps his immortality by feasting on their souls, leaving them to turn into mindless, vampire-like creatures who find their legally-mandated happiness in killing and cruelty. Meanwhile, the parents of the children are left to Bing Partridge (Olafur Darri Olafsson), Charlie's "Renfield," a serial killer who helps Charlie abduct children before sexually assaulting the parents and killing them afterward. He's challenged by Victoria "Vic" McQueen (Ashleigh Cummings), an 18-year-old Strong Creative and aspiring artist whose Inscape is an old bridge torn down long before, known as "The Shorter Way," which she initially accesses through her Knife, a red motorbike. She's also able, inexplicably, to track Charlie and enter Christmasland. From another Strong Creative, Maggie Leigh (Jahkara Smith), she learns that she, too, is a chosen one, destined to find and rescue the lost children kidnapped by Charlie. Charlie senses it, however, setting up a long-running battle between the two that takes its toll on each of them. The Knives of the Creatives come at a cost whenever they're used: for Charlie, he is deeply connected to his Wraith, and when the Wraith is damaged, so is he; for Vic, she suffers debilitating migraines and her left eye bleeds; and for Maggie, the use of her Scrabble tiles causes her at first to stutter, and eventually turns to seizures. It'll leave you at the edge of your seat. He truly believes he is, in his own way, protecting the children from the horrors that he himself endured at the hands of a pedophile when he was younger, but is lost to how his actions take away their innocence all the same. Cummings, too, is fantastic, navigating Vic through discovery, loss, crippling fear, and vengeful determination. The supporting cast, led by Ebon Moss-Bachrach's must-see performance as Vic's father, is also strong. Family dynamics, the power of addiction, the dangers of emotional distance and isolation, and the effects of childhood trauma in adulthood, among others, are themes NOS4A2 addresses in ways both subtly and overt. It's not rare that a horror series might address one or two, but NOS4A2 stands out from its peers in addressing them all. It's well worth the binge — you can trust your friends at Collider.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers now believe that planets well outside the so-called Goldilocks zone could still host habitable conditions, a discovery that may reshape the ongoing search for extraterrestrial life. But new climate modeling and recent observations suggest that this conservative definition may overlook a far broader array of potentially livable environments. This reassessment arrives alongside compelling evidence from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which has detected water vapor and volatile gases in the atmospheres of super-Earths orbiting close to M dwarf stars, well inside what was once considered too hot for habitability. According to a study published in The Astrophysical Journal on January 12, liquid water might persist on planets orbiting both closer and farther from their stars than previously thought, under the right atmospheric and thermal conditions. According to the new study, “3D climate models have demonstrated that given a sufficient atmospheric pressure, or the presence of an ocean, efficient heat redistribution between the day and night sides can stabilize temperatures and maintain habitable conditions.” In fact, the research shows that under certain conditions, the permanent night side of such a planet could maintain temperatures that allow liquid water to persist, despite being much closer to their host star than Earth is to the Sun. This heat redistribution mechanism enables the formation of stable thermal environments, even in seemingly inhospitable orbital zones. “Signs of water vapor and volatiles have been detected in JWST transmission spectra of small exoplanets,” the researchers explain, adding that “some of these exoplanets are closer to their M dwarf hosts than the inner [habitable zone] boundary.” These findings raise questions about how such planets retain their atmospheres and moisture despite their proximity to harsh stellar radiation. According to the same study published in The Astrophysical Journal, even under high radiative flux, liquid water can remain stable in substellar or even off-stellar zones, particularly when atmospheric conditions such as greenhouse heating and albedo effects are taken into account. One proposed explanation is that a low heat-transport parameter, a factor that controls how effectively heat moves across the planet's surface, allows the nightside to remain cool enough for water to condense, even as the dayside remains scorched. The research also outlines how cold, distant exoplanets (well beyond the classical outer limits) could harbor habitable conditions beneath thick layers of ice. “Liquid water can exist beneath thick ice layers, as subglacial lakes or through internal heating,” the team writes, citing environments like Antarctica's subglacial lakes on Earth as real-world analogs. These findings align with previous hypotheses about moons such as Europa and Enceladus, where tidal heating maintains subsurface oceans. In the exoplanet context, geothermal or tidal heating could similarly allow for liquid water well outside traditional habitable zones, without any need for sunlight-driven warmth. The paper suggests that evidence from Mars' south pole, where radar data indicates a possible intraglacial lake, supports the plausibility of this model for distant exoplanets. The implications are significant: expanding the habitable zone in both directions, closer and farther, means a far greater number of planets may now qualify as potentially life-supporting. According to the researchers, this could mean that “the number of habitable planets within the extended HZ of M and K dwarfs may be bigger by a factor of 50” compared with classical estimates for Sun-like stars. While it remains unknown whether these environments actually host life, the findings mark a pivotal shift in how scientists define habitability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered. But many of the biggest open questions in his case remain unanswered. Once a top FBI fugitive, Wedding finally faced a U.S. judge in federal court this week, where he pleaded not guilty to 17 felony charges — including murder, drug trafficking and other alleged crimes. It was a pivotal moment in the years-long pursuit of a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder authorities have labelled one of the most violent criminals in the world, and the first step in what promises to be a sweeping prosecution involving dozens of co-defendants. Mexican and American authorities had cast a wide dragnet to catch the fugitive, and now they have their target. Still, many of the biggest mysteries in this unfolding crime story remain unanswered. Notorious fugitive Ryan Wedding was arrested in Mexico January 22, 2026 It's been over two years since Jagtar Singh Sidhu, 57, and Harbhajan Kaur Sidhu, 55, were killed in an attack allegedly orchestrated by Wedding. Their daughter, Jaspreet, was shot 13 times but survived. Authorities later revealed the hit men were allegedly hired by Wedding to kill an Ontario trucker who stole a cocaine shipment from his organization — the killers had the wrong people. What is known is that the man worked for trucking companies in the Peel Region and has since been given some element of protection from local police, though the exact details of this are unknown. It would be natural to assume the man may have previously rented the home where the attack occurred, but local police and American authorities have not confirmed this. While some arrests have been made in other local shootings loosely linked to the case, police have yet to identify or lay charges against any gunmen in the Sidhus' murders. “We sympathize with the Sidhu family, who continues to grieve their loved ones as they await answers,” OPP Det. Brian McDermott told the Star in a statement this week. He said the probe remains active and ongoing. “We cannot speculate on whether developments in other regions, including arrests, may support the investigation but we remain committed to bringing answers to the family by identifying and arresting the individual(s) responsible for taking the lives of two innocent people,” McDermott said, urging anyone with information to contact police. Wedding's capture has become a major diplomatic flashpoint between two governments. At issue: What exactly did U.S. agents do inside Mexico? If you ask American law enforcement leaders, and Wedding's lawyer, they'd tell you that's wrong; he was nabbed in what the FBI Director Kash Patel has called a “high-stakes” tactical operation by U.S. agents. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has challenged Patel's description, saying her government would never allow a foreign power to execute such an operation. Only adding to the confusion, Sheinbaum also publicly pointed to a faked Instagram photo as proof that Wedding had, indeed, surrendered. While the FBI has declined to share more details about the nature of his arrest, the Wall Street Journal has reported that Mexican security forces were closing in when they were joined by U.S. authorities who, following an intense negotiation, apprehended Wedding. It remains unclear if we'll ever learn the truth. If Wedding did surrender, it could signal he'd become more of a liability than an asset to the Mexican cartels. Authorities have nabbing the guys behind the drug distribution, his alleged money man, and even his so-called “cocaine lawyer.” They've also placed immense public pressure on the fugitive and his inner circle after adding him to the FBI's most wanted list and dangling an enormous $15-million reward. That's a lot of heat; the cartel could have told Wedding, “Look, either give yourself up or, worse, we're not protecting you anymore,” said retired FBI agent Brett Kalina, who once arrested the Canadian on drug trafficking charges in California in 2008. In a scenario in which Wedding has lost the favour of the Sinaloa Cartel — once run by Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán — a U.S. prison may be the only place he's safe from his former associates. If Wedding is willing to co-operate, Kalina suggested he wouldn't necessarily turn on people in the cartels, but rather their partners around the world. But that would be a dangerous choice, Kalina said — “He will not survive prison if he gives up the wrong people.” The Star interviewed Estrada this week at his Los Angeles law firm, where he now works as a trial attorney. Striking a deal with any defendant “requires a measured, thoughtful approach and decision by the government,” Estrada said. However, he added, some people simply should not be afforded the opportunity because their crimes are too severe. But the known timeline of his rise to becoming an alleged international drug lord has some surprisingly large gaps. The FBI first caught wind of Wedding in 2008, when he and a low-level drug dealer flew from Vancouver to California to purchase 24 kilograms of cocaine from an informant. By 2013, undercover agents with the RCMP had infiltrated his network. They'd spend the next two years uncovering various schemes by Wedding and his associates to allegedly buy and import tons of cocaine linked to Colombian and Mexican cartels into Canada. Around then, court records obtained by the Star paint a picture of Wedding as a cartel middleman, allegedly co-ordinating drug shipments from the Caribbean with men tied to El Chapo. In 2015, the RCMP charged Wedding and more than a dozen others in the undercover sting dubbed Operation Harrington — but Wedding was never arrested. A decade later, the U.S. indictments from 2024 and 2025 suggest Wedding spent the intervening time building up a billion-dollar-a-year organization. First, the drugs would be cooked and tested in “cocaine kitchens” run with the help of Colombian neo-paramilitary groups. Next, they'd ship the cocaine by boat and plane into Mexico, hundreds of kilos at a time. Then it was onto semi-trucks destined for California stash houses. And finally, it was loaded onto trucks driven by GTA truckers bound for Ontario. Still, it's a huge leap to go from a mid-level cartel figure in the mid-2010s to an alleged top boss — and we don't know how he got there. Wedding, left, in court with his defence attorney Anthony Colombo. If you ask Patel, the FBI director, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, they'll tell you Wedding is the modern-day version of two of Latin America's most notorious drug lords, Sinaloa's El Chapo and Colombia's Pablo Escobar. Those comparisons are clearly an exaggeration — but by how much? “I don't make comparisons like that,” Estrada said; he thinks each defendant should be looked at “based on their particular conduct.” With Wedding, it's “really, a tragic story,” he continued, “not just squandering his opportunities, but rejecting them, wholly to go in the opposite direction and really become a scourge on his own nation and other nations.” U.S. authorities have said that Wedding is behind “dozens” of murders, but the indictments link his organization only to five killings. Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration. Comparisons to some of the most-notorious drug lords in the history of Latin America are, at best, an exaggeration. Wedding himself has been charged with three killings near Toronto, including the Sidhus', and the assassination of a federal witness in Colombia. Attorneys stick to what they can prove, Estrada notes. “It would not shock me to see that there were other (murders), but when you're prosecuting cases on behalf of the United States government, it'd be very precise and stick to the facts,” the former prosecutor said. Investigators will have “significant” amounts of credible intelligence that may not be attached to any criminal proceeding due to a lack of substantive evidence that meets the threshold of usability, Chrustie said. As well, some evidence cannot be entered in court because “it's too sensitive.” In short, we just don't yet know how close Wedding was to being what Bondi and Patel claim. The FBI released photos of items believed to be owned by Ryan Wedding that were seized in December by Mexican law enforcement partners. His exact whereabouts in Sinaloa have not been made public, but his address was listed as Los Mochis, a coastal city in the state's northwest, in a Mexican court filing last year. (The court records, first reported by local media, show Wedding tried to prevent law enforcement from executing a warrant for his arrest and extradition in mid-February 2025 — just weeks after the assassination of the federal witness.) That life is over now, but his network hasn't yet been fully dismantled. Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.). Fewer than 10 Mercedes CLK-GTR roadsters were ever made, with the example seized by the FBI worth an estimated $13 million (U.S.). Authorities are still looking for multiple associates, including the suspects who killed the witness, Jonathan Acebedo Garcia, at a restaurant in Medellín, Colombia, on Jan. 31, 2025. The victim, a Montrealer who met Wedding in prison before working with him, was set to testify at trial. And while Wedding's days on the run are over, it remains to be seen what will happen in court — and how, or if, the death of Acebedo Garcia hurts the prosecution. But the chances of him facing trial on those offences are incredibly small if he is convicted in the U.S. Calvi Leon is a Toronto-based general assignment reporter for the Star.

The stage version, which premiered in England and is now in Washington, is set in the same fictional world as the horror movie franchise.

Ghost sightings in the theater usually mean Henrik Ibsen or a despondent Danish prince. A total fleece, in other words, if you're a kid or can still think like one. But “Paranormal Activity,” an itinerant amusement at Shakespeare Theatre Company's Harman Hall that's as much a carnival-style haunted house as a domestic drama about a troubled marriage, will give even the most lizard-brained aesthetes among us their money's worth and then some. If you're game to have your soul harrow'd up and yer young blood froze by something other than the news, you are invited.</p>
