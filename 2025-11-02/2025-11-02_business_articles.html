                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With politics among the biggest stressors for Americans, and the political gender gap growing among young people, it can be hard to stay motivated when divisions feel more contentious than ever. Few people understand that like Ella Emhoff, the daughter of former U.S. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and stepdaughter of former Vice President Kamala Harris. "I think what has kept me the most invigorated around politics and just social change is seeing everyone else empowered by it, coming to things like ZCON and being able to talk about it," Emhoff recently told CNBC Make It at the Gen Z-focused conference put on by United Talent Agency. With so much happening, Emhoff says she finds power in focusing on small changes within her control, and actions she can take toward them. "Small changes impact big change," she says. "Even going and volunteering at a shelter or with dogs or feeding the homeless, anything like that is going to create positive impact. On the other hand, scrolling and consuming every bad headline won't do much for your emotions or your feelings of being able to enact small changes. The 26-year-old says turning to offline creative pursuits, like her work as a textile artist and her recently relaunched Soft Hands Knit Club, helps too. Working in a creative field has its own challenges. But Emhoff says her mother, Kerstin, who works as a film producer and heads a creative entertainment studio, has always given her the best outlook on her career. "When you're in a non-traditional career path like I am, it's really easy to want to give up when the stream of income is lost, or you're feeling like your engagement is down and you want to just quit and get a normal job. I love to threaten her that I'm going to go and just get a corporate job, but she's always been a really big proponent of the message I have in mental health and crafting and community, and it's pushed me a lot farther than I ever thought." Emhoff says she's also gotten good advice from her stepmother Harris, especially about recovering from a setback after losing the 2024 presidential election. This is just a bump in the road.' And I really do believe that," Emhoff says. We are in an especially hard time. But we have gotten out of hard times, and the only way to get through that is with believing and not letting up." "I think we collectively need to get into that same headspace of just kicking butt," she adds. Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree. Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad "liberation day" tariffs. Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement. And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves. LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season. The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion. Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion. "For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant," said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt," Schulz said. Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs. Schultz agreed, calling it an "unfortunate reality" that many consumers will have to face. "That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want," Schulz said. "I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want," he said. "However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice." LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper. Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently. Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180. "We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution," said Mehta. The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026. In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. We move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company "accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform." Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines. The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth. Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Finally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield. Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, "WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects." Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many investors welcome a windfall, the rules for inherited individual retirement accounts are complicated — and mistakes can be costly. Plus, some non-spouse beneficiaries, commonly adult children, must begin taking required minimum distributions, or RMDs, in 2025 over the 10-year period, or face a hefty IRS penalty. Inherited IRA planning is important amid the "great wealth transfer," with more than $100 trillion expected to change hands through 2048, according to a December report from Cerulli Associates. Here are three of the biggest inherited IRA mistakes and how to avoid them, according to financial advisors. For non-spouse heirs, "the [inherited IRA] rules can get complex fast, and it's critical to know your options," said certified financial planner Brett Koeppel, founder of Eudaimonia Wealth in Buffalo, New York. The "10-year rule" and new RMD requirement for 2025 apply to most non-spouse beneficiaries, such as adult children, if the original IRA owner reached RMD age before their death. However, you could reduce that fee to 10% by disbursing the correct amount within two years and filing Form 5329. If you inherit a pretax IRA, you can expect to pay regular income taxes on withdrawals, which may require tax planning during the 10-year drawdown, experts say. Some heirs aim to take only their RMD for the first nine years and a lump sum in year 10. But this could mean "significant taxes in that final year of distribution," said CFP John Nowak, founder of Alo Financial Planning in Mount Prospect, Illinois. Instead, you should run multi-year tax projections to decide the best withdrawal amounts for each year, experts say. For example, it might make sense to accelerate distributions during temporary lower-income years. Another common mistake is failing to change inherited IRA assets, according to CFP Jamie Bosse, a senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas. Ideally, the investments should match your risk tolerance, goals and timeline. However, when choosing investments, you need to weigh your tax liability, yearly RMD and income needs, said Nowak with Alo Financial Planning. For example, holding certificates of deposit in your IRA with a maturity date beyond your RMD window could be "difficult or costly to distribute," he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Christina Kantzavelos, 37, a therapist and chronic illness advocate based in Óbidos, Portugal, a town about 52 miles north of Lisbon. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. It was early summer of 2024 that I first decided that I wanted to make Portugal my permanent home. For me, Portugal just feels the most comfortable. There's a lot happening where you feel like you can be involved or contribute to the community very easily. I have felt very welcomed here so far. It's nice to know things are happening and going on. I'm not that far from Lisbon, where a lot of bands come to play. And I love the access to nature and the good weather — it's reminiscent of California, where I grew up. I love the fact that sunshine is just a drive away, even if it seems like it's raining somewhere. Overall, my nervous system just feels safer here. For me, it really comes down to my health and the fact that I feel better overall. I work mostly Pacific Standard Time; however, I coach clients from the Midwest to the East Coast and also internationally. It's been great to have slow mornings. It's nice that I can go see doctors, or go get treatments, or go do things that are related and helpful to my health during the day, and get that over with, and then work. I actually really like that switch of workflow. I feel like in the US it is shifting in a healthier direction, but the lifestyle in Portugal seems more conducive to living, and I really enjoy that. I try to eat mostly organic, and I can do that here more affordably versus in the US, where I'd be left with very little money at the end of the month. For two people, between the grocery store and the farmer's market, a week's worth of groceries costs 125 euros, or about $145. Eating mostly organic food, that would've easily cost me closer to $300. I rent my house in Joshua Tree, California, which is a little bit more affordable than big cities where I was before, like San Diego and Los Angeles. For point of reference, my three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot apartment in Portugal is 1,300 euros a month. For something like this in San Diego, this would probably be at least $5,000 a month for a location where I am walking distance to town and for what I have access to. Where I am, I feel like there's a lot around community and families: they're doing family dinners on Sunday, where everyone gets together, or group lunches. It's still less expensive: I went to the osteopath, and I paid 40 euros for an hour of treatment. I have to get weekly lymphatic massages for one of my health conditions. When I was living in Greece, I needed a small emergency surgery, and I was charged 50 euros for that — and that was at a private institution. If I'd gone to an ER in the US, that would've probably cost me $5,000. I know folks who've had to open a GoFundMe for their healthcare. That just doesn't make sense that we need to crowdfund to get our healthcare covered when we pay so much for health insurance in the US. I see it almost every day in my work, insurance denying someone's health treatment. If we're not feeling comfortable or safe in the environment we're living in, it can impact our health big time. I've noticed a really huge difference in my overall health, even without the treatments here. I've received only love, support, and curiosity from my clients thus far. If we go somewhere and we realize, "Wow, I see a difference," it's worthwhile for us to make the move.</p>

Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist told Business Insider that "extreme enthusiasm" about innovation and circular deals between tech companies reminded her of the internet bubble 25 years ago. Sonders said the immense concentration of investor wealth in Big Tech companies means there's "more exposure to the equity market than ever before." She said that if a bear market takes hold, it "could have feeders into the economy" as consumers might balk at their portfolio losses and cut back on spending, curbing economic growth. The Wall Street veteran said there's a danger that AI companies fail to deliver on their bullish growth forecasts, which have driven the stock market to record highs. Sonders said that speculation in more niche areas, such as meme stocks, drones, and quantum computing, made her a "little less uncomfortable" about investor exuberance, as "you could have cracks in that armor show up" without tanking the wider stock market. She added that gold's surge to record highs of over $4,000 this month was an "area where the enthusiasm pendulum swung maybe a bit too far," and the moves were "more about FOMO than fundamentally driven." But she said that economic gauges in recent months have shown rising pressure on lower-income consumers and a softening labor market, which could erode growth. "It's not screaming 'recession is imminent,'" Sonders said, but investors should "be mindful" of a weakening jobs backdrop.</p>

They repeat each action hundreds of times during eight-hour shifts, and their work is captured by five cameras attached to their helmet and a heavy backpack. CEO Elon Musk sometimes stops by to watch, and Tesla investors visit regularly for demos. Musk has identified Optimus as a crucial part of the business. He has also projected that Optimus would account for around 80% of the automaker's value one day. Tesla intends for Optimus to perform a wide variety of tasks, including factory work, household chores, and caregiving. Business Insider spoke with five current and former workers to understand how Optimus is trained. They said the role is physically demanding, occasionally absurd, and always meticulous. Tesla is one of many tech companies, including Figure and 1X, attempting to replicate complex human behavior in a robot. Training a robot to be human isn't glamorous. Most data collectors start out wiping down a table, sometimes for weeks. "You take a step, wipe the table, go into a reset pose, and do it all over again," one former worker said. The workers receive detailed documents about how to perform simple tasks, and they're guided by a thick, constantly evolving manual, three workers said. They're also paired up with a peer to ensure the tasks are performed correctly, five people said. "Tesla is very strict on how everything needs to be done," one worker said. "It can be very tough mentally and physically." Since data collection started, workers have largely used motion capture suits to teleoperate the robot — teaching it with manual movement. In June, the company told workers it was pivoting away from motion-capture suits and teleoperation and toward collecting data using only cameras, Business Insider previously reported. Since the June shift, the company has incorporated multiple new training processes, including stationing cameras around workers while they perform tasks, three workers said. Workers are sometimes outfitted with haptic gloves, which track the minute movements of their hands, three employees said. Musk has said Tesla has spent considerable energy trying to develop a human-like hand for Optimus, calling it "an incredibly difficult engineering challenge." Workers have also recorded themselves mirroring each other's movements, three people said. At the company's Fremont, California, plant, data collectors have organized vehicle parts and worked on conveyor belts while wearing the headset and backpack, two people said. Experts who spoke with Business Insider said that collecting different data points for the same task can be helpful for training. Two data collectors said they recorded themselves working on brain teasers designed for actual babies: putting rings on by size and color, or putting shapes into their corresponding slots. Tesla has also begun using AI-generated prompts to help train the robot, three people said. During some training exercises, workers receive a series of AI-generated prompts via a headset, which is attached to the 30- to 40-pound backpack via wires. Though they're often wearing the backpack, it sometimes sits nearby on a chair or table. Workers said the exercises have included squatting, doing the "Chicken Dance," acting like a gorilla, pretending to vacuum, sprinting for several yards, pretending to golf, and twerking. Two people recalled instances where some tasks made them uncomfortable, including AI-generated requests to crawl on all fours or remove a piece of clothing. Aitken said the seemingly random tasks could help Tesla understand which areas it needs to improve on. The work can take a physical toll, four people said. One former worker described it as "basically doing cardio all day." One former worker said they sustained a back injury while training the robot. Some people experienced problems during teleoperation, which can involve motion-capture suits and a virtual reality headset. A mix of poor image quality and the length of time workers spent wearing the gear triggered severe motion sickness, three people said. They said it could be especially disorienting when the robot fell over. Investors are sometimes accompanied by Musk, who has brought his 5-year-old son X to see the robot, two former workers said. "It felt like theater," the former worker said. Half the time, two workers said, the robot tumbles over when performing tasks that require bending or leaning, sometimes damaging expensive equipment. It's typically strapped into the gantry — a supportive rig that keeps the robot upright — unless it's performing tasks that involve traveling more than a few feet, three workers said. Aitken said the robot should be able to remain upright with ease in a controlled environment like Tesla's offices. "Having it stand up and maintain balance should be one of the first things you look at," he said. Dawn of the physical Agentforce  revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! The company cut dozens of data collectors in September following twice-yearly performance reviews. Workers are scored on how well they perform the tasks, five people said. They receive feedback on everything from bodily angles to positioning. Each worker is expected to gather at least four hours of usable video footage per shift, five people said. If the video footage is deemed unsatisfactory — if the worker's positioning isn't quite right, for instance — workers can be penalized. For the workers who train it, Optimus' performance metrics are less clear. When training relied primarily on teleoperation, data operators could press a button to see if Optimus would perform the task. (More often than not, it couldn't, three people said.) In company videos, Optimus can be seen walking, folding laundry, performing kung fu moves at the "Tron Ares" premiere, and handing out candy in Times Square. A robot demo "is always the very best demo they could show you," Alan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider. There is not a cognitive thought behind it." Musk, meanwhile, continues to tout a grand vision. "It won't even seem like a robot," he told investors in October. Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?</p>

Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy. "I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in California. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board. Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers. Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job. Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark. Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen. Business Insider has heard from dozens of workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. "When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle. By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers. After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment. "I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said. As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security. "I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner," he said, adding, "I don't really have a choice." Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it. Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs. "Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes." For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable. Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week." However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. "I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump." While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward. "Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said, adding, "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference."</p>

On October 30, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced the final rule to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. The rule delivers on an executive order Trump signed in March to redefine what "public service" means, including ensuring that employers who participate in activities that do not align with the administration's political views will be barred from qualifying for PSLF. "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service — not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex," Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement. "This is a direct and unlawful attack on nurses, teachers, first responders, and public service workers across the country," advocacy groups Democracy Forward and Protect Borrowers said in a statement, adding: "That's why we will soon see the Trump-Vance administration in court." Are you enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? The department said it will now exclude employers that have "substantial illegal purpose," including: supporting terrorism; helping transgender people transition; working with undocumented immigrants; and engaging in a "pattern" of violating state laws. "When an organization has a pattern or practice of engaging in certain illegal conduct, they have a substantial illegal purpose because a significant amount of their activities are supporting illegal activity," the department's fact sheet said. "Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good." The fact sheet said that employers following the law will not be impacted, along with those found to have "minor compliance issues." Employers will receive notice and an opportunity to review the allegations of illegal activity, and they'll also be able to rebut the department's findings. The department said the PSLF Help Tool, which helps borrowers find qualifying employers, will be updated to reflect any pending eligibility determinations. If an employer is disqualified from PSLF, the fact sheet said they can reapply to be a qualifying employer after 10 years, or they can enter a "corrective action plan" before being disqualified to maintain PSLF eligibility. Borrowers are not able to appeal their employer's qualifying status themselves. Once an employer no longer qualifies for PSLF, any payment borrowers make to that employer after July 1, 2026 will not count toward PSLF progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took "no" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude. Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast. Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home. She can't stay in over the weekend,'" Harris said. This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California. "Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed," she added. In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump. "I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, " she said. At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her. "When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are," she added. "That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself." Learn more about the world of CNBC Make It</p>

One day before he officially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he shared a video on his account that showed him carrying a sink into the social media platform's former headquarters in San Francisco. "Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!," Musk wrote. During Friday's episode of the "All-In" podcast, Musk said that the video, which now has 1.2 million likes and 202,000 reposts, almost didn't happen. "Well, I think the store was confused because my security team was asking for any kind of sink, and normally, people wouldn't ask for any kind of sink because you need a sink that fits in your bathroom or connects to a certain kind of plumbing," Musk said. "So, they're trying to ask, 'What kind of faucets do you want?' Musk said the store almost didn't sell them a sink out of concern. "The store was confused that we just wanted a sink and didn't care what the sink connected to," Musk said. "They were, like, almost not letting us buy the sink because they thought maybe we'd buy the wrong sink." Twitter, now known as X, underwent major changes after Musk completed his takeover, including layoffs, office closures, and the discontinuation of the original blue checkmark verification feature. Another significant shift happened this March when Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, acquired X in an all-stock deal. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach." Grok, a generative chatbot that debuted on the social media platform in November 2023, is just one example of how Musk is encouraging synergy. The chatbot, powered by a large language model with the same name, can answer users' queries on X and in Tesla vehicles. In July, the chatbot faced criticism after it shared several antisemitic posts, prompting xAI to apologize for its "horrific behavior."</p>
