                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sydney Sweeney and her ex-fiancé, Jonathan Davino, allegedly had a tense reunion late Saturday night amid the actress' romance with Scooter Braun. Sweeney was spotted getting into the passenger seat of a car being driven by Davino in Los Angeles Saturday night, according to photos obtained by Page Six. A source who was near Sweeney's home told TMZ that they heard the “Anyone But You” star scream at him when she got out of the car. After the Dodgers came out ahead in a 5-4 victory just before midnight local time, Sweeney was seen getting into an Uber that drove a few blocks away until pulling up next to Davino's car. Sweeney — wearing a brown leather jacket, denim shorts and brown suede boots — and Davino swiftly made their getaway. The “Anyone But You” star's reunion with Davino comes after Page Six reported that Sweeney is enjoying spending time with Braun. “She enjoys having someone to ask advice from about her career,” a source told us last month. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. It's not a casual relationship,” the source said in October. Sweeney and Braun, who were spotted looking cozy on several public outings, have been romantically linked since September. At the time, Braun was back on the market after he and his ex-wife Yael broke up in 2021. The former couple, who finalized their divorce in 2022, share three children. Meanwhile, Sweeney ended her engagement to Davino earlier this year after seven years together. This isn't the first time Sweeney and Davino have joined together since deciding not to go through with their wedding. They also grabbed a low-key lunch in April. Page Six has reached out to Sweeney's rep for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meghan Markle celebrated the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2025 World Series victory by giving her husband, Prince Harry, a big smooch on the lips. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were seen reacting to the Dodgers' game 7 win against the Toronto Blue Jays in a video posted to Markle's Instagram Story Saturday night. Harry was seen seated in a reclining chair in what appeared to be a private theater as the “With Love, Meghan” host was heard cheering off-screen. Markle then materialized and pranced excitedly over to the “Spare” author, who, unenthusiastically, remained in his seat. She excitedly planted a kiss on Harry's lips as he wrapped his arms around her before she threw her arms up in excitement, yelling, “Oh my god!” Markle then proceeded to jump up and down with her friend before they embraced, prompting Harry to let out a chuckle. The As Ever founder, 44, looked cozy in a black lounge set while Harry, 41, looked laid back in a collared shirt and pants. He appeared to be snacking on a box of popcorn. As Page Six reported, Harry and Markle were dressed in matching blue hats as they sat front row at Dodger Stadium in LA Tuesday. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. The duo was seen chatting and laughing throughout the MLB game and even stood up from their seats to clap. While they appeared to be in high spirits throughout the duration of the face-off, they were criticised for having better seats than several sports legends in attendance. Internet users were up in arms when they noticed Harry and Markle sitting in front of former Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax and Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson, who holds a 2.3 percent stake in the LA franchise.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One day after beloved Hallmark star Paul Campbell confirmed that his comedy-infused mystery franchise, “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” has been canceled, shocked fans had already mobilized, launching a petition urging Hallmark execs to reconsider. Wearing the red ballcap from one of his character Alden Case's many hilarious disguises, Campbell posted an Instagram photo on October 31, 2025, and wrote, “Show may be cancelled, but he's still on the Case… IYKYK” In 2023's “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” Campbell and co-star Aimee Garcia play married couple Alden Case, a chronically unemployed but adorable, quirky guy searching for his purpose, and Birdie Case, a gifted attorney. When Alden signs up for private investigator classes, he gets sucked into a murder mystery, only to find Birdie may hold the key to cracking the case. Over 1,300 fans signed the petition and months later, Campbell and Garcia got to reunite for “The Cases of Mystery Lane: Death is Listening,” which premiered in September 2024. In May, Hallmark actor Matt Hamilton — who played dim-witted Officer Newton in both movies — first announced the cancellation on Instagram, writing, “Yes, Paul Campbell and I are building up a nice collection of cancelled shows together. Then, in late September, “Hallmark Mysteries & More” podcast host Eric Rutin shared a screenshot on Instagram of a comment from Campbell on his post about the future of the franchise. Fans flooded Campbell's post with comments expressing their disappointment and surprise, including one who wrote, “I can't believe they cancelled it! I was loving the Mystery Lane movies, and YOU as Alden! On November 1, Campbell shared in his Stories multiple posts that people shared about a brand new petition started by fan Susan Fraser on Change.org to “urge the decision-makers at Hallmark Channel to reconsider their decision to shelve ‘The Cases of Mystery Lane. Even Tyler Hynes, Campbell's buddy and “Three Wisest Men” co-star, shared one of the posts to rally his fans to support the petition. Though Campbell continues to be one of Hallmark's biggest stars, with two Christmas movies still to come in 2025 — “The Wisest Men” and “Christmas at the Catnip Cafe” — losing “The Cases of Mystery Lane” franchise likely stings because it was a role he loved so much. It was everything you could possibly want, plus disguises, fake mustaches. When you film it, there's always the idea that, if this were to go on for a hundred episodes, you would be thrilled.” Those who want to throw their support behind the new petition can find it here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katy Perry is no longer keeping her romance with Justin Trudeau a secret. During her latest concert in Prague on Thursday, the “Firework” hitmaker made it clear that she's no longer single. “This guy is trying to get me to marry him, and he has a ring in his hand,” Perry told the audience. I am dating someone else for crying out f*g loud!” i can‘t with this woman 😂😂😂 @Katy Perry #katyperry #lifetimestour #prague #concert #katycats The “American Idol” judge and former prime minister were first romantically linked in July. At the time, Perry and Trudeau were spotted on a dinner date in Montreal and a stroll in Mount Royal Park. Just last week, the two went public with their relationship when they packed on the PDA during a date night in Paris. They then walked to a waiting vehicle, looking quite happy. Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Perry is very happy with her and Trudeau's blossoming relationship. “[Katy] is trying to keep it low-key, and they've spent a lot of private time together. “He is a much happier person now,” the outlet noted. They have fun together, laugh a lot, talk about everything. The singer was surprised to find a fan holding a sign asking to marry her yet again — an offer she previously also turned down at her London show — and explained she's no longer available. A source also told PEOPLE that Perry and Trudeau are “very much a couple” and always find time for each other despite their busy schedules. Yet he goes the extra mile to be with her when possible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality cookware comes with a hefty price tag for two major reasons: It lasts longer than the cheap stuff, and it supposedly makes you a better chef. So, when I ponied up hard-earned cash for my first Our Place Always Pan, there were big expectations. Let's just say that it impressed me so that since then, my kitchen has been nearly taken over by the brand's cookware and small appliances. It comes with a wood spatula that smartly nests on the handle and an aluminum strainer that makes draining pasta or steaming veggies a cinch. OK, I was in love with my original little pink Wonder Oven, another kitchen multitasker. It's perfect for small kitchens and has a petite counter footprint. I may retire it, though, since trying the new Wonder Oven Pro, which is larger and impressively offers even more functionality. (This is the first time that it's been on sale!) Besides the myriad options of the original, it also proofs dough for homemade bread and pastries, and has a dehydrating function, to make sulfur-free homemade dried fruit snacks (or whatever dehydrated snacks you fancy). If a foodie is on your holiday list, there are giftable sets and suggestions starting under $50. I love my mom's 1970s Le Creuset, but it has seen better days. This cast-iron stove-to-oven Perfect Pot might just be the one to replace it. I have some limited-edition mini bowls from the brand, which I've had for years, and they have not so much as chipped since then, despite getting used on a near-daily basis. I'm so taken with the designs, I might add some dinner bowls for pasta and big salad bowls to my collection now, thanks to this sale. The stackable set is made from chip-resistant ceramic stoneware and is available in three sizes and three colors (I'm just hooked on the spice hue). Using it is the first time I've successfully cooked dried beans, and incredibly, they come out to buttery perfection in 20 minutes. Since the season is turning, I'll be making big pots of my apple pie filling, with maple syrup instead of sugar, that I put on everything all fall long. They fit on the handles of all Our Place cookware, so you don't have to find your giant oven mitts. However, the other hot grips (sans charms) are indeed marked down to $26 — if you're not a sucker for adorable kitchen accessories like me! A great gift or a kitchen essential for any baker or chef, this Oeko-Tex certified, 100% cotton twill apron is included in the deals and comes in three colors. One shopper wrote, “Got this as a gift for my momma. She loves all the pockets and how sturdy it is!” This article was written by Erica Radol, Page Six Commerce Reporter.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brandi Carlile returned to Saturday Night Live on Nov. 2 with a commanding performance of “Church & State” and “Human,” both from her newly released solo album Returning to Myself. This marks Carlile's fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John promoting their joint project Who Believes in Angels?. On Saturday's show, she took center stage solo, delivering two emotionally charged performances. Mariah Carey Announces 'It's Time' for Christmas 2025 in Ad With Sephora Kali Uchis Named a 2025 ASCAP Women Behind the Music Honoree & More Uplifting Moments Oasis Ends 19-Year Drought With Blinding First Concert of Australian 'Live '25' Tour She followed with “Human,” a soaring ballad that reflects on vulnerability and resilience — also the name of her upcoming Human Tour, which kicks off in February 2026. The two songs are from Carlile's eighth studio album, Returning to Myself, released Oct. 25. It marks her first solo LP since 2021's In These Silent Days, which peaked at No. Since her last solo project, Carlile has remained a central figure in American roots and rock music — curating music festivals (Girls Just Wanna Weekend, Echoes Through the Canyon), forming the country supergroup The Highwomen, and collaborating with legends like Elton John, Joni Mitchell and Tanya Tucker. Carlile also appeared in the episode's promos, stealing the scene with a joke about noticing co-star Ashley Padilla's haircut before Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller, who hosted this week's episode.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump reminded everyone that New York's mayoral election on Tuesday is about him—to some extent—while making fun of each candidate. And in that way, I am already one step ahead of the game.” Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa (Shane Gillis) then answered succinctly: “I need a job.” And Zohran Mamdani (Ramy Youssef) acknowledged with a smile that what he wants to see in the city—affordable housing, free healthcare, free wifi—would probably not be happening. Trump (James Austin Johnson) entered the debate stage after each candidate was asked what they felt was the “biggest problem” they would have to deal with if elected. “We can pretend this election is going to be about housing or taxes, but it's about me, because I'm going to be very involved, very hands-on. Something must be done about Sliwa's “Emily in Paris-looking hat,” Trump continued, while Mamdani “looks like the subway takes guy went to work at McKinsey.” Trump then an answered a question that had been put to the candidates earlier: their preferred type of bagel. 'SNL' Cold Open: Trump Crashes NYC Mayoral Debate to Roast Each Candidate “Big Mac with a hole in the middle,” he said confidently. “Now I may not live in New York anymore, but I'm always watching, lurking in the shadows,” he continued, segueing into a Phantom of the Opera cosplay. “Maybe I'll add New York mayor to my list of duties.”</p>

The duo topped the leaderboard on “Halloween Night,” earning a 39 out of 40 for their haunting tango to Billie Eilish's “Bury a Friend.” Cheryl Burke, who served as a guest judge, was the only panelist not to give a perfect 10. After the episode aired, Earle's stepmom, Ashley, took a jab at Burke on social media, telling her to “go take more Ozempic.” She later apologized for the comment. Earlier this week, Earle, 24, revealed that her spooky “Halloween Night” performance almost looked very different. In a behind-the-scenes TikTok posted October 30, she explained that the pair originally planned to start their tango buried under a pile of dirt. “This is crazier than expected,” Earle said in the video as she stood in the mock graveyard set. To keep the set clean and safe, producers decided to replace the dirt with rubber mulch. Earle later joked in the comments that she was still finding dirt and sand in her costume for days and gave a shout-out to the “DWTS” crew for their hard work cleaning up the mess.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The federal government is still shut down, food stamps are being cut off for millions of Americans, the Los Angeles Dodgers are still grinding it out with the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series Game 7 and there are big elections in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey on coming this week. So, of course, tonight's Saturday Night Live opened with a fictional Big Apple Mayoral debate. Returning host Miles Teller played ex-Empire State governor and alleged sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo (“I know this city like the back of a women's back”), and the SNL-fired and later host Shane Gillis put on the red beret to be low-polling Republican candidate and Guardian Angel CEO Curtis Sliwa. Upping the ante, Ramy Youssef showed up as front-runner Zohran Mamdani. Pitching himself to New Yorkers, Youssef's much mispronounced Mamdani put in bluntly and smoothly in that TikTok kinda way that has characterized the long-shot race that the Assemblyman is almost certain to win: “Once you vote for me, you know you'll feel a little less bad about that chicken and rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen, so why don't you hit me up on the ballot box, girl?” SNL being SNL, even in what was ultimately one of the most topical but forgettable cold opens in ages, cast member James Austin Johnson showed up as Donald Trump. Swearing that his go-to bagel order is a “Big Mac with a hole in the middle,” the former New York resident cut to the chase and pronounced “this election is about housing and taxes, but we all know it's about me, right?” Which, almost everything in America is nowadays — sadly. The fourth episode of the Lorne Michaels-created NBC late-nighter's 51st season, SNL tonight sees Teller back as host for a second time. The Top Gun: Maverick and Eternity star is actually the SNL rookie this week compared to musical guest Brandi Carlile. As Deadline exclusively reported earlier this week, SNL will have a double punch of Thanksgiving and Christmas specials later this year too. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading figures across film, television, music and art came together Nov. 1 at the 2025 LACMA Art + Film Gala, including Angela Bassett, Demi Moore, Quinta Brunson, Dustin Hoffman, Tessa Thompson, Elle Fanning, Finneas, Demi Lovato and more. Other attendees included Emmy-winning Hacks star Hannah Einbinder, F1 actor Damson Idris, Dancing with the Stars competitor Alix Earle, Nobody Wants This star Justine Lupe and Overcompensating creator Benito Skinner. This year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art honors Mary Corse — the artist whose work across six decades has explored light, perception and subjectivity — as well as Sinners and Fruitvale Station filmmaker Ryan Coogler, who was in attendance alongside producer and wife Zinzi Coogler. Last year's honorees were artist Simone Leigh and director Baz Luhrmann. The Gucci-sponsored event featured LACMA trustee Eva Chow and Leonardo DiCaprio as co-chairs for its 14th consecutive year. Proceeds from the annual Art+Film Gala go toward underwriting LACMA's initiative to make film more central to the museum's curatorial programming, while also providing funding for exhibitions, acquisitions and education, in addition to allowing for screenings that explore the intersection of art and film. Past honorees of the Art+Film Gala include artists Helen Pashgian, Catherine Opie, Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Barbara Kruger and David Hockney, as well as filmmakers David Fincher, Park Chan-wook, Steven Spielberg, Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, George Lucas, Kathryn Bigelow, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Clint Eastwood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new interview with company CEO Sam Reich, the streamer revealed that it's now passed the 1 million paid subscribers mark. That puts Dropout on roughly the same tier as niche streaming companies like Shudder or Acorn TV, and not far behind a sports streamer like FuboTV. Which isn't bad for a streamer that doesn't license any third-party content, and instead makes all of its own stuff—including format-breaking, improv-heavy game shows like Game Changer and Make Some Noise. (To say nothing of the company's other big flagship show, Dungeons & Dragons actual play series Dimension 20, which had live shows at both Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl in 2025.) And, sure, those numbers start to look like slightly smaller potatoes compared to a Netflix—which has something like 300 million subscribers planetwide, a number that means its growth is starting to be curtailed by the total number of internet-connected humans on Earth as much as it is by more editorial concerns—or even the much smaller numbers posted by services like Apple TV+ (45 million) or Peacock (41 million). Again, though: Those are arms of massive corporations, in comparison to a company that employs roughly 40 people, according to the Variety interview, and which makes and owns its own stuff, a rarity in the streaming world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Famke Janssen has a new Netflix show out this week, with her Dutch crime drama Amsterdam Empire getting a global debut back on October 30. But, deep down, Janssen knowns that people are frequently only interested in asking her about one thing, i.e., a project she was last part of fully 11 years ago (and even then, only as a cameo): Fox's original X-Men movies, where she played psychic powerhouse Jean Grey. Never ever,” Janssen said when asked by Entertainment Weekly if she'd ever had conversations about bringing her version of Jean back for the MCU. (This, despite the fact that a large number of her former co-stars on the franchise will be back for next December's Avengers: Doomsday, including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Rebecca Romjin, and Alan Cumming.) It all sounds pretty academic to Janssen, though, who appears to have gained some level of acceptance about how influential a role (that she herself apparently never cared all that much about) has become. “Every time I do an interview, it's mentioned,” she notes. I didn't realize that was such a big part. I'm sure every single time there's a new movie that they're doing… it'll come up again.” IT: Welcome To Derry finds its sea legs—and cruelty By William Hughes October 31, 2025 | 3:01am Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere has no idea why Nebraska is a great album By Alex Lei October 29, 2025 | 4:00pm November film preview: Zootopia, Predator, and Wicked return for sequel-heavy Thanksgiving By Matt Schimkowitz October 28, 2025 | 1:00pm</p>

Ben Stiller Compares 'Nepo Baby' Criticism To 'Brat Pack', Considers It "A Selling Point" 'Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost' Review: Ben Stiller's Enlightening Documentary About His Famous And Funny Parents Becomes A Family Affair To Remember A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) News of working alongside the actress-singer: “What's surprising, and maybe not really surprising, is how amazingly she blended in. What she's doing in this movie is very unique, it's a very unique character, and we're having a great time and just like to work with her.” It followed Greg Focker, a nurse who suffers a series of unfortunate events while visiting his soon-to-be in-laws, played by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, who are set to reprise their roles. Teri Polo, who played Pam Byrnes, Greg's girlfriend-turned-wife, is also set to return. The jury is still out whether Barbra Streisand will reprise her role as Roz Focker, Greg's mom, and the EGOT winner has said she's “pissed” about having been paid less than her male co-stars in the franchise. Aside from appearing in Focker-in-Law, Grande has a busy slate ahead, with the forthcoming release of Wicked: For Good, her 2026 tour in support of her seventh studio album Eternal Sunshine and voice role in the new animated feature Oh, the Places You'll Go!, based on Dr. Seuss's classic children's book.
