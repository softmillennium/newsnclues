                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Posted in: Amazon Studios, CW, TV | Tagged: Jensen Ackles, Supernatural, the boys Check out highlights from Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys) tearing up the stage during SPN Nashville's Saturday Night Special concert. Between Prime Video's The Boys: Vought Rising quietly rolling along with production (which is a nice way of saying that not a lot of news is getting out), and Countdown being cancelled (even as fans continue fighting to save it), we thought Jensen Ackles fans might want a little something in their lives that would give them a chance to smile. That's where Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead": Creation Nashville comes in, with Ackles taking the stage to join Louden Swain, Mark Sheppard, and Richard Speight Jr. for the Saturday Night Special – and we've got some highlights to pass along. Here's a look at some great videos that Creation Entertainment and Fangasm posted from this weekend's Saturday Night Special in Nashville: Here's a clip of Jensen Ackles performing "Whipping Post" with Louden Swain, Mark Sheppard, and Richard Speight, Jr.#SPNNASH pic.twitter.com/bfZRo15U7Y @JensenAckles @stevecarlson and a little hip action #spnnash pic.twitter.com/MVYnlVZ4xI In September, Ackles was the subject of a profile interview with Variety, which covered a wide range of topics. Regarding Supernatural, Ackles shared how his 15-season run gave him "the tools" he needed to move on to roles in The Boys, Countdown, and Big Sky. As for his feelings about being most known for playing Dean Winchester, Ackles makes it clear that he wouldn't change it for anything, opening about about how much the Supernatural family still means to him to this day. Jensen Ackles Credits "Supernatural" For Giving Him "The Tools" His Career Needed: "'Locked-in' is a good word. 'Supernatural' gave me not just 15 years of a great story to tell and family that I've now come to know and love, but it gave me the tools to continue doing what I'm doing. It also gave me some notoriety so that people like showrunners like Derek or even Elwood Reid, who brought me onto 'Big Sky' and has also brought me onto 'Tracker,' and of course Eric Kripke — it gave me some proof in the pudding that I'm happy to take on whatever kind of challenges these guys throw at me. And I've met actors that have had very popular characters on very popular shows or movies, and maybe try to shy away from that, like, 'Oh, I don't want to be known for that.' I would never shy away from or reject anything that has brought me to this place, because I'm very proud of what we all did on that show, and obviously, I continue to talk about it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SALT LAKE CITY — On Halloween night, while many were out trick-or-treating or attending costume parties, a brave group of locals chose a different kind of adventure — one that explores the haunted corners of Salt Lake City's historic downtown. “There are definitely things happening here,” said Cody Owen, a guide with U.S. Ghost Adventures. Owen led a group of ghost-hunting enthusiasts through six of the city's most haunted locations, starting with the historic Capitol Theatre. Doors that are locked will be unlocked,” Owen explained. Armed with lanterns and EMF detectors — devices used to detect electromagnetic fields often associated with paranormal activity — the group wandered through the city's eerie landmarks. “Whether the spirits are trying to prevent history from repeating itself or simply stay connected, they're here.” For ghost-hunting enthusiast Gage Ramos, his appreciation for the past is more than just a thrill; it's something he likes to share with others. “It's something I love doing with friends,” Ramos said. On Halloween night, while many were out trick-or-treating or attending costume parties, a brave group of locals chose a different kind of adventure — one that explores the haunted corners of Salt Lake City's historic downtown. While the women accused in the infamous Salem witch trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that. Friday is Halloween, which means tons of kids will be out trick-or-treating. Halloween comes with a very important decision every year: Where should we go trick-or-treating? A majestic Norway spruce in upstate New York has been chosen as this year's Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. Now after nearly a decade of renovations, the theater will reopen this fall. By scheduling an annual tune-up with a technician, you can extend the lifespan of your furnace from what may have been 10-12 years to 15-20 years or even longer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it comes to writing any piece of fiction, one of the hardest aspects to nail is the ending. Wrapping everything up in a nice little bow whilst simultaneously saying what you intended to say from the start is actually not such an easy feat, as it turns out. This is especially true, considering that you can't please everyone, and that any ending will inevitably disappoint or anger some of the fans. Perhaps no one knows this better than TV screenwriters, especially in the realm of fantasy, as there have been numerous TV shows that have dropped the ball for their final episodes. While not everyone loathed these finales with a passion, it's important to know that some were fine with them, and some even loved them. There's a lot of debate surrounding these final episodes, but there's no denying that they were extremely controversial, no matter where you stand. Granted, many die-hard fans of Supernatural didn't really have anything bad to say about the finale, and it wasn't widely criticized for bad writing or bad character moments like other shows are. All in all, it's not really the most controversial ending to a TV show ever created, but it was still met with its fair share of disappointment. It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't inspire the same level of near-unanimous approval as its earlier episodes did. Those who weren't too pleased with Buffy's conclusion criticized it for its out-of-character moments and its abrupt change in direction, which disgruntled fans claimed were against the reasons they fell in love with the show in the first place. Of course, some fans didn't mind the ending so much, but this didn't stop the louder, angrier group from complaining. Once Upon a Time is a show that fell victim to the classic fault of running longer than it really should've. Many fans felt that it could have been easily wrapped up in six seasons, yet it inexplicably ran for one extra season. This only served to disappoint people, especially the fans who felt that they had already gotten proper closure. Instead, Season 7 tried to change things for the worse, including an absurd number of retcons that left things convoluted and messy. Fans didn't really like how this unwarranted extension lessened any emotional impact that the finale deserved, and also disliked how much it felt like a cheap cash grab with how it tried desperately to milk the show for what it was worth. On the other hand, some fans were more than happy to receive another season and see some of their favorite characters again, so they didn't really mind if the quality wasn't up to par. Merlin is a show that lasted five seasons, which is exactly the amount it planned to receive, as the showrunners didn't want to overstay their welcome or have the show grow stale. Unfortunately, some felt it did just that anyway in the final episode. The show was generally pretty light-hearted and contained a fair bit of comedy, despite being for more mature audiences, which is why many felt a bit insulted by its bitter ending. Instead of getting the satisfying conclusion that fans expected, many were faced with a bleak, depressing ending that nobody could have seen coming in a million years. Some fans also felt that the ending was a bit rushed, but others still enjoyed the final episodes for what they were. It lasted nearly an entire decade, but tragically suffered towards the end, which is where many felt it took a sharp turn in the wrong direction. Many characters also exited in ways that fans felt didn't befit them, and some relationships were never fully elaborated upon or given closure. The vampire romance show is certainly nothing new or groundbreaking, but many fans of the genre did end up liking it very much. The conclusion, though, really reached a whole new level of divisiveness in the genre, which nobody could have predicted. Some fans felt satisfied and were able to just move on, but this doesn't mean everyone was able to. One of the main reasons some hated it was due to character inconsistencies that seemed to come out of nowhere, as well as a perceived decline in the quality of the writing. On top of that, one of the major flaws that people pointed out was that the show lost its sense of excitement and passion, almost like the cast and crew were growing bored by it and no longer felt the love they once had. Lost was one of the most revolutionary TV shows of all time, as it served as a hybrid of sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery, and was so much more than it initially appeared to be. The show follows a group of survivors after their plane crashes on an uncharted island. Many of these characters are played by some pretty big names, and all get their own moments to shine as the episodes provide flashbacks that delve into their backstories. But not everybody minded this so much, as some felt it was more fun to work out the answers on your own and develop your own personal theories. There's no question that the most divisive series finale in all of fantasy has got to belong to Game of Thrones. It might be appalling to those who hate it, but there are actually people who enjoyed the finale for various reasons. One of the most legendary fantasy TV shows in history, Game of Thrones faced significant backlash in its final season from fans, many of whom felt the show's shortest season was rushed, messy, and sometimes nonsensical. While those who liked the finale acknowledge that it does have its flaws and isn't as good as the previous seasons, many felt that it's still comparatively pretty good compared to some of the absolute garbage that can be found on TV. Wherever you stand, there is no denying that this show had a very polarizing finale, perhaps the most polarizing in the entire history of television. Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgia Republican lawmaker also claims she didn't know Rothschild family, of her ‘space laser' theory, was Jewish Republican US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene has said she believes in demons, surmising that they might be aliens who fell from heaven, and claims to have been unaware that key figures in the antisemitic space lasers conspiracy she floated were Jewish. She made those bizarre remarks as a guest on Friday on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher after winning some fans among Democrats who once loathed her – yet had come to appreciate how the far-right Georgia representative had recently broken with Republicans on various issues. Greene's appearance on Maher's show perhaps made evident the ideological distance between the congresswoman – who has conspicuously avoided directly criticizing Trump himself – and some of her newer, cross-aisle admirers. Maher on Friday asked another of his on-air guests, film-maker Dan Farah, to discuss his new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, and how it explores the way some senior US military officials apparently theorize earnestly that “demons” may be responsible for what some colloquially refer to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. Greene, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, confidently answered: “Absolutely. The Fifth Column podcast host Michael Moynihan was also participating in the discussion, and Maher called on him to say whether he agreed with Greene. The progressive watchdog Media Matters uncovered that post weeks into Greene's first congressional term. Greene on Friday declared to Maher that she initially “didn't even know the Rothschilds were Jewish”. Maher pointed out that “‘Rothschild', to a lot of people, is almost synonymous with the word ‘Jewish'”. Well, now we know … That's what I'm here for – to make sure that people in Congress know what the fuck you're talking about.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Close Encounters of the Third Kind” is considered a landmark science-fiction film that fueled greater curiosities about the wonders and mysteries of extraterrestrial life. Now more than 48 years since its release, the movie is sparking a question that doesn't have an answer. The latest mystery doesn't involve aliens, flashing lights or UFOs, but the fate of an old farmhouse where the movie's alien abduction scene of a 3-year-old boy took place. “I think people are interested to know what is going on,” said Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell, unaware of the reasons for the issue. The developer has until November 21 to provide some information. Tim Herrington, a Realtor who is also working on the project, emailed AL.com to say there is “no update at this time.” “I have not had anyone voice disappointment that it hasn't been done,” said Erik Cortinas, the city's building official. “Any calls I have received were mainly just curiosity, and people wanting to verify the developer's intention is still to preserve and relocate the structure.” He added, “We do not want to rush such an endeavor.” Projects are ongoing at and near the farmhouse. A new Sherwin Williams paint shop is under construction to the immediate south of the farmhouse. That project was approved by the council last October. In addition, a new office building with an orthodontics practice is under construction near Route 118 and 104. The plans for that project were approved on April 14. Fairhope city officials got in on the act as well during its Nov. 21, 2024, meeting by posting an alien face marker on a map to show where the house was eventually relocating. However, city officials including Mayor Sherry Sullivan said they were hopeful the development team would create a historic marker or additional wayfinding information connecting the house to a movie considered among the best directed by iconic Hollywood director Stephen Spielberg. “There is a history of the arts that people don't necessarily associate with Alabama,” said Max Romanowski, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of South Alabama. The preservation of stuff like this is culturally and historically valuable.” The potential also exists for an unexpected tourism boom connected to the public's fascination with aliens. In nearby Pascagoula, for instance, the city celebrates a wild story about a local alien abduction during the annual Goula Palooza, held downtown in early October. Roswell, New Mexico, has been transformed from a small rural town to a tourism mecca for alien enthusiasts and curiosity seekers. Since then, the county has more than doubled in size to a population of over 231,000 people. The farmhouse itself was surrounded by nothing but rural landscape. In recent years, Route 181 has seen extra traffic lanes added. Simmons said last year that he was uncertain how the house would be relocated. The lack of activity has caught some city officials by surprise and uncertainty on the next steps. “Everything is in the same place,” said Fairhope City Councilman Jimmy Conyers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With warnings for language, violence, murder, suicide, and "references to the occult", the horror game lets you play across multiple timelines, hunt and communicate with entities, "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate", and offers multiple endings that "expand the story". "Daniel and Jessica Stewart have decided to remodel their first home," the description teases. "Old and dilapidated, they begin to record the adventures of their renovation, but the couple soon discovers their new home hides much more than asbestos and faulty wiring. "As they dig deeper into the mysterious house, their excitement turns to concern when they uncover strange markings and items hidden within the walls. Sinking deeper into the influences of a dark presence, Daniel and Jessica are unprepared for the horrifying events that follow." It was so successful, in fact, that earlier this year, we learned that production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role. Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant. Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire actor Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She's made a name for herself as psychic to the stars having worked with the likes of George Michael, Michelle Keegan and Princess Diana. Yet Sally Morgan revealed she had the tricky task of telling one Hollywood star the upsetting news that her marriage was about to come to an end. Sally, 74, worked with Uma Thurman in the Noughties and told Daily Mail: 'As soon as she walked in I thought "Oh my God, she's about to get rid of her husband. How am I going to tell her this?" Uma, 55, was married to fellow Hollywood heavyweight Ethan Hawke at the time. At the time of their split, Ethan, 54, who shares children Maya, 27, and Levon, 23, with Uma was rumoured to have been unfaithful. He had been accused of cheating on Uma with their children's nanny Ryan Shawhughes. The Training Day actor denied the affair but he did begin publicly dating Ryan after he and Uma finalized their divorce in 2005. Elsewhere in the chat, Psychic Sally revealed her favourite celebrities she's worked with, naming 'sweet' Christine McGuinness, 'funny' Thomas Skinner and 'wonderful' influencer Char Bailey. 'So very quickly I learned that you can't self-edit'. She added: 'But there have been occasions when I've been reading for somebody and I think this person is going to have an accident or be attacked and I'll say, "you should avoid  this or that". While Sally has millions of fans there are also many out there who have accused her of being a fraud. Yet she pays no attention to critics, as she explained: 'I don't say it's a belief system because I think whether you believe I happen to believe in a God or not, if you don't follow any religion, any denomination, you can still have spirit around you. 'You don't have to believe, it's about trusting.' Sally also revealed what she believes happens after death, explaining that she considers there to be the earth we're on and then divinity - a divine energy. She mused: 'There can be really good, lovely people, but we don't all get to there [divinity]. Sally sadly lost her husband John in September 2021 following a short battle with coronavirus and she said it brings her comfort to imagine where his spirit is now. 'I see it like he's gone to a room which has got everything in there he wanted - his garden, his football and all of that, but he can't get out and I can't get in. 'So I think heaven is full of love and I think that this is hard for us to take on board because we grieve so much. 'We say, "I know my John would want to be down here with his grandchildren," but he's OK where he is because we are all meant to go there.</p>
