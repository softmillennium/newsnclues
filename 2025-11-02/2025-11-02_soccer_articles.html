                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold scored 23 goals and contributed 92 assists in his 354 appearances for Liverpool Trent Alexander-Arnold says his feelings for former club Liverpool will not change, no matter what reception he receives on his Anfield return with Real Madrid. Alexander-Arnold was criticised by some Liverpool fans for the way he allowed his contract to expire, before eventually leaving in June for a reported cut-price £8.4m so he could join Real Madrid at the Fifa Club World Cup. "No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool," the 27-year-old full-back told Amazon Prime, when asked if getting a good reception back at Anfield would give him closure. He made 354 appearances for his boyhood club, turning out for the final time in May against Crystal Palace, after which they were presented with the Premier League trophy. Alexander-Arnold was one of three senior Liverpool players - alongside captain Virgil van Dijk and talisman Mohamed Salah - to enter the final year of their contracts last season. "I spoke to Robbo [Andy Robertson], Mo [Salah], Ibu [Ibrahima Konate]," added Alexander-Arnold. Alexander-Arnold has only recently returned to the Real Madrid squad after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in a Champions League tie against Marseille on 16 September. But he has yet to make an appearance in the side and likely to start on the bench against Liverpool as 15-time European champions Real - managed by another former Reds player in Xabi Alonso - bid for a fourth successive win in this season's competition. Alexander-Arnold has endured a difficult time since his Madrid move, struggling to establish himself in the first team, being left out of the England squad and sidelined by injury. But he praised Real's England midfielder Jude Bellingham for helping him to adapt. "It's good to have someone else that is English here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trent Alexander-Arnold insists he won't celebrate if he scores for Real Madrid on his return to Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday. “If I was to score, then no I wouldn't celebrate to be honest,” he told Prime Video Sport. “It will be a big difference for me going into the away dressing room, warming up on the other side. “When I made the decision to move on, it was probably destined that at some point being here I'd play against Liverpool.” Alexander-Arnold, 27, who has been an unused substitute in Madrid's past two matches after recovering from a hamstring injury, says whatever reception he gets from the home supporters won't change his affection for Liverpool. He was booed by a significant section of fans after announcing his plan to leave in May, but was ultimately given a warm send-off amid the Premier League title celebrations. I'll always be thankful for the opportunities and the things that we achieved together… they'll live with me forever. “No matter what, my feeling won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime.” “I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen. It will be a very difficult game, but one I am excited for. “Although they haven't had the results of late, they're still a top footballing team, and nobody here thinks it's going to be an easy game.” Alexander-Arnold also spoke about the influence of fellow England international, club team-mate and close friend Jude Bellingham in convincing him to make the move last summer. He said: “There was a lot of speculation… the ‘agent Jude' stuff. It was more so in his first season (at Real Madrid). “We would meet up at England camps and everyone would want to know what it was like behind the scenes. I wanted a new challenge so it was time to go and do that. It's good to have someone else who is English here. It made settling a lot easier for me.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Premier League rivals Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are all set to go head-to-head in the transfer market to secure a move for FC Porto's star striker Samu Aghehowa. Aghehowa enjoyed a stellar debut campaign in Portugal as he scored 27 goals across all competitions and provided three assists. As Aghehowa continues with stunning form, he has attracted interest from Chelsea, alongside Tottenham Hotspur, according to Correio da Manha. The report further adds that former Blues manager and current Porto president Andre Villas-Boas is ready to sanction a move for Aghehowa. The striker's current deal at the Liga Portugal side runs until 2029 and has a €100million (£88m/$115.9m) release clause; however, Villas-Boas could let him leave for €80m as he considers it to be an "irresistible deal". The other clubs from the English top-flight had shown interest in Aghehowa in the last summer transfer window as Newcastle United and Aston Villa reportedly considered signing him, but both offers were turned down. Portuguese outlet Record reported in August that the Magpies had enquired about the striker as they were desperately looking for Alexander Isak's replacement at that time. But despite their strong interest, the Spaniard turned the offer down as he was fully committed to Porto's campaign and was looking forward to winning more trophies. After a shock defeat at the hands of Sunderland last weekend, Chelsea returned to winning ways on Saturday as they edged out Spurs 1-0 courtesy of Joao Pedro's first-half strike. The Blues climbed back into the Premier League's top four with a deserved win away at Spurs on Saturday. Enzo Maresca's side were head and shoulders above their London rivals as the disparity between the two teams was clear for all to see throughout the 90 minutes, with Thomas Frank's side registering just three shots in total and one on target. The Blues next face Qarabag in the Champions League away from home on Wednesday, before hosting Wolves for a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on November 8.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nashville started strong and held on to an early lead to beat Inter Miami in game two of their first round MLS playoff series, 2-1, on Saturday night. Lionel Messi scored the only goal for Miami, who threatened late but were unable to find a stoppage time equalizer, and could now face a second straight opening round elimination after taking a 1-0 lead. Miami got off to a signature slow start, with some sloppy defensive play costing them the lead. Rocco Rios Novo reacted late to Hany Mukhtar's lofted ball, Sam Surridge galloped onto it and was clipped while trying to round the stranded goalkeeper. They fell asleep on a corner, and center back Josh Bauer simply reacted first to a loose ball. He comfortably hooked home with the goal gaping. The second half was all Miami, but not enough. It seemed like the inevitable equalizer was coming. But Nashville defended well, cut off angles, and after clearing a last-minute free kick, were good value for the home win. GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Geodis Park. Got into the scrappy stuff early, and certainly could have been sent off. Will need to keep his cool a bit more in the series final. Sacrificed for a more attacking setup at the break - which was unfair given that he turned in a solid first half. Played some nice passes, connected with Messi, but could never find the killer ball. Hardly involved in 50 minutes of action, and was dutifully hooked. A really composed midfield performance without much support. Dropped into a load of deep positions and left De Paul isolated at times. Missed a golden opportunity in the first half, and never fully recovered. Basically marked out of the game for 89 minutes, then scored an absolute worldie to give Miami life. Hit the post, and was otherwise pretty quiet. Added a bit more creativity in the midfield when introduced at half-time. Went unchanged from the first game win, which he can't really be blamed for. But was then outcoached and will have to face the nerves of a deciding game.</p>
