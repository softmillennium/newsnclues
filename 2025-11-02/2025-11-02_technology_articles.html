With Windows 10 reaching its end of life (EOL) last month, a free third-party tool called Flyoobe (which we have covered here) has been gaining popularity for enabling safe upgrades to Windows 11 on unsupported systems by bypassing the system requirements. Additionally, it includes various options to customize the OS further, such as removing AI features and unwanted apps. According to a notice marked "SECURITY ALERT" on the official Github page, an unofficial mirror is being hosted at https://flyoobe.net/ (do not visit), which may contain malware or a tampered build of Flyoobe. Originally known as Flyby11, Flyoobe describes itself as “a better way to set up Windows,” and aims to make Windows 11 more accessible and customizable, especially on older or less powerful hardware. So it will bypass TPM module checks, etc. With that, Flyoobe also gives users the flexibility to remove AI-based components and trim unnecessary features to create a lighter installation. Malicious versions of software potentially include hidden keyloggers, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, or scripts that compromise sensitive data during the Windows installation process. Even if the installer may appear to work as intended, tampered builds can introduce backdoors or stability issues that are difficult to trace and fix. That the reputable sounding imposter website URL exists is worrying, so please avoid it. Hopefully, the fake Flyoobe hosting will be shut down shortly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They're butt ugly heat islands that take up way too much space. While adding solar on them doesn't solve the last issue, it does help mitigate the heat island effect and solar panels are no less ugly than asphalt. Plus it is power creation right next to where it is being consumed for minimal transfer losses. But I find geometric rows of tilted rectangles much less noisy (visually) than a zillion random cars, or an acre of cracked asphalt. Just because old school power generation is often out of sight, it shouldn't be out of mind Alberta was the the fastest growing renewable producer in Canada due to high winds and long solar days and low cloud cover. The provincial government in the pocket of the oil industry banned renewable developments for months under the excuse that it was "destroying farmland" and then came back months later with a policy that hamstringed future development.to these people, renewables are a threat because they can't be a parasite off it. The best thing is that EV owners can be paid during the day for providing demand and paid again in the evening and at night for supplying. Who is then paying for the solar?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's a bent-out-of-shape GPU repair that quickly turned from a curiosity into a horror story: A dead Aorus-branded Nvidia RTX 4090 card landed on the desk of Northwest Repair, originally reported to have a melted connector and "some knocked off components," but one by one, slowly, the tech finds so much wrong with this card that it's deemed irreparable by the end. That's rare for a GPU in those skillful hands. Let's dive into the rocky journey of attempting to fix a Scoliosis-ridden graphics card that's literally bent out of shape. The bad signs began immediately: not only was the card obviously and unnaturally curved, but the backplate was screwed on with aftermarket plastic screws and looked severely worn, as if someone had thrown it around. Once disassembled, the PCB itself was basically straight, but the cooler was so twisted that our host, Tony, just gave up trying to bend it back into shape. Under a thermal camera, he saw heat building up around the VRAM area, indicating that 12V was shorted to the memory and likely propagated further, frying other components. When put underneath a microscope, he discovered the card had previously been RMA'd, as it was in poor condition with a bunch of missing components, but nothing too egregious jumped out right away — except for grinding marks near a screw post, hinting that a Dremel was used there for some reason. Tony grounded the memory rail to stabilize it before pushing a higher current to see what else was causing issues. Removing the MOSFET made the short go away, and after replacing it with a new one from a donor board, he tested again. Tony once again injected a few amps into the VRAM, and sure enough, the core started getting hot, confirming a dreadful conclusion. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. You might be wondering why it looked “okay” before, and that's because the resistance test only shows obvious shorts; it's only when actual current is injected that the electrically wounded GPU core collapsed and confirmed it was dead. Tony admits he didn't need to do all that, and that reviving this card based on its condition would be nothing short of a miracle. It's a routine part of electronics repair and par for the course when attempting to fix sensitive hardware like graphics cards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Some familiar names are still around, like DirecTV, but even more have popped up as wholly unique entities. TV looks a lot different than it did a decade ago, with cord-cutting going mainstream, and TV giants ditching the proprietary boxes and hardware leases in favor of streaming over the internet. Although the best live TV streaming services make it easier to watch live TV (often for cheaper), the internet has introduced its own problems. A large roster of brands has fragmented channel lineups, and ongoing negotiations with streaming platforms have meant channels disappear from some networks overnight. I went on a deep dive into channels, DVR, sports, on-demand videos, and increasingly confusing add-ons and pricing to understand where the live TV streaming market is at, and which service you should spend your money on. How You Can Stream Live TV for Free Most live TV streaming services will cost you money, and they aren't cheap, with the going price sitting above $80 per month. However, a new model for streaming live TV has been growing in popularity over the last several years known as FAST, or free ad-supported television. There are several FAST services available, with some of the more popular options being Tubi, Roku TV, Pluto, and Peacock. The channels you find on FAST services don't mirror those of a traditional live TV provider, so you shouldn't expect to see major networks like Discovery, at least in the same form you find them on cable. There are thousands of FAST channels, and most of them focus on a specific genre or even a specific series. For instance, Tubi has dedicated channels for Johnny Carson, The Carol Burnett Show, and Baywatch, while Pluto TV includes dozens of channels dedicated to sitcom re-runs, as well as a channel dedicated solely to Dateline re-runs. You won't find much in the way of live sports or new, live premieres, but FAST services are great if you just want TV for TV's sake. How You Can Stream ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Live ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox are all broadcast through local affiliates, so you'll need a live TV streaming service that can deliver local affiliates. Sling, for instance, includes NBC, ABC, and Fox, but it doesn't have CBS. And Philo doesn't offer any local affiliates. Half of the battle with live TV streaming services is even understanding what you're getting. Sling Orange & Blue, for instance, includes local affiliates, but unlike other services I looked it, it doesn't comes with CBS. DirecTV is expensive, for instance, but it doesn't have major holes in the channels lineup like Sling TV, which you have to make up with paid add-ons. I never experienced any outage problems, so my focus shifted to usability in the app. Beyond usability and channel selection, I focused in on a few other key elements. Most live TV streaming services offer unlimited cloud DVR, but some do it better than others. Sling, on the other hand, charges for unlimited DVR. Hulu and Disney+ are subscriptions you probably want anyway, and adding live TV with a comprehensive lineup of plans and ESPN Unlimited just makes sense, especially when Hulu is charging around the same price as YouTube TV. Hulu has just a slightly less comprehensive lineup of channels compared to YouTube TV, but it still covers all the bases. You get the major channels, including big networks like Discovery, and a full roster of national news stations, including Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. The only place Hulu loses out is with secondary channels. Channels like Science, Hallmark Family, and MTV 2 are paid add-ons, even though the main channels on these networks are included with the base plan. My big gripe with Hulu is its frustrating interface. Even before introducing Live TV, Hulu had a rough app, and that hasn't changed. It's cluttered and clunky, and although there's still a guide with useful category sorting, the app still feels like it's fighting with itself. Further, the future of Live TV isn't clear. Still, the thing that makes Hulu Live TV so attractive hasn't changed. You get an awful lot for your money, combining go-to streaming apps between Hulu and Disney+, a solid channel lineup of live TV, and ESPN Unlimited to create a package that's hard for most services to contend with. What I love about YouTube TV is that it's easy. There's one plan that comes with a complete roster of channels for a reasonable price, and only a handful of add-ons that truly feel like add-ons (i.e., Spanish-speaking channels and movie channels). Along with broad national channel coverage, YouTube TV includes local channels in most areas. Even in Missouri, where I live, YouTube TV has all of my local channels, including ABC, Fox, NBC, and CBS. You'd be shocked at how few live TV streaming services include all of your local affiliates. It's lightning fast without even a hint of lag, and it's available everywhere, from smart TVs like those from Hisense, Samsung, Vizio, LG, and Roku, to streaming devices from Amazon and Apple, not to mention game consoles. Although YouTube TV has a comprehensive lineup of channels, apps, and features, it's also one of the most expensive live TV streaming services around, and there aren't any ways to save money with a smaller channel lineup. In addition, it doesn't include any extras like you get with Hulu Live TV. Still, it's clear why YouTube TV is such a popular option. It's easy, and if you can float the monthly price, you won't have to worry much about random channels falling through the cracks because of renewal deals or add-ons to pick up a single extra channel. I won't mince words: Sling TV is confusing. There are a handful of core plans, none of which encompass the scale of Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, or DirecTV, as well as about half a dozen add-ons to bring the channel roster up to par. This modular approach is annoying while shopping, though it also means you can save quite a bit of money by only picking up what you need. The Blue plan focuses on news and entertainment, while the Orange plan cuts news like MSNBC and CNN in favor of an array of ESPN channels. It's clear Sling wants folks to pick up the Orange & Blue plan that combines these channel lineups. It's about 30 percent cheaper getting them together than it is purchasing them separately (and about $30 cheaper than most other providers). Most of Sling's add-ons are $6 extra per month, minus the sports add-on, which is $15. The entertainment add-on includes Cartoon Network and MTV, for instance, while the movies add-on comes with Grit, TCM, and FXX. You can pick up all of the extras for $27 per month with Blue & Orange or $21 per month with other plans. Even with the full package, however, Sling comes in a few dollars below YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV, and there are opportunities to get your monthly price even lower by cutting some packages. For apps, Sling has just about everything you could want. Roku, Samsung, LG, Apple, and Google TV are all supported, as are boxes from Cox, Xfinity, and even TiVo Stream. You can create profiles, see upcoming games, and favorite channels in the guide so they're easy to find. It's only fitting that the only familiar satellite service on this list is the best cable replacement, and DirecTV lives up to its name—for better and worse. DirecTV includes most of the top 100 channels I looked at, along with major regional sports networks like FanDuel and NBC Sports. And just like the satellite plans of yore, DirecTV charges a pretty penny. Still, you get quite a bit for your money. It includes quite a few more channels than the cheaper Entertainment plan, including the NFL and MLB Networks, along with truTV, Pop, and Science. The more expensive Ultimate plan has more channels, but they're mainly secondary channels like Disney Junior and Nat Geo Wild. Notably, there aren't any apps for game consoles, which is a shame because DirecTV's app feels sluggish. It's great in the browser, but testing on my TCL QM8K TV, there was always a bit of a hang as I navigated through channels. I suspect this will only be exaggerated on less powerful devices, like a cheaper Roku Streaming Stick. I don't love the interface, but there are solid features. It's useful for seeing your favorite channels, but leaving a channel will return you to this home screen rather than the guide. Fubo makes a big deal about the number of channels it carries, and by the numbers, it has a ton of channels indeed. It's missing a lot of the important ones—TBS, Discovery, CNN, and Univision chief among them—but if you want both The Weather Channel and AccuWeather, Fubo has your back. Fubo may not have all the channels that Hulu Live TV or YouTube TV have, but it goes deep in one area: sports. FanDuel and NBC Sports take center stage, but Fubo also carries smaller regional networks, from MASN and MSG in the northeast to Space City in Houston. I wouldn't recommend anything less than Fubo TV Pro for most people, though, which carries the regional sports networks. If you jump up to the most expensive plan (Elite with Sports Plus), you also get access to NFL Red Zone, plus a free Apple TV 4K and 4K streaming. Red Zone and 4K upgrades are available elsewhere, but it's great to see both included as a package, especially for such a sports-focused service. Testing on a Google TV system, it felt responsive without much in the way of lag as I was flipping through the guide. It's not as clean as YouTube TV's interface, particularly with the sports emphasis, but an app that feels responsive is all I can really ask for. It's, by far, the cheapest option out of any of the live TV services I tested, with its only plan (Core) coming in at just $33 per month. You have a far smaller channel roster compared to the other services I tested, mainly due to the fact that Philo doesn't include any local affiliates like NBC or ABC, nor any regional sports networks. You might not care about local news or sports, though, and Philo is excellent if you fall in that camp. And to better support this entertainment and reality TV focus, it has the best DVR out of any service I tested. Unlimited cloud DVR comes standard with your plan, and Philo retains your recordings for a full year—just about every other service tops out at nine months. One of the draws of live TV streaming is that it doesn't require an antenna, instead leveraging your internet connection to deliver live television. However, a TV antenna can help fill in the gaps of cheaper live TV services like Sling or Fubo, particularly when it comes to local affiliates. Our favorite indoor TV antenna is the Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified, which you can pick up for about $50. It covers up to 60 miles, which should reach most local affiliates, assuming you live within an hour of a major city.

AMD confused the gaming community greatly after it announced it would put RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 driver support in "maintenance mode", but later corrected that the two architectures would still be receiving game optimizations regardless. Luckily, Phoronix has published an article reaffirming that Linux support has not changed with this announcement, primarily because Linux AMD drivers are developed separately from their Windows counterparts. Kernel driver support reportedly dates back all the way to AMD's GCN 1.2 architecture, which includes GPUs such as the R9 390X and R9 Fury X. Up until September this year, the AMDVLK driver was the official open-source Linux driver from AMD and was maintained by AMD directly. Community contributions are also implemented to help improve the driver's functionality. There is also the exclusively community-driven RADV driver that was started before AMD got into the Linux game with its own AMDVLK driver. Being exclusively community-driven, RADV is maintained completely independently of AMD and is currently the de facto GPU driver for all Radeon GPUs for Linux. RADV is a very robust and well-built driver solution that is supported by many of the industry's tech giants, including Valve, Google, and Red Hat. This is why, starting on September 15th, 2025, AMD has opted to discontinue the AMDVLK driver altogether. Performance on RADV also outshines AMDVLK in many situations. All of this is to say that Linux gamers can rest assured that any nasty driver support changes AMD makes on the Windows side won't immediately be copied on the Linux side. Even if AMD wanted to start cutting support on the Linux side, it can't anymore because it has discontinued its own official AMDVLK driver. (In other words, if AMD stops development for certain GPUs, another company or individual would inevitably take over.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sim immersion turned up to 11 with crazy DIY World of Tanks controller version 5. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Perhaps the crown prince of such extreme sim build-outs is Chinese enthusiast Blyat, best known among Tom's Hardware readers for his immersive World of Tanks gaming contraptions and, most recently, a (frankly dangerous) fighter jet rig. Today, Blyat released a video showcasing his wild Tank Simulator 5, which comes with a full-size replica machine gun and cannons, on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili. You can watch the full video on Bilibili, but, as we can't embed this Chinese social media format, we have also made a couple of GIF clips for your convenience. The Wargaming-published vehicular combat MMO features an incredible array of tanks, adept at various battlefield tasks. However, this video is all about fun, and doesn't go into the technical aspects of getting these crazy sim setups working. The frantic video begins with Bylat driving what might be dubbed a ‘Tactical vehicle' out of a garage, cannon blazing. It switches to the corresponding on-screen WoT action, where the anti-armor cannon can be seen peppering an enemy tank until it violently explodes. There's lots of overt humor in the WoT sim video, too. For example, at one stage we see Bylat's pants fall down due to the incessant recoil of the machine gun.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>X11's practical absence of any security mechanisms for user sessions means you should probably not run any kind of low-trust UI program anyway, as there is no prevention of keystroke injection or screen recording, but that's a design flaw that will never be solved. Any program you run on a computer (especially a Linux computer, which lacks modern OS security measures and has constant privesc kernel holes) exposes you to security flaws. There has yet to be any computer system designed that a hacker can't break out of. If you intentionally download and execute a program, you are rolling the dice, regardless of what the software is.What's insane about all these discussions is that NOBODY IS HACKING X SERVERS. But nobody is trying to hijack your X11 session. This imagined threat is a red herring designed to bolster the argument for Wayland's horrible designs. This imagined threat is a red herring designed to bolster the argument for Wayland's horrible designs. The main problem when I last checked a decade ag was that some important extensions such as composite would need to be exposed to untrusted clients. Who exactly should and can control the horde of OSS developers? And going to rabbit hole there are even proof of concept security implementation named Xnamespace for Xorg fork (needs polishing and much more patches but looks doable. The deal here is that the only way to fix X11's security issues is by breaking all those types of workflows and forcing application rewrites to implement them in authenticated ways.So if you are going have to go and break all that stuff, why not fix a crapload of other problems while you are at it?Calling Wayland "X13" may have avoided a lot of misunderstandings, but it probably would of caused others. So if you are going have to go and break all that stuff, why not fix a crapload of other problems while you are at it?Calling Wayland "X13" may have avoided a lot of misunderstandings, but it probably would of caused others. There are applications with good reason that need to chose their location themselves, and users who want that type of behavior, so it's definitively not just a security issue. How is this possibly the most charitable reading of parents comment, and honestly, do you think that's what they meant? You can't read that in some other way, where maybe parent wasn't actually asking about time traveling but something else? "Preventing" the vulnerability would indeed require going back to 1994.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Outer Worlds sequel does not play particularly well with ray tracing turned off, either. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. It's a new day, and another badly-optimized AAA Unreal Engine 5 game has hit store shelves. A couple of YouTubers, including Daniel Owen, have discovered serious performance problems in The Outer Worlds 2 that almost mirror Borderlands 4's atrocious launch day performance. One of the most problematic graphics settings is the game's ray tracing mode, which prevents even AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming champ from achieving 60 FPS at resolutions well under 1080p. The game struggled to hit 60 FPS on both 5600X-powered configurations. With the GTX 1070, the game was unable to run at even 30 FPS consistently in one of the game's city areas at low settings with FSR set to performance mode at 1080p (540p internal resolution). But regardless, it couldn't maintain a solid 60 FPS at the game's lowest quality settings. With these top-of-the-line components, the game ran above 60 FPS at 4k resolution with DLSS set to performance mode (1080p internal resolution) at the game's maximum settings (except for hardware ray tracing). Running the game at native 4k resolution with DLAA at maximum settings (with ray tracing still disabled) was only good enough for 45-50 FPS. At 1080p with DLSS performance mode (540p internal resolution), the RTX 5090 and 9800X3D could not achieve a solid 60 FPS. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Outer Worlds 2's performance on modern-day hardware is comically bad, even by Unreal Engine 5 standards. The developers seem to have taken a step from Borderlands 4's playbook, a game that also struggles to maintain 60FPS at its lowest graphical settings on modern mainstream PC hardware.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission. The best ones come from a few brands, and while new models have come out, the designs have usually focused on new frames and styles versus any real change in the technology or how to use the device. They're pretty simple: Upload your photos and enjoy them anytime on the digital screen. While Aura's newest frame still embodies that basic concept, the Aura Ink stands out as a fully portable digital photo frame. The portable design is made possible by an E Ink screen like you'd find on a digital notebook or a color e-reader, instead of the usual LCD screen. The photos end up stylized like a newspaper photo, rather than your classic bright-screen display. The result is a much more muted screen and representation of your photos, with all the benefits we already like about Aura's frames and app (including free and unlimited photo storage). This is a frame for your best (and absolute brightest—dim photos will only look darker) photos you'd want to look at all day, rather than fun photos from this weekend. The screen only uses six color pixels: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. To bring your photos to this type of screen, Aura designed an algorithm to convert photos into pixels of those six tones and still look like the original picture. The result is newspaper-like, with a design that devolves into a multitude of different colored squares if you look closely. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Brighter photos are much easier to enjoy on the Ink's screen. Darker photos, paired with the dimmer E Ink screen, were much harder to see. But a photo of my family at golden hour still showed the sky fading from blue to yellow and orange, for example, and the range of greens of the plants around us. My son's smiling face while wearing his astronaut costume was just as cute, with the various shades of his blond hair still nicely relayed. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Aura did build a gentle front light into the Aura Ink, similar to what you'd find on a Kindle device, but it's not nearly as bright as my Kindle when I crank the brightness all the way up. Compared side by side with my Kindle Colorsoft, which also has a color E Ink screen, the Aura Ink looks to get about half as bright. Instead of a touchbar at the top, there are three buttons on one side: One to flip forward through your photos, one to flip backward, and an “action” button that just shows the battery status with an LED light. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It does look much, much more realistic and photolike than any other photo frame out there, but the photos displayed on it still appear dim compared to a true printed picture, let alone another digital screen. The screen doesn't look different just for fun. It's what makes the Aura Ink fully wireless. While the rest of Aura's lineup needs to be plugged in at all times, as does just about every other digital photo frame on the market, the Aura Ink promises a battery life of about three months on a single charge. Devices like e-readers see similar benefits with this type of screen. The Kindle Colorsoft lasts about eight weeks on a single charge, while the larger Kindle Scribe (2nd Gen) has a similar three-month battery life. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. That battery life can vary based on how often the photo changes, which is what takes up most of the Ink's power. If you've ever used an e-paper device like a digital notebook or e-reader, the experience of the flashing screen as it loads the next image will look familiar, but the Aura Ink amps it up with a much longer set of flashes as it runs the next photo through its algorithm to become a six-pixel print. That transition between photos takes less than 30 seconds. Aura defaults to this happening once overnight to both preserve the battery and your eyes during the intense transition phase. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Now, with the Aura Ink's truly cordless design, it's possible to hang it without any cord clutter. The Ink comes with a little mounting kit of two nails and a small hook that the digital frame clicks into, and it can easily click back off for charging (the charging port is on the side if your hanging spot is near an outlet). I was able to hang it on one of my existing pushpins without issue, and the frame easily blended into my existing gallery wall. I'd like to see the front light get a little brighter. It's considerably more expensive than other digital photo frames, too. But as I look at it on my gallery wall, I have to say that if you didn't already know it was digital, you'd likely have no idea.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an interview alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that the problem in the AI industry is not an excess supply of compute, but rather a lack of power to accommodate all those GPUs. He said this on YouTube in response to Brad Gerstner, the host of Bg2 Pod, when asked whether Nadella and Altman agreed with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who said there is no chance of a compute glut in the next two to three years. “I think the cycles of demand and supply in this particular case, you can't really predict, right? “So, if you can't do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in. Nadella's mention of 'shells' refers to a data center shell, which is effectively an empty building with all of the necessary ingredients, such as power and water, needed to immediately begin production. AI's power consumption has been a topic many experts have discussed since last year. This came to the forefront as soon as Nvidia fixed the GPU shortage, and many tech companies are now investing in research in small modular nuclear reactors to help scale their power sources as they build increasingly large data centers. This has already caused consumer energy bills to skyrocket, showing how the AI infrastructure being built out is negatively affecting the average American. OpenAI has even called on the federal government to build 100 gigawatts of power generation annually, saying that it's a strategic asset in the U.S.'s push for supremacy in its AI race with China. This highlights another risk that companies must bear as they bet billions of dollars on massive AI data centers. While you would still need the infrastructure to train new models, the data center demand that many estimate will come from the widespread use of AI might not materialize if semiconductor advancements enable us to run them locally.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There's no denying that an Austin tech scene, which has been simmering for decades, has reached a boiling point in the past few years. The scrappy “Keep Austin Weird” era is on the wane, but there's still plenty that feels authentic and lovable in this once-sleepy college town that was content with doing its own thing in the shadows of nearby metropolises like Dallas and Houston. Whether you prefer a quick drive to the office park or a quick walk to your new “coffice” for the day, our picks have you covered. It's far enough from the commotion of both downtown and campus to feel calm, yet just a stone's throw from both. The rooftop pool is clutch for winding down with a Lone Star after a long day of meetings, which can be conveniently hosted onsite at one of the six event spaces, and Acre 41 is the kind of multiuse restaurant that's great for checking emails over coffee in the morning and brokering big deals over a Texas ribeye at night. Austin is growing upward at an unprecedented clip, but until it starts putting up New York–style pencil skyscrapers, the Omni Hotel stands out as one of the most iconic pieces of its skyline. This glistening 20-story marvel is just a few blocks from the core of Austin's entertainment district on West 6th Street, though you wouldn't be faulted for hardly leaving the property if a bar crawl on “Dirty 6th” isn't your thing. Many maverick tech workers are in the sole proprietor/bootstraps phase of their career, which means cutting costs while still feeling luxe (or at least presenting as such) is important. East Austin Hotel offers traditional rooms for a slight upgrade, or you can save some serious cash by booking a “cabin” room with a suite of shared private bathrooms in the middle of the floor. Rainey Street ain't what it used to be, but this charming enclave of bungalows turned bars still packs more character into a tiny city block than most midsize cities can muster in their entire downtown footprint. It's a solid all-purpose pick for moderate luxury in the middle of one of Austin's most charming and memorable downtown-adjacent neighborhoods. Lone Star Court is fashioned in the likeness of a hill country lodge, with a pair of conjoined courtyards that center around a teal oval-shaped pool with its own bar and lounge. Whether you're looking for a quiet desk for the day or a parachute into a bustling tech-y social scene, the variety of coworking options available in Austin is staggering and has something for everyone. Before you walk in off the street, we strongly suggest checking their website for availability and pricing, and while you're surfing the web, you might as well check out Austin Coworking and Deskpass, as they're excellent resources for updates on events, newcomers to the scene, and deals on participating offices. Day passes start at $35 for quick drop-ins, and monthly memberships offer access to almost all Bond Collective locations in the US—with many locations in New York, Philly, and the DC area—along with 24/7 access and ad hoc conference rooms if needed. This startup social hall functions more so as an IRL hub for meetups and events for the entrepreneur set, but it also offers quite a few open coworking events throughout the week if you prefer a more lively and interactive environment while you tap away at your laptop. You might meet your next full-stack developer here, or (more realistically) you might swill some beers and play pop-a-shot with some dudes who ditched California for the booming startup scene the Texas capital has been riding high on for several years now. Local favorites like Odd Duck, Tiki Tatsu-Ya, and an Alamo Drafthouse outpost are within a short walk, and the space shares walls with a location of the boozy brunch chain Snooze if mimosas and chilaquiles are in order. It's also chock-full of multiuse all-day drinking spots where the hours melt away and your taste for a cortado in the morning and a cafe de cachapa in the afternoon is joyously accommodated. Coffee (and coffee cocktails, no judgment) start flowing at 7 am daily, and the Shortwave Diner truck parked outside slings a variety of diner staples like smash burgers, hot dogs, and breakfast sandwiches throughout most of Radio Rosewood's generous hours of operation. Figure 8 is one of the most popular purveyors for cafés that don't roast their own beans, which makes it easy to find just about anywhere, but the opportunity to try its outstanding espresso and drip coffee right at the source is one you must enjoy if possible. This low-slung rectangle of a building sits on the edge of a quiet residential area, but the inside is always buzzing gently with activity and caffeination. With a decade-plus of explosive growth in their rear view, it's fair to say Houndstooth is akin to third-wave roasters like Stumptown, Blue Bottle, and Intelligentsia, all of which are synonymous with their respective cities. Their downtown location lives in the lobby of an office tower right smack in the middle of Austin's business district, which makes it a great place to sip a cortado between meetings or escape the grind of the workday with a cold brew and a croissant. Nature is healing, and one of Austin's most beloved all-night hangs has finally resumed its 24/7 schedule. As its name denotes, The Buzz Mill is a lumber mill–themed coffee bar that's great for late-night study sessions, marathon coding sprints, work drinks with the crew, or a mellow place to sip on a drink or two while you wait for whatever it is you were doing all day to flush out of your system. This South Lamar bistro casts a wide net in terms of influence, with contemporary riffs on Texan comfort classics serving as the backbone of the dozen-or-so items that populate its menu. Look no further than the climax of their current dinner offerings—a wagyu strip steak that's plated with tater tots and masa queso—for a cheeky tell of what to expect from their delightfully low-brow iterations on high-minded chefiness. On the other hand, Austin is also a hot spot for well-heeled progressives, which means the vegetarian and vegan food is on point if you know where to look. Bouldin Creek Cafe is a funky and colorful mainstay for eco-friendly fare that's elegant enough for a dinner date yet also crunchy enough to please a table of hungover hippies who went a bit too hard at the day rave that dragged on until 4 in the morning. Its kitchen serves up decadence until midnight on weekends, offering the pre- or post-party set decadent burgers, frites, seafood dishes, and a few stunning salad options that pair wonderfully with an expansive list of cocktails, aperitifs, and wines from all over the price spectrum. For 50 years this North Austin cochina has gifted Texans with upscale Mexican cuisine that joyfully transcends what your average taqueria-goer imagines when food from south of the border comes to mind. Here you'll find stunning platters of wagyu tacos, tangy ceviches, and decadent mole that converge in a way that suggests what might happen when Mexico City answers the question of what a brasserie might look like in a hyper-modern American metropolis. Founded by Joe Avila in 1962, this humble East Austin diner infuses hearty brunch fare with stately Mexican tradition. The proper move here is a breakfast plate that typically includes eggs, beans, potatoes, tortillas, and your choice of protein. Smaller appetites are accommodated by a full lineup of tacos, including a handful of breakfast tacos alongside more traditional two-biters like barbacoa, chicharrone, and migas. Anointing one barbecue spot out of the hundreds in the area as “the best” is a fool's errand, so a quick-and-dirty list of knockouts that suit a variety of needs is more appropriate. Know that most have a line well before they open, brisket sells out quickly, and very few are open more than three or four days a week. Terry Black's is an exception to all of these rules, with generous hours, a massive seating area, and an industrious pit that makes it easy to score award-winning brisket for the entire crew at 7 pm on a Monday. La Barbecue is a consensus favorite among chefs and influencers, earning high marks for its outstanding sausage and brisket, along with its approachability—online ordering is clutch when you don't have the time or patience for the line. KG BBQ has the most unique story on this list, with a charismatic Egyptian pitmaster who adds a Middle Eastern spin to familiar Texas staples in the form of sumac rice bowls topped with brisket, barbecue lamb pitas, and cardamom and pistachio rice pudding for dessert. Similar to barbecue, there is no best breakfast taco spot in Austin. Most locals choose based on proximity and reliability, while natural selection weeds out the bad ones in short order. That said, the handful of locations in the Veracruz All Natural empire offer something for everyone all over town, and most of them are situated in a truck park that usually has coffee, pastries, and other local goodies on offer courtesy of the other vendors. Vaquero Taquero is a solid pick for folks situated near UT or downtown, and the Bouldin Creek location of El Tacorrido slings breakfast tacos (and other styles) out of a walk-up/drive-thru window every day from 7am to midnight. This cheeky East Austin post-dive ingests the memories of every Midwestern transplant's favorite windowless dump and polishes them up real nice like, in a convivial nod to the great American institution that is the neighborhood watering hole. Ice cold lager and top-tier boozy slushies wash down satisfying pub grub courtesy of the Delray Cafe truck outside, which slings smash burgers, Detroit-style coneys, and all manner of fried fare until the wee hours of the evening. Its light and airy aesthetic, plus its massive outdoor footprint, make this Old West Austin bar/café hybrid an inviting hub for productivity, lounging our outright shenanigans if the mood strikes. While Austin has seen no shortage of IPA factories come to fruition in the past decade, it's fitting that its most significant opening rolled into town by way of the OP beer scene in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 2019 by a pair of Breakside veterans, the expansive, quasi-suburban footprint of Meanwhile brewing manages to be peak Austin in its amenities, with an massive outdoor space that boasts a stage, picnic tables galore, a kids play area, and a fleet of food trucks that puts many stand-alone truck parks to shame. Unlike many new school lager factories, St. Elmo commands a diverse range of styles that err on the crispy side but still check a variety of unique boxes. The aforementioned Kolsch, simply named Carl, is the obvious pick for your first pint, but your second could be anything from a Mexican Lager to a Dubai chocolate–inspired pastry stout. Kitsch is balanced carefully with playfulness and refinement, yielding a fanciful experience that's punctuated by stiff drinks that aren't for the faint of heart. There are few better places to take a small group of friends who are in dire need of a boozy kick in the pants courtesy of a cocktail menu that balances tradition and innovation, with classics like Painkillers and Jungle Birds dancing alongside new-school shareables like the Daruma or the Aku Aku. These days it feels like everyone's favorite neighborhood dive is on the verge of ruin, but the Yellow Jacket soldiers on as one of the last grungy gathering places in Austin where chain smoking and kvetching about condos is not only accepted but encouraged. The local-centric scene here is cordial enough to tolerate tourists and newcomers, provided you mind your manners by being chill and not ordering espresso martinis from the bar. No trip to Texas is complete without a night of drunken line dancing, and The White Horse is the preeminent spot for just that. Its proximity to the hipster scene of East 6th means the rough edges that accentuate more suburban line dancing joints are sanded down ever so slightly, making it an approachable option for normies to kick up their boots with minimal jeering from dudes who have two first names and a well-stocked gun rack in the back window of their F-350. The vibrant back patio provides an unbeatable vantage point of a typical night out in Austin, complete with carousing youngsters, aging indie hipsters, honky tonk bros, and just about everything in between. This rawkus downtown venue has been rumored to be on the brink of extinction for years, so it's a better time than any to assemble your crew and cut a rug at one of the preeminent LGBTQ-ish clubs before the slow, violent churn of gentrification claims yet another real one. Only in Austin does one of the preeminent midsize outdoor music venues double as a legendary barbecue joint that has its own sauce you've probably seen at your local Kroger or Target. These days the barbecue at Stubb's is a serviceable afterthought to the heavyweight touring acts that grace its stage on a weekly basis, and it's a serious hub of SXSW activity when the music industry's favorite trade show turns the entire city into an ad hoc indie rock boomtown for a week every March. Though this legendary indie club opened a few years after the term “emo-core” was coined, its status as a must-play venue during the salad days of the burgeoning punk offshoot was cemented long before emo was we know it became a mainstream genre. It's the platonic ideal of a mid-size venue with excellent sight lines, efficient bar service, and a penchant for booking bands that are often too big for the space by the time their gig comes around. It took a few trips for him to figure out that they're food trucks (not carts, as in his former home of Portland) and that you probably should not trust any barbecue spot with no line and a pile of brisket left around dinnertime. He's deeply concerned about the condo plague that's stricken the beloved East 6th corridor, and he would rather rub elbows with weird uncles from Iowa and Oklahoma in the hours-long Franklin Barbecue queue than get within 20 feet of the Comedy Mothership, or anywhere on “Dirty 6th,” for that matter.

The $379 frames are Meta's entry-level smart glasses, and a direct successor to the original that became a smash hit. They are $80 more expensive than their predecessor, but what you get in return is a better 12-MP camera capable of capturing photos and videos at up to 3K resolution. There are also options for recording up to 60 frames per second and shooting videos in slow motion. Battery life also gets a big bump, extending to 8 hours of various use, but more like 5 or 6 with constant use or less if you're recording high-def video the whole time. They don't have quite the GoPro-esque camera capabilities of the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguards, which my colleague Adrienne So liked a lot. (We have not been able to review the Display glasses yet because Meta said it prioritized sending review units to “creators,” i.e., influencers.) I have been using the Gen 2 smart glasses for about a month. Meta handed them out for free to the journalists and influencers at its Connect developer event in Palo Alto in September, and I've been wearing them since then. These feel a lot like the previous pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses I've used. They weigh about the same, offer many of the same visual styles, though there are a few new colors to choose from. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Music playback on the frame's speakers sounds fine, but I still prefer wireless earbuds for something I actually want to listen to. Podcasts and phone calls sound great, though—voices seem to shine on the glasses. This is probably a skill issue, since I don't have prescription lenses and normally just wear sunglasses. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. It's a petty peeve, but I much prefer polarized lenses, which Meta doesn't offer. At least you can get them with Transitions lenses, which is what I tested. Those do a good job of reacting to the light, but I find they don't ever feel quite dark enough to keep me from squinting on a sunny day. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. As I wore them on one of my walks through San Francisco, on the shore of Ocean Beach, I came upon a dolphin-like fish that had washed up on the sand. Though I got my camera glasses close enough to the thing that I could smell it, Meta's AI assistant could not tell me what kind of animal it was. Beyond instances like that, I tend to avoid the AI voice interaction because I haven't gotten to the point where it feels natural. Getting it to search something is usually very quick, but doing so requires you to stop dead in your tracks, stare directly at another person's purse or something, and say out loud, “Hey Meta. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The glasses' AI features are both its best asset and biggest weakness. Features like live language translation and whispered map directions are very helpful. But if you've spent any time curating the AI slop out of your Facebook feed lately, you'll know that Meta just can't help pack a firehouse blast of AI features into everything it does. There's a very clear problem with using the app: bad vibes. When you go into the Meta AI app to look at the pictures or videos you've taken, the first thing you'll see is Meta's terrible new Vibes service; a constant barrage of AI slop videos that Meta just one day foisted upon its app users. Vibes is akin to OpenAI's dubious Sora app, but somehow even worse quality. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. If I'm lucky, it's a bunch of uncanny AI cats riding motorcycles or dancing to hip hop beats. If I'm unlucky (usually the case), it's a bunch of cringey political videos, like AI Obama getting arrested by ICE or one where an AI President Trump lookalike leans over a visibly pregnant Statue of Liberty who also seems to be giving birth to an egg. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Vibes is a service I wish I could opt out of by launching it straight into the sun, but unfortunately, it has become an inescapable part of my Meta Ray-Ban software experience. The thing all of Meta's glasses do really well is remind you that you're wearing a device made by Meta, a company that has a long history of playing hot potato with user data and a leader who has displayed increasingly craven capitulation to power. The glasses are great, but I find myself feeling hesitant to wear them around in public. To be fair, that might just be aesthetics, as I've been told by almost all my friends that my face doesn't take to square glasses well. (“You just look wrong,” one told me while I wore the glasses in a restaurant.) Fashion aside, these devices are in a fraught place. Privacy rights and the absolute explosion of surveillance tech are much harder to ignore these days. Especially as people buy mod kits to disable the indicator light on the Meta glasses that let people see when the Meta glasses are recording, or use their glasses to record themselves harassing workers in massage parlors. I'm not saying these are glasses for creeps, but I can't help but feel like one while wearing them. All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Cold plunging at the gym or having a chilly shower at home has become a popular practice in recent years. But is all the self-inflicted freezing really that good for you? With the promise of boosting your mood, providing mental clarity, and reducing muscle soreness post-workout, it may sound enticing, but it's not for everyone. With my adrenaline pumping and my endorphins having a disco post-plunge, I was hooked and have since became an ice bath advocate. Keen to find out more, I asked Gary Brecka, top biohacker and founder of The Ultimate Human, for advice on how to cold plunge for maximum benefit. Whether it's in the sea, a lake, or an ice bath at your local gym or at home, cold plunging means immersing your body in water that is 39 to 59 defrees Fahrenheit (4 to 15 Celsius). If you don't have a gym membership and don't fancy stripping down to your bathing suit at the local lake, an indoor bathtub filled with icy cold water will do. “You don't need an expensive set up,” says Brecka. Brecka suggests two to six minutes as the ideal time. If you're new to cold plunging, however, under a minute is plenty. “What are the benefits of cold plunging?” is the million dollar question you're probably asking yourself, right as you're staring into the tub (along with “Why don't you just have a warm cookie and hot chocolate instead?” which is what I often hear my inner child say.) “We do a plunge because cold exposure activates your nervous system, improves circulation, and helps your body adapt to stress,” he says. Some studies show benefits for cold plunging, including from Harvard Medical School. “Exposure to cold water boosts levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that increases your energy level and makes you feel more alert,” says Brecka. “You can also get a big, measurable spike in dopamine release. This is the neurotransmitter that's linked with feeling pleasure and motivation. That's why I call cold plunging my ‘drug of choice.' It also activates cold shock proteins, which help protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Cold exposure constricts blood vessels, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and helps the body recover faster.” While it can be beneficial for both men and women, evidence is limited. While cold plunging has a lot of instant positive effects, it's not safe for everyone. “You're not a polar bear,” points out the American Heart Association. “The main risk is pushing past your body's limits. I would recommend keeping it under five minutes, especially to start. People with heart conditions should consult a doctor.” Cold plunging needn't be a public affair to broadcast on your socials. If you're keen to give it a try but are worried about the freezing temperatures, you can start with a cold shower. “Get comfortable with 30 to 60 seconds at the end of your shower,” says Brecka. Cold showers trigger some of the same effects. But full immersion in cold water is more powerful as it hits more surface area and drops your core temperature faster.
