HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. It's not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn't too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74. Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes. With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring. “The impact, even if it's temporary, on many of the nation's poor families is going to be profound if we don't solve this problem,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes. “These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can't point to a similar time in recent history where we've had this.” LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. Josh Shapiro's administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. Minnesota's energy assistance program is processing applications but the state's Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. “As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. “The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states' program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available. “Once you've fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said. Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections. Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. “If you're a heating oil dealer, we can't tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you'll get your money back,'” Wolfe said. Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter. “I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House, on April 2, 2025, in Washington. The Supreme Court building is seen, June 27, 2024, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump sees tariffs — or the threat of them — as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will. He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on. Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history. He has said it would be a “disaster” for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place. “The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.” “We do have backup plans,” Leavitt said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But ultimately…we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what's right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council. There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates. Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario. In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. “On the other hand, you would say there's probably some backlash.” Trump's tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America's friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up. Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices. “There's literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,” said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations, “The use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like — just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,” said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank. But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a “decent chance” the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president “broad, flexible emergency powers.” The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump's wide-ranging use of executive powers. If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities. “It certainly doesn't take tariffs off the table,” she said.

A new video advertisement from pro-Israel group Canary Mission is calling out the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) for scheming to take over the Democratic Party from within. After an antisemitism watchdog posted a new video warning about socialist efforts to take over the Democratic Party from within, socialist leaders from across the country embraced the video and its message, appearing unafraid of such accusations. The Canary Mission's advertisement included recorded remarks from various leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) describing their opposition to, and in some cases "hatred" of the Democratic Party, which one speaker says must be torn down. Members of the Democratic Socialists of America rally at a May Day march in New York City in 2019. It lays its egg in another bird's nest. But the analogy, which pointed to candidates like self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani, did not appear to bother the socialists it was targeting. Rather, they applauded the video advertisement as a great recruitment tool to get more people to join their ranks. "New DSA recruitment ad for communists just dropped," joked Nicolás Vargas in response to the video. Vargas has been affiliated with the Central Brooklyn branch of the DSA, according to a 2022 DSA national convention resolution on COVID protections. "Are you trying to make young people find the DSA more cool?" "New recruitment ad unlocked," joked Giovanetta Marangoz, co-chair of the New York City Young Democratic Socialists of America. Other socialist activists were a little more direct in their view that the Democratic Party must be extinguished. "DSA is loud and proud: we are fighting for a worker's party. The Democratic Party is a tool we use for local elections, but it remains an enemy of the working class." Part of Canary Mission's video focused on New York City's Mamdani, who is running for New York City mayor on the Democratic Party's ticket. He beat out former New York Gov. Mamdani, who is a member of DSA's NYC chapter, brought several DSA members on stage during a "New York Is Not For Sale" rally last week. He was also a keynote speaker at the group's national convention in 2023 while serving as a New York state representative. Members of the Democratic Socialists of America were brought on stage during a recent rally for New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The event was titled, "New York Is Not For Sale." "With Zohran, we're in basically the best possible position to seize state power that we can be in because, you know, we're like this," Goulden said during an August DSA panel, indicating with his fingers that the campaign and organization are very close. Goulden went on to suggest that "one of the things that made Zohran really successful with his policy rollouts is specifically relying on DSA." The team was so happy to work with us on this," he explained. "What we explicitly wanted to do was use the power of New York City to provide free gender-affirming care – and I say free in case insurance companies decide to boot us off – free gender-affirming care, not just to people in New York City, but across the country." New York City Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, spoke to supporters at a canvass launch event in Prospect Park on Aug. 17, 2025. In addition to the responses to Canary Mission's new video, other messaging materials the pro-Israel group has put out, such as a graphic slamming socialists for attempting to "weaken and ultimately dismantle" the United States, have similarly been met with praise by DSA socialists. For example, in response to a Canary Mission graphic exposing DSA's Red Star Caucus for their stated goal of striving to "weaken and ultimately dismantle US empire," a user on X, who describes themselves as "DSA's favorite Maoist," remarked that the slogan Canary Mission was calling out "needs to be the line of the DSA as a whole." "I will use every tool at my disposal to make it so," they added. "That's right," another X user with the handle "centristmarxist" said in response to a second graphic slamming DSA's Marxist Unity Group for their stated goal. "With every tool available to us, we must erode the political, cultural, and physical hegemony of the U.S. police state." Fox News Digital reached out to the DSA for comment, but did not receive a response. Fox News Digital's Peter Pinedo contributed to this report.

New York Post columnist Douglas Murray assesses the state of Britain's government, economy and society on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.' U.K. police offered new details about victims and suspects following Saturday night's stabbing spree aboard a train in Huntigdon, Cambridgeshire. Multiple patients remain in life-threatening condition after the stabbing, which left at least 11 people wounded. Police say the suspects were "born in the U.K.," and remain in custody as of Sunday morning. "This is a shocking incident and my thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families," British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said in a statement. They were both arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, he said. Police Superintendent John Loveless addresses the media after a mass stabbing on a London-bound train in Huntingdon, England, Sunday, Nov. 2, 2025. Loveless added that nine people were reported initially to have life-threatening injuries, but most have since recovered. "Following assessment and treatment, four have been discharged and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition," Loveless said. "We declared a major incident yesterday and Counter Terrorism Policing were initially supporting our investigation, however, at this stage there is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident. This is a British Transport Police investigation. We continue work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident. At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident," he added. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his sympathy regarding the stabbing on X. "The appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning," he wrote. "My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Police work at the Huntingdon train station in Cambridgeshire, after people were stabbed, Saturday, Nov. 1, 2025. "The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Huntingdon Town FC tonight are with the victims and their families from this evening's local incident," the club wrote on X around 11 p.m. local time Saturday. "We send our thanks and thoughts to colleagues in the police, ambulance and other agencies supporting this that are also affected."

Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin tells Fox News Digital that the possibility of far left and moderates winning big on Election Day shows "the great breadth of our party." While plenty of Democrats are fearful of the political consequences and how it would fuel Republican efforts to make a Mayor Mamdani the face of a Democratic Party aiming to usher in socialism, Ken Martin isn't concerned. "What it shows is the great breadth of our party," the chair of the Democratic National Committee said in a one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital this week in Philadelphia as he crisscrossed the 2025 campaign trail. Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on stage during a "New York is Not For Sale" rally at Forest Hills Stadium, in New York City on Oct. 26, 2025. A likely Mamdani win in New York City, where he holds a double-digit lead in the polls, may be coupled with potential victories by moderate Democrats Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia in the only two states this year to hold gubernatorial elections. And I've always said that you win elections through addition, not subtraction. Martin acknowledged that Democrats "don't agree on everything. There's a lot of different ideas on how to accomplish our goals, but we're unified around those goals. As Democrats work to escape the political wilderness after last year's stunning election setbacks, when the party lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, Republicans portray their rivals as a leaderless party being held hostage by the far left. But Martin spotlighted his party's diversity, saying, "Whether you're a far-left Democrat or a conservative Democrat, or anything in between, everyone's welcome into this big tent party of ours." Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin addresses party members at the DNC's summer meeting on Aug. 25, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. "Ken Martin's so-called ‘big tent' Party includes communists, antisemites, and illegal aliens, while apparently the only people who aren't welcome are hardworking American families. The inmates are now running the asylum in the Democrat Party, which is why the DNC is broke and proudly backing a communist for mayor of New York City," RNC national press secretary Kiersten Pels claimed in a statement to Fox News Digital. Martin, pointing to the Republican Party, argued that they "basically have one ideology and do not allow for any dissent." Martin was interviewed a few days after a new center-left group named "Welcome," in their inaugural report, argued that left-leaning ideas and rhetoric have badly weakened the Democratic Party. And the group urged Democrats to jettison some of the party's progressive language about race and LGBTQ issues. The news was first reported by Semafor. Asked for his take, Martin said he had yet to read the report, but he did emphasize that "the Democratic Party can walk and chew gum at the same time." "We can both focus on a core economic message that gives people in this country a sense that we're going to fight for their economic future, that they'll have an opportunity to get ahead... and also, at the same time, stand up and fight for our values. Make sure that no one gets left behind. Make sure that... people who are being harassed or bullied or pushed out of the conversation are protected."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Britain was shocked by a mass stabbing attack on a train Saturday evening, targeting passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London in an incident Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described as “deeply concerning.” Nine people were left with life-threatening injuries, two of whom were still fighting for their lives in hospital on Sunday, as the British Transport Police declared a “major incident.” Two suspected attackers were detained within minutes of police receiving their first emergency call, as the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon station. Authorities have now confirmed they are two British-born males in their 30s. The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6.25 p.m. local time on Saturday evening, bound for London. Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm. After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.” People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train's toilets, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood. Police received their first emergency call at approximately 7.42 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralise any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down'… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News. 10 people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening. As of Sunday morning, two people remained fighting for their lives, British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters. Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages. Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding. One is a 32-year-old, Black British national, while the other is a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, according to Superintendent Loveless. They remained in separate police stations for questioning on Sunday morning. Police are still working to establish a motive, but say there is no indication it was terror-related. British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview. BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding it. The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations. Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics. Some 51,527 knife crime offences were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.” In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.” It connects major cities, running from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EDITOR'S NOTE:  This account of the allegations against Los Angeles hotelier Steve Farzam is based on official statements, court documents, investigation reports, interviews with law enforcement officials and people who encountered him over the years, his social media posts and other reporting from CNN. At an extravagant reception, hotelier Steve Farzam seemed to literally plunge into marriage, appearing to dive from a helicopter in a rainbow parachute onto the grounds of a luxury hotel north of Beverly Hills. It was staged: A stuntman jumped from the helicopter and landed near the crowd amid a downpour of rose pedals. He was surrounded by a ground crew that included Farzam, who slipped out of a bodysuit and switched places with the stuntman. “It was like a magician,” said Wind, who produced the movie-like wedding video. People with money, they really want to impress their guests.” He's a state certified and licensed paramedic with an associate degree in emergency medical technology; a self-proclaimed do-gooder whose penchant for protecting and serving has occasionally run afoul of the law. Though often appearing stylish and refined, with an air of unshakable confidence, like a real-life James Bond, Farzam seemed to come undone in recent years. He was chief operating officer of an eco-friendly boutique hotel owned and operated by his family across from the storied Santa Monica pier. On his websites and social media posts, he has portrayed himself for years as a beneficent giver, a man of action: boasting about his paramedic experience, medical helicopter missions in Arizona and volunteer work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. On social media he praised emergency medical crews and US Border Patrol officers; posted a photo of President Donald Trump in a MAGA cap with the message, “God bless America and our brave patriots who keep us safe;” and urged people to support the tough-on-crime policies of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, whose office is now trying to put him behind bars. In a blue paramedic uniform, Farzam appeared on “The Tyra Banks Show,” which usually featured chats with Hollywood stars and presidential hopefuls. Farzam offered tips about home survival kits and accident safety, according to a YouTube video. He smiled during his introduction, seeming to revel in applause. “I have learned over the years that people work for money but they die for admiration and respect,” Farzam, in 2017, told VoyageLA, a digital publication that claims to highlight “LA's most inspiring stories.” He now stands accused of perpetrating a more than 25-year con that spiraled into a cinematic tale of intrigue, with potentially dire consequences: If convicted, Farzam faces up to 23 years and 10 months in prison. An FBI and Homeland Security agent, a firefighter, arson investigator and police officer, Farzam has been them all over the years – well, he's appeared to wear each of those hats. In 2011, Beverly Hills police reported catching Farzam and a woman, dressed as security personnel, trying to sneak into the Golden Globe Awards. He told officers they had worked security the previous night and returned to “see all the movie stars,” according to an investigation report. He even created a fictitious fire company, according to prosecutors – an accusation his lawyer has pushed back on. He's no public servant but a great pretender, a serial law enforcement and first responder wannabe, according to court records, official statements and interviews with people who have encountered him over the years. His misconduct, from posing as an arson investigator during the worst wildfires in Los Angeles history to aiming lasers at the cockpits of commercial and law enforcement aircraft, repeatedly put lives at risk, according to prosecutors. “This is a continuous con to pretend to be a first responder for benefits,” Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Ayvazian, who is prosecuting the case, said at a preliminary hearing last month. The reason why we're here is because he put himself out in the community, and he represented himself as a firefighter. He represented himself as a law enforcement officer,” the prosecutor said. “If you look at the entire context of what we've presented in this case … it's a very troubling pattern,” he said of Farzam's behavior. CNN has sought comment from Farzam's wife and two brothers. One of his attorneys, Alan Jackson, declined to comment on the record. Jackson, at the preliminary hearing, argued prosecutors failed to produce evidence to support the charges, particularly “zero” proof the targeted aircraft “were flashed by a laser.” About Farzam's presence at a restricted zone during the Palisades Fire, Jackson insisted his client was “there to help.” “Not one shred of evidence suggests that my client tried to benefit monetarily or benefit in any other way, at the detriment of the community or the government, to falsify his identity as a fireman. He's not charged with any violent crime whatsoever,” Jackson said. In a motion in support of no bail filed one day before the enigmatic hotelier's mid-July arrest, Ayvazian wrote Farzam “has a long and persistent history involving the impersonation of law enforcement and emergency personnel, fraudulent access to government systems, and unlawful firearm possession.” Farzam was 21 at the time of his earliest known criminal involvement, in 1999, when he was arrested for impersonating a police officer and committing perjury, according to prosecutors. The charges were dismissed under a plea agreement, court documents show. He pleaded guilty to providing false information on Department of Motor Vehicles documents and giving unlawful registration. After his release, he was placed on house arrest at an in-patient mental health facility and ordered to wear an ankle monitor. He's not permitted to possess firearms, explosive devices, pyrotechnics, lasers or flashlights. Farzam also was ordered not to contact witnesses in the case. “Where does he stop?” asked James Hirt, a retired special agent supervisor for the California Department of Justice, who investigated Farzam in a major 2014 case involving 60 felony counts. He pleaded guilty to three felonies in that case and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years of probation. Eventually the convictions were reduced to misdemeanors and expunged. “I'm sure all we've ever done is scratch the surface of his nonsense. A thick blanket of smoke and ash rolled over the southern California horizon that mid-January day during the deadly Palisades Fire. In a white Ford Expedition with exempt plates and red emergency lights, Farzam stopped at a checkpoint manned by the National Guard on January 17 and presented a document showing the vehicle was registered to the fictitious Santa Muerte Fire Department, prosecutors said. After showing his driver's license, the soldiers allowed him in the restricted zone, according to the no bail motion, which didn't indicate what he did or how long he was there. “God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy,” Farzam wrote on X the next day, with video of crackling, wind-swept flames swallowing up a luxury home. God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy. We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes. “We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes.” He was allowed to remain in the restricted zone. On March 25, prosecutors said, Farzam was seen on LAPD surveillance footage driving to a National Guard checkpoint at Sunset Boulevard and Amalfi Drive. Santa Muerte is a Mexican folk religion that mixes traditional aspects of Catholicism and ancient Aztec beliefs. The patron saint of death is venerated as a spiritual benefactor of a growing number of marginalized Mexicans and Central Americans who claim they feel unprotected by the state and cast aside by the Catholic Church. While lighting candles of various colors is part of its veneration, Saint Death has nothing to do with fires or extinguishing them. Farzam's nonexistent fire department is listed online and in state records as being on North Imperial Avenue in El Centro, a sweltering desert community about 120 miles east of San Diego. The creation of the fake agency is “central” to Farzam's scheme, according to prosecutors, who said he “assumed false authority as a high-ranking fire official.” The fabricated role, they say, was exploited to “obtain government-issued exempt license plates, gain unlawful access to restricted emergency zones” and acquire new firearms reserved for peace officers. The 164-room glass-and-steel, beachfront Shore Hotel – which the Farzam family opened in 2011 – served, according to prosecutors, as “base of operations for several fraudulent activities, including IP addresses linked to false submissions and vehicle registration.” Farzam's brother Jon, CEO of Shore Hotel, and the hotel's public relations firm have not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The volunteer fire department was registered as a nonprofit in California in July 2022, according to state records, which show a representative of the Shore Hotel, with its Santa Monica address, as its registered agent. Farzam's attorney Jackson argued the Santa Muerte Fire Department is a nonprofit legitimately registered with the state and said prosecutors have not established “it was a false firefighter department, and it was just literally made up.” Ayvazian, the prosecutor, told the court: “We would have to assume that Mr. Farzam is a very low IQ person who is incredibly gullible to believe that he did not know” this is not a “legitimate fire department.” In all, at least 10 vehicles were “fraudulently registered” under the Santa Muerte name, court records said. “Are you a native Spanish speaker?” asked the prosecutor. The so-called Saint of Death fire company helped Farzam secure guns, prosectors said. The no bail motion said from February 2023 to January 2024, Farzam posed as a law enforcement officer to unlawfully obtain nine firearms from a licensed dealer. The falsified credentials “allowed him to bypass the mandatory Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) and to purchase handguns not listed on California's Roster of Certified Handguns.” Gun store employees recalled Farzam on two occasions pulling out of the parking lot – red and white lights flashing, sirens blaring – as if responding to an emergency call, court documents show. He's not a child, and he's clearly able to fill out forms,” Ayvazian said of the defendant at the preliminary hearing. Farzam is accused of “a series of blue laser strikes directed at commercial, recreational and law enforcement aircraft” near his Brentwood home earlier this year, according to court documents. The FBI has warned laser strikes can potentially disorient or temporarily blind pilots and contribute to a crash. No aircraft has ever been reported to have crashed because of a laser strike. Still, Farzam's alleged strikes account for the more serious charges against him: multiple felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and assault upon a peace office or firefighter. On the night of February 21, several aircraft – including a news helicopter, a California Highway Patrol helicopter and three commercial airliners descending into Los Angeles International Airport – reported “being struck by a high-intensity blue laser beam,” according to court documents. “It was a really frightening night, because that light was so powerful and so bright, it really could've gotten us hurt,” CNN affiliate KABC reporter Chris Christi told the station after Farzam's arrest. That same night, three commercial airline pilots reported being targeted with blue laser light on the approach to LAX – which led to additional criminal charges against Farzam. On April 19, prosecutors said, Farzam allegedly pointed a blue laser at an LAPD helicopter. Jackson, Farzam's high-profile veteran criminal defense attorney, noted a defense expert's testimony that an analysis of video and photos of one strike showed “the diffusion of that light source is inconsistent with the laser.” “Everything rises and falls on whether or not it was a laser, and they simply failed to produce that information,” Jackson said of the prosecution witnesses. A flashlight with blue light was found in Farzam's possession, Jackson said. “They have to have something that says there was a laser and they don't.” The attorney acknowledged investigators found laser pointers in Farzam's home, but none were blue. Still harder to prove, Jackson said, are the counts of assault on a peace officer stemming from the laser strikes, arguing that Farzam would not or could not have known what kind of aircraft was flying at the time. Last September, Farzam was at the center of what prosecutors called “a disturbing encounter” at a home in Beverly Hills. In a black Ford Explorer registered with the Santa Muerte Fire Department, Farzam pulled up to a driveway and blocked the sidewalk, according to court documents. He later told police he was “acting as a private investigator looking into a fight involving the homeowner's son,” according to court documents. Surveillance video showed “Farzam threatening to arrest the boy without identifying himself or citing any legal basis for doing so.” Farzam, still wearing the tactical jacket and carrying a 9mm handgun, was later pulled over by police in Beverly Hills. During the preliminary court hearing, Farzam's attorney acknowledged a witness in a video noted Farzam “said something about an arrest” during the incident, but “there was no allegation whatsoever that my client was engaged in any kind of self-benefit or violence.” Farzam is the son of a doctor-turned-hotelier who emigrated from Iran with his wife and their three children, according to an obituary of the eldest Farzam, who died last year. To meet teaching credentials at Southwestern, he submitted an American Heart Association Healthcare Provider card that was “invalid and dishonestly obtained,” the California Emergency Medical Services Authority said in a 2009 letter denying his application for licensing. A college spokesperson confirmed Farzam was an adjunct professor for about a year, beginning in August 2007, but declined to discuss personnel matters. One summer night in 1999, McChesney was conducting a traffic stop when a Crown Victoria – the sedan that dominated police fleets for decades – with exempt plates made a sudden U-turn and pulled up behind his patrol car. Later, McChesney said, he responded to a report of a public disturbance at a downtown apartment complex and found Farzam “in the middle of it.” He said Farzam showed up at the scene and “just made it worse.” At the time Farzam was no longer a cadet or associated with the local police department. He recalled Farzam was “mad” that McChesney had “started looking into him.” “He does this stupid stuff that seems harmless, right. In July 1999, Santa Barbara police learned Farzam's car was registered to “State of California Metro Police Enforcement” and he was identified as an officer, according to the state Emergency Medical Services Authority. His vehicle had exempt plates, flashing lights, a radio scanner, spotlights, and other police equipment. Lee Carter, a retired deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, said details of the case he prosecuted are fuzzy after so many years but recalled Farzam was arrested in 1999 on charges of impersonating a police officer and other charges. “I remember he showed up at a couple of calls all decked out, and there was some circumstantial evidence he drove around in a car outfitted with police lights,” Carter told CNN. “It worries me that the accusations continue after this length of time. We thought, ‘He's just a young kid making bad mistakes.' Now, three decades later, you say, maybe there's something else going on.” He reportedly identified himself as an off-duty officer and county paramedic. He was again arrested by the LAPD in 2004 for falsely reporting an emergency. Then, in 2014, Farzam became embroiled in what prosecutors called the “most significant prior case” against him: a 60-count complaint filed by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris. Prosecutors accused Farzam of using an alias to fraudulently access the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, a vast computer network that connects state public safety agencies to databases for criminal histories, vehicle and driver records and other sensitive information. Farzam “falsely impersonated an FBI Special Agent during a phone call to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office to influence a driving under the influence prosecution,” according to the no bail motion. “Representing himself as the real special agent, Farzam falsely claimed the defendant was a key member of a covert federal task force. He spoke directly to a supervising deputy city attorney, who requested official FBI confirmation.” The source of the information was an informant, a former friend and associate of Farzam who turned on him, according to state DOJ investigation reports obtained by CNN. He identified himself as “Special Agent in Charge Rafael Garcia” and said he wanted to “get a driving under the influence arrest dismissed for a Santa Monica police officer because she was an informant in the ‘Chapo Guzman case,'” the documents said, referring to now imprisoned Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán, known as “El Chapo.” If she wanted to know more, Farzam suggested, the prosecutor should “Google Chapo Guzman.” The prosecutor told a state DOJ investigator the caller was “very personable and talked as if he knew what he was doing,” according to an investigation report. In June 2014, law enforcement officials seized 16 firearms – including assault-style rifles – a dozen emergency radios, more than 40 forged badges, two counterfeit permits to carry concealed weapons, TSA and airline “Flying While Armed” documents and a CHP Crown Victoria with emergency lights from Farzam's home and business, according to the no bail motion. The fire truck, registered under the Santa Muerte Fire Department, was seized as evidence after Farzam's arrest last July, prosecutors said. Hirt, the retired state DOJ agent, said one item in Farzam's home was particularly humorous. “I think we would know if that occurred, right,” Hirt said. Farzam eventually pleaded guilty to three felony counts: impersonating a peace officer, possession of an assault weapon and unauthorized computer access, according to the no bail motion. His sentence: 90 days in jail and five years' probation. The parents were always there to bail him out. Literally, I was walking into the police department in Santa Monica after serving the search warrant at his hotel and he's walking out with his family. That's how quick they managed to bail him out.” A felony complaint by the state attorney general charged him with attempted witness intimidation, identity theft and use of counterfeit court seal, according to the no bail document. A UCLA law professor discovered the forgery and alerted authorities. If he only became a screenwriter, he could harness all that,” said Eugene Volokh, the University of California, Los Angeles law professor emeritus who alerted authorities. Mental health diversion connects people with mental health issues to treatment programs and support services in lieu of jail time. When Farzam was arrested this year on July 16, former state DOJ special agent supervisor Hirt got a call from a colleague who was part of the 2014 investigation. “You'll never guess who got arrested?” asked the caller. “I'm surprised it took this long to arrest him again.</p>

The emerging schism was laid bare by a prominent conservative think tank president's defense of talk show host Tucker Carlson's controversial decision to welcome a far-right activist with antisemitic views onto his podcast Thursday, and Carlson's hesitation to challenge some of his views. “We are at this point in what I consider sort of the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community,” Republican Jewish Coalition leader Matthew Brooks said in an interview with The Associated Press. Brooks had planned to fold some of his concerns into the three-day, annual conference of Republican Jewish elected officials, fundraisers, media personalities and activists. But comments made just before the meeting by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts denying the conservative group was “distancing itself” from Carlson — a former Fox News host and powerful voice on the right — after his podcast hosted Nick Fuentes prompted a sudden pivot. Fuentes has said the Holocaust was exaggerated, and that he believes in a global Jewish conspiracy. Carlson has espoused a white supremacist ideology called the “great replacement theory,” which says people of color are replacing white people and that Jews are furthering the change. The video of Roberts' comments sparked outrage from some Heritage staffers, senators and conservative activists. But they also reflect increasing skepticism toward Israel and of Jews among some on the right, complicating GOP efforts to cast the Democratic Party as antisemitic. Brooks had named others for contributing to the schism, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and conservative social media figure Candace Owens. That challenge was met by a steady chorus from the podium. “Sadly, we're seeing antisemitism on the fringes of our own party,” Tennessee Rep. David Kustoff lamented. Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida later proclaimed: “In our party we will not tolerate antisemitism.” Brooks said the leak of a series of TeleGram text messages from National Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont praising Hitler, joking about gas chambers and other atrocities, which was published last month by Politico, is a symptom of the division he and the coalition are trying to contain. Perhaps that is why dozens of college-age Jewish Republicans attended the conference, cheekily waving red signs emblazoned with “Tucker is not MAGA,” a reference to President Donald Trump's Make-America-Great-Again mantra, during Florida Congressman Randy Fine's presentation. There was joy at the event, notably over the release of Israeli hostages, many held for more than two years since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, prompting two years of brutal retaliation in Gaza. “I'm sure many of you have spent the last few weeks watching with joy and tears the joyful of Israel's resilient heroes, reuniting with their loved ones,” said Norm Coleman, a former Minnesota Senator and chairman of the coalition's board. “It has been a deeply emotional time for all Jewry.” When an image of Trump was cast on screens in the ballroom, the audience rose in cheers to hear his recorded 5-minute address to the group, in which he declared, “No one has been a greater friend to Israel than Donald J. Trump.” Several coalition members saw it as unlikely to hold, especially in light of Israel's renewed strikes in Gaza after it claimed Hamas had violated the ceasefire terms by firing on Israeli soldiers. Board member Bobby Schostak of Michigan suggested a lasting peace was possible but would take years. “I think we're some distance away from that,” he said. Coleman was even more grim, suggesting that Hamas still must be completely eradicated. “If they are still part of the equation,” he said.</p>

Laos' Defense Minister Khamlieng Outhakaisone attends the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-United States Defence Ministers' Hi-Tea, as part of the ASEAN Defense Ministers' meeting, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Saturday, Nov. 1, 2025. KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday that Washington and Beijing would establish military-to-military communications channels, adding that bilateral ties between the countries have “never been better.” Hegseth said he spoke with his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, late Saturday on the sidelines of a regional security meeting and that they agreed that “peace, stability and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries.” His remarks posted on X came hours after he urged Southeast Asian nations to stand firm and strengthen their maritime forces to counter China's increasingly “destabilizing” actions in the South China Sea. “China's sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea fly in the face of their commitments to resolve disputes peacefully,” Hegseth said at a meeting with his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Saturday. But we must ensure that China is not seeking to dominate you or anybody else,” he added. The South China Sea remains one of Asia's most volatile flashpoints. The Philippines, a key U.S. ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet. Manila has repeatedly urged a stronger regional response, but ASEAN has traditionally sought to balance caution with economic ties to Beijing, the region's largest trading partner. Hegseth said on X he also spoke with President Donald Trump and they agreed “the relationship between the U.S. and China has never been better.” Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea earlier this week “set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the U.S. and China,” added Hegseth, who left Malaysia on Sunday for Vietnam. The contrasting messages — a sharp warning at the ASEAN meeting followed by conciliatory language online — underscored Washington's effort to balance deterrence with diplomacy amid rising tensions with Beijing. More importantly, it reflects two different currents in U.S. relations with China — one that sees China as a threat and another a possible partner,” said Southeast Asian political analyst Bridget Welsh. In his meeting on Saturday, Hegseth criticized Beijing's recent declaration of the Scarborough Shoal — seized from the Philippines in 2012 — as a “nature reserve.” He told the meeting it was “yet another attempt to coerce new and expanded territorial and maritime claims at your expense.” He urged ASEAN to hasten the conclusion of a long-delayed Code of Conduct being negotiated with China to govern behavior in the sea. He also proposed developing shared maritime surveillance and rapid-response systems to deter provocation. A “shared maritime domain awareness” network, he said, would ensure that any member facing “aggression and provocation is not alone.” He also welcomed plans for an ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise in December to strengthen regional coordination and uphold freedom of navigation. Tian Junli, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command, said the exercise seriously undermined regional peace and stability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEWARK, New Jersey — Those thinking former President Barack Obama no longer has electoral influence in New Jersey would find that opinion challenged on Saturday night in Newark. He was met by applause, whistles, yells, and excited chants from all corners of the venue. Much to the delight of attendees, he came equipped with his trademark dry humor jokes and a repeated line telling people, “Don't boo. “If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a path to a brighter future, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama told hundreds of supporters who started lining up around the block early in the morning ahead of the rally. Obama said Sherrill will build a “stronger, brighter future” for New Jersey that will spread “light” across the country. Because, let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said. “We need leaders like Mikie, public servants who are in it for the right reasons, who are focused on the future, and who will always stay connected to the people that they were elected to serve. Though the congresswoman held a sizable lead for most of the general election season, recent polling shows her in a dead heat with Ciattarelli — hence the last-minute rally effort with the former president and other high-profile senators leading up to Election Day. Obama's stop in Newark came a few hours after he stumped for former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk, Virginia, who is also running for governor on Nov. 4. His endorsement of Sherrill will test whether he still holds considerable sway over the Democratic electorate and can influence voters who sat out the 2024 election to come out in an off-cycle year to cast a ballot. He said Sherrill is among the “tough people” he's met in his life, noting her military background as a pilot, work as a federal prosecutor, and life as a mother. “Apparently, that was a little bit too easy. I get tired just thinking about it,” Obama quipped. During the speech, he acknowledged that people voted for Trump in the last election because they were “understandably frustrated with inflation and high gas prices and the difficulty of affording a home, and they were worried about their children's futures.” He also noted that in 2024, he heard from many people who told him the election “didn't matter.” “If nothing else, these nine months should have cured us of that idea, because the stakes are now clear,” he said. “They never miss a chance to scapegoat minorities and blame DEI for every problem. He wrapped up his speech by encouraging people to stand with their convictions and reminded them that despite the “dark” emotions being felt by the public, this “contest of ideas, it's not new.” “I still believe our best days are ahead of us,” Obama said. Sherrill, who spoke before Obama took the stage, said she understood that New Jersey was a critical crossroads as one of only two gubernatorial races in 2025. “We are waging a battle at this very moment for the future of our nation and New Jersey has always answered the call to defend this country and our values,” Sherrill said. “In these difficult times, when everything seems to come down to our election, when people across the nation look at me with fear and despair in their eyes, when they asked me, ‘Is New Jersey up for this moment? She said her campaign focuses on opportunities for New Jersey, stating that “we believe it doesn't matter who your parents are, it doesn't matter where you were born, you should get a shot.” She focused heavily on her plans to install a state of emergency declaration to freeze electricity costs for at least a year after utility costs rose 22% from the previous year. She also spoke to Trump's energy policies, arguing he is “getting rich off the higher utility prices that New Jersey families are being forced to pay,” and the freezing of funds for the Hudson Tunnel project. Jack Ciattarelli is nowhere to be found,” Sherrill said. Does he commit to buying that money back for New Jersey? Does he say, ‘Hey, I'm serving you no matter what the cost.' “Jack has decided, I'm going to defend Trump. “We've got to take on all those hits coming from Trump and Washington, D.C.,” she said. “New Jerseyans give me courage, and I'm sure the nation feels that way, too. So, anger and courage are the daughters of hope.” Saturday's rally kicked off with speeches from local labor unions and county and state officials, as well as an energetic performance by the local senior citizens' East Orange Silver Steppers dance troupe. The featured songs of Saturday's rally were “Hit The Road Jack” by Ray Charles, a knock at Ciattarelli, as well as “Hey Mickey” by Sweet California, a nod to Sherrill. All speakers had the same message: voters cannot sit by and be complacent in Tuesday's election. All pleaded with supporters not to “sit on the sidelines” and instead vote in the Garden State's competitive gubernatorial election on Nov. 4. Booker spent his speech blasting the Republican trifecta in Washington, D.C., with the senator calling it “one of the most outrageous periods of American history.” He said President Donald Trump's policies have seeped across state lines, pointing to cuts to Medicaid and immigration operations occurring in cities across the country. “This is one of those moments — it's a rare one for our state — where this election has become about something so much bigger,” Booker said. “All over the United States of America, people are looking at New Jersey, and I will tell you right now, we are the people of hope. We are the light that's rising,” he added. Several of the speakers called Ciattarelli “100% MAGA” — a line Democrats have used for months as Sherrill's campaign has worked to tie the Republican candidate to Trump in order to show that he would be an extension of the administration and won't fight for New Jersey. Martin said Ciattarelli and Trump are “two sides of the same bad coin.” At one point, a supporter required brief medical assistance. Murphy, after calling for first responders, quipped, “I was starting to tell you what the state would look like if Jack were left and then somebody collapsed. Booker also said the election is about “defending New Jersey from Donald Trump and his minions.”</p>

At least 10 people were injured in a stabbing attack on a train in England Saturday night.

British Transport Police responded to reports of a mass stabbing aboard a train bound for London at around 7:30 p.m. local time. Police said at the time that “multiple people” were stabbed on the train, which was stopped at Huntingdon Station, near Cambridge.

Armed police officers arrested two suspects at the scene shortly after, whose identities have not been disclosed. Of the 10 passengers injured in the attack, nine are suffering from life-threatening injuries.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene, with passengers trampling over each other and hiding in bathrooms during the attack. One witness also told the Times that there was “blood everywhere,” and recalled seeing at least one man with a large knife.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than two weeks now during the government shutdown, Imelda Avila-Thomas has been trying in vain to get approved for unemployment compensation to help cover essentials such as food and mortgage payments for her family while she's on unpaid furlough from her federal government job. But Avila-Thomas, who works for the Department of Labor in San Antonio, said the system still deems her ineligible for benefits, saying it cannot verify her wages. She wonders whether someone who might help her has also been furloughed. The dollar amounts and length of benefits vary by state. About 26,000 federal workers filed initial claims from Sept. 28 through Oct. 18, according to raw data published by the Department of Labor. For instance, if they receive back pay as expected when the shutdown ends, they would need to repay the unemployment aid. For Avila-Thomas, refunding the money later is preferable to taking on debt. Avila-Thomas has worked at the Labor Department for 16 years. Her husband is a disabled veteran who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs and is still working with pay, but they have had to cut back on tutoring for their daughter, who has dyslexia, and with one income now, they've gone to a food bank. “This would cover that — the essential basics,” said Avila-Thomas, whose local American Federation of Government Employees covers Labor Department workers in several states. “And yes, in an ideal world, everybody would have six months worth of savings. And the reality is, most of our members are coming to that point where they could no longer pay those regular bills.” Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees relies heavily on state laws and processing. Massachusetts has a high-end weekly benefit of $1,105 per week for up to 30 weeks. In Mississippi, it's no more than $235 weekly for up to 26 weeks. Roughly half the states pay less than $600 a week maximum, according to U.S. Department of Labor numbers. And the limits can grow in some states when unemployment rates are particularly high. In Texas, where Avila-Thomas lives, the weekly maximum is $605, for up to 26 weeks. States normally issue payments within two to three weeks after someone's claim is approved, the Labor Department says. And most states also have an initial “waiting week” for which benefits are not paid upfront. Beneficiaries typically receive money for that week only later, if they exhaust all the weeks they're allotted, the National Employment Law Project says. States are responsible for verifying an applicant's job and earnings with their federal employer. Many workers have not received forms normally sent by their employing agencies that are used to verify employment and earnings, according to the National Employment Law Project. Questions have come up about states' varying requirements that people prove they are job hunting while receiving unemployment checks. And some states have specified that work-search mandates won't apply to these workers, waiving them for several weeks or longer. But in Texas, Avila-Thomas said she has not received a clear answer. About 730,000 federal employees have kept working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, and they are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits. They will receive back pay after the government is reopened. Workers on reduced hours could be eligible for unemployment. “Excepted” employees working without pay are typically necessary to respond to emergencies or ensure national security, such as air traffic controllers and airport security screeners. The Trump administration has said pay will continue for some groups, including FBI special agents and military troops. Paychecks never stopped for some other workers whose departments, such as the Postal Service, rely on their own revenues or certain other funding sources. There have been other wrinkles specific to how this administration has handled the shutdown, as well. Earlier in October, the Trump administration threatened that back pay for furloughed federal workers would not be guaranteed, though he later backtracked on it. Trump has also sought to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers during the shutdown. Avila-Thomas said workers like her are ready for the shutdown to end.

Israel has confirmed that three more bodies recently returned by Hamas are not those of hostages taken by the terrorist group over two years ago.

Hamas handed over the remains of three people on Friday, as part of its obligations under the Gaza ceasefire struck last month. None of those are of the remaining hostages that Hamas has yet to return, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Saturday.

“The remains we received are not our hostages,” the office said, without providing any more information.

Israel's confirmation is the latest instance of Hamas's failure to uphold its duties under the ceasefire, the first phase of which required the terrorist group to release all living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of it taking effect.

Nearly a month later, 11 hostage remains are still due to be returned to Israel, and pressure is mounting.

President Donald Trump's patience has worn thin with the pace of the release, with him recently warning of potential action from other countries if Hamas did not move quickly.

That led to Egypt joining the recovery efforts, with teams entering the Gaza Strip with engineering vehicles and excavators to locate the bodies.

Some of those efforts were successful, as Hamas returned the bodies of two hostages on Thursday.</p>
