Behind bars I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration.

“There's nothing wrong with him. If there were, it would say so in his file.”

I heard a licensed mental health counselor say those words to a correctional officer as they stood side by side, watching a man through a large plexiglass window that took up most of the wall of an observation cell, a cell used for people deemed a threat to themselves or others. Inside, the man was visibly unraveling, pacing, talking to someone who wasn't there.

We were in B-4, the mental health unit at Orange County Jail in Goshen, New York, known among incarcerated men and staff as the “bug-out” unit. I was 19 years old, newly incarcerated, and already diagnosed with several mental health disorders. In my naive and inexperienced mind, I thought the man in that cell was going to receive some sort of help. However, on that day, I learned a harsh reality: in New York's jails and prisons, mental health services do not exist unless it is documented and part of your case file.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

When I was arrested in 2014, I came to jail with a psychiatrist's diagnosis already in hand: oppositional defiant disorder, depression, and severe anxiety. I had been prescribed psychiatric medication, and because that paperwork followed me, I was placed on the mental health caseload. In many ways, I was fortunate. Before my incarceration, I was covered under my family's health insurance, which allowed me to see a psychiatrist and receive treatment that many others could not access. That single privilege, the ability to afford care and obtain a documented diagnosis, became the reason I qualified for mental health care in jail. Though the services were limited, I was at least provided monthly check-ins, medication, and placement in a housing unit that catered more to our individual needs than a general population unit would have.

None of it felt like treatment though. There were no therapy sessions, no support groups, and no opportunities to understand what I was experiencing or how to manage it, especially in a place like jail. The unit I was housed in felt less like a place for healing, and more like a warehouse: somewhere to lock away people with visible symptoms until they could be filtered back into general population, which eventually is where I ended up.

In 2017, I was sentenced and transferred to a state facility run by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). I expected some continuity of care. What I found was worse: a system where treatment is reduced to a checklist, and if you are not already “on the books,” you do not qualify. Care inside is determined by paperwork, not people. If you had a psychiatrist before prison, you might be placed on the caseload. If you did not, no matter how much you are struggling, you are likely ignored.

When I told staff that I felt more depressed and even had thoughts of hurting myself, I was told, “That is just the price you pay to feel better.”

This reality was impossible to miss. I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration. I listened to stories from people who had been hearing voices since their teenage years, but whose requests for treatment were denied because they had never seen a doctor before prison. Others described panic attacks, chronic insomnia, or overwhelming anxiety, only to be told, “You are not on the caseload.” Their suffering did not count because it was not already written down in a file.

Correctional officers and even some mental health aides treat mental illness like a hustle, assuming people are exaggerating to get medication, avoid punishment, or score a free high. Unless you came in with schizophrenia or psychosis, you are often brushed aside. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD, conditions that disable so many, are dismissed as mood swings or bad behavior. Instead of being seen as medical issues, they are treated as flaws in character, a reflection of willpower rather than well-being.

DOCCS reports that about 29 percent of incarcerated individuals are currently on the mental health caseload, up from 26 percent in 2022. Yet according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly 50 percent of incarcerated people nationwide live with some form of mental illness. That gap exposes the truth: people are coming to prison already suffering, but if they lacked access to doctors and diagnoses before incarceration, their pain remains invisible.

In 2018, while at Clinton Correctional Facility, I stopped taking psychiatric medication. The side effects — weight gain, fatigue, emotional numbness — became unbearable. When I told staff that I felt more depressed and even had thoughts of hurting myself, I was told, “That is just the price you pay to feel better.” But I did not feel better. What I learned was that in prison, medication is often the only tool offered, and even that is reserved for those whose paperwork qualifies them. Real care such as counseling, trauma-informed therapy, and group support is almost nonexistent. The state treats medication as a substitute for healing rather than one part of it, reducing human suffering to a matter of dosage and compliance.

A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm.

A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm. Constant surveillance, unpredictable violence, long-term separation from family, and the complete loss of control over your own life are not simply stressors; they are traumas that shape every waking moment. Yet the system refuses to acknowledge this. Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself. When someone begins to break down, their behavior is treated as a disciplinary issue rather than a crisis. Instead of receiving treatment, they are written up. Instead of obtaining care, they are sent to solitary. Their file grows, not with diagnoses or treatment plans, but with misbehavior reports. The result is predictable: people leave prison more fragile than when they came in, carrying untreated wounds back into their communities.

The file system does not merely fail people; it protects the institution. By tying care to prior diagnosis, DOCCS shifts responsibility away from itself. If a man spirals into psychosis but was never diagnosed before prison, the state can claim, “There was nothing in his file.” The suffering becomes invisible by design, hidden behind policy language and bureaucratic logic that prioritize liability over lives. This shield saves money, limits accountability, and allows lawmakers to say they are addressing mental health without making real investments. It is austerity disguised as policy, and its consequences are written on the faces of the people it abandons.

Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself.

Mental health care must be available to everyone, not just those with paperwork. Everyone should be screened at intake and again at regular intervals, ensuring that these screenings are conducted by independent clinicians rather than correctional staff. Prisons should offer talk therapy, group sessions, and trauma-informed care in every facility. Staff should be trained to recognize signs of distress and respond with care, not punishment. We need systems that acknowledge incarceration itself as trauma and help people survive it rather than break under it.

We know untreated mental illness drives higher recidivism rates, deepens cycles of poverty and violence, and fuels despair that can end in suicide. New York spends more than $3 billion annually on prisons yet continues to ration care as if acknowledging suffering were too expensive. The truth is, neglect is what proves costly. People return home untreated, destabilized, and at higher risk of reoffending. Communities bear the weight. Families pay the price.

Right now, DOCCS treats mental illness as a logistical problem. But what is happening inside these walls is deeper than that. People are hurting. Some are unraveling. And many are leaving prison with scars that no file will ever record. We cannot medicate our way through this crisis. Healing requires more than prescriptions. It requires care, presence, and a system that sees people rather than paperwork, because what is not written down still matters.

Faculty are forming support networks to connect with each other to protect students and end the genocide in Palestine.

Photos of Palestine solidarity encampments have disappeared from the news, replaced by pictures of immigration agents kidnapping university students and community members, but the campus-based battle to force universities to divest from Israel and weapons manufacturing is still underway.

This a long-term, smoldering battle. “The campuses are definitely as active as they were a year ago from my purview,” says Akin Olla, communications director for the anti-militarist youth organization Dissenters. But, he adds, “The actions look different and are generally less media-friendly.”

While this struggle continues, its shape has shifted, as students who were initially on the front lines of pro-Palestine activism experience additional vulnerability due to the Trump administration's attacks. Many of these students are Muslim immigrants or from immigrant families, while others are queer or trans and confronting a different series of attacks. As a result of these changes, the shape of the work has changed. For one thing, faculty who spoke to Truthout said that campus student groups are working more in coalition to provide some shielding to targeted students, like Students for Justice in Palestine or Muslim student associations.

Faculty across the United States continue to organize: They're supporting students and their movements; organizing their own events; building aboveground and underground safety networks in response to the presence of immigration police on campus; and pushing their own unions and scholarly associations to take political positions.

Since Donald Trump took office in January 2025, people on campuses have experienced a series of rollercoaster events around the status of international, immigrant, and undocumented students and staff. In March, there were a series of high-profile kidnappings of students on visas and green cards like Rümeysa Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil in retaliation for their activism on Palestine. These widely publicized kidnappings were accompanied by the sudden revocation of 6,000 student visas around the U.S., the majority of which were not related to activism or political opinions.

The dramatic crisis of the spring has given way to other forms of exclusion: This summer, the administration made a dramatic reduction in the number of student visas that were issued, leading to a 30-40 percent drop in international students attending school in the U.S. this fall. Then on September 19, the Trump administration issued an executive order about H-1B visas that initially made it seem as if H-1B visa holders would no longer be able to come and go from the U.S. without their employers paying a $100,000 fee. There are currently around 120,000 faculty and university workers holding H-1B visas across the U.S., many of whom travel internationally professionally as part of their research.

There does not seem to be an end in sight to attacks on immigrant, undocumented, and international students, faculty, and staff, nor does there seem to be an obvious line that will not be crossed as the administration escalates its attacks. Jenna Loyd, co-founding member of Sanctuary Campus Network, says that in addition to a spillover from the administration's attacks on immigrants more broadly, the logic is to “attack the whole idea of universities being international spaces.”

Contrary to Republican talking points, universities are not hotbeds of radical leftism. In reality, governing boards react swiftly and punitively to events that rock the boat.

At a small private liberal arts college in the Northeast, a political theorist is facing dismissal for her activism. “Laura,” who chose not to give her real name because she is on the job market, found herself on the wrong side of her institution when she organized a series of speaking events about Palestine. The events featured high-profile speakers and highlighted the interconnectedness of Palestine to other issues, including campus repression of free speech, in an effort to build more solidarity with Palestine on campus.

Faculty active in the pro-Palestine struggle are generally frustrated at the lack of support and activism from their colleagues. Many faculty, says Laura, have an “easy posture of learned helplessness” around difficult issues, insisting disingenuously that the university is not a political space. “It's racism masked behind civility politics,” Laura says.

At the University of Central Florida, Talat Rahman, faculty union president and professor of physics, says that there is unfortunately not nearly as much support for organizing against the genocide as for resisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), although the two causes are interrelated. Rahman says there is a lot of fear on campus, but that “people can only be afraid for so long. At some point you have to live with your own conscience.”

It's no coincidence that the attacks on students and immigrants on campus began with those speaking out against the genocide in Palestine, says Bill V. Mullen, professor emeritus of American Studies at Purdue and secretary-treasurer for American Association of University Professors local 6741. “The opposition to the war against Palestinians has become a hammer to destroy academic freedom…. Whatever your position might even be on Palestine and Israel, you have to acknowledge that this is the mechanism that's being used to try to reshape higher education. The discussion of Palestine is actually a discussion about our work conditions.”

In other words, the repression of pro-Palestine protesters on university campuses, under Joe Biden and under every previous presidential administration, created the opportunity for the anti-immigrant attacks by the Trump administration, as well as other attacks against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and independent governance.

Despite mission statements extolling the benefits of diversity and care for their students, campus administrations have offered little other than platitudes to protect international and undocumented students, leaving it to faculty staff and students to organize and protect each other. The overwhelming majority of university administrations are too risk-averse to offer real support to students facing an expanded immigration dragnet, so some faculty are responding to administrative compliance with ICE and the Department of Homeland Security by forming their own support networks.

One national coordinating group is the new and growing Sanctuary Campus Network, which aims to pool ideas and resources so that faculty on any single campus don't need to reinvent the wheel. The network has been holding large Zoom meetings on the first Friday of each month since December 2024. These meetings often involve a training or presentation from a partner organization, like Muslims for Just Futures or Palestine Legal.

One early project of Sanctuary Campus Network was to develop an immigration-focused Know Your Rights training and slide deck that was adapted specifically for the campus environment. The network encouraged members to give the presentation on their own campuses to disseminate this information as widely as possible while reducing the time that individual faculty need to spend developing materials.

Similarly, the network has a large drive of materials for printing and use by faculty, like signs that can be placed on office or classroom doors indicating that these are private spaces (and therefore closed to immigration agents without a signed judicial warrant). The goal is to use these signs to indicate to students and others who may be targeted which faculty are supportive and where they will be harbored in the event of a raid on campus.

Sanctuary Campus Network is broken up into five regions, and members meet regularly in smaller groups. Rachel Ida Buff, a writer and working historian currently teaching at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who is part of the Midwest region, says that these regional meetings have been “really, really useful,” and validating, allowing faculty to commiserate, share tactics, and build camaraderie with each other. These regional network meetings are especially important as a space to build a collective effort since the number of active faculty on an individual campus may be quite small.

Organizing on campus, like organizing more generally, does not always look like what it looks like in the movies. Laura says that a big part of her role in mentoring student activists is teaching that “activism is not always the flashiest thing.” Instead, it's often about “illuminating how power functions” and other less obvious goals, she says.

Dana Morrison, member of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, explained that one of the group's goals is politicization. On regional public campuses like West Chester, most students work and many live far from campus, leading to a relatively apolitical campus. “How do you [participate in coordinated national events] if on your own campus, nobody has even uttered a political thing in the public space?” Morrison says that “you have to have the soil correct for anything to happen.”

It's not just students on campus who are sometimes relatively apolitical. Sanctuary Campus Network co-founding member A. Naomi Paik pointed out that some faculty have little experience with activism and are just learning to organize. There are places to learn, however: A focus of the network as well as of the American Association of University Professors has been to offer trainings on the various components of organizing, and there are usually at least a small group of faculty members on each campus who do have this experience.

Mullen, who helped organize the second National Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17, 2025, as part of the Coalition for Action in Higher Ed (CAHE), says “overcoming hopelessness is a crucial organizing problem.”  

The Day of Action featured scores of actions on a diverse range of campuses, as well as a full day of online programming organized by CAHE. Mullen says that one of the goals of this year's events was to bring Palestine more directly into the focus of higher ed organizing. CAHE is beginning to transition to an organization from an ad hoc coalition, and is already planning for April 17, 2026.

One of the main challenges of campus activism is the churn of leadership in student groups. Campaigns like divestment struggles are long, much longer than the average tenure of a student activist. Several faculty members mentioned that student organizations that led earlier protests on their campus are in a process of reformation after all the leaders graduated at once.

Faculty have much lower rates of turnover and can be present for a longer campaign, but activist faculty are careful about their role in relationship to students. Morrison says that she and her colleagues are careful to develop campaigns of their own rather than drive campus-wide divestment campaigns. “If we were to define the campaign, name the target, and all that kind of stuff, we'd be taking up space in terms of how we teach students,” she says. Faculty would end up teaching students that their participation is not important.

Instead, Morrison's Faculty and Staff Justice in Palestine chapter organized a successful divestment campaign focused on their labor union. Other faculty have engaged in pressure campaigns within their scholarly associations, like the Sociologists for Palestine campaign.

On some campuses, student groups have merged with off-campus community groups so that students who've graduated can stay involved. This is the case with the Dissenters chapter at North Carolina State University, says Chelsey Dyer, assistant teaching professor of anthropology who serves as the faculty adviser for the group. Dyer says this joint community/campus structure also allows her and other involved faculty to show up to the group more as peer activists than specifically as faculty mentors.

Similarly, Buff says campus sanctuary organizing on her campus in Milwaukee has benefited from collaborations with deeply rooted immigrant organizing in the city, and that Buff herself has benefited from looking to other activists as peers rather than often-fearful faculty colleagues.

The struggle to protect international, immigrant, and undocumented students is deeply entwined with the longer-term struggle for a free Palestine and to build a more liberatory version of higher education itself. Mullen puts it this way: “If both parties have been willing to consent to supporting a mass killing of a population, it's not a shock that both parties participated in the firing of college presidents and the arrests of students.”

The odds are daunting, but faculty like Mullen emphasize that building cross-campus and national networks reduces their isolation — and their fear.

The Pentagon is preparing for a war with Nigeria after Donald Trump threatened to send in the military “guns-a-blazing” if the country does not stem the killing of Christians.

The US president said on Saturday that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack just days after warning that Christianity was “facing an existential threat in Nigeria” by Islamic extremists.

“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Mr Trump said on Truth Social.

“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians.”

The Nigerian government vehemently rejects the claims, and analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

On Friday, Mr Trump announced that he would designate Nigeria “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some US lawmakers.

The designation could lead to sanctions and include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid.

Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, shared Mr Trump's post and wrote on social media: “Yes, sir.”

“The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Mr Hegseth said.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and a largely Christian south.

The country is consumed by security issues. Its northeastern region is at the epicentre of a Boko Haram jihadist insurgency, which has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced more than two million since 2009, according to the United Nations.

In central Nigeria, majority-Muslim herders have repeatedly clashed with majority-Christian farmers. The conflict is frequently portrayed as inter-religious but generally stems from competition over land access.

Christianity has played a central role in Mr Trump's campaign to return to office and was fundamental in securing a large and reliable voting bloc among white evangelical and conservative Christians.

Conservative politicians in the US have fuelled the accusations and called for intervention.

Last month, Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, and Riley Moore, congressman for West Virginia, accused the Nigerian government of turning a blind eye to the “mass murder” of Christians.

Claims of Christian persecution have also been pushed by some in Nigeria, where ethnic, religious and regional divisions have flared with deadly consequences in the past and still shape the country's modern politics.

“The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,” Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria's president, said on social media on Saturday.

“Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Mr Tinubu added.

On Sunday, Nigeria said it would welcome the US help in fighting Islamist insurgents as long as its territorial integrity is respected.

“We welcome US assistance as long as it recognises our territorial integrity,” said Daniel Bwala, an adviser to the Nigerian president.

The increased focus on the African nation is part of a wider shift in America's foreign policy, which seeks to redraw the Western sphere of influence. The overall plan has been dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, and its aim, in part, is to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence.

Beijing had deep trade and resource-extraction ties across Africa and Nigeria is part of that ecosystem. Nigeria holds vast reserves of rare earth elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are vital to consumer electronics and the American tech industry.

The doctrine also extends to Latin America. In Venezuela, military strikes on drug-smuggling vessels have been framed as a national security threat and the need to revive American dominance in the region.  

Dozens of alleged cartel members have been killed in targeting strikes on small boats in the Caribbean since early September in a renewed war on drugs. Whether for show, or as part of a wider doctrine closing in on Latin America, the attacks remain controversial among legal scholars and some of the countries in America's “backyard”.

The Justice Department told Congress this week that Mr Trump could lawfully continue his lethal strikes and that the 60-day limit on congressionally unauthorised deployments into “hostilities” does not apply in this operation.

Patel reportedly became furious after revelation he flew to visit girlfriend and agency fired official who oversees fleet

A top FBI official with 27 years standing has reportedly been fired by the bureau after its director, Kash Patel, became enraged by press stories revealing he had used a government jet to travel to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a wrestling match.

Steven Palmer, who had worked at the bureau since 1998, was fired as head of the FBI's critical incident response group which is responsible for handling major security threats as well as overseeing the agency's fleet of jets. He was the third head of the unit to be dismissed since Patel became the second Trump administration's FBI director in February.

Bloomberg Law, which broke the story, said that three unnamed sources had expressed astonishment at the sacking given that Patel's flight schedules were fully public and trackable on websites. A day after her performance, Patel himself had reposted photos showing him together with his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, on his X account.

According to Bloomberg, Patel had become furious over stories published after the event about his use of the FBI jet to go on the date with Wilkins. Soon after, Palmer had been told he could resign instantly or be fired.

The dismissal was made official on Friday.

Flight logs publicly trackable on Flight Aware for Patel's plane, N708JH, show that the jet landed at an airport near Penn State on 25 October. That evening Wilkins performed at a Real American Freestyle wrestling event, and the flight logs show Patel's FBI plane later flying to Nashville.

Records for the movements of the jet N708JH were blocked on Flight Aware as of Sunday. A search for the government jet generates a message saying that it is “not available for public tracking per request from the owner/operator”.

Patel himself has not responded to Bloomberg's report on the dismissal of Palmer. But earlier his spokesman, Ben Williamson, did post a lengthy statement on X in which he called criticism of Patel's jet travel “disingenuous and dumb” and “bad faith whining”.

Williamson pointed out that the director is required under government rules to pay some reimbursement for the travel and claimed Patel had “significantly limited” personal travel compared with his predecessors Chris Wray and James Comey. “He's allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend,” the spokesman said.

As the Daily Beast has noted, Patel was highly critical of Wray's use of government jets for personal use when Wray was director of the bureau. In 2023, Patel scathingly dubbed Wray “#GovernmentGangster” and accused him of “jetting off on out (sic) tax payer dollars while dodging accountability for the implosion of the FBI on his watch”.

Palmer's dismissal makes him the third head of the FBI critical incident response group to be ditched under Patel. Wes Wheeler was fired in March, and Brian Driscoll in August.

Driscoll is now suing the Trump administration for unfair dismissal claiming he was targeted for showing lack of loyalty to the president.

Patel's travel on a government jet for a date night was first spotted by Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent who has become a thorn in the side of the Trump administration. His podcast is caustically critical of the current leadership of the FBI.

“We're in the middle of government shutdown … and this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?” Seraphin said in a recent podcast.

The government shutdown to which Seraphin alluded had entered its 32nd day.

In a separate unflattering development for him, Patel is facing heat from a defense lawyer in Michigan who is objecting to the FBI director's allegations Friday that five young men had been arrested as they planned a Halloween terror attack. The lawyer, Amir Makled, who represents one of the five individuals, said that having reviewed the case he was convinced no such terror event had been in the pipeline.

Makled told Associated Press that the FBI director's claims were “hysteria and fearmongering”. The five men were aged 16 to 20 – and were US citizens and gamers.

“I don't believe that there's anything illegal about any of the activity they were doing,” he said.

Turkey's largest oil refineries are scaling back purchases of Russian oil and turning to alternative suppliers, as the latest Western sanctions tighten restrictions on Moscow's exports used to fund its war against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 2.

New U.S. restrictions announced on Oct. 22 target Russia's two largest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil, along with their subsidiaries. The measures pave the way for secondary sanctions against foreign institutions that handle transactions with those on the blacklist.

According to Reuters' industry sources, the shift marks a notable change for Turkey — one of the main buyers of Russian oil, alongside India and China.

The SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), owned by Azerbaijan's state oil company, has recently secured four shipments of crude from Iraq, Kazakhstan, and other non-Russian producers for December delivery, Reuters reported.

These purchases amount to between 77,000 and 129,000 barrels per day, significantly reducing the refinery's intake of Russian oil.

Another major Turkish refiner, Tupras, is also increasing purchases of non-Russian oil, including Iraqi grades of similar quality to Urals. 

Two sources told Reuters that the company plans to phase out Russian crude imports at one of its two major refineries, allowing it to continue exporting fuel to Europe without breaching upcoming restrictions.

Tupras has already begun diversifying its crude sources, receiving its first-ever shipment from Brazil earlier this year and expecting a second from Angola in November.

Rosneft and Lukoil are pillars of Russia's economy. Together, they account for nearly half of the country's crude oil exports, around 3.1 million barrels per day, according to Russian estimates.

State-controlled Rosneft, led by Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, produces about 40% of Russia's oil. Lukoil, the country's largest private energy company, accounts for roughly 15% of the national output and 2% of the global production.

The new sanctions extend far beyond the parent companies, covering six Lukoil subsidiaries and 28 Rosneft enterprises. Among them is Lukoil-Western Siberia, which alone accounts for around 40% of the group's hydrocarbon production.

Voters set to accept new maps to help Democrats counter Republican gerrymandering – and check president's power

California's Proposition 50 began as a warning from the nation's largest blue state to its largest red one: don't poke the bear. But when Texas moved ahead with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat.

Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, who have cast it as a chance to check Trump's power.

“California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country's democracy before our very eyes,” Newsom said at a rally, formally announcing the initiative, known as the Election Rigging Response Act.

Proposition 50 asks voters to temporarily scrap the state's independently-drawn congressional district lines in favor of new maps carved up to help Democrats win five additional safe seats – a tit-for-tat response to Texas, where Republicans secured five new, friendlier districts earlier this year.

Voting has been underway for weeks in the Golden State. As of Saturday, nearly 6m ballots had been returned, about one in four of the total mailed out, according to Political Data Inc, a firm that tracks voter data. Voting ends on Tuesday, 4 November.

Early returns and polling suggest the ballot measure is on track for a comfortable victory. Though it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election, several recent surveys showed it passing by more than 20 points.

The focus on Trump has galavanized Democrats in the deep-blue state, averting what some initially feared: an esoteric debate about the political minutiae of redistricting, a process that until just a few months ago typically took place at the start of each decade.

National Democrats lined up behind California's retaliatory plan. Their closing ad features Barack Obama, Newsom, and prominent congressional Democrats – including New York House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – telling voters they have the power to “stand up to Donald Trump”.

“Democrats have won the messaging war in California because they've successfully framed it as an anti-Trump campaign,” said Dave Wasserman, the senior elections analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “Republicans just did not cobble together the resources or the momentum to stop it.”

Opponents of the effort initially promised a formidable fight, but their campaigns were vastly outraised and support from national Republicans never materialized. In the final weeks, Republicans had largely retreated from the airwaves.

California Republicans focused part of their attack on Newsom, denouncing the plan as a “Gavinmander” designed to help the term-limited governor build a national profile and donor base ahead of a likely 2028 presidential run. Millions of conservative voters in the state will be disenfranchised, they've warned, appealing to the fairness of the independent redistricting commission's current work.

California representative Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose district would be redrawn under the new maps, has called for a nationwide ban on mid-decade redistricting. The proposal has not gained traction.

“What Newsom is trying to do here is to entrench even more power in the hands of a corrupt political class that has caused California to go from being the most beautiful state in the country to being the most popular state to leave,” Kiley said in an interview this week on Fox Business Network.

Republicans hold just nine of the state's 52 House seats. If successful, the gerrymander could slash the number of Republicans California sends to Washington by more than half.

Former California Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Trump critic who championed the commission's creation, harshly criticized Proposition 50. And Charles Munger, the wealthy Republican donor and longtime supporter of independent redistricting, poured more than $30m into the effort to stop California from “returning to the evils of partisan gerrymandering”.

Amid the immigration raids and the federal takeover of US cities, California voters were more concerned with the stopping the Trump administration than saving their fair maps, said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist advising Munger's opposition group, the Protect Voters First committee. Madrid suspected that most people who voted for Proposition 50 hadn't even bothered to study the new districts.

“It has nothing to do with redistricting,” he said. “This is about sending a message to Donald Trump.”

National good governance groups such as Common Cause, which has historically fought partisan redistricting, opted to stay neutral on California's gerrymander.

“The question was, are we going to unilaterally disarm one side?” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the CEO and president of Common Cause. Instead, the group developed a six-point “fairness” criteria, an effort to put “guardrails” on the process, which she said were reflected in the California measure.

The view that politicians should not draw their own districts remains popular in California. Trump, however, is not. Nearly two in three voters agree that the president treats California “worse” than other states, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey. Among those voting for the measure, 75% said opposition to Trump was a factor in their decision.

“It brings me no joy to see the maps that the commission drew being pushed aside,” said Sara Sadhwani, a professor of politics at Pomona College who served as one of the mapmaking panel's Democratic members in 2020. “However, I do believe that in this moment, there is a greater fight that we have to wage in order to ensure a level playing field across the nation for the 2026 election.”

Sadhwani appeared in one of the yes campaign's first ads, in which she warned: “Donald Trump's scheme to rig the next election is an emergency for our democracy”.

Though Trump is at the center of the yes campaign, he was unusually muted on the ballot measure itself. Last month, he weighed in on Truth Social to preemptively discredit, without evidence, the “totally dishonest” results of Tuesday's election.

The Trump administration announced that it was deploying federal election monitors to New Jersey and California to watch the vote. In response, Newsom accused Trump of attempting to “suppress the vote” while the Democratic attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the state would dispatch its own observers to watch the federal monitors.

Heading into election day, Democrats' confidence has given the campaign an air of inevitability – so much so that Newsom, to the surprise and delight of supporters, took the unconventional step of telling them last week: “You can stop donating now.”

But the yes campaign say it is taking nothing for granted. Newsom spent the final weekend before Tuesday's special election traveling “up and down” the state, his team said, as tens of thousands of volunteers knocked doors and sent text messages reminding voters to return their ballots. “This election is not over,” the governor cautioned.

Meanwhile, in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Newsom made it a point to say he was “deeply confident” that California voters would approve Proposition 50 – and said Trump was “changing the rules” and Democrats had to adapt.

“We want to go back to some semblance of normalcy, but you have to deal with the crisis at hand,” he said.

In the national redistricting arms race, California remains the farthest along of any Democrat-led state to retaliate. Wasserman estimates that passage of the California ballot initiative would probably improve Democrats' chances of winning the House majority next year by between 10% and 15%. But, with Trump having pushed Republican-led states such as Missouri and North Carolina to approve new maps and others poised to follow suit, he noted: “The problem for Democrats nationally is that they don't have enough Californias.”

As the gerrymander war escalates, supporters outside the Golden State are pleading with Californians to, in the words of their governor, “fight fire with fire”.

“We're depending on California to help a friend out, to help us out as a country,” said Texas state representative Nicole Collier, who fled the state with roughly two dozen of her Democratic colleagues to prevent a vote on the Republican gerrymander there. “The future direction of this country hangs in the balance.”

A home for sale in Vancouver. Canadians have been putting money into the red-hot housing market for years, and could be headed for financial pain with a correction underway, Tim Shufelt writes.Isabella Falsetti/The Globe and Mail

Every conversation about financial markets these days eventually veers toward the question of whether we are in a bubble – AI, gold, Big Tech.

But there's another asset bubble already undoing itself in painful fashion, and this one means a lot more to the finances of the average Canadian than the stock market.

Home prices in Canada have been grinding lower for 3½ years and counting. And still, the long-awaited rebound has yet to materialize.

Sales are low. Buyers are in no hurry, and sellers are being forced to reduce their prices.

“It's going to be at least five to 10 years from the peak before we get back to 2022 prices, just because of how frothy valuations got in housing,” said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist with Bank of Montreal. 

“Real estate as an asset class in Canada is pretty-much dead for now.”

How the Toronto condo bubble burst

The era of the shoebox condo is over. Here's how Canada can build livable apartments

When you look back to major housing busts in recent history, this one is tracking fairly close to precedent.

There is enormous variation across regional markets in Canada that needs to be kept in mind. Weak demand and declining values are concentrated in the Toronto and Vancouver areas, which had years of bidding wars and intense speculation. In parts of the Prairies and Atlantic Canada, sales growth is much stronger.

At the national level, the average selling price has declined by about 20 per cent in nominal terms since 2022. Once you factor in inflation, that figure rises to 30 per cent.

That puts Canada's current housing correction in line with both the U.S. housing crash that sparked the 2008 global financial crisis, and Ontario's housing crash of the 1990s.

This one does not have the wave of foreclosures of the former, nor the severe recession and mass unemployment of the latter. But in terms of depth and duration, it's very much on par, so far. In those two prior downturns, it took 10 years and 12 years, respectively, for home prices to recover to their previous highs.

Canada's bear market in housing will drag on simply because it has to rebalance from a confluence of stimulants that is not likely to ever be repeated, Mr. Kavcic said. They include peak demand from millennial buyers, peak immigration to Canada, pandemic-era mobility, excess liquidity from government stimulus, rock-bottom interest rates, and rampant market speculation.

From January, 2005, up to the housing market's peak, the average home price more than tripled in Canada, topping out at about $820,000.

One side effect of a two-decade property boom is that it increasingly put Canadians' homes front and centre of their finances.

Even after the correction, real estate accounts for more than 40 per cent of total household assets, according to Statistics Canada data. (It peaked at 46 per cent). 

Even though Canadians have record high levels of stock-market exposure, equities make up just 26 per cent of the average Canadian's total assets.

Clearly, Canadians' financial well-being is much more dependent on the housing market than the stock market.

This is especially true of lower and middle-income Canadians, since stock ownership is heavily skewed to wealthier brackets.

Having one of the world's hottest markets conditioned a generation of Canadians to treat housing as a financial asset, and even a retirement plan.

Variable-rate mortgages are making a comeback, but some economists are already predicting rate hikes

A recent survey found that half of unretired homeowners plan to rely on the sale of their home to set themselves up for retirement, according to a report released by Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in June.

A similar poll conducted last year found that one-third of Canadians are relying on their home as their only financial plan for retirement, according to a Re/Max report.

The risks of such an approach are now coming to the fore. If you're counting on the equity in your home to finance your retirement any time soon, then you're obviously vulnerable to declining property values. 

Perhaps the stock market is in a bubble that will end badly. Meanwhile, many Canadians are enduring a correction that is already taking a toll on their financial health.

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Trey Yesavage celebrate after a double play in Game 7. Toronto lost to Los Angeles, but Mark Kingwell writes that some moments from the game represent the Blue Jays at their best.Kevin Sousa/Reuters

Mark Kingwell is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and the author of Fail Better: Why Baseball Matters.

Baseball is not a religion but it sure feels like one sometimes. The rituals, the costumes, the incantations. The narratives of sacrifice and redemption. The slow deaths and joyful resurrections. Above all, the return of days, the year-guiding calendar of spring training, regular season, and post-season.

Game 7 of the 2025 World Series was peak baseball on the Feast of All Saints. The day after – All Souls' Day by the traditional Christian calendar – is when we honour the departed, especially those in Purgatory. Together these two festivals make up Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. Let's agree, in an ecumenical spirit, that this combined observance of joy and mourning now embraces all Blue Jays fans, regardless of what other belief systems they may honour.

Nobody has to tell us anything more about the agony of defeat, the dashed hopes of a solo shot that breaks an extra-inning tie, the stranded runners, the broken-bat double-play that will live in jagged memory. We all saw the post-game tears and disappointed thousand-yard-stares of this so very likeable team, this cheerful band of brothers. A solitary Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the dugout will join, for some of us, Pafko at the wall as an enduring image of baseball's infinite capacity for pain.

Dodgers clinch World Series after 5-4 win over Blue Jays

Blue Jays mourn the World Series win that slipped away

The game, and the series, were objectively epic for all the reasons historians will record. Record-setting post-season hits, complete games, marathon extra innings, multiple future Hall of Famers on both benches, the two-decade range between two of our starting pitchers, a bench-clearing almost something – the list of superlatives goes on. We can tell ourselves the simple truth: we have witnessed one of the best baseball series in the entire span of the game.

Blue Jays reflect on the team's loss to Los Angeles in Game 7 of the World Series. It's the closest the team has come to winning the championship in more than 30 years.

The Canadian Press

But baseball is made of more than records and stats, much as they feature prominently in the narrative of the sport. Like most fans, for me it is singular images that will stay in the mind, forever cementing this magic season and series, the last one before robo-camera challenges and other threats to the crooked timber of the game's humanity.

So: Just from Game 7 I will cherish a few freeze-frames of my favourite players at their winning best, even if ultimately they lost. Bo Bichette's grim hit-man satisfaction after hitting a three-run homer, dropping his bat contemptuously like a discarded McMillan TAC-50 rifle. Guerrero's open-mouthed glee as he bolted for the dugout after turning that perfect 3-6-3 double play. Ernie Clement's joyful, surely unnecessary playground slide into home after throwing off his batting helmet in a pure dash around third, looking around like a happy 12-year-old to see who's watching.

That would be everybody. Because this was, above all else, an eminently watchable team, fun to follow, brimming with love of the game. I'm biased, I know, but they were so much more charming than the po-faced Dodgers, those dour, greedy seekers after a repeat title. The Jays had rizz, as the kids say; or, to use a more old-fashioned word, style. They were resilient, courageous, buzzy, and creative. They made things happen, sometimes by conjuring something out of nothing, as great players can.

Baseball is not an art form any more than it's religion, but these Jays played it like they were artists, every one of them, with an expansive play of imagination and collective exercise of their talents. Those different body types, my lord. (Like it or not, the super-slo-mo replay of Alejandro Kirk's awesome swing will take up semi-permanent residence in my mental theatre.) Our injury-battered heroes grimacing and limping their way to still more hits and runs. The diving catches and jaw-dropping splitters over the plate. The ups and the downs.

Cathal Kelly: Congrats on the loss, Toronto. It was a masterpiece

Now we deal with the loss of all that, the harsh, unforgiving logic of what might have been. It's a game of inches, they say, of missed chances and almost-there sallies. Consider that toe-tap at home plate, or the almost collision of Dodgers in centre field, the hanging curveball tagged for a homer – these are all the little things that make the big difference. Of course they are.

Now November continues its bleak course into winter. But we have a duty to take the joy as and where we can. We must fold this series into all the other memories of this team, this improbable season, this sport that is made of memory.

Jays fans say thank you to the Blue Jays players and they expect the team to be back in the World Series in 2026.

I attended my first Blue Jays game in 1978, driving in from Mississauga with my uncle in his old Chevy Monte Carlo, parking in somebody's yard for five dollars, and walking over to Exhibition Stadium – the Mistake by the Lake – to buy actual paper tickets from a human being at a kiosk. From that day to this, like so many other fans, baseball has sustained me.

This is a hard moment, fellow believers, but we are blessed to be here for it. And we all know that there's always next year – because that's how years work.

Officers did not find additional devices in a sweep of building, authorities say

There was an explosion early Saturday at Harvard University's medical school that appears to have been intentional, but no one was injured, authorities said.

Police at the Massachusetts Ivy League university said in a statement that an officer who responded to a fire alarm encountered two unidentified people and tried to stop them. But they ran from the campus's Goldenson building before the officer got to where the alert was triggered by an explosion, police said.

The Boston fire department determined that the explosion was intentional. Officers did not find additional devices in a sweep of the building, police said.

Police released grainy photos of two people wearing face coverings and what looked like sweatshirts.

Mud Australia opened its first Canadian outpost inside Toronto's high-end homeware store Hopson Grace in mid-October.Mud Australia

Shelley Simpson has always believed that beauty belongs in the small moments of daily life. “I make objects that I would want to live with, and use, every day,” says the founder of Mud Australia, a 31-year-old company that has quietly redefined what handmade porcelain can be.

Now, Canadians can bring that same sense of everyday elegance into their own homes.

In mid-October, Mud opened its first Canadian outpost: a 200-square-foot “shop-in-shop” inside Toronto's high-end homeware store Hopson Grace. The installation showcases a collection that has captivated design lovers and collectors around the world, from everyday aesthetes to A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, chef David Chang and French designer Philippe Starck.

All are drawn to Mud's organic, sensual pieces – handmade from Limoges porcelain imported from France – which are designed to move gracefully from oven to table.

For Hopson Grace co-founders Martha Grace McKimm and Andrea Hopson, the expansion felt inevitable. “There's a real love for Mud here in Canada,” says McKimm, who began carrying a small selection of the brand's collection in 2018. “People adore how the pieces mix and match. They like the smooth, glazed interiors, the soft matte exteriors that change over time, and the colours that interact so beautifully.”

After visiting Mud's Islington store in London, McKimm knew she wanted to bring the full experience to Toronto. “It was a visual and sensual feast,” she says. “We wanted to recreate that, to give Canadians the chance to see most of the collection and choose from the full range of colours.”

Mud's palette includes 19 signature hues with names such as Dust, Mist, Milk and Blossom (a favourite of Paltrow's). The soft neutrals, combined with more robust shades such as plum, citrus and slate, have helped the brand stand apart in a crowded tableware marketplace.

“The versatility allows people to put their own stamp on their Mud collection,” says McKimm.

Today, Mud has grown into one of Australia's most successful craft-based businesses, with 14 stores throughout Australia, London, New York, Los Angeles and now, Toronto.

The brand's Canadian debut marks the latest step in a three-decade-long journey that began when Simpson decided to try tossing clay on a potter's wheel in a friend's backyard in Sydney. She had no idea what she was doing, but she loved working with her hands. “I fell in love with the process and the way it makes me feel,” says Simpson.

“When you're making things, you release endorphins, whether you're cooking or designing a beautiful piece. Designing and making beautiful objects makes me happy. I have the resting heart rate of an elite athlete, and I'm not that at all.”

Simpson launched Mud in 1994, and started small, making minimalist bowls, plates and cups. She slowly added more pieces, each inspired by her own life. 

Simpson loves to bake, so she designed pie plates and flan dishes. She's a tea drinker, so Mud crafted teapots and cups. And when she and her husband needed lighting during a renovation, she designed a pendant light to hang over the kitchen table. Mud now offers ceiling fixtures in various shapes and sizes, as well as table lamps.

That personal touch – designing around real-life needs – defines Mud's appeal. “I'm always inspired by how people live with things,” Simpson says. “Pieces should be used, loved and reached for without thinking.”

Mud's success, she adds, also comes from restraint. “We try not to over-complicate things. A new colour, a small tweak and new product profile – that's often all it takes.” 

It's that careful curation that keeps fans loyal. And Simpson loves to meet her customers, such as a man in New York who came in after each paycheque to buy one piece. “It was always a different colour. We found out he had an arranged marriage, and his wife was coming. He told us he wanted to fill the cupboard with colour.”

Simpson says when someone tells her that Mud makes a difference in their day, it fills her up.

“What I do isn't important – doctors and nurses do important things. But if setting a table with Mud, or serving a roast in one of our dishes makes someone happy, then I know I've done something worthwhile.”

British Transport Police have ruled out terrorism in a knife attack on a train Saturday night that left 11 people wounded including two who have life-threatening injuries. 

Police said on Sunday that two men have been arrested: a 32-year-old and a 35-year-old. 

Officials were also quick to note that both men were British born and point out their ethnicity, something that has become increasingly common among British police forces to avoid online speculation. 

The younger man is Black and the older one is a British national of Caribbean descent, police said. However, they have yet to determine what motivated the attack. 

Counter terrorism police were initially called to join the investigation, but by Sunday morning those officers had been pulled out. 

“At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” said Superintendent John Loveless of the British Transport Police which is conducting the investigation. “We continue work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident. At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”

Stabbing attack on a UK train injures multiple people.

The attack happened after the train left Doncaster in northern England at around 6:30 p.m. en route to London's King's Cross station. Police were called at around 7:42 p.m. after reports of multiple stabbings after the train left Peterborough. 

Witnesses said they saw a man with a large knife running through the train stabbing people. Some passengers hid in toilets.

One passenger, Olly Foster, told the BBC that he was listening to an audiobook when a man ran past him shouting; “Run, run, there is a guy stabbing literally everyone, everything.” 

At first he thought it was a Halloween prank but saw the horror in the faces of other passengers. 

“You could kind of see in their faces they were being serious,” he said. “Everyone was really pushing behind us, really panicking.” 

Mr. Foster said he saw one man who had been stabbed in the head while protecting a young girl.

The train was re-directed to Huntingdon Station where armed officers quickly boarded the carriages and arrested the two men within eight minutes of the first emergency call.

Supt. Loveless said ten people were taken to hospital by ambulance and another person self-presented at hospital. While nine were initially believed to have life-threatening injuries, following assessment and treatment, four have been discharged and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition.

“It's a shocking incident and first and foremost, my thoughts are with the family and friends those who have been affected and those who are injured,” he said.

The attack is the latest in a series of deadly stabbings that have put the country on edge. 

Last week a 49-year-old man was killed and two others injured in a knife attack in London. An Afghan refugee who came to the U.K. in 2020 has been arrested. 

Last month, two men died and three men were injured in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester during Yom Kippur services. A Syrian-born man was shot at the scene by police. 

On Sunday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered condolences to the victims of Saturday's attack. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,” he said. 

Defence Secretary John Healey said the national threat level for a terrorist attack would remain at “substantial” and he called on people to be more vigilant.

“We're not going to be deflected from carrying out our everyday lives,” he told Sky News. “But I think it requires us all to be more vigilant, more vigilant about our electronic devices, about the risk of cyber fraud and cyber-attack and just be more vigilant for looking out for others around us.”

In a statement King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla “were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack” and added; “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones.”

Conservative Party Leader Kemi Badenoch said it was time for a national conversation about violent crime. “We cannot be a country where people are innocently going about their business and facing this level of violent crime,” she told the BBC on Sunday.

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. Russian troops repelled an attempt by Ukrainian forces to break through toward the settlement of Grishino in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and eliminated all involved personnel, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

"An attempt by militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' 425th Assault Regiment Skala to break through in an armored combat vehicle toward the settlement of Grishino in the Donetsk People's Republic has been thwarted. All militants were eliminated," the ministry said.

Russian forces are also completing the clearing of enemy forces in Gnatovka and Rog near Krasnoarmeysk, the Ministry of Defense said.

The ministry also reported that Russian troops struck energy facilities that support the operation of Ukraine's military-industrial complex, as well as sites used to store and prepare Ukrainian long-range strike drones, over the past 24 hours.

"Operational-tactical aviation, strike UAVs, missile troops, and artillery of the Russian Armed Forces delivered strikes against energy facilities supporting enterprises of Ukraine's military-industrial complex, sites for storing and preparing long-range strike unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as temporary deployment points of Ukrainian armed formations and foreign mercenaries in 141 locations," the ministry stated.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, entrenched in a long-standing brawl with Brussels and Kyiv, found an unexpected obstacle — U.S. President Donald Trump's U-turns.

Trump's expected Budapest summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — which was to be Orban's crowning achievement — has been canceled.

Adding insult to the injury, it is Orban who now feels the sting of Trump's foreign policy zigzags, facing pressure to cut off Russian energy imports and fearing the impact of new U.S. sanctions on Moscow.

Trump's sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's leading energy companies, prompted rare criticism from Orban, who said on Oct. 27 that the step went too far.

Hungary's leader is set to travel to Washington to meet with Trump on Nov. 7 to explore ways to mitigate the impact of sanctions on his country.

As Russian supplies cover most of Hungary's oil and gas demand, experts say that Orban is likely to stand his ground, especially with the election season heating up.

"Despite mounting pressure from the United States and the European Union, the Orban government appears determined to continue buying energy from Russia," Richard Demeny, an analyst at the Political Capital think tank in Budapest, told the Kyiv Independent.

When Trump won the U.S. election last year, Orban was jubilant.

Hungary's leader hoped the U.S. president — who has endorsed him and shares his conservative, anti-immigration views — would disrupt Western unity on continued support for Ukraine.

However, the latest Trump policy shift does not seem to align with Orban's expectations.

Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow while urging European nations — including Hungary — to cease importing Russian oil and gas, a strategy designed to force Moscow into peace talks.

This puts Orban into a tight spot, as his government has declared that swift decoupling from Russian imports without endangering its energy security is impossible, namely due to its geographical location.

"We can't ensure a safe supply for our country without Russian oil or gas sources," Hungary's chief diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, said in September. "For us, energy supplies are a purely physical question."

The landlocked Central European country is one of the two remaining EU members — alongside Slovakia — still buying Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline.

Unlike much of the EU, Budapest made no steps to reduce its reliance on Russian imports.

Quite the contrary, it increased the dependence on Russian crude from 64% before the full-scale invasion to 86% in 2024, the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) reported.

Hungary also signed a 15-year deal with Russia's Gazprom in 2021 to purchase natural gas mainly via the TurkStream pipeline, seeking increased volumes as the war rages on in Ukraine.

"Orban desperately tries to maintain ties with Russia, repeatedly declaring he would be the first one to return to Moscow," said Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs in Prague, underscoring Budapest's political — rather than just economic — motivations.

Experts say that shifting to alternative supplies — such as oil via Croatia and liquified natural gas via Poland — is fully feasible.

Though options exist, "it's also the question of political willingness and the financial cost of this choice," says Andrej Nosko, an energy policy expert and visiting researcher at Matej Bel University in Slovakia.

A comparable example is Czechia, another landlocked country that used the Druzhba pipeline until declaring itself free of Russian oil this April.

Orban, in turn, has shown no inclination toward abandoning Russian energy, which has driven massive profits for Hungary's MOL oil and gas company.

Cheap utilities could also offer valuable political leverage ahead of the upcoming elections. However, as Nosko notes, MOL's profits have not translated into lower fuel prices for Hungarian consumers.

While Trump could use the threat of secondary sanctions to pressure Orban, it seems Hungary is instead seeking "waivers from new U.S. sanctions and leveraging its strong ties with Trump to avoid having to diversify away from Russian supplies," Nosko told the Kyiv Independent.

According to Demeny, Orban might also use a new plan from Hungary's Energy Ministry, which suggests reducing dependence on Russian energy, to show at least some progress toward diversification and thus appease Trump.

When Trump unexpectedly announced on Oct. 16 a summit with Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks, Orban was quick to welcome the initiative.

But the hastily announced plan was scrapped mere days later, reportedly after Washington realized Moscow was not ready to concede on its maximalist demands on Ukraine.

In spite of this, Hungary's foreign minister promptly flew to meet his U.S. and Russian counterparts to assure the public that the summit is still very much on — only the date is yet to be set.

Hosting the summit — the second meeting between Trump and Putin since the former returned to office — would allow Orban to portray himself as a peacemaker, experts say.

It would bolster Orban's "position on the international stage and against his rising domestic challenger, the Tisza Party's Peter Magyar," Demeny noted.

According to Pavlicek, the Hungarian prime minister also seeks to legitimize his foreign policy stance by having other world leaders, namely Trump, share and amplify these views.

Orban's image as a leader who kept his country out of the war while ensuring energy security through "pragmatic" ties with Moscow has been a prominent feature of the Fidesz campaign.

The Hungarian strongman needs every advantage for the April 2026 vote, which presents the most serious challenge to his rule in years.

The US high court will hear arguments on whether Trump's erratic imposition of global tariffs is legally valid

Donald Trump thrives on emergencies. He cried havoc on the very first day of his second term, declaring a national emergency caused by an “invasion” of “illegal aliens” from Mexico. He has since invoked emergencies more than any president since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976.

Next Wednesday, he faces another of his own making, as the US supreme court hears oral arguments on whether his globe-shaking signature economic policy – tariffs – is legally valid.

Trump sees emergency everywhere. From the flow of illegal drugs and precursors from Mexico, China and, somehow, Canada; the international criminal court's investigation of US and Israeli officials; the US's “insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation”; the Brazilian government's tussle with social platform X and its prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro; crime in Washington DC; and the US's longstanding trade deficits.

The emergencies have served Trump to secure funding to build a border wall and give him the military responsibility for border enforcement, to allow oil drilling on federal land and keep unprofitable coal plants operating, to deploy the national guard in Washington DC. And, of course, to impose tariffs.

Now, the supreme court is scheduled to hear about some of these, in a case brought by a dozen states challenging Trump's contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from Trump's fanciful list of supposed threats to the nation.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to levy a tariff – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power. But the court should not lose sight of the broader threat to the nation's constitutional democracy: Trump's abuse of the notion of a national emergency to grant himself absolute power to govern unconstrained by anybody.

IEEPA gives the president authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Yet as the plaintiffs noted, using this “to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the US he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the president has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy”. Rather than solving national emergencies, Trump is using emergency powers to manufacture one.

Consider the trade deficit, which occupies an unusually dark place in Trump's imagination – not the result of voluntary, mutually beneficial exchanges between US and foreign businesses and consumers, but the consequence of a twisted world order in which devious foreign countries take advantage of the US.

Whatever it may be, it is neither extraordinary nor unusual. The US began running consistent trade deficits half a century ago, in 1975, bolstered by the US's low savings and the government's large budget deficits, which require pulling capital from abroad and hence boosting demand for foreign goods and services.

Unauthorized immigration, which has been growing for quite some time, also fails to meet the “extraordinary” and “unusual” bars, fueled by US employers' longstanding demand for foreign workers. And even if it did, a tariff on Mexican goods would do next to nothing to solve the problem. Hurting the Mexican economy is more likely to encourage Mexicans to seek jobs north of the border.

It is beyond me how a Canadian TV ad featuring clips of Ronald Reagan warning about the high cost of tariffs and extolling the virtues of free trade amounts to an emergency that justifies the added 10% tariff with which Trump retaliated against Ottawa last Monday. (The White House has not specified what authority the US is using to impose these tariffs.) For that matter, tariffs on legally imported goods from Mexico or Canada cannot possibly end the “emergency” created by drug cartels' illegal drug shipments to the US. Nor can they curb Americans' fentanyl addiction.

Trump's capricious deployment of tariffs is provoking a new set of problems. Inflation has remained relatively subdued – largely because importers anticipated tariffs and stocked up on imports beforehand – but prices on intermediate inputs and consumer goods are starting to rise, denting the competitiveness of American exporters. And most economists expect the inflation shock to hit soon.

Most critically, Trump's trade war is getting hot.

The financial upheaval caused by the worldwide volley of tariffs he unleashed on “Liberation Day” in April calmed down in subsequent months. And yet the world economy remains close to the edge: earlier this month Beijing signaled it was ready to pull the nuclear option in its confrontation with Washington, imposing stringent export controls on rare earths and other minerals over which it holds a near supply monopoly and which are indispensable for defense industries and the entire modern economy.

In a meeting on Thursday at the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, presidents Xi Jinping and Trump agreed to a one-year truce in which China would suspend the latest rare earth export controls and the US would relax its limits on technology exports to Chinese companies, among other concessions. But the odds are shortening that the trade war launched by Trump with no congressional input will go terribly wrong for the US economy and national security. The supreme court might take note.

The trade war is unlikely to be over even if the court bars Trump from using IEEPA. There are other statutes he can rely on. Section 201 of the Trade Act allows the president to impose tariffs or other restrictions if imports are causing or threatening “serious injury” to a domestic industry. Section 301 also allows the president to impose duties to respond to unfair trade practices by another country.

The statutes, however, come with limits. Before retaliating under 301, for instance, the US trade representative must perform an investigation, consult with the country in question and publish its proposed action and the factual findings on which it is based. If not stop the trade war, these constraints could slow it down.

Critically, by putting some limit on Trump's wanton belligerence, the supreme court could, for once, send the message that crying wolf – or “national emergency!” – does not offer blanket cover for the president to run roughshod over the checks and balances essential to liberal democracy.

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. The plan proposed by US President Donald Trump for resolving the conflict in the Gaza Strip is currently functioning as intended, Palestinian Ambassador to Russia Abdel Hafiz Nofal told TASS.

"So far, Trump's plan is proceeding normally," the diplomat noted.

The ambassador stressed the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. "There have been violations by Israel, we are aware of that. But the worst outcome would be if the war resumes," he said, stressing that the first stage must proceed properly and that the second stage will be the most difficult due to the involvement of international organizations, as well as issues related to the disarmament of Hamas.

In the context of the settlement process, the diplomat also highlighted the importance of three key principles: "ending the war, releasing the hostages, and ensuring that the Israeli army withdraws from Gaza."

On October 9, Israel and Hamas, with the mediation of Egypt, Qatar, the United States, and Turkey, agreed to implement the first stage of the peace plan presented by US President Donald Trump. Under the plan, a ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on October 10.

TORONTO, Nov 2 (Reuters) – Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was named Most Valuable Player of baseball's World Series early on Sunday after leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a repeat championship.

Yamamoto forced the decisive seventh game of the World Series with a solid outing against the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday and pitched the final 2-2/3 innings of the clinching game without allowing a single run.

The Japanese right-hander secured the win for the Dodgers when, with runners on first and third and one out, he got Alejandro Kirk to ground into a season-ending and championship-clinching double play.

“I was not sure if I could pitch tonight until I went to the bullpen,” Yamamoto said through a translator after being named MVP. “But I'm glad I was able to.”

In his 17-2/3 innings over the World Series, Yamamoto had a 1.02 ERA and 15 strikeouts while allowing 10 hits, two runs and two walks.

The Japanese right-hander, who the Dodgers signed for 12 years and $325 million in December 2023, is also the first pitcher with three wins in a World Series since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2001.

“I did everything I was supposed to do, and I'm so happy that I was able to win this with these teammates,” said Yamamoto.

SEOUL, November 2. /TASS/. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the command of the 11th Corps of the Korean People's Army, which is considered its elite unit, on November 1, the Korean Central News Agency reported.

The corps belongs to the special forces. Kim observed the training of special forces soldiers, "who fully demonstrated their incomparable courage and spirit," and took a photo with the servicemen. "He expressed great satisfaction with the full readiness of our armed forces to wage war," the news agency said.

The soldiers greeted the head of state with the utmost respect, the report noted. Kim Jong Un emphasized that the mass heroism and incomparable fighting spirit of the corps' soldiers set an example for the entire Korean People's Army. The North Korean leader visited the office where operational plans are drawn up and evaluated. "He listened to the commander's report on the plans for this large unit's military operations in various circumstances," the news agency noted.

Kim Jong Un also emphasized that ideology is the main factor in the outcome of war and battle. "Therefore, our party has high hopes for the active work of political workers," the Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying. During his visit, he outlined a strategic course and important tasks for strengthening and developing special forces.

            A fire at a general store in northern Mexico has killed at least 23 people, the state governor said Saturday.
    


            The blaze happened at an outlet of the Waldo's chain in the city of Hermosillo, capital of Sonora state, Governor Alfonso Durazo said in an online video address.
    


            “So far, there are reports of 23 people dead and 11 injured who are being treated at different hospitals in the city. Unfortunately, among the victims are minors,” he said. The tragedy “has left a deep sadness among all the people of Sonora,” he added.
    


            Twelve women, five men, four boys, and two girls were among those killed, reported local radio station Uniradio Sonora, citing Carlos Freaner, president of the Mexican Red Cross.
    


            CNN has contacted both the city and state governments for comment.
    


            Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her “heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who died in the fire.”
    


            “I instructed the Secretary of the Interior, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, to send a support team to assist the families and the injured,” she said.
    


            The Sonora Public Security Secretariat said on X that the fire was not caused by an arson attack or other intentional act of violence, without giving more details about the cause.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.

“I feel like I'm living in scary times. It's not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn't too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74.

Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.

With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.

The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

“The impact, even if it's temporary, on many of the nation's poor families is going to be profound if we don't solve this problem,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.

“These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can't point to a similar time in recent history where we've had this.” 

LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.

States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. 

While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. 

Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. 

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.

Minnesota's energy assistance program is processing applications but the state's Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients' heating bills until the shutdown ends.

“As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.

Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. 

“The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government.

“Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration's earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program.

Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states' program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available.

“Once you've fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said.

Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.

Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.

“If you're a heating oil dealer, we can't tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you'll get your money back,'” Wolfe said.

Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago.

“I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.”

He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.

Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year.

“I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said.

ESPN broadcasters Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit poked fun at Oklahoma Sooners kicker Tate Sandell's shorts during the team's win against the Tennessee Volunteers.

Sandell came into the game to attempt a 51-yard field goal in the second quarter and his gameday attire became the topic of conversation. Fowler said the short shorts were "no longer frowned upon in the sport." Herbstreit replied, "It is for me."

"That should be a penalty. Just dressing like that should be a penalty," Herbstreit added. "What the hell is it? Wearing shorts out there?"

Sandell nailed the field goal to give Oklahoma a 13-10 lead with 1:09 left in the first half.

"Got his Daisy Dukes on and puts it right down the middle again," Herbstreit said.

Short shorts or not, Sandell was money the entire night. He was 4-for-4 on field goal attempts, with a 55-yarder being his longest of the night. He also made all three of his extra-point attempts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump sees tariffs — or the threat of them — as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.

He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.

He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil's case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.

This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.

Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.

He has said it would be a “disaster” for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place. Trump has suggested he may take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person.




The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.

Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs — a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.

The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related — and unrelated -- to trade.

“The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.”

Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration.

“We do have backup plans,” Leavitt said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But ultimately…we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what's right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.”

Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.

There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.

Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.

“Presidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Lipsky said.

In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. “All of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,” he said.

For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump's support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs.

The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. But Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič argued the settlement was “not only about the trade. It's about security. It's about Ukraine.”

Trump has been able “to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals — not just trade deals — but better deals overall than he might otherwise,” Lipsky said. “On the other hand, you would say there's probably some backlash.”

Trump's tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America's friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.

There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up.

Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices. 

“There's literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,” said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,

“The use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like — just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,” said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.

But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a “decent chance” the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president “broad, flexible emergency powers.”

The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump's wide-ranging use of executive powers.

If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities. 

The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.

“It certainly doesn't take tariffs off the table,” she said. “It just makes them a little bit slower.”

A new video advertisement from pro-Israel group Canary Mission is calling out the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) for scheming to take over the Democratic Party from within. (CREDIT: Canary Mission)

After an antisemitism watchdog posted a new video warning about socialist efforts to take over the Democratic Party from within, socialist leaders from across the country embraced the video and its message, appearing unafraid of such accusations. 

The Canary Mission's advertisement included recorded remarks from various leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) describing their opposition to, and in some cases "hatred" of the Democratic Party, which one speaker says must be torn down. The video also shared remarks from DSA leaders describing how the Democratic Party, which one of the socialist speakers in the video referred to as "toxic," can be used as a "tool" to push forward their aims of destroying the current capitalist society we live in.

At the center of the ad was something Canary Mission referred to as the "cuckoo analogy."

"In nature, the cuckoo survives by trickery. It lays its egg in another bird's nest. The unsuspecting parents raise the impostor as their own until the cuckoo grows strong enough to push the true chicks out," the video's narrator explains. "The DSA is the cuckoo inside the Democratic Party."

But the analogy, which pointed to candidates like self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani, did not appear to bother the socialists it was targeting. Rather, they applauded the video advertisement as a great recruitment tool to get more people to join their ranks.

"New DSA recruitment ad for communists just dropped," joked Nicolás Vargas in response to the video. Vargas has been affiliated with the Central Brooklyn branch of the DSA, according to a 2022 DSA national convention resolution on COVID protections. 

"Are you trying to make young people find the DSA more cool?" quipped Marxist-socialist blogger C. Derrick Varn.

"New recruitment ad unlocked," joked Giovanetta Marangoz, co-chair of the New York City Young Democratic Socialists of America. 

Other socialist activists were a little more direct in their view that the Democratic Party must be extinguished.  

"My biggest gripe is the idea that we're being deceptive," Allan Frasheri, an at-large delegate to the 2023 DSA Convention who spent time as a co-chair of the University of Florida's DSA chapter, said in response to the video. "DSA is loud and proud: we are fighting for a worker's party. Only a party of, by and for working people can bring about a better world. The Democratic Party is ultimately one for the billionaires."

"This is the best DSA ad I've ever seen," added DSA organizer Miko Ludoviko. "The DSA is an anti-capitalist organization with the long-term goal of taking state power. The Democratic Party is a tool we use for local elections, but it remains an enemy of the working class."

Part of Canary Mission's video focused on New York City's Mamdani, who is running for New York City mayor on the Democratic Party's ticket. He beat out former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic Party primary earlier this year to be the party's candidate. Cuomo is now running as an Independent.  

Mamdani, who is a member of DSA's NYC chapter, brought several DSA members on stage during a "New York Is Not For Sale" rally last week. He was also a keynote speaker at the group's national convention in 2023 while serving as a New York state representative.

DSA has admitted to closely collaborating with Mamdani's campaign, including regularly holding meetings with his team.

"With Zohran, we're in basically the best possible position to seize state power that we can be in because, you know, we're like this," Goulden said during an August DSA panel, indicating with his fingers that the campaign and organization are very close. Goulden went on to suggest that "one of the things that made Zohran really successful with his policy rollouts is specifically relying on DSA."

"We wrote the platform with him. The team was so happy to work with us on this," he explained. "What we explicitly wanted to do was use the power of New York City to provide free gender-affirming care – and I say free in case insurance companies decide to boot us off – free gender-affirming care, not just to people in New York City, but across the country."

In addition to the responses to Canary Mission's new video, other messaging materials the pro-Israel group has put out, such as a graphic slamming socialists for attempting to "weaken and ultimately dismantle" the United States, have similarly been met with praise by DSA socialists. 

For example, in response to a Canary Mission graphic exposing DSA's Red Star Caucus for their stated goal of striving to "weaken and ultimately dismantle US empire," a user on X, who describes themselves as "DSA's favorite Maoist," remarked that the slogan Canary Mission was calling out "needs to be the line of the DSA as a whole."

"I will use every tool at my disposal to make it so," they added.

"That's right," another X user with the handle "centristmarxist" said in response to a second graphic slamming DSA's Marxist Unity Group for their stated goal. "With every tool available to us, we must erode the political, cultural, and physical hegemony of the U.S. police state."

Fox News Digital reached out to the DSA for comment, but did not receive a response.

New York Post columnist Douglas Murray assesses the state of Britain's government, economy and society on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.'

U.K. police offered new details about victims and suspects following Saturday night's stabbing spree aboard a train in Huntigdon, Cambridgeshire.

Multiple patients remain in life-threatening condition after the stabbing, which left at least 11 people wounded. Police say the suspects were "born in the U.K.," and remain in custody as of Sunday morning.

"This is a shocking incident and my thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families," British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said in a statement.

Loveless described the two suspects as, "32-year-old man, a black British national, and a 35-year-old man, a British national of Caribbean descent." They were both arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, he said.

Loveless added that nine people were reported initially to have life-threatening injuries, but most have since recovered.

"Following assessment and treatment, four have been discharged and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition," Loveless said.

"We declared a major incident yesterday and Counter Terrorism Policing were initially supporting our investigation, however, at this stage there is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident. This is a British Transport Police investigation. We continue work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident. At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident," he added.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer expressed his sympathy regarding the stabbing on X.

"The appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning," he wrote. "My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police."

The local football club also sent thoughts and prayers after the attack.

"The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Huntingdon Town FC tonight are with the victims and their families from this evening's local incident," the club wrote on X around 11 p.m. local time Saturday. "We send our thanks and thoughts to colleagues in the police, ambulance and other agencies supporting this that are also affected."

Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin tells Fox News Digital that the possibility of far left and moderates winning big on Election Day shows "the great breadth of our party."

Zohran Mamdani appears to be on the verge of becoming the next mayor of the nation's most populous city.

And a victory by the 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from New York City would capsulize the rise of the far left in the Democratic Party.

While plenty of Democrats are fearful of the political consequences and how it would fuel Republican efforts to make a Mayor Mamdani the face of a Democratic Party aiming to usher in socialism, Ken Martin isn't concerned.

"What it shows is the great breadth of our party," the chair of the Democratic National Committee said in a one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital this week in Philadelphia as he crisscrossed the 2025 campaign trail.

FIVE KEY RACES TO WATCH IN NEXT WEEK'S ELECTIONS

A likely Mamdani win in New York City, where he holds a double-digit lead in the polls, may be coupled with potential victories by moderate Democrats Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia in the only two states this year to hold gubernatorial elections.

"We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have progressives and we have leftists. And I've always said that you win elections through addition, not subtraction. You win by bringing people into your coalition and growing your party," Martin touted.

'DEMOCRATS ARE NERVOUS' ABOUT POTENTIAL ZOHRAN MAMDANI VICTORY, NEW REPORT WARNS

Martin acknowledged that Democrats "don't agree on everything. There's a lot of different ideas on how to accomplish our goals, but we're unified around those goals. We're unified around making sure that people's lives are more affordable and that we can create an economy that works for everyone in this country. We're unified in stopping Donald Trump in his authoritarian margin, his shredding of our Constitution."

As Democrats work to escape the political wilderness after last year's stunning election setbacks, when the party lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, Republicans portray their rivals as a leaderless party being held hostage by the far left.

But Martin spotlighted his party's diversity, saying, "Whether you're a far-left Democrat or a conservative Democrat, or anything in between, everyone's welcome into this big tent party of ours."

The Republican National Committee took issue with the Democrats' big tent.

"Ken Martin's so-called ‘big tent' Party includes communists, antisemites, and illegal aliens, while apparently the only people who aren't welcome are hardworking American families. The inmates are now running the asylum in the Democrat Party, which is why the DNC is broke and proudly backing a communist for mayor of New York City," RNC national press secretary Kiersten Pels claimed in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Martin, pointing to the Republican Party, argued that they "basically have one ideology and do not allow for any dissent."

Martin was interviewed a few days after a new center-left group named "Welcome," in their inaugural report, argued that left-leaning ideas and rhetoric have badly weakened the Democratic Party. And the group urged Democrats to jettison some of the party's progressive language about race and LGBTQ issues. The news was first reported by Semafor.

Asked for his take, Martin said he had yet to read the report, but he did emphasize that "the Democratic Party can walk and chew gum at the same time."

"We can both focus on a core economic message that gives people in this country a sense that we're going to fight for their economic future, that they'll have an opportunity to get ahead... and also, at the same time, stand up and fight for our values. Make sure that no one gets left behind. Make sure that... people who are being harassed or bullied or pushed out of the conversation are protected."

"We are the Democratic Party. We've fought for the working class and the poor, and we've always fought against bigotry and discrimination, and we'll continue to do both," he pledged.

            Britain was shocked by a mass stabbing attack on a train Saturday evening, targeting passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London in an incident Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described as “deeply concerning.”
    


            Nine people were left with life-threatening injuries, two of whom were still fighting for their lives in hospital on Sunday, as the British Transport Police declared a “major incident.”
    


            Two suspected attackers were detained within minutes of police receiving their first emergency call, as the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon station.
    


            Authorities have now confirmed they are two British-born males in their 30s. Police are working to determine a motive but say there is no evidence to suggest the attack is terror-related.
    


            Here's what we know about the stabbing attack.
    


            The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6.25 p.m. local time on Saturday evening, bound for London.
    


            The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.
    


            Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.
    


            After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”
    


            People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train's toilets, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.
    


            Police received their first emergency call at approximately 7.42 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within eight minutes of the first emergency call, the two suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned, emergency stop at Huntingdon station.
    


            Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralise any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported.
    


            One eyewitness, who gave his name as Gavin, described one of the suspects being struck down by a police Taser. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down'… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.
    


            The trauma-stricken train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.
    


            A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. 10 people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.
    


            As of Sunday morning, two people remained fighting for their lives, British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters.
    


            Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages.
    


            Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.
    


            Two suspects were arrested on Saturday evening, on suspicion of attempted murder. In an update on Sunday, police revealed both are British nationals in their 30s.
    


            One is a 32-year-old, Black British national, while the other is a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, according to Superintendent Loveless.
    


            Both were born in the UK, he added. They remained in separate police stations for questioning on Sunday morning.
    


            Police are still working to establish a motive, but say there is no indication it was terror-related. “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” Loveless said. “At this stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.”
    


            British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview.
    


            BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding it.
    


            The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.
    


            Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.
    


            In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offences were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.
    


            British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday's attack and offered their condolences to victims.
    


            “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X.
    


            Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”
    


            In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”
    


            “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.
    


            “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”
    


            The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK's busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  This account of the allegations against Los Angeles hotelier Steve Farzam is based on official statements, court documents, investigation reports, interviews with law enforcement officials and people who encountered him over the years, his social media posts and other reporting from CNN.



            At an extravagant reception, hotelier Steve Farzam seemed to literally plunge into marriage, appearing to dive from a helicopter in a rainbow parachute onto the grounds of a luxury hotel north of Beverly Hills.
    


            The parachutist descended from an overcast sky at the lavish 2017 wedding reception, as seen in videos posted online. “Groom or 007?” Farzam wrote in a YouTube description.
    


            It was staged: A stuntman jumped from the helicopter and landed near the crowd amid a downpour of rose pedals. He was surrounded by a ground crew that included Farzam, who slipped out of a bodysuit and switched places with the stuntman. In a white tux, the groom emerged to rousing applause, according to videographer Moziko Wind.
    


            “It was like a magician,” said Wind, who produced the movie-like wedding video. “He claimed that he jumped. People with money, they really want to impress their guests.”
    


            Well-known in the civic circles of the affluent Westside of Los Angeles, Farzam is the son of a longtime hotel owner and former doctor who emigrated from Iran. He's a state certified and licensed paramedic with an associate degree in emergency medical technology; a self-proclaimed do-gooder whose penchant for protecting and serving has occasionally run afoul of the law.
    


            Though often appearing stylish and refined, with an air of unshakable confidence, like a real-life James Bond, Farzam seemed to come undone in recent years.
    


            In January, he was seen in a restricted emergency zone around the Palisades Fire — fully decked out in firefighter turnout gear. By July, he was facing nearly two dozen felony charges, including impersonating a firefighter and assaulting a first responder.
    


            He was chief operating officer of an eco-friendly boutique hotel owned and operated by his family across from the storied Santa Monica pier. On his websites and social media posts, he has portrayed himself for years as a beneficent giver, a man of action: boasting about his paramedic experience, medical helicopter missions in Arizona and volunteer work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
    


            On social media he praised emergency medical crews and US Border Patrol officers; posted a photo of President Donald Trump in a MAGA cap with the message, “God bless America and our brave patriots who keep us safe;” and urged people to support the tough-on-crime policies of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, whose office is now trying to put him behind bars.
    


            Farzam's posts shared a common theme: He lauded the courage of first responders, extolled those who serve and safeguard communities and promoted civic engagement and small acts of heroism.
    


            In a blue paramedic uniform, Farzam appeared on “The Tyra Banks Show,” which usually featured chats with Hollywood stars and presidential hopefuls. Farzam offered tips about home survival kits and accident safety, according to a YouTube video. He smiled during his introduction, seeming to revel in applause.
    


            “I have learned over the years that people work for money but they die for admiration and respect,” Farzam, in 2017, told VoyageLA, a digital publication that claims to highlight “LA's most inspiring stories.”
    


            In the waning days of the pandemic, appreciation and recognition came from Los Angeles city and county officials, who, according to posts on Farzam's Instagram, commended Farzam for operating Covid testing centers and hailed him as a leader and role model.
    


            Despite the accolades and online swagger, the Seattle-born son of Jewish Iranian immigrants kept getting into trouble. In the months and years before his July 16 arrest, his behavior grew increasingly erratic, court documents show.
    


            He now stands accused of perpetrating a more than 25-year con that spiraled into a cinematic tale of intrigue, with potentially dire consequences: If convicted, Farzam faces up to 23 years and 10 months in prison.
    


            An FBI and Homeland Security agent, a firefighter, arson investigator and police officer, Farzam has been them all over the years – well, he's appeared to wear each of those hats. In 2011, Beverly Hills police reported catching Farzam and a woman, dressed as security personnel, trying to sneak into the Golden Globe Awards. He told officers they had worked security the previous night and returned to “see all the movie stars,” according to an investigation report. He even created a fictitious fire company, according to prosecutors – an accusation his lawyer has pushed back on.
    


            Who is the real Steve Farzam?
    


            He's no public servant but a great pretender, a serial law enforcement and first responder wannabe, according to court records, official statements and interviews with people who have encountered him over the years. His misconduct, from posing as an arson investigator during the worst wildfires in Los Angeles history to aiming lasers at the cockpits of commercial and law enforcement aircraft, repeatedly put lives at risk, according to prosecutors.
    


            “This is a continuous con to pretend to be a first responder for benefits,” Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Ayvazian, who is prosecuting the case, said at a preliminary hearing last month.
    


            “Whatever those benefits are, financial or whether those benefits are in Mr. Farzam's head, that is not relevant.”
    


            “If Mr. Farzam was in his backyard playing with his fire trucks and his guns with his friends, we wouldn't be here. The reason why we're here is because he put himself out in the community, and he represented himself as a firefighter. He represented himself as a law enforcement officer,” the prosecutor said.
    


            Investigators have been unable to identify a motive in what Ayvazian called “a very strange case.”
    


            “If you look at the entire context of what we've presented in this case … it's a very troubling pattern,” he said of Farzam's behavior.
    


            CNN has sought comment from Farzam's wife and two brothers. One of his attorneys, Alan Jackson, declined to comment on the record. Farzam, 47, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
    


            Jackson, at the preliminary hearing, argued prosecutors failed to produce evidence to support the charges, particularly “zero” proof the targeted aircraft “were flashed by a laser.” About Farzam's presence at a restricted zone during the Palisades Fire, Jackson insisted his client was “there to help.”
    


            “Not one shred of evidence suggests that my client tried to benefit monetarily or benefit in any other way, at the detriment of the community or the government, to falsify his identity as a fireman. He was there to help. He's not charged with any violent crime whatsoever,” Jackson said.
    


            In a motion in support of no bail filed one day before the enigmatic hotelier's mid-July arrest, Ayvazian wrote Farzam “has a long and persistent history involving the impersonation of law enforcement and emergency personnel, fraudulent access to government systems, and unlawful firearm possession.”
    


            Farzam was 21 at the time of his earliest known criminal involvement, in 1999, when he was arrested for impersonating a police officer and committing perjury, according to prosecutors. The charges were dismissed under a plea agreement, court documents show. He pleaded guilty to providing false information on Department of Motor Vehicles documents and giving unlawful registration.
    


            “His conduct spans more than two decades, demonstrating a calculated disregard for the law and a sustained pattern of deception,” according to the motion for no bail in the current case.
    


            Farzam was held without bail until October 24, when a judge set bail at $3 million, according to the district attorney's office. After his release, he was placed on house arrest at an in-patient mental health facility and ordered to wear an ankle monitor. He's not permitted to possess firearms, explosive devices, pyrotechnics, lasers or flashlights. Farzam also was ordered not to contact witnesses in the case. His next court appearance is slated for November 20.
    


            “Where does he stop?” asked James Hirt, a retired special agent supervisor for the California Department of Justice, who investigated Farzam in a major 2014 case involving 60 felony counts. He pleaded guilty to three felonies in that case and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years of probation. Eventually the convictions were reduced to misdemeanors and expunged.
    


            “I'm sure all we've ever done is scratch the surface of his nonsense. And that's probably why he keeps doing it.”
    


            A thick blanket of smoke and ash rolled over the southern California horizon that mid-January day during the deadly Palisades Fire. The air was hazy and acrid.
    


            Farzam paid a visit to a restricted evacuation zone, wearing full firefighting gear over his 6-foot, 200-pound frame.
    


            In a white Ford Expedition with exempt plates and red emergency lights, Farzam stopped at a checkpoint manned by the National Guard on January 17 and presented a document showing the vehicle was registered to the fictitious Santa Muerte Fire Department, prosecutors said. That's Spanish for Saint Death, a scythe-wielding skeleton folk saint popular in Latin America as a guardian of outcasts. He said he was an arson investigator, according to prosecutors. After showing his driver's license, the soldiers allowed him in the restricted zone, according to the no bail motion, which didn't indicate what he did or how long he was there.
    


            “God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy,” Farzam wrote on X the next day, with video of crackling, wind-swept flames swallowing up a luxury home.
    

God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy. We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes. 🙏 @LACOFD @LAFD @SantaMonicaFire @CAL_FIRE @Cal_OES @MRCAParks… pic.twitter.com/Whc0QKr4VV


            “We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes.”
    


            On January 16, prosecutors said, Farzam drove to a checkpoint at the evacuation zone in a vehicle with state exempt plates. He allegedly told a Los Angeles Port Police officer he was with the LA Fire Department. He was allowed to remain in the restricted zone. 



            On March 25, prosecutors said, Farzam was seen on LAPD surveillance footage driving to a National Guard checkpoint at Sunset Boulevard and Amalfi Drive. He identified himself as a security guard. He presented a guard card and gun permit to gain access to the restricted zone.
    


            Santa Muerte is a Mexican folk religion that mixes traditional aspects of Catholicism and ancient Aztec beliefs. The patron saint of death is venerated as a spiritual benefactor of a growing number of marginalized Mexicans and Central Americans who claim they feel unprotected by the state and cast aside by the Catholic Church.
    


            While lighting candles of various colors is part of its veneration, Saint Death has nothing to do with fires or extinguishing them.
    


            Farzam's nonexistent fire department is listed online and in state records as being on North Imperial Avenue in El Centro, a sweltering desert community about 120 miles east of San Diego. Its motto is, “Serving with Courage, Integrity and Professionalism,” according to a website, which includes a volunteer form. The address is actually a UPS Store in a strip mall that also houses a hair salon and spa and a Mexican seafood restaurant.
    


            The creation of the fake agency is “central” to Farzam's scheme, according to prosecutors, who said he “assumed false authority as a high-ranking fire official.” The fabricated role, they say, was exploited to “obtain government-issued exempt license plates, gain unlawful access to restricted emergency zones” and acquire new firearms reserved for peace officers.
    


            The scheme has put Farzam “at the center of a far-reaching, multi-agency criminal investigation involving a sustained pattern of fraud, impersonation of public officials, unlawful acquisition of firearms, and repeated endangerment of public safety,” according to the no bail motion.
    


            The 164-room glass-and-steel, beachfront Shore Hotel – which the Farzam family opened in 2011 – served, according to prosecutors, as “base of operations for several fraudulent activities, including IP addresses linked to false submissions and vehicle registration.”
    


            Farzam's brother Jon, CEO of Shore Hotel, and the hotel's public relations firm have not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            The fictitious fire department has the same initials as the legitimate Santa Monica Fire Department – near where the Shore Hotel is located, prosecutors said. The volunteer fire department was registered as a nonprofit in California in July 2022, according to state records, which show a representative of the Shore Hotel, with its Santa Monica address, as its registered agent.
    


            Farzam's attorney Jackson argued the Santa Muerte Fire Department is a nonprofit legitimately registered with the state and said prosecutors have not established “it was a false firefighter department, and it was just literally made up.”
    


            Ayvazian, the prosecutor, told the court: “We would have to assume that Mr. Farzam is a very low IQ person who is incredibly gullible to believe that he did not know” this is not a “legitimate fire department.”
    


            On September 15, 2022, Farzam went to the Santa Monica office of the California Department of Motor Vehicles and submitted forms to turn over ownership of a Hummer to the fictitious fire agency, according to court documents. He identified himself as “Dep. Chief.”
    


            In all, at least 10 vehicles were “fraudulently registered” under the Santa Muerte name, court records said.
    


            Israel Gonzalez, a special agent for the California Department of Justice, testified at the preliminary hearing that the name of the fire department on DMV documents drew his attention.
    


            “Are you a native Spanish speaker?” asked the prosecutor.
    


            “I am.”
    


            “What does ‘Santa Muerte' mean?”
    


            “The literal definition is Saint of Death.”
    


            The so-called Saint of Death fire company helped Farzam secure guns, prosectors said.
    


            The no bail motion said from February 2023 to January 2024, Farzam posed as a law enforcement officer to unlawfully obtain nine firearms from a licensed dealer. He falsely claimed to be a peace officer with the Santa Muerte Fire Department, arriving at a store in uniform with patches from the fake agency – and a holstered handgun, according to testimony by a Bureau of Firearms special agent.
    


            He drove exempt vehicles and presented forged peace officer IDs and a false peace officer standards and training certificate. The falsified credentials “allowed him to bypass the mandatory Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) and to purchase handguns not listed on California's Roster of Certified Handguns.”
    


            In one haul, prosecutors said, he drove away with a .22 caliber handgun, a 9mm handgun, a couple of rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun.
    


            Gun store employees recalled Farzam on two occasions pulling out of the parking lot – red and white lights flashing, sirens blaring – as if responding to an emergency call, court documents show.
    


            “He's a 47-year-old man. He's not a child, and he's clearly able to fill out forms,” Ayvazian said of the defendant at the preliminary hearing. “He's not an ignorant fool. He is someone who is doing this as a pattern of conduct, and he is manipulating the different bureaucracies in the state of California to his benefit.”
    


            “Santa Muerte does not exist. It is not an unincorporated city. It's not an incorporated city.”
    


            And there were the bizarre incidents that prosecutors described as “the most dangerous aspect” of his current criminal case.
    


            Farzam is accused of “a series of blue laser strikes directed at commercial, recreational and law enforcement aircraft” near his Brentwood home earlier this year, according to court documents. The FBI has warned laser strikes can potentially disorient or temporarily blind pilots and contribute to a crash.
    


            No aircraft has ever been reported to have crashed because of a laser strike. Still, Farzam's alleged strikes account for the more serious charges against him: multiple felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and assault upon a peace office or firefighter.
    


            On the night of February 21, several aircraft – including a news helicopter, a California Highway Patrol helicopter and three commercial airliners descending into Los Angeles International Airport – reported “being struck by a high-intensity blue laser beam,” according to court documents.
    


            “It was a really frightening night, because that light was so powerful and so bright, it really could've gotten us hurt,” CNN affiliate KABC reporter Chris Christi told the station after Farzam's arrest.
    


            The helicopter was piloted by Morrie Zager. A camera operator also was on board. Christi told the station a “particularly bright blue light” filled the cockpit. It reflected off the windshield and “lit up the entire cockpit.”
    


            “The laser directly struck Zager and (Christi) in the eyes, causing intense pain and temporary blindness, forcing evasive maneuvers,” according to the motion in support of no bail. The helicopter followed and recorded a black SUV. Detectives later identified Farzam as the man seen on news footage stepping out of the vehicle during the attack.
    


            At the preliminary hearing, Zager compared the laser strike in his eye to “a whack in the back of the head with a baseball bat.”
    


            That same night, three commercial airline pilots reported being targeted with blue laser light on the approach to LAX – which led to additional criminal charges against Farzam.
    


            On April 19, prosecutors said, Farzam allegedly pointed a blue laser at an LAPD helicopter.
    


            Jackson, Farzam's high-profile veteran criminal defense attorney, noted a defense expert's testimony that an analysis of video and photos of one strike showed “the diffusion of that light source is inconsistent with the laser.”
    


            “Everything rises and falls on whether or not it was a laser, and they simply failed to produce that information,” Jackson said of the prosecution witnesses.
    


            “If Mr. Farzam was the person who was shooting the item,” Jackson added, “it wasn't a laser.”
    


            A flashlight with blue light was found in Farzam's possession, Jackson said. “They have to have something that says there was a laser and they don't.” The attorney acknowledged investigators found laser pointers in Farzam's home, but none were blue.
    


            Still harder to prove, Jackson said, are the counts of assault on a peace officer stemming from the laser strikes, arguing that Farzam would not or could not have known what kind of aircraft was flying at the time. “At night, against a black sky, in pitch black darkness, you cannot tell the difference between a law enforcement aircraft and a civilian aircraft,” he said. “They have the exact same silhouette.”
    


            “This has been overcharged as assault with a deadly weapon,” Jackson said of the complaint, adding there is “no way” a laser pointer “could be considered a dangerous or deadly weapon.”
    


            Last September, Farzam was at the center of what prosecutors called “a disturbing encounter” at a home in Beverly Hills.
    


            A charge of impersonating a police investigator stems from the incident on September 21, 2024. In a black Ford Explorer registered with the Santa Muerte Fire Department, Farzam pulled up to a driveway and blocked the sidewalk, according to court documents. He wore a tactical jacket emblazoned with the word “INVESTIGATOR.” At the front door, carrying a holstered firearm, he “aggressively demanded” to speak with the homeowner without identifying what agency he represented, according to the no bail motion.
    


            He later told police he was “acting as a private investigator looking into a fight involving the homeowner's son,” according to court documents. Surveillance video showed “Farzam threatening to arrest the boy without identifying himself or citing any legal basis for doing so.”
    


            Farzam, still wearing the tactical jacket and carrying a 9mm handgun, was later pulled over by police in Beverly Hills. The weapon was registered to an acquaintance, who told police he had left the firearm in the vehicle when he borrowed it from Farzam, according to court documents. The acquaintance expressed anger that Farzam had used the weapon. The Ford Explorer was “fraudulently registered” to the fictitious Santa Muerte Fire Department by someone named “Chief Ed Jackson,” the court documents said.
    


            Farzam told police he was conducting a transaction involving the legal transfer of a firearm at the time, according to the no bail document.
    


            During the preliminary court hearing, Farzam's attorney acknowledged a witness in a video noted Farzam “said something about an arrest” during the incident, but “there was no allegation whatsoever that my client was engaged in any kind of self-benefit or violence.”
    


            Farzam is the son of a doctor-turned-hotelier who emigrated from Iran with his wife and their three children, according to an obituary of the eldest Farzam, who died last year. The couple later had two other children. The family settled for a time in Seattle, where the couple purchased their first motel. They later moved to Los Angeles, where the Farzams owned and operated three motels in the 1980s and 1990s – including two that once stood on the site of the Shore Hotel.
    


            Farzam has a bachelor's degree in sociology from California State University, Northridge, and a certificate and associate degree in emergency medical technology/paramedic from Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California.
    


            Farzam later taught at the college. To meet teaching credentials at Southwestern, he submitted an American Heart Association Healthcare Provider card that was “invalid and dishonestly obtained,” the California Emergency Medical Services Authority said in a 2009 letter denying his application for licensing. A college spokesperson confirmed Farzam was an adjunct professor for about a year, beginning in August 2007, but declined to discuss personnel matters.
    


            In the late 1990s, Farzam was a police cadet at the Santa Barbara Police Department. Retired Santa Barbara Officer Charles McChesney, who was on the job when Farzam was training, still remembers him.
    


            One summer night in 1999, McChesney was conducting a traffic stop when a Crown Victoria – the sedan that dominated police fleets for decades – with exempt plates made a sudden U-turn and pulled up behind his patrol car. Farzam was at the wheel.
    


            “He backed me up on a traffic stop. I asked him what he was doing and he gave me a story and handed me a business card saying he had a contract with a state agency to provide some kind of security services,” McChesney told CNN. “I thought, ‘That's kind of weird,' but I let that go.”
    


            Later, McChesney said, he responded to a report of a public disturbance at a downtown apartment complex and found Farzam “in the middle of it.” He said Farzam showed up at the scene and “just made it worse.” At the time Farzam was no longer a cadet or associated with the local police department.
    


            The officer ended up seizing the exempt plates on Farzam's car, McChesney said. He recalled Farzam was “mad” that McChesney had “started looking into him.”
    


            “He was kind of borderline stalking me, and he had sent me one or two mysterious, threatening emails. Some kind of watch-your-back type of thing. And that's when detectives got involved,” he said.
    


            “He does this stupid stuff that seems harmless, right. But then it also got a little bit of a menacing overtone.”
    


            In July 1999, Santa Barbara police learned Farzam's car was registered to “State of California Metro Police Enforcement” and he was identified as an officer, according to the state Emergency Medical Services Authority. The discovery was one of multiple reasons the authorities gave for denying Farzam's paramedic license in 2008. His vehicle had exempt plates, flashing lights, a radio scanner, spotlights, and other police equipment. The denial letter said Farzam was convicted of making a false statement to the DMV and a registration violation.
    


            Lee Carter, a retired deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, said details of the case he prosecuted are fuzzy after so many years but recalled Farzam was arrested in 1999 on charges of impersonating a police officer and other charges.
    


            “I remember he showed up at a couple of calls all decked out, and there was some circumstantial evidence he drove around in a car outfitted with police lights,” Carter told CNN.
    


            “It worries me that the accusations continue after this length of time. We were the first and he was young. We thought, ‘He's just a young kid making bad mistakes.' Now, three decades later, you say, maybe there's something else going on.”
    


            In 2002, court records show, the LAPD arrested Farzam for “impersonating a firefighter and falsely reporting an emergency.” In a case involving 19 criminal counts, Farzam was convicted of five misdemeanors in 2003. He was sentenced to 182 days in jail and placed on probation, according to prosecutors.
    


            He reportedly identified himself as an off-duty officer and county paramedic. An LAPD investigation “revealed a pattern of behavior consistent with a continual desire to identify yourself as either a police officer, firefighter or any other officious position related to such professions,” the California Emergency Medical Service Authority said in a letter to Farzam.
    


            He was again arrested by the LAPD in 2004 for falsely reporting an emergency. Farzam pleaded guilty to two of six counts and got probation, according to court records.
    


            Then, in 2014, Farzam became embroiled in what prosecutors called the “most significant prior case” against him: a 60-count complaint filed by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris. The case was part of a state Department of Justice investigation.
    


            Prosecutors accused Farzam of using an alias to fraudulently access the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, a vast computer network that connects state public safety agencies to databases for criminal histories, vehicle and driver records and other sensitive information.
    


            Farzam “falsely impersonated an FBI Special Agent during a phone call to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office to influence a driving under the influence prosecution,” according to the no bail motion.
    


            “Representing himself as the real special agent, Farzam falsely claimed the defendant was a key member of a covert federal task force. He spoke directly to a supervising deputy city attorney, who requested official FBI confirmation.”
    


            The source of the information was an informant, a former friend and associate of Farzam who turned on him, according to state DOJ investigation reports obtained by CNN. On May 7, 2014, the informant made an undercover purchase of an assault rifle from Farzam at the hotelier's Brentwood home, the investigation reports show. He recorded the encounter. Farzam allegedly test-fired the rifle into the lawn in his backyard, which overlooks a public school.
    


            On the same day, according to the investigation reports, Farzam called the supervising prosecutor, claiming to be an FBI agent in Los Angeles. He identified himself as “Special Agent in Charge Rafael Garcia” and said he wanted to “get a driving under the influence arrest dismissed for a Santa Monica police officer because she was an informant in the ‘Chapo Guzman case,'” the documents said, referring to now imprisoned Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán, known as “El Chapo.”
    


            If she wanted to know more, Farzam suggested, the prosecutor should “Google Chapo Guzman.”
    


            The prosecutor told a state DOJ investigator the caller was “very personable and talked as if he knew what he was doing,” according to an investigation report.
    


            In June 2014, law enforcement officials seized 16 firearms – including assault-style rifles – a dozen emergency radios, more than 40 forged badges, two counterfeit permits to carry concealed weapons, TSA and airline “Flying While Armed” documents and a CHP Crown Victoria with emergency lights from Farzam's home and business, according to the no bail motion. A 1986 Pierce fire truck was also found on the property, according to an investigation report at the time.
    


            The fire truck, registered under the Santa Muerte Fire Department, was seized as evidence after Farzam's arrest last July, prosecutors said.
    


            Hirt, the retired state DOJ agent, said one item in Farzam's home was particularly humorous. A framed certificate mounted on a wall, reportedly from the Transportation Safety Administration, commended Farzam for thwarting an airline hijacking, Hirt recalled with a laugh.
    


            “I think we would know if that occurred, right,” Hirt said. “We Googled him, never found anything. He just made it up. In his own mind, he was somebody special. And he certainly believed he was not subject to the laws that everybody else was subject to.”
    


            Farzam eventually pleaded guilty to three felony counts: impersonating a peace officer, possession of an assault weapon and unauthorized computer access, according to the no bail motion. His sentence: 90 days in jail and five years' probation. The convictions were ultimately reduced to misdemeanors and expunged in 2022, the court document said.
    


            “He was able to convince the judge that he was not an innocent man but a reformed guy, and that he was going to stop,” Hirt said.
    


            “He's got money. The parents were always there to bail him out. Literally, I was walking into the police department in Santa Monica after serving the search warrant at his hotel and he's walking out with his family. That's how quick they managed to bail him out.”
    


            In 2019, Farzam was in trouble again. A felony complaint by the state attorney general charged him with attempted witness intimidation, identity theft and use of counterfeit court seal, according to the no bail document. The case centered on his alleged attempt to intimidate a former employee who filed a lawsuit against Farzam. He also was accused of creating and submitting a forged order with a counterfeit Los Angeles Superior Court seal in a bid to “compel the removal of unflattering online content,” prosecutors said. A UCLA law professor discovered the forgery and alerted authorities.
    


            “The guy lives in LA. If he only became a screenwriter, he could harness all that,” said Eugene Volokh, the University of California, Los Angeles law professor emeritus who alerted authorities.
    


            Mental health diversion was granted in the case, which, according to prosecutors, was dismissed in 2022. It's not clear what the mental health issue was or what treatment, if any, Farzam received. Mental health diversion connects people with mental health issues to treatment programs and support services in lieu of jail time.
    


            When Farzam was arrested this year on July 16, former state DOJ special agent supervisor Hirt got a call from a colleague who was part of the 2014 investigation.
    


            “You'll never guess who got arrested?” asked the caller.
    


            Hirt knew.
    


            “Nothing's going to stop him,” he said, referring to Farzam. “I'm surprised it took this long to arrest him again. He can't resist. He can't break the habit.”

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Concerns that antisemitism is on the rise among Republicans burst to the surface this weekend, turning a conference of the nation's leading Jewish Republicans from jubilation over a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East into a clarion call to stem the spread of anti-Jewish voices within the party. 

The emerging schism was laid bare by a prominent conservative think tank president's defense of talk show host Tucker Carlson's controversial decision to welcome a far-right activist with antisemitic views onto his podcast Thursday, and Carlson's hesitation to challenge some of his views. It prompted nearly every speaker who took the podium at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual conference in Las Vegas to call for rooting out anti-Jewish elements in the GOP.

Still, the meeting's proceedings sent a clear signal that the Republican Party has work to do to reconcile views within its ranks about the path forward for Israel in its relationship with the United States, its staunchest ally. But the voices speaking from the podium Friday and Saturday were united in their condemnation of antisemitism.

“We are at this point in what I consider sort of the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community,” Republican Jewish Coalition leader Matthew Brooks said in an interview with The Associated Press.




Brooks and the dozens of other speakers who condemned antisemitism within the GOP from the stage before an audience of about 1,000 in the Venetian Resort ballroom in Las Vegas set an ominous tone that cut into the air of celebration many had anticipated over the October ceasefire. 

Brooks had planned to fold some of his concerns into the three-day, annual conference of Republican Jewish elected officials, fundraisers, media personalities and activists. But comments made just before the meeting by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts denying the conservative group was “distancing itself” from Carlson — a former Fox News host and powerful voice on the right — after his podcast hosted Nick Fuentes prompted a sudden pivot. 

Fuentes has said the Holocaust was exaggerated, and that he believes in a global Jewish conspiracy. Carlson has espoused a white supremacist ideology called the “great replacement theory,” which says people of color are replacing white people and that Jews are furthering the change. 

The video of Roberts' comments sparked outrage from some Heritage staffers, senators and conservative activists. But they also reflect increasing skepticism toward Israel and of Jews among some on the right, complicating GOP efforts to cast the Democratic Party as antisemitic.

For months The Republican Jewish Coalition has been uneasy about Carlson, who has criticized U.S. support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views. One is his opposition to Christian Zionism, the belief that some evangelical Christians interpret the Bible as promising the land of Israel eternally to the Jews, thus viewing Israel as belonging to the Jewish people. 

Brooks had named others for contributing to the schism, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and conservative social media figure Candace Owens.

“And it's really going to be our challenge going forward to combat that before it has a chance to grow and metastasize in the Republican Party,” Brooks told the AP. 

That challenge was met by a steady chorus from the podium. 

“Sadly, we're seeing antisemitism on the fringes of our own party,” Tennessee Rep. David Kustoff lamented.

Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida later proclaimed: “In our party we will not tolerate antisemitism.” 

Sen. Lindsay Graham sought to lighten the mood, calling himself a member of the “Hitler-sucks wing of the Republican Party,” prompting laughter. But even as he injected humor, the South Carolina Republican downplayed the threat Fuentes and others pose to the GOP. 

“You can sit in a basement with weird people and say weird things. It's a free country, right?” he added. “But if you ever run for office as a Republican, and you embrace this weird s(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk), we're going to beat your brains out.” 

Fuentes, who is 27, has 1 million followers on the social media platform X, and his following is generations younger than Graham, who is 70. Brooks said the leak of a series of TeleGram text messages from National Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont praising Hitler, joking about gas chambers and other atrocities, which was published last month by Politico, is a symptom of the division he and the coalition are trying to contain. 

Perhaps that is why dozens of college-age Jewish Republicans attended the conference, cheekily waving red signs emblazoned with “Tucker is not MAGA,” a reference to President Donald Trump's Make-America-Great-Again mantra, during Florida Congressman Randy Fine's presentation. 

There was joy at the event, notably over the release of Israeli hostages, many held for more than two years since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, prompting two years of brutal retaliation in Gaza. 

“I'm sure many of you have spent the last few weeks watching with joy and tears the joyful of Israel's resilient heroes, reuniting with their loved ones,” said Norm Coleman, a former Minnesota Senator and chairman of the coalition's board. “It has been a deeply emotional time for all Jewry.” 

And the testimonials to Trump came from nearly all speakers, praising the Republican president for his role in brokering the ceasefire that resulted in the returned hostages. 

When an image of Trump was cast on screens in the ballroom, the audience rose in cheers to hear his recorded 5-minute address to the group, in which he declared, “No one has been a greater friend to Israel than Donald J. Trump.”

But even enthusiasm over his role was tempered by questions about the terms of the ceasefire, which required Hamas to disarm, disband and have no role in the future of Gaza. Several coalition members saw it as unlikely to hold, especially in light of Israel's renewed strikes in Gaza after it claimed Hamas had violated the ceasefire terms by firing on Israeli soldiers. 

Board member Bobby Schostak of Michigan suggested a lasting peace was possible but would take years. 

“I think we're some distance away from that,” he said. 

Coleman was even more grim, suggesting that Hamas still must be completely eradicated. 

“If they are still part of the equation,” he said. “I think it's going to be very difficult to hold.”

Speaking at a meeting of ASEAN leaders in Malaysia, Pete Hegseth labelled Chinese actions in the disputed waterway “provocative” and said they show a lack of respect for their neighbours.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday that Washington and Beijing would establish military-to-military communications channels, adding that bilateral ties between the countries have “never been better.”

Hegseth said he spoke with his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, late Saturday on the sidelines of a regional security meeting and that they agreed that “peace, stability and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries.”

His remarks posted on X came hours after he urged Southeast Asian nations to stand firm and strengthen their maritime forces to counter China's increasingly “destabilizing” actions in the South China Sea.

“China's sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea fly in the face of their commitments to resolve disputes peacefully,” Hegseth said at a meeting with his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Saturday. 

“We seek peace. We do not seek conflict. But we must ensure that China is not seeking to dominate you or anybody else,” he added.

The South China Sea remains one of Asia's most volatile flashpoints. Beijing claims almost the entire region, while ASEAN members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim ownership of coastal areas and features. The Philippines, a key U.S. ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet. 

Manila has repeatedly urged a stronger regional response, but ASEAN has traditionally sought to balance caution with economic ties to Beijing, the region's largest trading partner.

Hegseth said on X he also spoke with President Donald Trump and they agreed “the relationship between the U.S. and China has never been better.” Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea earlier this week “set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the U.S. and China,” added Hegseth, who left Malaysia on Sunday for Vietnam.




The contrasting messages — a sharp warning at the ASEAN meeting followed by conciliatory language online — underscored Washington's effort to balance deterrence with diplomacy amid rising tensions with Beijing.

“This is damage control. More importantly, it reflects two different currents in U.S. relations with China — one that sees China as a threat and another a possible partner,” said Southeast Asian political analyst Bridget Welsh.

In his meeting on Saturday, Hegseth criticized Beijing's recent declaration of the Scarborough Shoal — seized from the Philippines in 2012 — as a “nature reserve.” He told the meeting it was “yet another attempt to coerce new and expanded territorial and maritime claims at your expense.”

He urged ASEAN to hasten the conclusion of a long-delayed Code of Conduct being negotiated with China to govern behavior in the sea. He also proposed developing shared maritime surveillance and rapid-response systems to deter provocation. A “shared maritime domain awareness” network, he said, would ensure that any member facing “aggression and provocation is not alone.”

He also welcomed plans for an ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise in December to strengthen regional coordination and uphold freedom of navigation.

China rejects U.S. criticism of its maritime conduct, accusing Washington of interfering in regional affairs and provoking tensions through its military presence. Chinese officials say their patrols and construction activities are lawful and aimed at maintaining security in what they consider Chinese territory.

Chinese officials Saturday slammed the Philippines for being a “troublemaker” after Manila staged naval and air drills with the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in the South China Sea. The two-day exercise that ended Friday was the 12th that the Philippines says it has carried out with partner nations since last year to protect its rights in the disputed waters.

Tian Junli, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command, said the exercise seriously undermined regional peace and stability. “It further proves that the Philippines is the troublemaker in the South China Sea issue and a saboteur of regional stability,” he said.

NEWARK, New Jersey — Those thinking former President Barack Obama no longer has electoral influence in New Jersey would find that opinion challenged on Saturday night in Newark. 

Long lines wrapped around the venue, hundreds of smiling faces, and the deafening cheers at the mere mention of his name dominated the energy inside the Essex County College gymnasium, where Obama took the stage to rally support for Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), the Democratic candidate in Tuesday's gubernatorial race. 

He was met by applause, whistles, yells, and excited chants from all corners of the venue. Much to the delight of attendees, he came equipped with his trademark dry humor jokes and a repeated line telling people, “Don't boo. Go vote.”

His message for the evening? Elections matter.

“If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a path to a brighter future, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama told hundreds of supporters who started lining up around the block early in the morning ahead of the rally. 

Obama said Sherrill will build a “stronger, brighter future” for New Jersey that will spread “light” across the country.

“Lord knows, we need that light. We need that inspiration. Because, let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said. 

“We need leaders like Mikie, public servants who are in it for the right reasons, who are focused on the future, and who will always stay connected to the people that they were elected to serve. Her opponent? Not so much,” he continued.

Sherrill is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the race for the open governor's mansion to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ). Though the congresswoman held a sizable lead for most of the general election season, recent polling shows her in a dead heat with Ciattarelli — hence the last-minute rally effort with the former president and other high-profile senators leading up to Election Day.

Obama's stop in Newark came a few hours after he stumped for former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk, Virginia, who is also running for governor on Nov. 4.

His endorsement of Sherrill will test whether he still holds considerable sway over the Democratic electorate and can influence voters who sat out the 2024 election to come out in an off-cycle year to cast a ballot. He lent his voice to radio and digital ads leading up to Saturday's rally. 

He said Sherrill is among the “tough people” he's met in his life, noting her military background as a pilot, work as a federal prosecutor, and life as a mother.

“Apparently, that was a little bit too easy. She decides to run for Congress. I get tired just thinking about it,” Obama quipped.

During the speech, he acknowledged that people voted for Trump in the last election because they were “understandably frustrated with inflation and high gas prices and the difficulty of affording a home, and they were worried about their children's futures.” He also noted that in 2024, he heard from many people who told him the election “didn't matter.” 

“If nothing else, these nine months should have cured us of that idea, because the stakes are now clear,” he said. “We don't need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. They're here.”

“It's not as if we did not see some of this coming,” Obama added. “I'll admit it's worse than even I expected. But I did warn y'all.” 

He poked fun at the GOP's cracking down on and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in universities and agencies.

“They never miss a chance to scapegoat minorities and blame DEI for every problem. You got a flat tire? Must be DEI. Your wife kicked you out? Who knew?” Obama said.

He wrapped up his speech by encouraging people to stand with their convictions and reminded them that despite the “dark” emotions being felt by the public, this “contest of ideas, it's not new.” 

“I still believe our best days are ahead of us,” Obama said.

WHO IS MIKIE SHERRILL? MEET THE DEMOCRATIC PICK FOR NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR

Sherrill, who spoke before Obama took the stage, said she understood that New Jersey was a critical crossroads as one of only two gubernatorial races in 2025. 

“We are waging a battle at this very moment for the future of our nation and New Jersey has always answered the call to defend this country and our values,” Sherrill said. 

“In these difficult times, when everything seems to come down to our election, when people across the nation look at me with fear and despair in their eyes, when they asked me, ‘Is New Jersey up for this moment?'” she asked, interrupted by cheers.

“You guys just stole my line — my answer was hell yeah,” Sherill added.

She said her campaign focuses on opportunities for New Jersey, stating that “we believe it doesn't matter who your parents are, it doesn't matter where you were born, you should get a shot.” 

She focused heavily on her plans to install a state of emergency declaration to freeze electricity costs for at least a year after utility costs rose 22% from the previous year. She also spoke to Trump's energy policies, arguing he is “getting rich off the higher utility prices that New Jersey families are being forced to pay,” and the freezing of funds for the Hudson Tunnel project.

“Whether it's Medicaid, the one big beautiful betrayal, or the Gateway Tunnel, guess what? Jack Ciattarelli is nowhere to be found,” Sherrill said. “And when he is forced to talk about it, does he defend New Jersey? Does he commit to buying that money back for New Jersey? Does he say, ‘Hey, I'm serving you no matter what the cost.' No on every single occasion.”

“Jack has decided, I'm going to defend Trump. He even gives Trump an ‘A'. Guess what? I give Trump an ‘F,'” Sherrill said.

Sherrill said as governor, her fight “doesn't and can't end at the border of New Jersey.”

“We've got to take on all those hits coming from Trump and Washington, D.C.,” she said.

“As I stand here, I feel nothing but courage,” she added. “New Jerseyans give me courage, and I'm sure the nation feels that way, too. Courage to make change, to take on special interests, the status quo, the systems that aren't working to deliver for people, for families, to give every kid a shot. So, anger and courage are the daughters of hope.”

Saturday's rally kicked off with speeches from local labor unions and county and state officials, as well as an energetic performance by the local senior citizens' East Orange Silver Steppers dance troupe. 

The featured songs of Saturday's rally were “Hit The Road Jack” by Ray Charles, a knock at Ciattarelli, as well as “Hey Mickey” by Sweet California, a nod to Sherrill.

All speakers had the same message: voters cannot sit by and be complacent in Tuesday's election.

“If you're not in this fight, you're nowhere,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said. “You have to be in this fight. You can't be home, you can't be on the sidelines, you can't argue on TV or put things on Twitter. You got to get out. You got to vote.” 

Other big names in Democratic politics took the stage, including Murphy, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), New Jersey's congressional Democratic delegation, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin. All pleaded with supporters not to “sit on the sidelines” and instead vote in the Garden State's competitive gubernatorial election on Nov. 4.

Ahead of Obama's appearance, Booker joked, “I miss Obama … and I miss her husband, too.” 

Booker spent his speech blasting the Republican trifecta in Washington, D.C., with the senator calling it “one of the most outrageous periods of American history.” He said President Donald Trump's policies have seeped across state lines, pointing to cuts to Medicaid and immigration operations occurring in cities across the country.

“This is one of those moments — it's a rare one for our state — where this election has become about something so much bigger,” Booker said.

“All over the United States of America, people are looking at New Jersey, and I will tell you right now, we are the people of hope. We are the light that's rising,” he added.

Several of the speakers called Ciattarelli “100% MAGA” — a line Democrats have used for months as Sherrill's campaign has worked to tie the Republican candidate to Trump in order to show that he would be an extension of the administration and won't fight for New Jersey.

Martin said Ciattarelli and Trump are “two sides of the same bad coin.” 

At one point, a supporter required brief medical assistance. Murphy, after calling for first responders, quipped, “I was starting to tell you what the state would look like if Jack were left and then somebody collapsed. Who could blame them?”

JACK CIATTARELLI CONFIDENT HE'LL ‘DELIVER A WIN' AS HE VOTES EARLY IN NEW JERSEY ELECTION

Booker also said the election is about “defending New Jersey from Donald Trump and his minions.”

“When we vote, we send a message that Donald Trump is on the way out and democracy is on the way in,” the senator said, receiving loud cheers.

At least 10 people were injured in a stabbing attack on a train in England Saturday night.

British Transport Police responded to reports of a mass stabbing aboard a train bound for London at around 7:30 p.m. local time. Police said at the time that “multiple people” were stabbed on the train, which was stopped at Huntingdon Station, near Cambridge.

Armed police officers arrested two suspects at the scene shortly after, whose identities have not been disclosed. Of the 10 passengers injured in the attack, nine are suffering from life-threatening injuries.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene, with passengers trampling over each other and hiding in bathrooms during the attack. One witness also told the Times that there was “blood everywhere,” and recalled seeing at least one man with a large knife.

U.K. officials were quick to weigh in on the incident, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling it “appalling” and “deeply concerning.”

“My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,” he added.

For more than two weeks now during the government shutdown, Imelda Avila-Thomas has been trying in vain to get approved for unemployment compensation to help cover essentials such as food and mortgage payments for her family while she's on unpaid furlough from her federal government job. 

She kept asking questions and was ultimately sent a hyperlink to upload proof-of-income documents, which she did earlier this week. But Avila-Thomas, who works for the Department of Labor in San Antonio, said the system still deems her ineligible for benefits, saying it cannot verify her wages. She wonders whether someone who might help her has also been furloughed.

A mother of a 12-year-old daughter and local union leader, Avila-Thomas is among the thousands of furloughed federal workers trying to navigate the unemployment system — a sharp increase, but still a fraction of the 670,000-plus furloughed workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The dollar amounts and length of benefits vary by state.

About 26,000 federal workers filed initial claims from Sept. 28 through Oct. 18, according to raw data published by the Department of Labor. Some 3,300 applied in the week that ended days before the Oct. 1 shutdown start.

Furloughed workers have some factors to consider. For instance, if they receive back pay as expected when the shutdown ends, they would need to repay the unemployment aid. For Avila-Thomas, refunding the money later is preferable to taking on debt. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Avila-Thomas has worked at the Labor Department for 16 years. Her husband is a disabled veteran who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs and is still working with pay, but they have had to cut back on tutoring for their daughter, who has dyslexia, and with one income now, they've gone to a food bank.




“This would cover that — the essential basics,” said Avila-Thomas, whose local American Federation of Government Employees covers Labor Department workers in several states. “And yes, in an ideal world, everybody would have six months worth of savings. And the reality is, most of our members are coming to that point where they could no longer pay those regular bills.”

She has applied for part-time work and said she isn't looking for a handout.

Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees relies heavily on state laws and processing.

The specifics vary. Massachusetts has a high-end weekly benefit of $1,105 per week for up to 30 weeks. In Mississippi, it's no more than $235 weekly for up to 26 weeks. Roughly half the states pay less than $600 a week maximum, according to U.S. Department of Labor numbers. 

Not everyone gets the maximum weekly rate. Some states offer fewer than 20 weeks. And the limits can grow in some states when unemployment rates are particularly high.

Around the nation's capital, the maximum weekly payment is $444 in Washington, D.C., $430 in Maryland and $378 in Virginia.

In Texas, where Avila-Thomas lives, the weekly maximum is $605, for up to 26 weeks.

States normally issue payments within two to three weeks after someone's claim is approved, the Labor Department says. And most states also have an initial “waiting week” for which benefits are not paid upfront. Beneficiaries typically receive money for that week only later, if they exhaust all the weeks they're allotted, the National Employment Law Project says. 

States are responsible for verifying an applicant's job and earnings with their federal employer. But the Department of Labor has warned that the shutdown may delay processing of this information by federal agencies. 

Many workers have not received forms normally sent by their employing agencies that are used to verify employment and earnings, according to the National Employment Law Project.

Questions have come up about states' varying requirements that people prove they are job hunting while receiving unemployment checks. The Labor Department has said waivers of the requirement may apply for the furloughed federal workers under state laws, noting they face ethics limits on outside work. And some states have specified that work-search mandates won't apply to these workers, waiving them for several weeks or longer.

But in Texas, Avila-Thomas said she has not received a clear answer. Many of her job matches could present a conflict of interest, she said. The Texas Workforce Commission did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the work requirement for those workers.

About 730,000 federal employees have kept working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, and they are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits. They will receive back pay after the government is reopened. Workers on reduced hours could be eligible for unemployment.

“Excepted” employees working without pay are typically necessary to respond to emergencies or ensure national security, such as air traffic controllers and airport security screeners.

The Trump administration has said pay will continue for some groups, including FBI special agents and military troops. Paychecks never stopped for some other workers whose departments, such as the Postal Service, rely on their own revenues or certain other funding sources.

There have been other wrinkles specific to how this administration has handled the shutdown, as well.

Earlier in October, the Trump administration threatened that back pay for furloughed federal workers would not be guaranteed, though he later backtracked on it. Trump has also sought to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers during the shutdown. A judge has blocked the layoffs while a lawsuit challenging them plays out.

Avila-Thomas said workers like her are ready for the shutdown to end.

“We're ready to get back,” she said. “I think I've driven my family crazy with things and projects.” ___

Israel has confirmed that three more bodies recently returned by Hamas are not those of hostages taken by the terrorist group over two years ago.

Hamas handed over the remains of three people on Friday, as part of its obligations under the Gaza ceasefire struck last month. None of those are of the remaining hostages that Hamas has yet to return, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Saturday.

“The remains we received are not our hostages,” the office said, without providing any more information.

Israel's confirmation is the latest instance of Hamas's failure to uphold its duties under the ceasefire, the first phase of which required the terrorist group to release all living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of it taking effect.

Nearly a month later, 11 hostage remains are still due to be returned to Israel, and pressure is mounting.

President Donald Trump's patience has worn thin with the pace of the release, with him recently warning of potential action from other countries if Hamas did not move quickly.

That led to Egypt joining the recovery efforts, with teams entering the Gaza Strip with engineering vehicles and excavators to locate the bodies.

Some of those efforts were successful, as Hamas returned the bodies of two hostages on Thursday.

With politics among the biggest stressors for Americans, and the political gender gap growing among young people, it can be hard to stay motivated when divisions feel more contentious than ever.

Few people understand that like Ella Emhoff, the daughter of former U.S. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and stepdaughter of former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Getting offline is a good first step.

"I think what has kept me the most invigorated around politics and just social change is seeing everyone else empowered by it, coming to things like ZCON and being able to talk about it," Emhoff recently told CNBC Make It at the Gen Z-focused conference put on by United Talent Agency. "When we're online, it can feel so insular and feel like everything's happening to us, whether it be with immigration, with wars, with genocide, with the climate."

With so much happening, Emhoff says she finds power in focusing on small changes within her control, and actions she can take toward them.

"Small changes impact big change," she says. "Even going and volunteering at a shelter or with dogs or feeding the homeless, anything like that is going to create positive impact. The more you engage with that in your day-to-day, bigger things will feel more achievable."

These small and ongoing projects of purpose are more achievable and enjoyable no matter the result, versus large and intangible goals, Dr. Jordan Grumet, a hospice medical director and author writing about purpose, previously told Make It.

On the other hand, scrolling and consuming every bad headline won't do much for your emotions or your feelings of being able to enact small changes. "Get off your phone, engage in your community," Emhoff says. "It's going to make you feel better. I promise."

The 26-year-old says turning to offline creative pursuits, like her work as a textile artist and her recently relaunched Soft Hands Knit Club, helps too.

Working in a creative field has its own challenges. But Emhoff says her mother, Kerstin, who works as a film producer and heads a creative entertainment studio, has always given her the best outlook on her career.

"One of the best things she's told me is just don't give up," she says. "When you're in a non-traditional career path like I am, it's really easy to want to give up when the stream of income is lost, or you're feeling like your engagement is down and you want to just quit and get a normal job. I love to threaten her that I'm going to go and just get a corporate job, but she's always been a really big proponent of the message I have in mental health and crafting and community, and it's pushed me a lot farther than I ever thought."

Emhoff says she's also gotten good advice from her stepmother Harris, especially about recovering from a setback after losing the 2024 presidential election.

"After she gave her concession speech, she sat down with us and said, 'This is not the end. This is just a bump in the road.' And I really do believe that," Emhoff says. "There have been hard times before. We are in an especially hard time. But we have gotten out of hard times, and the only way to get through that is with believing and not letting up."

"I think we collectively need to get into that same headspace of just kicking butt," she adds.

American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree.

Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad "liberation day" tariffs.

Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.

And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.

LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.

The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.

Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.

That translates to around $132 per shopper.

Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.

"For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant," said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.

"While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt," Schulz said.

"That's a choice no one wants to have to make."

Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.

Schultz agreed, calling it an "unfortunate reality" that many consumers will have to face.

"That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want," Schulz said.

"I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want," he said. "However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice."

LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.

Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.

Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.

The focus on dividend stocks is growing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another rate cut. Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return.

In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

We start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. In Q3 2025, Valero returned $1.3 billion to stockholders via $351 million in dividends and $931 million in share repurchases. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.52, VLO stock offers a yield of 2.7%.

Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180.

"We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution," said Mehta.

The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026.

In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield.

Mehta ranks No. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%.

We move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. On October 14, Albertsons announced a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on November 7. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, ACI stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.

Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company "accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform."

Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines.

The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. In fact, For U membership increased more than 13% year-over-year in Q2 FY25, reaching over 48 million active participants. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth.

Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. He expects ACI stock to deliver a total return of close to 50%, including dividends.

Feinseth ranks No. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.2%.

Finally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield.

Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. In a preview on the Q3 results of the companies in the U.S. midstream space, Scotto stated that Williams and Targa Resources (TRGP) are her favored names into the earnings.

Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, "WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects."

Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.

Scotto views WMB's February analyst day as the next catalyst for the stock. The analyst expects WMB to increase its EBITDA growth target from the range of 5% to 7% to high single digits or more.

Scotto ranks No. 270 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.7%.

While many investors welcome a windfall, the rules for inherited individual retirement accounts are complicated — and mistakes can be costly.   

Since 2020, certain inherited accounts are subject to the "10-year rule," and heirs must empty the balance by the 10th year after the original account owner's death.  

Plus, some non-spouse beneficiaries, commonly adult children, must begin taking required minimum distributions, or RMDs, in 2025 over the 10-year period, or face a hefty IRS penalty. 

Inherited IRA planning is important amid the "great wealth transfer," with more than $100 trillion expected to change hands through 2048, according to a December report from Cerulli Associates.   

Stories for investors who are retired or are approaching retirement, and are interested in creating and managing a steady stream of income:

Here are three of the biggest inherited IRA mistakes and how to avoid them, according to financial advisors.

For non-spouse heirs, "the [inherited IRA] rules can get complex fast, and it's critical to know your options," said certified financial planner Brett Koeppel, founder of Eudaimonia Wealth in Buffalo, New York.

The "10-year rule" and new RMD requirement for 2025 apply to most non-spouse beneficiaries, such as adult children, if the original IRA owner reached RMD age before their death.

If you fail to take inherited IRA RMDs for 2025, you could be subject to a 25% IRS penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn. However, you could reduce that fee to 10% by disbursing the correct amount within two years and filing Form 5329. In some cases, the IRS may waive the penalty entirely.

If you inherit a pretax IRA, you can expect to pay regular income taxes on withdrawals, which may require tax planning during the 10-year drawdown, experts say.

Some heirs aim to take only their RMD for the first nine years and a lump sum in year 10. But this could mean "significant taxes in that final year of distribution," said CFP John Nowak, founder of Alo Financial Planning in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He is also a certified public accountant.

Instead, you should run multi-year tax projections to decide the best withdrawal amounts for each year, experts say. For example, it might make sense to accelerate distributions during temporary lower-income years.

Another common mistake is failing to change inherited IRA assets, according to CFP Jamie Bosse, a senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.

Ideally, the investments should match your risk tolerance, goals and timeline. "It's your money now and should be allocated according to your needs," she said.

However, when choosing investments, you need to weigh your tax liability, yearly RMD and income needs, said Nowak with Alo Financial Planning.

For example, holding certificates of deposit in your IRA with a maturity date beyond your RMD window could be "difficult or costly to distribute," he said.

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Christina Kantzavelos, 37, a therapist and chronic illness advocate based in Óbidos, Portugal, a town about 52 miles north of Lisbon. She left California at the end  of 2022 and lived nomadically in Europe until settling in Portugal in 2024. She still rents a home in California and has clients in the US. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

It was early summer of 2024 that I first decided that I wanted to make Portugal my permanent home.

I've been to a lot of different countries in Europe, and I've had the privilege of visiting and spending longer periods of time in them. For me, Portugal just feels the most comfortable. There's a lot happening where you feel like you can be involved or contribute to the community very easily. There's an openness, and I like that there's a mixture of locals as well as foreigners. I have felt very welcomed here so far.

It's nice to know things are happening and going on. I'm not that far from Lisbon, where a lot of bands come to play. And I love the access to nature and the good weather — it's reminiscent of California, where I grew up. It's a very nice balance.

I love the fact that sunshine is just a drive away, even if it seems like it's raining somewhere. You can be at the beach and in the snow, theoretically, on the same day. There are just so many rivers and beautiful hikes, and the air just seems so clear. Those are the aspects of the lifestyle I enjoy.

Overall, my nervous system just feels safer here. For me, it really comes down to my health and the fact that I feel better overall. I just feel less inflamed, more energized, more vibrant overall.

I work mostly Pacific Standard Time; however, I coach clients from the Midwest to the East Coast and also internationally.

It's pretty ideal. Generally speaking, I wrap up around 10 p.m., so I'm in bed at a reasonable hour.

It's been great to have slow mornings. It's nice that I can go see doctors, or go get treatments, or go do things that are related and helpful to my health during the day, and get that over with, and then work. I actually really like that switch of workflow.

People here seem to work to live versus live to work in the US.

I feel like in the US it is shifting in a healthier direction, but the lifestyle in Portugal seems more conducive to living, and I really enjoy that.

It's also more affordable overall. I try to eat mostly organic, and I can do that here more affordably versus in the US, where I'd be left with very little money at the end of the month.

For two people, between the grocery store and the farmer's market, a week's worth of groceries costs 125 euros, or about $145. Eating mostly organic food, that would've easily cost me closer to $300.

I rent my house in Joshua Tree, California, which is a little bit more affordable than big cities where I was before, like San Diego and Los Angeles. For point of reference, my three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot apartment in Portugal is 1,300 euros a month.

For something like this in San Diego, this would probably be at least $5,000 a month for a location where I am walking distance to town and for what I have access to.

Where I am, I feel like there's a lot around community and families: they're doing family dinners on Sunday, where everyone gets together, or group lunches. There are a lot of festivals, and there are a lot of community events.

I'm a European citizen and I'm now a resident of Portugal; however, I still don't have access to their healthcare, so everything is out of pocket. 

It's still less expensive: I went to the osteopath, and I paid 40 euros for an hour of treatment. Seeing an osteopath out of pocket in California was quite expensive — it was $275 for 30 minutes.

I have to get weekly lymphatic massages for one of my health conditions. And for an hour and a half, I pay 40 euros. To receive that in California, I think it was closer to $175 for an hour and a half.

When I was living in Greece, I needed a small emergency surgery, and I was charged 50 euros for that — and that was at a private institution. If I'd gone to an ER in the US, that would've probably cost me $5,000.

I know folks who've had to open a GoFundMe for their healthcare. That just doesn't make sense that we need to crowdfund to get our healthcare covered when we pay so much for health insurance in the US. I see it almost every day in my work, insurance denying someone's health treatment.

It's depressing. It breaks my heart. I'm so grateful that I have this privilege, but it doesn't make sense that we should have to leave our own country to be able to afford to be healthy.

Nervous system dysregulation is tied so closely to our health — the mind-body component is huge. If we're not feeling comfortable or safe in the environment we're living in, it can impact our health big time. I've noticed a really huge difference in my overall health, even without the treatments here.

I've received only love, support, and curiosity from my clients thus far. I feel so much better. I do feel like I'm fully able to take care of my health and feel confident, safe, and secure in where I am.

It's not rare that we go overseas or to different states or places for our health. If we go somewhere and we realize, "Wow, I see a difference," it's worthwhile for us to make the move.

The AI boom is far more robust than the dot-com bubble, but there's still a risk it disappoints investors and sends shockwaves through markets and the economy, Liz Ann Sonders says.

Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist told Business Insider that "extreme enthusiasm" about innovation and circular deals between tech companies reminded her of the internet bubble 25 years ago.

But she said a key difference is that many dot-com companies were small and loss-making, whereas today's AI leaders are massive companies with strong balance sheets and fast-growing revenues and profits, she said.

For example, Nvidia became the first company to notch a $5 trillion market capitalization this week, but that valuation has some support in the form of the microchip giant's $47 billion revenue and $26 billion net income for the quarter ended July 27.

Sonders said the immense concentration of investor wealth in Big Tech companies means there's "more exposure to the equity market than ever before." She said that if a bear market takes hold, it "could have feeders into the economy" as consumers might balk at their portfolio losses and cut back on spending, curbing economic growth.

The Wall Street veteran said there's a danger that AI companies fail to deliver on their bullish growth forecasts, which have driven the stock market to record highs.

"That's the ultimate risk — that you've set the expectations bar too high," she said. In that situation, even a slight miss could trigger market behavior that's a "little more egregious," she added.

Sonders said that speculation in more niche areas, such as meme stocks, drones, and quantum computing, made her a "little less uncomfortable" about investor exuberance, as "you could have cracks in that armor show up" without tanking the wider stock market.

She added that gold's surge to record highs of over $4,000 this month was an "area where the enthusiasm pendulum swung maybe a bit too far," and the moves were "more about FOMO than fundamentally driven."

Sonders said it's tricky to gauge the health of the US economy right now as the government shutdown has disrupted some data releases: "We're all flying this plane a little blind right now."

But she said that economic gauges in recent months have shown rising pressure on lower-income consumers and a softening labor market, which could erode growth.

"It's not screaming 'recession is imminent,'" Sonders said, but investors should "be mindful" of a weakening jobs backdrop.

Inside a glass-walled lab at Tesla's engineering headquarters, dozens of workers act out the motions of everyday life: lifting a cup, wiping a table, pulling open a curtain.

They repeat each action hundreds of times during eight-hour shifts, and their work is captured by five cameras attached to their helmet and a heavy backpack. CEO Elon Musk sometimes stops by to watch, and Tesla investors visit regularly for demos.

It's like being a "lab rat under a microscope," one former worker told Business Insider.

The goal is simple: Teach Optimus, the company's robot, how to move like a human.

Musk has identified Optimus as a crucial part of the business. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said that it "has the potential to be the biggest product of all time" and said the company would eventually produce 1 million units per year. He has also projected that Optimus would account for around 80% of the automaker's value one day.

Tesla intends for Optimus to perform a wide variety of tasks, including factory work, household chores, and caregiving. The work of the "data collection operators" is designed to pave the way for Optimus to replace human labor.

Business Insider spoke with five current and former workers to understand how Optimus is trained. They said the role is physically demanding, occasionally absurd, and always meticulous. They sprint, squat, and dance. If their movements are deemed not "human enough," one worker said, their performance is critiqued.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla is one of many tech companies, including Figure and 1X, attempting to replicate complex human behavior in a robot. The ultimate goal, as with much of the AI industry, might be autonomy, but an army of flesh-and-blood workers props up the sleek demos and lofty promises.

Training a robot to be human isn't glamorous.

Most data collectors start out wiping down a table, sometimes for weeks. "You take a step, wipe the table, go into a reset pose, and do it all over again," one former worker said. It's "rinse and repeat until break time."

The workers receive detailed documents about how to perform simple tasks, and they're guided by a thick, constantly evolving manual, three workers said. They're also paired up with a peer to ensure the tasks are performed correctly, five people said.

"Tesla is very strict on how everything needs to be done," one worker said. "It can be very tough mentally and physically."

Since data collection started, workers have largely used motion capture suits to teleoperate the robot — teaching it with manual movement. In June, the company told workers it was pivoting away from motion-capture suits and teleoperation and toward collecting data using only cameras, Business Insider previously reported. The change followed the departure of program director Milan Kovac.

The worker-mounted cameras point in all directions, helping precisely place the data collectors in the environment, workers said. They said the team was told it would be faster to scale data collection without the motion-capture suits.

Since the June shift, the company has incorporated multiple new training processes, including stationing cameras around workers while they perform tasks, three workers said. 

Jonathan Aitken, a robotics expert at the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider that the camera towers could supplement the data by providing a broader view of the environment.

Workers are sometimes outfitted with haptic gloves, which track the minute movements of their hands, three employees said. Musk has said Tesla has spent considerable energy trying to develop a human-like hand for Optimus, calling it "an incredibly difficult engineering challenge."

Workers have also recorded themselves mirroring each other's movements, three people said. At the company's Fremont, California, plant, data collectors have organized vehicle parts and worked on conveyor belts while wearing the headset and backpack, two people said. Experts who spoke with Business Insider said that collecting different data points for the same task can be helpful for training.

Other tasks are so simple that a former worker likened them to "teaching a baby." Two data collectors said they recorded themselves working on brain teasers designed for actual babies: putting rings on by size and color, or putting shapes into their corresponding slots.

Tesla has also begun using AI-generated prompts to help train the robot, three people said. During some training exercises, workers receive a series of AI-generated prompts via a headset, which is attached to the 30- to 40-pound backpack via wires. Though they're often wearing the backpack, it sometimes sits nearby on a chair or table.

Workers said the exercises have included squatting, doing the "Chicken Dance," acting like a gorilla, pretending to vacuum, sprinting for several yards, pretending to golf, and twerking. Workers are expected to perform each exercise within three to five seconds, the workers said. Two people recalled instances where some tasks made them uncomfortable, including AI-generated requests to crawl on all fours or remove a piece of clothing.

Aitken said the seemingly random tasks could help Tesla understand which areas it needs to improve on.

"How do you know you've covered the entire range of things you'll need it to be able to do?" he said.

The work can take a physical toll, four people said. One former worker described it as "basically doing cardio all day."

One former worker said they sustained a back injury while training the robot. They said the unbalanced weight of the backpack made it feel like they were constantly "walking with a limp." They said they went on medical leave as a result.

"I lost feeling in my right leg and had a sharp pain in my back," they said.

Workers said they saw colleagues sustain back and neck injuries due to the nature of the role.

Some people experienced problems during teleoperation, which can involve motion-capture suits and a virtual reality headset. A mix of poor image quality and the length of time workers spent wearing the gear triggered severe motion sickness, three people said. They said it could be especially disorienting when the robot fell over.

"You'd have the feeling you're falling because you're seeing through its eyes, but you'd be standing upright," one worker said.

For now, teleoperation is mostly reserved for investor visits.

"The investors want to see the bots moving in action," one former worker said. "When we're in mo-cap, we're controlling the bots so it looks more fluid."

Investors are sometimes accompanied by Musk, who has brought his 5-year-old son X to see the robot, two former workers said. One of the former workers compared the demos to "putting on a big show."

"It felt like theater," the former worker said.

Half the time, two workers said, the robot tumbles over when performing tasks that require bending or leaning, sometimes damaging expensive equipment. It's typically strapped into the gantry — a supportive rig that keeps the robot upright — unless it's performing tasks that involve traveling more than a few feet, three workers said.

Aitken said the robot should be able to remain upright with ease in a controlled environment like Tesla's offices. "Having it stand up and maintain balance should be one of the first things you look at," he said.

Musk said during Tesla's recent earnings call that the robot is a 24/7 presence at the company's engineering headquarters and walks around the office and escorts people to meeting rooms.

Elon's Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce  revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer!  Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1

At one point, more than 100 people worked on data collection, three people said. The company cut dozens of data collectors in September following twice-yearly performance reviews.

Workers are scored on how well they perform the tasks, five people said. They receive feedback on everything from bodily angles to positioning.

The data collectors have an online dashboard with grades based on data quality and quantity. Each worker is expected to gather at least four hours of usable video footage per shift, five people said. If the video footage is deemed unsatisfactory — if the worker's positioning isn't quite right, for instance — workers can be penalized.

For the workers who train it, Optimus' performance metrics are less clear. When training relied primarily on teleoperation, data operators could press a button to see if Optimus would perform the task. (More often than not, it couldn't, three people said.) Now, these evaluations are less common, and the workers said they have less transparency into the robot's progress.

In company videos, Optimus can be seen walking, folding laundry, performing kung fu moves at the "Tron Ares" premiere, and handing out candy in Times Square.

A robot demo "is always the very best demo they could show you," Alan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider.

"When you see something like it performing kung fu, it looks like it's doing something intelligent, which leads people to extrapolate its capabilities, but that's just not true," Fern said. "It's just reacting to its environment. There is not a cognitive thought behind it."

Musk, meanwhile, continues to tout a grand vision. "It won't even seem like a robot," he told investors in October. "It'll seem like a person in a robot suit."

For now, Optimus is still learning through repetition, trial and error, and endless hours of human labor.

When Michael Permana realized his software engineering job at Amazon was at risk, he didn't panic. He took paternity leave.

Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy.

"I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon," said the 47-year-old, who lives in California.

He began looking for work immediately but knew it might take a while to land a new role, and he was worried about not being able to earn a paycheck when he had a mortgage to pay.

Then he had an idea. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. By temporarily stepping away from work, he thought he might be able to prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role.

"I took the opportunity while I could to delay time," he said.

It paid off. Less than a month after returning to work, Permana received a job offer for a software engineering position at MobilityWare, a mobile game developer.

While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board.

Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers.

Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job.

Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark.

"If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job," she said.

Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen.

Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. He was spared, but it was a wake-up call.

"When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real," said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle.

After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made.

By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in.

"I never dared to quit," he said. "And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit."

Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers.

After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. Business Insider verified his identity, but he requested to use a pseudonym due to concerns about professional repercussions.

After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment.

"I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs," he said.

As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security.

"I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner," he said, adding, "I don't really have a choice."

Not all job jugglers are as ambitious as Reed. Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it.

In addition to his part-time gig, John has become less concerned about his job security as he has developed his network over the years. If he were to be laid off from his primary job, he said he knows several startup founders and hiring managers in his industry who he believes would help him find employment.

"I'm pretty confident that I'd be able to secure another full-time job in pretty short order," he said.

Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs.

"I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan," he said. "Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes."

When the feared layoff came in July, Ha was already in the middle of a job search. While he's still looking for work, he's glad he got a head start.

For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable.

Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity.

"I just didn't feel happy there anymore," said Coachman, who's in his 40s and lives in Pennsylvania. "I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week."

However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. He said the "rainy day fund" he'd built over the years helped him feel comfortable doing so.

"I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine," he said. "So it was just getting the courage to take that jump."

While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. A former Microsoft colleague referred him for a role at the AI startup Databricks, which led to an interview — and, in April, a job offer.

His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward.

"Finding my next gig was 100% through my network," he said, adding, "It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference."

Eligibility for a major student-loan forgiveness program for public servants is officially narrowing.

On October 30, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced the final rule to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.

The rule delivers on an executive order Trump signed in March to redefine what "public service" means, including ensuring that employers who participate in activities that do not align with the administration's political views will be barred from qualifying for PSLF.

"The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service — not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex," Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.

Advocacy groups said they plan to sue the administration over the changes to PSLF.

"This is a direct and unlawful attack on nurses, teachers, first responders, and public service workers across the country," advocacy groups Democracy Forward and Protect Borrowers said in a statement, adding: "That's why we will soon see the Trump-Vance administration in court."

The Department of Education said the changes will go into effect on July 1, 2026. Here's what you need to know.

The department's final rule changes the definition of a "qualifying employer," which previously used to be any government or nonprofit entity. The department said it will now exclude employers that have "substantial illegal purpose," including: supporting terrorism; helping transgender people transition; working with undocumented immigrants; and engaging in a "pattern" of violating state laws.

"When an organization has a pattern or practice of engaging in certain illegal conduct, they have a substantial illegal purpose because a significant amount of their activities are supporting illegal activity," the department's fact sheet said. "Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good."

The fact sheet said that employers following the law will not be impacted, along with those found to have "minor compliance issues."

The fact sheet said that the education secretary will weigh evidence of illegal activity to determine whether it is substantial enough to disqualify the employer from PSLF. Employers will receive notice and an opportunity to review the allegations of illegal activity, and they'll also be able to rebut the department's findings.

Borrowers will also receive a notice that their employer has been notified that they might no longer be eligible for PSLF. The department said the PSLF Help Tool, which helps borrowers find qualifying employers, will be updated to reflect any pending eligibility determinations.

If an employer is disqualified from PSLF, the fact sheet said they can reapply to be a qualifying employer after 10 years, or they can enter a "corrective action plan" before being disqualified to maintain PSLF eligibility. Borrowers are not able to appeal their employer's qualifying status themselves.

Once an employer no longer qualifies for PSLF, any payment borrowers make to that employer after July 1, 2026 will not count toward PSLF progress. However, any retroactive payments will not be disqualified.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took "no" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude.

Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast.

When asked what she was like as a 25-year-old prosecutor, Harris responded: "She was fearless. She didn't hear 'no it can't be done.'"

Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home.

"All the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom, and I asked the judge: 'Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend,'" Harris said.

"And the clerk was like: 'no, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day.' And I would not leave, and they called the case."

This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California.

"Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed," she added.

In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump.

Harris admitted that she experienced imposter syndrome in her career, especially when she was first elected district attorney in 2004.

"And there I was, sitting in the office, and I thought: 'Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States,'" the former vice president said on the podcast, adding that she felt a great responsibility in her role.

However, she put a positive spin on imposter syndrome, saying there's nothing wrong with having a little humility.

"I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, " she said.

At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her.

"When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are," she added.  "That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself."

Elon Musk isn't afraid to commit to the bit.

One day before he officially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he shared a video on his account that showed him carrying a sink into the social media platform's former headquarters in San Francisco.

"Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!," Musk wrote.

Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in! pic.twitter.com/D68z4K2wq7

During Friday's episode of the "All-In" podcast, Musk said that the video, which now has 1.2 million likes and 202,000 reposts, almost didn't happen.

"Well, I think the store was confused because my security team was asking for any kind of sink, and normally, people wouldn't ask for any kind of sink because you need a sink that fits in your bathroom or connects to a certain kind of plumbing," Musk said. "So, they're trying to ask, 'What kind of faucets do you want?' No, I just wanted a sink."

Musk said the store almost didn't sell them a sink out of concern.

"The store was confused that we just wanted a sink and didn't care what the sink connected to," Musk said. "They were, like, almost not letting us buy the sink because they thought maybe we'd buy the wrong sink."

"It's just rare that somebody wants a sink for sink's sake," Musk said.

Representatives for Musk and X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Twitter, now known as X, underwent major changes after Musk completed his takeover, including layoffs, office closures, and the discontinuation of the original blue checkmark verification feature.

Another significant shift happened this March when Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, acquired X in an all-stock deal.

"xAI and X's futures are intertwined," Musk wrote. "Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach."

Grok, a generative chatbot that debuted on the social media platform in November 2023, is just one example of how Musk is encouraging synergy.

The chatbot, powered by a large language model with the same name, can answer users' queries on X and in Tesla vehicles. It also has a stand-alone website.

Although Musk has shared plans to expand Grok's capabilities, the system has encountered some challenges. In July, the chatbot faced criticism after it shared several antisemitic posts, prompting xAI to apologize for its "horrific behavior."

"After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot," the company wrote on X.

The incident occurred days before xAI debuted Grok 4, the latest iteration of the chatbot.

Something went wrong

Stablecoins and payment use cases are exploding in popularity in crypto, drawing major institutional adoption while gaining a regulatory stamp of approval with the passing of the GENIUS Act in July 2025. 

The total stablecoin market cap has grown to more than $300 billion on-chain according to data from DeFi Llama, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has previously said that a $2 trillion market cap is reasonable for the asset class. 

Now, payments giant Stripe is collaborating with crypto venture firm Paradigm to build a blockchain specifically focused on stablecoins and their use in payments. 

Here's what you need to know. 

Tempo is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, layer-1 blockchain developed by Paradigm and Stripe. 

Unlike other layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana that are built for a wide variety of crypto activity, Tempo is purposefully designed for stablecoins and payments, banking on the experience Stripe has garnered from its 15 years in the field. 

In addition to promised low fees, the blockchain will operate at around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) and come with specific features designed to best facilitate real-world payment use cases and help bring more capital on-chain. 

The firm raised a $500 million Series A, valuing it around $5 billion, according to an October report from Fortune.

Tempo is being incubated by crypto venture firm Paradigm and global payments giant Stripe, with early design input from some of the world's largest companies—like OpenAI, Shopify, Visa, and more. 

The blockchain is initially using a set of independent validators, some run by early design partners, prior to transitioning to an open and permissionless network that enables validation by any interested party.

Additionally, in the early stages of Tempo's development, it is working with its design partners to test use cases on a private testnet related to real-world payments and stablecoin use, including cross-border payments, remittances, and more.

In September, Tempo unveiled a list of infrastructure partners that will help offer the building blocks of its network, including crypto wallets Phantom and MetaMask for wallet services, as well as protocols like Across and LayerZero for blockchain interoperability.

Stripe-acquired stablecoin platform Bridge and wallet infrastructure firm Privy are also included in the list of infrastructure partners. 

In October, the firm poached prominent Ethereum developer Dankrad Feist to help build out its network. 

Tempo's payments-focused design ensures that it maintains a feature set that's different from other networks. 

For example, the network allows for batch transfers and its transactions can make use of memo fields. Plus, its reported speeds of more than 100,000 TPS make it much faster than other popular layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana, which currently maintain true TPS numbers around 21.8 and 1,344 according to their respective block explorers.

Because Tempo is designed specifically for stablecoin use, it also comes equipped with an automated-market maker (AMM) that allows users to pay for gas or transaction fees with any stablecoin on the network. In other words, a user could pay for their transactions on Tempo with Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT stablecoin. 

Additionally, while blockchains are lauded for their transparency, Tempo boasts an opt-in privacy feature that allows users to keep select transaction data private while still adhering to typical financial compliance standards. 

Tempo is currently in private testnet, working with global design partners to build out existing payments use cases in a period of priority access. Some of its early design partners are also acting as the network's validators at present time. 

In the future, though, Tempo aims to be an open, permissionless blockchain, allowing any individuals to use, build, and participate in network validation.

Oops, something went wrong

Robert Kiyosaki has once again advocated for Bitcoin and Ethereum as potential safeguards against an impending significant financial crash.

Kiyosaki foresees a worldwide economic downturn in November. He shared these thoughts on his X account on Sunday.

Kiyosaki cautioned that the crash could obliterate millions of investors, especially those with investments in traditional assets such as stocks or bank savings. He proposed that silver, gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum could act as defensive investments during the crash.

MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. Take care

Kiyosaki has shown support for digital assets in the past. Last October, he questioned the traditional 60/40 investment rule that favors stocks and bonds, advocating for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as better long-term alternatives.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading higher by 0.24% and 1.14%, respectively. Bitcoin was priced at $110,081.79, while Ethereum stands at $3,876.06.

Kiyosaki's endorsement of Bitcoin and Ethereum as potential safe havens during a financial crash underscores the growing recognition of digital assets as viable investment alternatives.

His critique of the traditional 60/40 investment rule further emphasizes the shifting investment landscape, with digital assets increasingly being viewed as superior long-term alternatives.

This shift in perspective could potentially influence a broader acceptance and adoption of digital currencies, even as traditional markets face uncertainty.

The price of Bitcoin closed the historically bullish month of October on a loss for the first time in seven years. While the month started in typical fashion—on a bullish tear, the intense downturn didn't begin until October 10, when US President Donald Trump threatened new trade tariffs on China.

Now, although the United States and China seem to have found a temporary truce, the cryptocurrency market has been unable to find similar relief. In fact, the latest on-chain data suggests that US investors are still less optimistic about the digital asset market, specifically Bitcoin.

Negative Coinbase Gap Premium Coincides With Massive ETF Outflows 

In a November 1st post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the world's largest cryptocurrency has seen extremely low demand in the United States in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which has entered a deep red territory in the past few days.

This on-chain metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and the global Binance exchange (USDT pair). A positive difference indicates that the flagship cryptocurrency has a higher value on Coinbase than on Binance.

When the Coinbase Premium Gap is positive, it implies that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively. On the flip side, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap typically indicates heavy selling pressure for the market leader.

According to data highlighted by Maartunn, this on-chain metric is back around -$80, reflecting significant selling pressure from the US institutional players. This reduced demand can be seen with the disappointing performance of the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent days.

Data from SoSoValue shows the Bitcoin ETFs registered a total net outflow of more than $191 million on Friday. This marked the third consecutive day of negative outflows, having seen withdrawals of nearly $500 million each on Wednesday and Thursday.

From a historical perspective, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap is often correlated with periods of sluggish or downward movement for the BTC price. Hence, with the current intense selling pressure from large US investors, it is difficult to see the premier cryptocurrency making a strong recovery in the coming days.

Bitcoin Price At A Glance

As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $110,200, reflecting a measly 0.9% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down exactly 1% in the last seven days.

Bitcoin's quantum reckoning may still be years away, but the fear has already arrived. Breakthroughs from Google, Caltech, and IBM have reignited debate over a looming “Q-Day”—the moment when a quantum computer could shatter the cryptography securing Bitcoin and decentralized finance.

Yet experts warn that the real danger may come first from people—not equations—with panic, premature market reactions, and slow developer preparation could shake confidence long before any code actually fails.

In crypto, panic spreads faster than reason. The market may run on code, but emotion still moves the price.

Yoon Auh, founder of post-quantum cryptography company BOLTS Technologies, warned that even one mistaken claim about quantum computers breaking Bitcoin could set off a chain reaction, pointing to a recent flash crash in the market last month.

“Crypto had a little flash crash,” Auh told Decrypt. “A $50 to $100 million sell-off—basically nothing in traditional markets—triggered massive losses across blockchain assets. That shows how fragile the system still is.”

Earlier this month, a single post from President Donald Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese imports triggered the largest single-day crypto wipeout in history, erasing $19 billion in liquidations as Bitcoin briefly plunged below $102,000.

Auh said the same dynamic could unfold after a quantum scare: “Imagine hearing someone say, ‘[Elliptic-curve cryptography] can be broken now, maybe not instantly, but soon.' Everyone would rush for the exit. The system would trip over itself.”

The industry has seen it before. In 2017, a false 4Chan post claiming Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had died erased billions in market value before traders realized it was fake. The sell-off showed how quickly trust can collapse when information outruns verification.

Quantum computers operate on principles that differ from anything in classical computing. Instead of bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states at once. When qubits become linked—a property called entanglement—they can process many possibilities simultaneously. That property makes certain kinds of math, like factoring and discrete logarithms, exponentially more efficient to solve.

In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could, in theory, break the encryption securing everything from credit cards to Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin relies on elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, which turns private keys into public ones through equations that are easy to compute, but practically impossible to reverse.

A large-enough quantum computer could run Shor's algorithm to invert that math, revealing the private key behind any exposed public key on the blockchain.

Bitcoin's specific system, known as secp256k1, uses these elliptic-curve equations to generate and verify signatures. A quantum computer powerful enough to perform these calculations could recover private keys and empty wallets associated with visible public keys. A 256-bit elliptic-curve key provides roughly the same classical security as a 3,072-bit RSA key—extremely strong by today's standards.

For now, that danger remains theoretical. The world's largest quantum processors—IBM's Condor with 1,121 qubits and Caltech's neutral-atom array exceeding 6,000 qubits—are far from the millions of physical qubits needed to produce even a few thousand logical qubits for fault-tolerant computation.

Current research suggests that around 2,000 to 3,000 logical qubits would be required to break Bitcoin's elliptic-curve encryption with Shor's algorithm. Reaching that level will likely take another decade or more, though optimistic projections by IBM and Google place such machines in the early to mid-2030s.

“The quantum threat to cryptography is real and serious,” Edward Parker, a physicist at the RAND Corporation, told Decrypt. “Some people think quantum computers will never threaten encryption, and that might be true. But there's enough risk that we need to prepare well ahead of time.”

That measured caution often gets twisted online, and warnings meant to spark discussion and preparation instead fuel a wave of alarmism, and exaggerated ‘quantum apocalypse' rhetoric.

The U.S. government is already moving in that direction. A 2022 presidential directive, National Security Memorandum 10, ordered federal agencies to begin upgrading to post-quantum encryption—a rare case of long-term coordination across departments. Parker pointed to research in 2023 led by cryptographer Michele Mosca that put the median estimate for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer around 2037.

Research scientist Ian MacCormack agreed that public fear has run ahead of what the technology can actually do.

“Quantum computers are nowhere near powerful enough to break RSA-2048 or any encryption of meaningful size,” he said. “Getting the error rates down and combining thousands of qubits to do something practical will take time, money, and trial and error.”

MacCormack said the mystique of quantum computing, however, often amplifies fear.

“People hear about quantum computing and it sounds god-like or incomprehensible,” he said. “But regardless of its potential, it's just an incredibly difficult engineering problem. Developing quantum-resistant encryption will almost certainly happen faster than building a quantum computer capable of breaking current encryption.”

Coin Metrics co-founder and Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter recently called quantum computing “the biggest risk to Bitcoin.” In his essay "Bitcoin and the Quantum Problem," he notes that nearly a quarter of all Bitcoin—about 4 million coins—already sits in addresses that have exposed public keys. Those are theoretically vulnerable once practical quantum decryption arrives. Confidence in Bitcoin's unbreakable math could fracture long before the math itself does.

Even though the threat is distant, experts say the time to act is now—but it depends on broad coordination.

Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of post-quantum cybersecurity company QuSecure, said the next step is clear: elliptic-curve cryptography has to go.

“You'd need to replace that with one of the post-quantum standardized algorithms like ML-DSA,” she told Decrypt.

ML-DSA, short for Module Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, is a new post-quantum cryptography standard developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It's built on lattice-based math, a branch of cryptography that hides information within multidimensional grids of numbers.

Cracking those grids would require solving what's known as the “Learning With Errors” problem—an equation so complex that even a powerful quantum computer can't untangle it efficiently. That makes ML-DSA far more resistant to decryption than the elliptic-curve systems used in Bitcoin today.

Only a few blockchains today are truly quantum-resistant, while most are still adapting to post-quantum cryptography.

Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) was built for quantum safety, using the XMSS hash-based signature scheme standardized by NIST. Cellframe and Algorand use lattice-based algorithms from the NIST suite—Crystals-Dilithium, FALCON, and NTRU—allowing flexible, modular upgrades as standards evolve. IOTA relies on Winternitz one-time signatures in its “Tangle” network, protecting transactions from quantum key recovery. Nervos Network combines classical and lattice-based systems in a hybrid model that enables gradual migration to post-quantum security.

Major chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana remain in transition. Ethereum's 3.0 roadmap includes active research and testnets for post‑quantum signatures, while Bitcoin's modular Taproot and Schnorr upgrades provide the groundwork for integrating future quantum‑safe cryptography.

That kind of upgrade is feasible, but politically complex. Bitcoin's security model relies on network-wide consensus among miners, developers, and node operators. Any cryptographic change would require a fork, and that process takes years of discussion and testing.

“Quantum computing can sound abstract,” Krauthamer said. “But the fix is surprisingly straightforward. We already have the math. Governments are mandating quantum-safe standards, and finance will follow. The hard part is making people care before it's urgent.”

Most experts say the safest path is gradual: add post-quantum support now through new address types or hybrid signatures, get custodians and wallets to use them for new funds, and slowly migrate older wallets. That prevents the chaos of everyone rotating keys at once—a scenario that could damage confidence faster than any real quantum attack.

Bitcoin contributors have already explored post-quantum signatures and hybrid schemes in developer forums. The challenge isn't finding algorithms; it's deciding when and how to deploy them.

Scott Aaronson, a computer science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Bitcoin's decentralized model makes upgrades difficult.

“With Ethereum and most other chains, someone can decide to migrate to quantum-resistant crypto when it becomes urgent,” he told Decrypt. “With Bitcoin, you'd need a majority of miners to agree to a fork. And something like $100 billion worth of early coins are still protected only by ECC.”

That lack of central authority could slow adoption. A split or rushed rollout might fracture the network. Still, many Bitcoin developers argue that once a viable upgrade path exists, consensus will form around working code.

Ethereum and Solana have more flexible governance and could adapt faster. Bitcoin's caution has protected it from bad ideas, but that same conservatism makes big changes hard to implement.

A quantum computer powerful enough to break Bitcoin's encryption doesn't exist yet. Current prototypes count qubits in the thousands, but not the millions of error-corrected qubits required for stable, scalable attacks.

Late last month, Google announced a new milestone in its quantum research: Its 105-qubit “Willow” processor completed a physics simulation in just over two hours that would take the Frontier supercomputer more than three years to reproduce. The experiment used 65 active qubits across 23 circuit layers, and achieved median two-qubit gate errors near 0.0015. The result marked a verifiable quantum speed-up but posed no threat to encryption—progress, not peril.

Even researchers who view quantum computing as a long-term threat say the real danger is still years away.

“I think quantum computation has a reasonable probability—say, more than five percent—of being a major, even existential, long-term risk to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Christopher Peikert, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Decrypt. “However, it doesn't appear to be a real risk in the next few years. Quantum-computing technology and engineering still have too far to go before they can threaten modern cryptography.”

The harder part, Peikert added, will be performance once post-quantum systems are deployed. “Post-quantum signatures use much larger keys,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies rely on many signatures for transactions and blocks, switching to post-quantum or hybrid signatures would significantly increase network traffic and block sizes.”

As for near-term protection, Peikert said the best mitigation is behavioral, not technological.

“In the short term, one should avoid revealing public keys on a public network until absolutely necessary, and give those keys short lifetimes,” he said. “Longer-term, core protocols should be carefully updated to incorporate post-quantum cryptography for the most important functionalities and assets.”

Express agrees that quantum computing won't break Bitcoin anytime soon; what matters is whether the community can stay calm when it does.

Yet again, the digital economy was caught off guard when Amazon Web Services suffered its second major outage this year on Oct. 20, crippling exchange platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood and the analytics service Coinmarketcap. It was followed by a second, smaller outage just 10 days later.



According to Amazon's initial report, the Oct. 20 outage was caused by a malfunction affecting one of its internal subsystems that manages its domain name service, leading to connectivity issues in multiple services. It resulted from a faulty update, and it ended up taking out Amazon's critical U.S.-East-1 region. This is a massive hub of servers that powers many of the country's top internet services. For two hours, numerous trading platforms, streaming services, payment providers and gaming networks were inaccessible to users globally.



No doubt, Amazon's engineers were working overtime to try and fix the outage, and to the company's credit the vast majority of services that reported problems were back online within a couple of hours. But the incident once again highlights the hazards of relying on centralized infrastructure, coming just months after a similar outage in Amazon's eu-north-1 region. Going offline causes pain in just about every business, but for the crypto industry, where billions of dollars in value are traded by the hour, such events are unacceptable.





Although it's quite rare for centralized cloud platforms like Amazon to go down, it does happen from time to time. And when it does, the impact is very often monumental, affecting millions if not billions of people globally. A case in point, just six months earlier, Amazon suffered a similar disruption, taking out two of the world's biggest crypto platforms — Binance and Kucoin — for several hours. Amazon isn't alone in this either, for rival clouds like Google and Microsoft Azure have suffered crippling outages of their own. In fact, Azure was down for several hours on Oct. 29, with reports suggesting it took offline numerous websites and online services.



The problem with centralized infrastructure is that it's, well, centralized. The weakness of these platforms is that they introduce single points of failure, due to the way they rely on critical components that, if taken offline, cause the entire system to come crashing down. It might be as simple as something like a computer server or a database that contains vital configuration settings, or a lone network connection that lacks redundancy. These vulnerabilities exist in every cloud, and no matter how diligent operators are they'll always present a risk.



Coinbase was among the first services to report problems in the wake of Amazon's mishap, and it stepped up quickly to reassure its users that their funds are safe and secure. But this clarity doesn't fix the underlying issues of frozen transactions and delayed market orders —hat occur when systems go offline without any warning. The longer the delay, the more the price of an asset might move, meaning the trader cannot capitalize on this. They may even lose money if the price of an asset dips shortly after they entered a position, and they're unable to sell.



While it's impossible to calculate the exact impact, it's likely that the paralysis inflicted on traders caused them pain and financial losses.





One possible way to prevent this is for crypto exchanges to at least partially switch to a more resilient, decentralized infrastructure that eliminates these single points of failure. By operating some key modules of the trading system on a distributed network of servers, exchanges will all but eliminate the potential for such calamities.



For an industry that prides itself on decentralization and constantly lauds its benefits, to be so reliant on vulnerable centralized cloud platforms for their own infrastructure feels like hypocrisy. While blockchain networks are distributed across many hundreds of nodes, very few exchange platforms can say the same, instead choosing to host all of their infrastructure on one or another cloud provider.

Fortunately, Monday's outage was not quite as serious as previous incidents have been, because Amazon had most services back up and running within a couple of hours, but nonetheless it should serve as a wakeup call for the crypto industry to get its act together. Decentralized cloud infrastructure still has teething problems around latency, network coordination and scalability, but it's maturing rapidly to support a hybrid cloud strategy at the very least. By distributing their data and systems across an expansive network, exchanges can become virtually immune to the total blackouts caused by an outage of this kind. 



Centralized clouds will always have their place due to their immense scale, high performance, enterprise-grade security and the specialized services they offer, which decentralized alternatives cannot match. They will likely remain the backbone of the internet for many years to come, but they will never be able to replicate the resilience of decentralized alternatives. With crypto exchanges commanding billions of dollars of customer funds in a market where every second counts, they need to step up and make sure this episode doesn't happen again.

It's not exactly news to frustrated bitcoin BTC$110,210.77 bulls that risk assets across the planet for months have been recording what seem like daily record highs while the price action in BTC remains rather muted.

"What if everyone is looking at this wrong," asks longtime traditional finance asset manager Jordi Visser in a heavily shared (1.5M views on X and counting) weekend essay titled "Bitcoin's Silent IPO: Why This Consolidation Isn't What You Think."

While bitcoin never had a traditional IPO, the factors liming price gains are nearly exactly the same as those which cause poor price performance in stock IPOs, argues Visser.

Tradfi IPOs and the months that follow, reminds Visser — particularly in tech — are major liquidity events for early investors.

"Early-stage investors take enormous risks," wrote Visser. "If the investment succeeds, they deserve enormous rewards. But eventually, and this is crucial, they need to realize those gains. They need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify."

The examples, particularly in tech, are legion, but consider the Facebook (now Meta) IPO of 2012. The offering at $38 per share raised $16 billion at a valuation of $104 billion — quaint numbers today, but staggering amounts at the time. One year later, the stock was 30% lower, with pundits questions Mark Zuckerberg's leadership.

More likely than missteps by Zuck, it was early investors — be they his Harvard buddies, or Silicon Valley types, or the carpenters who framed out Facebook's first offices (who took pay in shares rather than cash) using public markets to realize life-changing profits.

Importantly, says Visser, the early investors don't hit the bid all at once. "They're methodically distributing their positions. They're being careful. They don't want to crater the price. They're patient. They've waited years for this moment. They can wait a few more months to do it right."

The result, he says: "A sideways grind that drives everyone crazy." Sound familiar?

"The on-chain data tells a clear story if you know how to read it," says Visser, turning to bitcoin. "Old coins, coins that haven't moved in years, some dormant since the single-digit price days, are suddenly active."

The ETFs, the institutional adoption, the friendly regulatory environment ... this created IPO-like conditions for bitcoin's early believers.

"For years, the liquidity simply didn't exist," he wrote. "Try selling $100 million of bitcoin in 2015. You'd crater the price. Try selling $1 billion in 2019. Same problem. The market couldn't absorb it."

"But now," he continued. "ETFs are providing institutional bid. Major companies hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds are getting involved. The market has finally matured to the point where early holders can exit significant positions without causing chaos."

Again, reminds Visser, it's not being done all at once — no one is interested in crashing the price. But instead, steadily and methodically: hence the sideways grind and the rallies that reverse so quickly.

What's occurring now is hardly anything that can be called a bear market, says Visser, but instead a distribution of ownership.

Over the long run, this is a bullish event, but the process — at least in traditional markets — can take 6-18 months. Even though cycles often get sped up in crypto, Visser suspects there could be many more months of this frustrating price action in bitcoin.

"Sentiment will only improve after the distribution is substantially complete," he wrote. "People are demoralized because they don't understand what phase we're in. They're waiting for bitcoin to 'catch up' to stocks. They are worried about the four year cycle. Be patient. Once the heavy selling pressure lifts, once the patient accumulation by institutions has absorbed the OG supply, the path becomes clearer."

The NFT world has changed a lot, right? Gone are the days when it was all about digital art. Now, it's about utility and real value, and the Milk Mocha project is a prime example of this shift. It shows us that NFTs can be functional assets in a living ecosystem. Let's take a moment to unpack Milk Mocha's innovative approach and how it can redefine crypto payroll solutions for SMEs. This could enhance engagement and value for both employers and employees.

So Milk Mocha's NFTs aren't just pretty pictures. They're keys to something bigger. The $HUGS token is the only currency you can use to buy these NFTs, which creates a solid link between the collectibles and the token itself. This means they have real, recurring value. In crypto payroll, we could do something similar. Imagine linking tokens to real, functional benefits like employee rewards or governance participation. That would be something, wouldn't it?

Community involvement is huge for Milk Mocha. The Milk Mocha DAO lets token holders be part of decision-making. They can help decide themes for future NFT collections. This kind of model makes people feel involved and invested. It's important for any crypto payroll solution. If SMEs adopt this community governance model, it could boost employee satisfaction and retention. Imagine a workplace that listens and engages with its employees.

Another thing Milk Mocha does is employ deflationary mechanics. Tokens get burned during transactions and NFT upgrades. This may reduce the total supply and increase the value over time. For SMEs, a similar deflationary mechanic could help maintain or even increase token value. This might encourage employees to hold on to their tokens. It's not a bad idea, especially with stablecoin adoption on freelancer platforms rising.

Milk Mocha connects the digital and physical worlds by linking NFTs to real merch. This means employees can enjoy perks like early access to exclusive products. It makes the experience richer. If SMEs bridge the gap between digital assets and physical goods, it could create a more rewarding crypto payroll system. Employees want both digital and real-world benefits, after all.

The lessons from Milk Mocha could shake up the way SMEs adopt crypto payroll solutions. A utility-driven token ecosystem, community engagement, and deflationary mechanics could make for a more satisfying employee experience. The rise of Web3 business banking and crypto-friendly payroll platforms makes this transition easier. It opens doors for companies to hire globally with crypto and pay employees in digital currencies.

As "Pay Me in Bitcoin" becomes a trend among tech workers, SMEs must adapt. The insights from Milk Mocha's NFT model could help create a sustainable and motivating crypto payroll ecosystem. It could go beyond simple payments to actually engaging and rewarding employees.

Milk Mocha teaches us that for crypto payroll to work, we need to create real utility and value for tokens. Flexibility and transparency are key, as is fostering community governance. Brand engagement can't be overlooked. As the crypto-HR intersection evolves, businesses that embrace these principles will be set up for success. With potential recurring demand and employee loyalty, Milk Mocha shows us how digital collectibles can be the functional, in-demand heart of a digital economy.

Senior Contributor.

Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire whose electric car company holds more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin, has again warned the U.S. is hurtling toward bankruptcy (just as U.S Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issued a surprise bitcoin endorsement).

Musk, who has set crypto alarm bells ringing by moving some of the near-$1 billion worth of bitcoin he also controls via his rocket company SpaceX, helped U.S. president Donald Trump back into the White House last year with his dire warnings of imminent financial catastrophe.

Now, as traders brace for the “mother of all” Federal Reserve pivots, Musk has warned it's not possible to solve the U.S. debt crisis without growing the economy at a fantastic pace—something that bitcoin supporters think will blow up the bitcoin price.

“It would be accurate to say that even unless you could go like super draconian … on cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country then …. there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis,” Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan. 

U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $38 trillion U.S. debt pile.

“The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget and growing. This is crazy,” Musk told Rogan during their marathon, three-hour conversation.

Musk, who joined the Trump administration via his Doge department of government efficiency, dramatically fell out with president Donald Trump earlier this year over Trump's signature tax and spend bill that's expected to add trillions of dollars to the national debt over the next decade. 

Musk then confirmed speculation his new America Party would adopt bitcoin, calling the U.S. dollar and other so-called fiat currencies that aren't backed by assets, “hopeless.”

However, Musk appears to have since all-but given up on the idea of preventing the U.S. from falling into “bankruptcy” via cost-cutting. 

“Even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes goes bankrupt,” Musk said. 

“I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. We need to grow the economy at a rate that allows us to pay off our debt."

The spiraling U.S. debt pile topped $38 trillion last month, up, $500 billion in October alone, according to analysts with The Kobeissi Letter.

“It is a horrible, no good situation,” Anthony Pompliano, a bitcoin and crypto influencer and the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, wrote in an emailed note.

“The only thing I know to do is opt-out of the broken system with some portion of my economic value. The higher the national debt goes, the higher bitcoin will go. And it doesn't appear either of them will stop any time soon.”

The bitcoin price has soared in recent years alongside the swelling U.S. debt pile, with traders this year naming its rally along with gold as the “debasement trade.”

“In the long term, the investment case for bitcoin and other risk assets remains intact,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and cofounder of The Coin Bureau, said via email.

The bitcoin price topped $126,000 per bitcoin in early October but has failed to maintain the rally that's seen it more than double from its 2024 lows, dropping back as traders pile into gold and stocks while the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to further cut interest rates and loosen its monetary policy.

“We're seeing easing monetary conditions across the globe—not just the U.S.—so fiat currency debasement is inevitable,” Puckrin said. "In the short term, though, volatility still reigns supreme. Any trader considering high leverage in this market should think long and hard before committing.”

The race for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is heating up, with central banks around the globe vying to get their digital currencies out the door. This shift is changing the game for fintech startups and established players like Ripple. Here's a closer look at how CBDCs are altering the digital finance landscape, Ripple's positioning of XRP as a bridge currency, and the new opportunities emerging in payments.

CBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency, created and regulated by the central bank. Their arrival is set to shake up the way we think about money, including how we move, store, and use it. This change presents significant operational challenges for fintech startups, compelling them to adapt their traditional business models to fit with CBDC infrastructure.

With the growth of CBDCs, disintermediation might occur, wherein consumers increasingly rely on bank-sponsored digital wallets, which could limit fintechs' access to customer funds and transaction activities. But, on the flip side, this also paves the way for innovative products and services that can harness CBDC functionalities, such as automated payment systems and investment mechanisms tied to digital currency holdings.

Ripple has consistently placed itself at the forefront of the financial evolution, and acquiring Hidden Road—a global prime brokerage—was a strategic move to bolster its position in institutional finance. This acquisition enables banks and hedge funds to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem without going through intermediaries.

As banks begin rolling out their own stablecoins, Ripple's mission to interconnect isolated financial networks via the XRP Ledger becomes even more pertinent. XRP's unique ability to serve as a bridge between disparate systems positions Ripple as a vital player capable of linking these emerging silos, ensuring smooth transactions in a fragmented financial scene.

XRP stands out as a prime bridge currency, facilitating swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions. Unlike traditional banking systems or many stablecoins that depend on middlemen, XRP settles transactions on-chain in mere seconds. This is crucial in a world where banks are launching their own digital currencies, potentially creating isolated "walled gardens" of liquidity.

While stablecoins from banks may offer stability and regulatory confidence, XRP's decentralized nature allows for transactions across various regulatory landscapes. This positions XRP as a complementary asset, rather than a rival to stablecoins, enhancing its utility in global digital transactions.

The emergence of CBDCs and stablecoins opens up new avenues for innovation within Web3 banking. Fintech startups can harness CBDC capabilities to develop fresh financial solutions catering to consumers and businesses alike. For example, cross-border crypto payroll solutions can drive financial inclusion, enabling unbanked populations to access digital financial services.

As demand for crypto payroll solutions surges, companies may also find value in paying salaries in cryptocurrencies, tapping into the trend of workers seeking roles with crypto compensation. This not only boosts employee satisfaction but also positions firms as forward-thinking players in the ever-evolving digital economy.

The rise of CBDCs and the strategic positioning of Ripple's XRP are set to redefine digital finance. Fintech startups need to adjust to this new environment by upgrading their tech and aligning with regulatory standards. As banks scramble to launch their own digital currencies, Ripple's focus on connectivity and liquidity is a timely approach for this new reality.

In this swiftly shifting financial ecosystem, it seems that CBDCs, stablecoins, and decentralized currencies like XRP will coexist, shaping the future of digital transactions. By embracing innovation and collaboration, fintechs can navigate the obstacles and capitalize on the opportunities of this transformative financial period.

The Ethereum price prediction discussion has intensified after steady bids returned to large-cap cryptocurrencies. Ethereum holds the second spot in terms of value and remains the primary settlement token for DeFi and NFTs. The focus now is whether momentum can carry ETH through year-end and what could benefit most if it does.

This is where Remittix enters the discussion. It is an ETH-aligned build that aims to convert on-chain value into money that can reach bank accounts. The angle is simple. If an Ethereum Price Prediction is bullish, a payments-first ETH project like Remittix can gain because demand is tied to use.



Ethereum currently trades near $3,892 with a market cap of around $470 billion and a 24-hour volume near $24 billion, signalling active flows into the crypto market. The $3,800 area acts as a nearby support, and $4,000 remains a level to watch for a break. A hold above support keeps the Ethereum Price Prediction tilted upward in the near term. A clear reclaim of $4,000 would add confidence to that view.

Over the last week, news highlighted steady interest tied to exchange-traded product flows and key spot levels. Analysts noted that $3,800 support and $4,000 resistance are guiding intraday bias, with ETF flows adding follow-through when topside breaks hold.

Sentiment is cautiously positive while range conditions persist. In brief, the base case Ethereum Price Prediction leans constructive if the price holds above support and volume stays firm.





Compared with ETH, which anchors the settlement layer, Remittix focuses on the last mile. The Remittix DeFi project aims to move value from wallets to real bank accounts in many countries. That ties performance to actual payment demand, not only to market cycles.

If an Ethereum Price Prediction calls for higher activity and fees, a payment rail that converts on-chain value into fiat can benefit from the same lift and gain. This makes Remittix a cleaner play on utility within the broader crypto market.

Remittix is audited and the team is verified, and RTX holds the number one rank for Pre-Launch Tokens on Skynet with a Grade A score near 80. The wallet beta is live and expanding to more iOS users, with the top ten weekly purchasers invited.

The project reports that it has sold over 681 million tokens, is priced at $0.1166, and has raised over $27.7 million. Listings are secured with a third listing in progress. A 15% USDT referral is live, a $250,000 giveaway is active, and the RTX50 code offers a 50% bonus for a limited time as the raise nears $30 million.

Here Is What Stands Out About Remittix As Investors Look For The Best Crypto To Buy Now:

Ethereum Price Prediction narratives work when there is a clear link to usage. ETH provides the base, and projects that help people move money across borders can magnify gains when activity rises. Remittix sits in that lane and ties value to payment outcomes.

If ETH breaks and holds above key levels into the year-end, the projects that convert those flows into bank money can lead the move. That is why Remittix stands out as attention shifts to utility.

The crypto market has faced one of its longest and toughest periods for altcoins. Many investors who held through this phase are sitting on steep losses, with prices struggling to recover despite strong macro signals. Analyst Michael van de Poppe believes this exhaustion phase could be nearing its end.

According to him, the recent correction after the Federal Reserve's latest meeting has shaken market confidence, but the underlying data shows a shift is coming. The Fed decided to cut rates by 25 basis points and plans to end quantitative tightening by December 1. This move could mean that the tightening phase of the cycle is almost over—a condition that has historically marked the start of new bull markets.

In previous cycles, similar monetary policy changes have triggered massive runs in crypto. In 2020, when the Fed began cutting rates and launched quantitative easing, Bitcoin and altcoins entered a powerful bull phase. On the flip side, the tightening and rate hikes that began in late 2021 started the bear market investors are still feeling today.

This time, conditions again point to a transition. Inflation is no longer the Fed's main concern; employment and economic growth are taking priority. Weak labor and business data could force the Fed into more rate cuts. That would boost liquidity and create a favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Van de Poppe said that gold, often a signal of risk-off sentiment, has recently peaked and fallen by nearly 10 percent. Historically, when gold cools off after a strong run, money begins flowing back into risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto.

Bitcoin remains in a tight range around the $109,000 level, but its valuation compared to assets like gold and copper suggests it is undervalued. Van de Poppe expects this lag to close as liquidity shifts, potentially sending Bitcoin toward $150,000–$170,000 in the coming quarters.

As Bitcoin regains momentum, altcoins are likely to follow. Many smaller cryptocurrencies are already showing signs of bullish divergence, a pattern that often marks the beginning of a recovery.

While the market reaction to the Fed meeting was negative in the short term, the longer-term setup looks increasingly favorable. The end of quantitative tightening, possible rate cuts, and a cooling gold market all point toward a return to risk-taking.

This combination could mark the early stages of a new cycle. Altcoins, which have been in deep correction for months, may finally see relief once Bitcoin breaks key resistance around $112,000.

Une erreur s'est produite

TORONTO — Anticipation is building on what the federal government might say in Tuesday's budget about the buzziest corner of the crypto world.

Stablecoins, the kind of crypto asset that aims to mirror real-world currencies rather than replace them, have been growing fast enough to raise fears they could eventually destabilize Canada's finances if the country doesn't change its approach.

There have been increasing calls to simplify the rules to make it easier to launch Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins, and stem the potential outflow of capital from the country.

“At a minimum, from a sovereignty perspective, Canadians should want a Canadian stablecoin," said Didier Lavallée, chief executive of digital assets company Tetra Digital Group.

Concerns have risen since the United States passed legislation this past summer that establishes clear rules around the sector, and further entrenched U.S.-dollar dominance in the space that touts faster and cheaper money transfers.

Because stablecoins are meant to reflect the value of conventional currencies, issuers need to buy hard assets like dollars to back them up. No Canadian-dollar pegged stablecoins means more money flowing out of Canada, and into U.S. dollars and U.S. government bonds.

"Canada should also weigh the merits of federal stablecoin regulation," said Ron Morrow, executive director of payments at the Bank of Canada, in a September speech.

His former colleague Timothy Lane, who stepped down as deputy governor in 2022, was a little more blunt in an October report for the Global Risk Institute.

"Stablecoins are becoming too important to be ignored," said Lane.

"There is now an increasing sense of urgency about establishing a coherent framework for regulating stablecoins in Canada."

Peter Routledge, head of Canada's banking regulator, has also said he's worried about the fast moving space and will be watching the budget closely on Nov. 4, while John Ruffolo, managing partner at Maverix Private Equity, has been one of the most outspoken in the need to respond.

One of Ruffolo's biggest worries is that some people and businesses could start to leave money in the stablecoin sphere, rather than in bank deposits.

That's already how stablecoins first gained traction: as a stable place for crypto-traders to park money between bets, without having to exchange it back into conventional currencies.

Given banks use deposits as an anchor for lending, he's warned that even if five per cent of Canadian bank deposits, or some $135 billion, went into U.S. stablecoins, it would have a knock-on effect of erasing as much as $675 billion in domestic lending capacity.

The rising calls have increased expectations of some movement from the federal government, but given how slowly past promises like open banking have actually rolled out, some companies like Tetra aren't waiting around for change before pushing ahead with their own stablecoins.

“Financial innovation in this country takes quite a long time,” said Lavallée.

Because Tetra is already registered as a Canadian trust company, Lavallée sees an easier road than others to getting regulatory approval through the current system.

Tetra's efforts have also had a boost from major backers like Wealthsimple, National Bank, ATB Financial and Shopify, which chipped in on a $10 million financing to help ready a stablecoin for release aimed at early next year.

Elsewhere, Transactix Financial Inc. announced plans in May to move forward on its own token, and just last week Loon Technology Inc. announced it had raised $3 million to get its own Canadian-dollar stablecoin going.

The companies are all working to navigate an existing system that some, at least, aren't so concerned about.

“I think it's working well,” said Grant Vingoe, head of the Ontario Securities Commission that's taken a lead role in stablecoin oversight.

While the U.S. has used legislation, Canada's approach to working with each issuer is more adaptable in the fast-moving crypto space, he said.

“There's a lot to be said for a more tailored, direct engagement approach, where you express your concerns and requirements ... rather than try and codify it once and for all.”

So far that approach has yielded a single issuer, Circle, getting the blessing of regulators for its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.

But Vingoe is also still skeptical about how much uptake there will actually be for stablecoins.

“I think it's still an open question whether stablecoins will be used extensively as a payment mechanism."

Improvements to the existing payment system could end up being better or more efficient, he said.

Some have pointed to central banks possibly issuing their own digital currencies, though the Bank of Canada has shelved work on such efforts.

Conventional banks are also working to adapt to the rising interest.

Swift, the private system that underpins global banking money flows, announced in late September that it was working “at pace” to add a blockchain-based digital ledger to allow real-time, round-the-clock cross-border payments.

Banks including RBC and TD Bank Group are among the more than 30 involved in the effort.

Vingoe also pointed to concerns about how widely stablecoins are used for illicit purposes, and said that overall Canada should find its own path, rather than imitating others.

“I worry a little bit about speed leading to sort of a bandwagon effect."

While it's not clear how much growth there may be in Canada, the global market is expected to balloon.

Citigroup said in a September report that it sees the total pool of stablecoins growing from about US$200 billion at the start of 2025 to US$1.9 trillion by 2030 as its base case, or US$4 trillion in its bull case.

As for the federal government, Finance Department spokesman Benoit Sabourin said in an statement that they're working on it.

“The government continues to work closely with federal and provincial regulators to assess these risks and evaluate measures that could be considered to mitigate them, while ensuring that opportunities are not missed.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) started November quietly, holding steady near $110,350 after a flat 24 hours. The Bitcoin price chart still points to a possible reversal as the pattern remains intact — a structure that usually signals a major upward shift.

But despite that, BTC has failed to break out. On-chain data explains what's keeping the move stuck and what could finally change it.

Bitcoin's cost basis distribution heatmap — a chart showing where investors last bought their coins — highlights why BTC keeps struggling near current levels.

Between $110,000 and $112,500, there's a heavy supply zone where about 434,000 BTC were last accumulated. These dense clusters often act as resistance, as many traders who bought at these levels look to sell when prices revisit their cost basis.

The heatmap helps identify where big pockets of holder activity are concentrated, showing which price levels act as support or resistance.

This particular supply wall between $110,000 and $112,500 has been capping BTC's rally attempts for a week. In the price chart — which we'll come to later — the same level also aligns with an important technical marker, reinforcing the validity of this range.

Until Bitcoin closes firmly above $112,500, the reversal pattern remains valid but paused, waiting for a clear catalyst.

Whales may be the ones bringing that catalyst. On-chain data indicates that large wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC are resuming accumulation.

The 30-day whale address count change has turned positive (+6) for the first time since August 31, suggesting accumulation has resumed after months of dormancy.

Meanwhile, the total number of whale addresses dipped to a three-month low on October 27 but has been climbing since, now sitting around the same level last seen on October 3.

This increase shows renewed confidence from big players, a trend that often appears before price breakouts. The dashboard tracking these wallets also includes exchange, ETF, and custodian addresses, giving a broad view of institutional activity.

If this steady rise continues, it could help BTC absorb the selling pressure around $112,500, setting the stage for a potential breakout.

Technically, Bitcoin still trades inside a clear inverse head and shoulders formation. A daily close above $116,400 would confirm the breakout, paving the way for targets at $122,000, $125,900, and $130,800.

Adding to this bullish setup, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) — a tool that measures buying and selling strength — shows a bullish divergence.

Between October 22 and October 30, Bitcoin's price made lower lows while RSI made higher lows. This move often signals a trend reversal and the start of upward momentum.

Please note that on the BTC price chart, $112,590 is the key resistance level. This level validates the breakout-stalling theory pushed forth by the cost basis heatmap. For BTC, this $112,500-$112,590 zone might be the most crucial one in the near-term.

However, if Bitcoin breaks below $106,200, the breakout structure that remains intact may begin to lose shape. A further drop under $103,500 would invalidate the entire bullish pattern, confirming that sellers have regained full control.

Home - Crypto Presales - Remittix ICO Heads Into Closing Stages With A Huge 50% Bonus! Why Do Many Believe It Will Replicate SHIB's & Dogecoin's Historic Runs?

Renewed excitement keeps building in the cryptocurrency market as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin remain in the limelight among investors. Retail enthusiasm stirred up by news of a Dogecoin ETF and fluctuations in the price of Shiba Inu has set off a round of speculation in altcoins.

In such an environment, Solana-based projects and utility-driven tokens are gaining traction as investors look for platforms offering real-world use cases. Amongst the newer projects, Remittix (RTX) has positioned itself well, blending innovation with real-world practicality in DeFi space solution provisions for making payments.

Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000992, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $5.83 billion and a trading volume of $171.77 million in the last 24 hours, up 27.25%. 











Dogecoin is at $0.1849, up 1.96% in the last 24 hours, and retains a market capitalization of $27.9 billion, though its trading volume has fallen 40.26% to $2.07 billion. Interest in DOGE has been revived following news of a potential Dogecoin ETF, reflecting how signals from institutions can influence retail trading patterns.












The Solana ecosystem does look promising, with more and more projects implementing DeFi and cross-chain capabilities into their systems. Among the low gas fee crypto initiatives is Remittix, choosing Solana's network for faster and cheaper transactions, hence making such platforms practical alternatives to Ethereum-based solutions.

Remittix is a token that changes hands at $0.1166 each, while it has been able to raise over $27.7 m in private funding. Over 681.8 m RTX tokens have already been sold, indicating strong community engagement of interest.


Recently, it expanded the Wallet Beta Testing Program to iOS users, allowing the top 10 purchasers every week to give their valuable feedback for refinement of the platform.

Moreover, the Remittix team has acquired full CertiK verification and is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, which attests to its commitment to security and transparency. That includes a 15% referral rewards program, crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries, and a $250,000 community give-away that sets up the token for utility and growth potential.











How Remittix Is Turning Utility Into Market Strength

Investor confidence, practical use cases, and community-driven features place Remittix among the most promising projects in DeFi during 2025. While all attention is turned to the latest events around Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Solana-based initiatives, RTX is quietly getting ready for mainstream with tangible real-world applications.

With strong market momentum, robust security credentials, and an expanding user base, Remittix has shown just how a utility-first token can take center stage among meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE. Practical payment solutions and active community involvement show that RTX is not only following trends but is actually building for long-term crypto adoption.

Astronomers have produced the first three-dimensional map of a planet outside our solar system, revealing distinct temperature regions, including one so hot that water vapor breaks apart. The findings appear in Nature Astronomy, published October 28, 2025.

Led by researchers at the University of Maryland and Cornell University, the study charts temperatures across WASP-18b, a massive gas giant classified as an "ultra-hot Jupiter" located 400 light-years from Earth. The team applied a method known as 3D eclipse mapping, also called spectroscopic eclipse mapping, marking the first time this technique has been used to build a full 3D temperature map. The work expands on a 2D eclipse map the group released in 2023 using highly sensitive observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

"This technique is really the only one that can probe all three dimensions at once: latitude, longitude and altitude," said the paper's co-lead author Megan Weiner Mansfield, an assistant professor of astronomy at UMD. "This gives us a higher level of detail than we've ever had to study these celestial bodies."

With this approach, scientists can begin charting atmospheric differences across many exoplanets observable by JWST, much as ground-based telescopes once documented Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its banded clouds.

"Eclipse mapping allows us to image exoplanets that we can't see directly, because their host stars are too bright," said the paper's co-lead author Ryan Challener, a postdoctoral associate in Cornell University's Department of Astronomy. "With this telescope and this new technique, we can start to understand exoplanets along the same lines as our solar system neighbors."

Spotting exoplanets is difficult because they are typically far dimmer than their stars, often contributing less than 1% of the total light. Eclipse mapping measures tiny variations in that light as the planet moves behind its star, alternately hiding and revealing different regions. By tying these small brightness changes to specific locations on the planet and analyzing them in multiple colors, scientists can reconstruct temperatures across latitude, longitude, and altitude.

WASP-18b is well suited for this test because it has about the mass of 10 Jupiters, completes an orbit in only 23 hours, and reaches temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Those properties provide a comparatively strong signal for the new mapping method.

The team's earlier 2D map used a single color of light. For the 3D version, they reanalyzed the same JWST data from the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) across many wavelengths. Each color probes different layers of WASP-18b's atmosphere and corresponds to a specific temperature and altitude. Combining these layers yields a detailed three-dimensional temperature structure.

"If you build a map at a wavelength that water absorbs, you'll see the water deck in the atmosphere, whereas a wavelength that water does not absorb will probe deeper," Challener explained. "If you put those together, you can get a 3D map of the temperatures in this atmosphere."

The 3D analysis identifies spectroscopically distinct zones on the planet's permanent dayside, which always faces the star because the planet is tidally locked. A circular hot spot sits where the star's light strikes most directly, and winds appear too weak to spread that heat efficiently. A cooler ring encircles the hot center near the limb of the planet. Measurements also show reduced water vapor within the hot spot compared with the planet's average.

"We've seen this happen on a population level, where you can see a cooler planet that has water and then a hotter planet that doesn't have water," Weiner Mansfield explained. "But this is the first time we've seen this be broken across one planet instead. It's one atmosphere, but we see cooler regions that have water and hotter regions where the water's being broken apart. That had been predicted by theory, but it's really exciting to actually see this with real observations."

Additional JWST observations could sharpen the spatial detail in future 3D eclipse maps. Weiner Mansfield noted that the method opens new opportunities to study many "hot Jupiters," which number in the hundreds among the more than 6,000 confirmed exoplanets. She also aims to apply 3D eclipse mapping to smaller, rocky worlds beyond gas giants like WASP-18b.

"It's very exciting to finally have the tools to see and map out the temperatures of a different planet in this much detail. It's set us up to possibly use the technique on other types of exoplanets. For example, if a planet doesn't have an atmosphere, we can still use the technique to map the temperature of the surface itself to possibly understand its composition," Mansfield said. "Although WASP-18b was more predictable, I believe we will have the chance to see things that we could never have expected before."

This research was supported by the James Webb Space Telescope's Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program.

Plankton are the unseen drivers of life on Earth. These microscopic organisms produce a large share of the planet's oxygen and form the base of the ocean food chain. They are also astonishingly diverse, with tens of thousands of species already identified and many more waiting to be discovered. Among them, protists -- tiny, single-celled organisms -- are especially remarkable for their evolutionary significance. For many years, scientists could study them only through genetic data because existing imaging techniques were unable to reveal their complex internal structures.

A Pandemic Collaboration Sparks Discovery

During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMBL Group Leader Gautam Dey received a Zoom call from collaborator Omaya Dudin, then leading a research group at EPFL. Dudin had just succeeded in adapting a new imaging method to visualize the inner organization of Ichthyosporea (a marine protist closely related to animals and fungi). This breakthrough overcame a long-standing obstacle: the species' tough cell walls.

The technique, known as expansion microscopy, was originally developed at MIT and later refined into ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) by Paul Guichard and Virginie Hamel at the University of Geneva. Their improvements made the protist's cell walls permeable, allowing scientists to clearly observe its inner architecture for the first time.

Motivated by this success, Dudin, Dey, Guichard, and Hamel began a long-term collaboration. Three years later, their partnership has produced an unprecedented body of knowledge about hundreds of protist species and laid the groundwork for a "planetary atlas" of plankton.

The EMBL-led Traversing European Coastlines (TREC) expedition offered an ideal opportunity to explore these marine organisms further. Recently published in Cell, the team's findings provide detailed insight into the cellular structures of more than 200 plankton species, especially eukaryotes (organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus). This research marks the beginning of PlanExM, a TREC project designed to map the hidden structural diversity of plankton using expansion microscopy.

Exploring Marine Microbes in Unprecedented Detail

At Roscoff, France -- one of the first TREC expedition sampling sites -- the Station Biologique maintains one of Europe's most comprehensive collections of marine microorganisms. Expecting only a few dozen samples, the team asked manager Ian Probert for material to test their technique. Instead, they gained access to over 200 species.

"We spent three days and nights just fixing those samples. This was a treasure trove we could not let go of," said co-first author Felix Mikus, who completed his PhD in the Dey Group and is now a postdoc in Dudin's laboratory at the University of Geneva.

How Expansion Microscopy Works

Expansion microscopy, which marks its 10th anniversary this year, physically enlarges biological samples. A sample -- containing cells, tissues, or single-celled organisms -- is embedded in a transparent gel that absorbs water and expands. Remarkably, the cell's internal structures remain intact and stretch proportionally, allowing researchers to enlarge the specimen up to 16 times without using high-powered lenses.

"When combined with regular light microscopy methods, expansion microscopy allows scientists to bypass the standard wavelength barriers which limit how small a structure can be resolved using light microscopy," said Guichard and Hamel.

Mapping the Cellular Skeleton of Life

Using samples from Roscoff and a second collection in Bilbao, Spain, the team conducted one of the most comprehensive studies ever of the cytoskeleton -- the filament network that supports and organizes eukaryotic cells. They focused on microtubules (hollow filaments that help cells maintain shape, divide, and move) and centrins (proteins involved in organizing microtubules).

"We were able to map features of microtubule and centrin organization across many different eukaryotic groups," explained Hiral Shah, EIPOD Postdoctoral Fellow in EMBL's Dey and Schwab groups and co-first author of the study. "The scale of the study, with many species characterized in each group, opens up the possibility to make evolutionary predictions. For instance, dinoflagellates, one of the most diverse groups found in oceans across the planet, are well-represented in our study. We were able to map the presence of tubulin and centrin structures associated with the cell cortex or the flagella in these species."

Revealing Evolutionary Patterns Through Microscopy

"U-ExM is transforming how we explore protist ultrastructure," said co-first author Armando Rubio Ramos, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Geneva. "By combining this technique with high-throughput imaging and comparative analyses, we can begin to decode how cellular architecture has diversified across evolution. It's a bridge between molecular data and the physical organization of life at the microscopic scale."

The results not only illuminate how eukaryotic cells are organized but also offer clues about the evolutionary development of their internal structures. The research highlights expansion microscopy's power as a tool for studying even complex environmental samples collected directly from the ocean.

Toward a Planetary Atlas of Microscopic Life

"Our adventures with expansion microscopy are only beginning," said Dey. "This is perhaps the first high-resolution microscopy technique that has the potential to match the scale and ambition of large biodiversity genomics projects, enabling us in the near future to associate new multiomics data with cellular physiology at scale across the tree of life."

With Thomas Richards from Oxford University joining the collaboration, Dey and Dudin secured a CHF 2 million Moore Foundation Grant to continue expanding their research.

"The next step is to selectively look deeper into certain species within this broad collection to answer specific questions, such as understanding how mitosis and multicellularity evolved and the phenotypic diversity that underlie major evolutionary transitions," Dudin said.

Users are urged to download only from the official GitHub page.

With Windows 10 reaching its end of life (EOL) last month, a free third-party tool called Flyoobe (which we have covered here) has been gaining popularity for enabling safe upgrades to Windows 11 on unsupported systems by bypassing the system requirements. Additionally, it includes various options to customize the OS further, such as removing AI features and unwanted apps. However, there is a suspected bogus build of this tool downloadable via an official-looking domain, which is causing concern.

The developer of Flyoobe recently issued a warning about a potentially malicious copy of the tool being distributed through a website that is not directly affiliated with the project. According to a notice marked "SECURITY ALERT" on the official Github page, an unofficial mirror is being hosted at https://flyoobe.net/ (do not visit), which may contain malware or a tampered build of Flyoobe. The developer also urges users to download only from the official GitHub releases, emphasizing that the mentioned website has no connection with the developer or the project's official pages.

Originally known as Flyby11, Flyoobe describes itself as “a better way to set up Windows,” and aims to make Windows 11 more accessible and customizable, especially on older or less powerful hardware. The tool lets you upgrade directly from Windows 10 to Windows 11, bypassing compatibility checks that normally block unsupported systems. So it will bypass TPM module checks, etc. With that, Flyoobe also gives users the flexibility to remove AI-based components and trim unnecessary features to create a lighter installation. It can even enhance the overall Windows experience with additional customization options and the ability to install some of the most commonly used applications.

Downloading tools with system-level access, like Flyoobe, from an unverified source comes with huge risks. Malicious versions of software potentially include hidden keyloggers, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, or scripts that compromise sensitive data during the Windows installation process. Even if the installer may appear to work as intended, tampered builds can introduce backdoors or stability issues that are difficult to trace and fix. That the reputable sounding imposter website URL exists is worrying, so please avoid it. Hopefully, the fake Flyoobe hosting will be shut down shortly.

Parking lots are horrible.  They're butt ugly heat islands that take up way too much space.  While adding solar on them doesn't solve the last issue, it does help mitigate the heat island effect and solar panels are no less ugly than asphalt.  Plus it is power creation right next to where it is being consumed for minimal transfer losses.  It's also much nicer for the vehicles parked there to be in the shade.

The cooler had separated from the vapor chamber.

Here's a bent-out-of-shape GPU repair that quickly turned from a curiosity into a horror story: A dead Aorus-branded Nvidia RTX 4090 card landed on the desk of Northwest Repair, originally reported to have a melted connector and "some knocked off components," but one by one, slowly, the tech finds so much wrong with this card that it's deemed irreparable by the end. That's rare for a GPU in those skillful hands. Let's dive into the rocky journey of attempting to fix a Scoliosis-ridden graphics card that's literally bent out of shape.

The bad signs began immediately: not only was the card obviously and unnaturally curved, but the backplate was screwed on with aftermarket plastic screws and looked severely worn, as if someone had thrown it around.

Once disassembled, the PCB itself was basically straight, but the cooler was so twisted that our host, Tony, just gave up trying to bend it back into shape. The heatpipes were fine, but the fin stack was separating from the vapor chamber, and the thermal pads weren't even making contact with the VRAM and most of the MOSFETs.

 




“Screw this,” exclaimed the seasoned GPU tech, as he moved on to testing the GPU itself, pulling out the multimeter. There was a dead short on the 12V rail, 1.8V rail, and the memory, but the 5V and PEX were seemingly okay. After injecting current into the 12V rail, he formed the initial hypothesis. Under a thermal camera, he saw heat building up around the VRAM area, indicating that 12V was shorted to the memory and likely propagated further, frying other components. Checking the core's resistance, however, confirmed that it wasn't shorted, so there was hope.

When put underneath a microscope, he discovered the card had previously been RMA'd, as it was in poor condition with a bunch of missing components, but nothing too egregious jumped out right away — except for grinding marks near a screw post, hinting that a Dremel was used there for some reason.

 




Next, a suspect VRAM module was removed, but the short still persisted, confirming the hypothesis that 12V reached the entire memory rail, likely taking out all the VRAM chips in the process. Tony grounded the memory rail to stabilize it before pushing a higher current to see what else was causing issues. Pushing 5 amps made the SIC653A power stage glow, indicating it failed and allowed the 12V to reach the memory. Removing the MOSFET made the short go away, and after replacing it with a new one from a donor board, he tested again.

The short on all the rails was gone, except for the memory. Tony once again injected a few amps into the VRAM, and sure enough, the core started getting hot, confirming a dreadful conclusion. He just performed an autopsy, not a repair, as the 12V had travelled through the memory chips and eventually reached the core, frying it in the process.

You might be wondering why it looked “okay” before, and that's because the resistance test only shows obvious shorts; it's only when actual current is injected that the electrically wounded GPU core collapsed and confirmed it was dead.

 




Tony admits he didn't need to do all that, and that reviving this card based on its condition would be nothing short of a miracle. Discovering the dead core wouldn't have been possible without first replacing the MOSFET, which removed the short on the 12V rail and confirmed that the rest of the card was not salvageable. It's a routine part of electronics repair and par for the course when attempting to fix sensitive hardware like graphics cards.

Hulu (Base, Monthly)

YouTube (Monthly)

Sling (Orange and Blue, Monthly)

DirecTV (Choice, Monthly)

Cable TV died only to return as live TV streaming services. Some familiar names are still around, like DirecTV, but even more have popped up as wholly unique entities. TV looks a lot different than it did a decade ago, with cord-cutting going mainstream, and TV giants ditching the proprietary boxes and hardware leases in favor of streaming over the internet.

Although the best live TV streaming services make it easier to watch live TV (often for cheaper), the internet has introduced its own problems. A large roster of brands has fragmented channel lineups, and ongoing negotiations with streaming platforms have meant channels disappear from some networks overnight. So what's the best? I went on a deep dive into channels, DVR, sports, on-demand videos, and increasingly confusing add-ons and pricing to understand where the live TV streaming market is at, and which service you should spend your money on.

Be sure to check out our Best Indoor TV Antennas and Best TVs guides for more.

How You Can Stream Live TV for Free

Most live TV streaming services will cost you money, and they aren't cheap, with the going price sitting above $80 per month. However, a new model for streaming live TV has been growing in popularity over the last several years known as FAST, or free ad-supported television.

There are several FAST services available, with some of the more popular options being Tubi, Roku TV, Pluto, and Peacock. The channels you find on FAST services don't mirror those of a traditional live TV provider, so you shouldn't expect to see major networks like Discovery, at least in the same form you find them on cable. There are thousands of FAST channels, and most of them focus on a specific genre or even a specific series.

For instance, Tubi has dedicated channels for Johnny Carson, The Carol Burnett Show, and Baywatch, while Pluto TV includes dozens of channels dedicated to sitcom re-runs, as well as a channel dedicated solely to Dateline re-runs. You won't find much in the way of live sports or new, live premieres, but FAST services are great if you just want TV for TV's sake.

How You Can Stream ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Live

ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox are all broadcast through local affiliates, so you'll need a live TV streaming service that can deliver local affiliates. YouTube TV, Hulu Live TV, Fubo, and DirecTV support all four, but some services are different. Sling, for instance, includes NBC, ABC, and Fox, but it doesn't have CBS. And Philo doesn't offer any local affiliates.

How We Tested

Half of the battle with live TV streaming services is even understanding what you're getting. Although some of the confusion of cable's past is gone, a lot of it remains. Sling Orange & Blue, for instance, includes local affiliates, but unlike other services I looked it, it doesn't comes with CBS. There are dozens of examples just like this if you go through all of the channel lineups.

That's where I started. I created a grid of the top 100 channels according to Nielsen to better understand what each service offers. That helps contextualize how much you're paying. DirecTV is expensive, for instance, but it doesn't have major holes in the channels lineup like Sling TV, which you have to make up with paid add-ons.

I used these services for about three weeks, cycling between them each time I sat down to watch TV. I never experienced any outage problems, so my focus shifted to usability in the app. The goal is to have a modernized app with the features of a streaming platform (like user profiles) while maintaining the familiarity of a traditional cable service with a robust guide and easy channel switching.

Beyond usability and channel selection, I focused in on a few other key elements. Chief among them was DVR. Most live TV streaming services offer unlimited cloud DVR, but some do it better than others. DirecTV, for instance, allows you to record DVR up to 72 hours in the past. Sling, on the other hand, charges for unlimited DVR.

Hulu

Hulu (Base, Monthly)

Hulu (Premium, Monthly)

If there's an easy sell in the world of live TV streaming services, it's Hulu Live TV. Hulu and Disney+ are subscriptions you probably want anyway, and adding live TV with a comprehensive lineup of plans and ESPN Unlimited just makes sense, especially when Hulu is charging around the same price as YouTube TV.

Hulu has just a slightly less comprehensive lineup of channels compared to YouTube TV, but it still covers all the bases. You get ESPN channels, along with regional sports networks like FanDuel and local affiliates like ABC, NBC, and CBS.

You get the major channels, including big networks like Discovery, and a full roster of national news stations, including Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. The only place Hulu loses out is with secondary channels. Channels like Science, Hallmark Family, and MTV 2 are paid add-ons, even though the main channels on these networks are included with the base plan.

My big gripe with Hulu is its frustrating interface. Even before introducing Live TV, Hulu had a rough app, and that hasn't changed. It's cluttered and clunky, and although there's still a guide with useful category sorting, the app still feels like it's fighting with itself. Unlike YouTube, which separates YouTube and YouTube TV into separate apps, there's only one Hulu app. Further, the future of Live TV isn't clear. Disney has said it will phase out the Hulu app, integrating it into Disney+. That includes Live TV, and it's unclear how it'll work when that happens.

Still, the thing that makes Hulu Live TV so attractive hasn't changed. You get an awful lot for your money, combining go-to streaming apps between Hulu and Disney+, a solid channel lineup of live TV, and ESPN Unlimited to create a package that's hard for most services to contend with.

Google

YouTube (Monthly)

What I love about YouTube TV is that it's easy. There's one plan that comes with a complete roster of channels for a reasonable price, and only a handful of add-ons that truly feel like add-ons (i.e., Spanish-speaking channels and movie channels). You don't need a spreadsheet to understand what you're getting with YouTube TV. With all the major channels you want and unlimited DVR, everything is built into the base plan.

Along with broad national channel coverage, YouTube TV includes local channels in most areas. Even in Missouri, where I live, YouTube TV has all of my local channels, including ABC, Fox, NBC, and CBS. You'd be shocked at how few live TV streaming services include all of your local affiliates. However, while affiliate inclusion is great, YouTube TV is spotty when it comes to regional sports networks.

YouTube TV has a simple lineup of offerings, so it makes sense that it has an equally straightforward app. It's my favorite app out of any of the streaming services I tested. It's lightning fast without even a hint of lag, and it's available everywhere, from smart TVs like those from Hisense, Samsung, Vizio, LG, and Roku, to streaming devices from Amazon and Apple, not to mention game consoles.

Although YouTube TV has a comprehensive lineup of channels, apps, and features, it's also one of the most expensive live TV streaming services around, and there aren't any ways to save money with a smaller channel lineup. In addition, it doesn't include any extras like you get with Hulu Live TV. It would be great to have, for instance, YouTube Premium included to unlock ad-free YouTube videos and YouTube Music.

YouTube TV recently removed Disney from its offerings, cutting ESPN, ABC, and Disney proper. The company says these channels may come back in the future, but that seems unlikely immediately. Still, it's clear why YouTube TV is such a popular option. It's easy, and if you can float the monthly price, you won't have to worry much about random channels falling through the cracks because of renewal deals or add-ons to pick up a single extra channel.

Sling

Sling (Orange and Blue, Monthly)

Sling (Orange, Monthly)

Sling (Blue, Monthly)

Sling (Select, Monthly)

I won't mince words: Sling TV is confusing. It has, by far, the most confusing lineup of plans and add-ons out of any of the live TV streaming services I tested. There are a handful of core plans, none of which encompass the scale of Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, or DirecTV, as well as about half a dozen add-ons to bring the channel roster up to par. This modular approach is annoying while shopping, though it also means you can save quite a bit of money by only picking up what you need.

The core of Sling is Blue and Orange. The Blue plan focuses on news and entertainment, while the Orange plan cuts news like MSNBC and CNN in favor of an array of ESPN channels. It's clear Sling wants folks to pick up the Orange & Blue plan that combines these channel lineups. It's about 30 percent cheaper getting them together than it is purchasing them separately (and about $30 cheaper than most other providers).

The Orange & Blue plan, which I recommend for most people, covers the major bases, but it loses out on some of the secondary channels available elsewhere. For instance, you get ESPN channels and Fox Sports 1, but not Fox Sports 2 or the Big Ten Network. You'll need an add-on for those.

Most of Sling's add-ons are $6 extra per month, minus the sports add-on, which is $15. The add-ons fill in the gaps depending on what you're most interested in. The entertainment add-on includes Cartoon Network and MTV, for instance, while the movies add-on comes with Grit, TCM, and FXX. You can pick up all of the extras for $27 per month with Blue & Orange or $21 per month with other plans. Even with the full package, however, Sling comes in a few dollars below YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV, and there are opportunities to get your monthly price even lower by cutting some packages.

For apps, Sling has just about everything you could want. Roku, Samsung, LG, Apple, and Google TV are all supported, as are boxes from Cox, Xfinity, and even TiVo Stream. Mobile apps are available, and there's an app for the Xbox (though not the PlayStation 5).

Although not as responsive as YouTube TV, the app felt smooth on my TCL QM8K. You can create profiles, see upcoming games, and favorite channels in the guide so they're easy to find.

DirecTV

DirecTV (Choice, Monthly)

DirecTV (Entertainment, Monthly)

DirecTV (Ultimate, Monthly)

DirecTV (Premier, Monthly)

If you want cable without the box, DirecTV is what you're after. It's only fitting that the only familiar satellite service on this list is the best cable replacement, and DirecTV lives up to its name—for better and worse. On the plus side, there's a massive channel selection, particularly on the Choice plan and above. DirecTV includes most of the top 100 channels I looked at, along with major regional sports networks like FanDuel and NBC Sports.

And just like the satellite plans of yore, DirecTV charges a pretty penny. Plans climb all the way to $170 per month if you want movie channels like Starz and Showtime, and even DirecTV's cheaper Choice and Entertainment plans come in $10 to $15 more than Hulu Live TV and YouTube TV.

Still, you get quite a bit for your money. In addition to a broad channel lineup, DirecTV includes ESPN Unlimited with every plan, along with ad-supported versions of Disney+ and Hulu with the Choice plan and above. Unlimited DVR also comes standard, as does unlimited streams at home (and up to three outside of your home).

You can build your own plan with DirecTV's Genre Packs, though the cost ends up being more expensive than just picking up one of the full plans from the get-go. For most people, the Choice plan is the best option. It includes quite a few more channels than the cheaper Entertainment plan, including the NFL and MLB Networks, along with truTV, Pop, and Science. The more expensive Ultimate plan has more channels, but they're mainly secondary channels like Disney Junior and Nat Geo Wild.

The DirecTV app is available on Fire TV, Google TV, Apple TV, Roku, and Samsung TVs (2017 and newer), and you'll also find apps on mobile devices and in your browser. Notably, there aren't any apps for game consoles, which is a shame because DirecTV's app feels sluggish. It's great in the browser, but testing on my TCL QM8K TV, there was always a bit of a hang as I navigated through channels. I suspect this will only be exaggerated on less powerful devices, like a cheaper Roku Streaming Stick.

I don't love the interface, but there are solid features. You can favorite channels and sports teams to easily find them, as well as turn on live scores. The most frustrating aspect is the home screen. It's useful for seeing your favorite channels, but leaving a channel will return you to this home screen rather than the guide.

Fubo

Fubo (Pro, Monthly)

Fubo (Elite with Sports Plus, Monthly)

Fubo (Deluxe, Monthly)

Fubo makes a big deal about the number of channels it carries, and by the numbers, it has a ton of channels indeed. It's missing a lot of the important ones—TBS, Discovery, CNN, and Univision chief among them—but if you want both The Weather Channel and AccuWeather, Fubo has your back. Fubo may not have all the channels that Hulu Live TV or YouTube TV have, but it goes deep in one area: sports.

ESPN Unlimited is included with every plan. Fubo has the most comprehensive list of regional sports networks out of any of the live TV streaming services I tested. FanDuel and NBC Sports take center stage, but Fubo also carries smaller regional networks, from MASN and MSG in the northeast to Space City in Houston. You'd suspect that the cheapest Fubo Sports plan is all you need, and if you just want a few local affiliates and ESPN Unlimited, you can get by with that plan. I wouldn't recommend anything less than Fubo TV Pro for most people, though, which carries the regional sports networks.

If you jump up to the most expensive plan (Elite with Sports Plus), you also get access to NFL Red Zone, plus a free Apple TV 4K and 4K streaming. Red Zone and 4K upgrades are available elsewhere, but it's great to see both included as a package, especially for such a sports-focused service.

Fubo's app is solid, too. Testing on a Google TV system, it felt responsive without much in the way of lag as I was flipping through the guide. It's not as clean as YouTube TV's interface, particularly with the sports emphasis, but an app that feels responsive is all I can really ask for.

It's available on most devices, including Fire TV, Google TV, Apple TV, and Roku, as well as TVs from Vizio, Samsung, LG, and Hisense. There's also an Xbox app (though no PlayStation app) and native apps for Android and iOS.

Philo: This almost made the main list, though I decided against it due to the limitations. It's, by far, the cheapest option out of any of the live TV services I tested, with its only plan (Core) coming in at just $33 per month. It's just extremely limited. You have a far smaller channel roster compared to the other services I tested, mainly due to the fact that Philo doesn't include any local affiliates like NBC or ABC, nor any regional sports networks. You might not care about local news or sports, though, and Philo is excellent if you fall in that camp. The channel lineup hits all the highlights, including the massive Discovery network, drama channels like AMC and TNT, and reality-focused channels like MTV and Lifetime. Philo also throws in over 100 ad-supported free channels, along with ad-supported versions of AMC+, HBO Max, and Discovery+. And to better support this entertainment and reality TV focus, it has the best DVR out of any service I tested. Unlimited cloud DVR comes standard with your plan, and Philo retains your recordings for a full year—just about every other service tops out at nine months.

One of the draws of live TV streaming is that it doesn't require an antenna, instead leveraging your internet connection to deliver live television. However, a TV antenna can help fill in the gaps of cheaper live TV services like Sling or Fubo, particularly when it comes to local affiliates.

Our favorite indoor TV antenna is the Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified, which you can pick up for about $50. It covers up to 60 miles, which should reach most local affiliates, assuming you live within an hour of a major city. If you want to see your local channels, you can enter your address at AntennaWeb.

Another reason to game on Linux?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD confused the gaming community greatly after it announced it would put RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 driver support in "maintenance mode", but later corrected that the two architectures would still be receiving game optimizations regardless. Apparently, this confusion also led some people to believe game optimizations would also stop on AMD's Linux drivers as well. Luckily, Phoronix has published an article reaffirming that Linux support has not changed with this announcement, primarily because Linux AMD drivers are developed separately from their Windows counterparts.

Linux driver support is maintained very differently on AMD GPU drivers compared to AMD's GPU drivers for Windows. Linux driver support for AMD GPUs typically dwarfs what AMD supports officially in Windows. Kernel driver support reportedly dates back all the way to AMD's GCN 1.2 architecture, which includes GPUs such as the R9 390X and R9 Fury X.

Helping matters is that AMD GPU driver support in Linux is heavily reliant on open-source drivers. Up until September this year, the AMDVLK driver was the official open-source Linux driver from AMD and was maintained by AMD directly. Community contributions are also implemented to help improve the driver's functionality.

There is also the exclusively community-driven RADV driver that was started before AMD got into the Linux game with its own AMDVLK driver. Being exclusively community-driven, RADV is maintained completely independently of AMD and is currently the de facto GPU driver for all Radeon GPUs for Linux. RADV is a very robust and well-built driver solution that is supported by many of the industry's tech giants, including Valve, Google, and Red Hat.

This is why, starting on September 15th, 2025, AMD has opted to discontinue the AMDVLK driver altogether. Support for RADV has grown so much in strength that there is no need to have both AMDVLK and RADV co-existing. Performance on RADV also outshines AMDVLK in many situations. Instead, AMD is backing RADV fully and shifting all of its GPU driver development and maintenance to the RADV driver.

All of this is to say that Linux gamers can rest assured that any nasty driver support changes AMD makes on the Windows side won't immediately be copied on the Linux side. Even if AMD wanted to start cutting support on the Linux side, it can't anymore because it has discontinued its own official AMDVLK driver. Pulling the same stunt on RADV would be impossible because too many other companies and individuals are maintaining the driver. (In other words, if AMD stops development for certain GPUs, another company or individual would inevitably take over.)

Sim immersion turned up to 11 with crazy DIY World of Tanks controller version 5.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Some folks will go to great lengths, sparing no expense, to raise their gaming sim experience to thrilling new heights. Perhaps the crown prince of such extreme sim build-outs is Chinese enthusiast Blyat, best known among Tom's Hardware readers for his immersive World of Tanks gaming contraptions and, most recently, a (frankly dangerous) fighter jet rig. Today, Blyat released a video showcasing his wild Tank Simulator 5, which comes with a full-size replica machine gun and cannons, on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili.



You can watch the full video on Bilibili, but, as we can't embed this Chinese social media format, we have also made a couple of GIF clips for your convenience.



Bylat's new video is a showcase of sim hardware-enhanced fun inside the free-to-play hit, World of Tanks. The Wargaming-published vehicular combat MMO features an incredible array of tanks, adept at various battlefield tasks. The PC version is closely tied to the mouse and keyboard control that the platform is renowned for. However, this video is all about fun, and doesn't go into the technical aspects of getting these crazy sim setups working.

The frantic video begins with Bylat driving what might be dubbed a ‘Tactical vehicle' out of a garage, cannon blazing. It switches to the corresponding on-screen WoT action, where the anti-armor cannon can be seen peppering an enemy tank until it violently explodes.

Next, the scene switches back to inside the garage, and Bylat demos both the armor-piercing canon of his vehicle firing, backed up with our hero standing on the hood with a heavy machine gun. We guess Bylat is annihilating some other tank-foes, seen on the headset he is wearing.

 




There's lots of overt humor in the WoT sim video, too. For example, at one stage we see Bylat's pants fall down due to the incessant recoil of the machine gun. Perhaps funnier is the slapstick moment when, stood in the back of the truck with the machine gun blazing, the large armor piercing cannon swings around to smack our hero in the head – leaving him poleaxed in the back of the truck.

If you enjoy this kind of immersive sillyness, Bylat's Bilibili channel also recently showcased his Airplane simulator, a Mech simulator with VTOL, and an erm… donkey riding simulator.

X11's practical absence of any security mechanisms for user sessions means you should probably not run any kind of low-trust UI program anyway, as there is no prevention of keystroke injection or screen recording, but that's a design flaw that will never be solved. That doesn't mean that EoP style attacks like these should be ignored or underestimated, though.

reply

Any program you run on a computer (especially a Linux computer, which lacks modern OS security measures and has constant privesc kernel holes) exposes you to security flaws. There has yet to be any computer system designed that a hacker can't break out of. If you intentionally download and execute a program, you are rolling the dice, regardless of what the software is.What's insane about all these discussions is that NOBODY IS HACKING X SERVERS. There's a thousand other kinds of software on Linux that there is real malware for. But nobody is trying to hijack your X11 session. This imagined threat is a red herring designed to bolster the argument for Wayland's horrible designs.

The deal here is that the only way to fix X11's security issues is by breaking all those types of workflows and forcing application rewrites to implement them in authenticated ways.So if you are going have to go and break all that stuff, why not fix a crapload of other problems while you are at it?Calling Wayland "X13" may have avoided a lot of misunderstandings, but it probably would of caused others.

Maybe it's both? There are applications with good reason that need to chose their location themselves, and users who want that type of behavior, so it's definitively not just a security issue.

"Preventing" the vulnerability would indeed require going back to 1994. Since it is a vulnerability that has existed in every display server released since then.

It's a new day, and another badly-optimized AAA Unreal Engine 5 game has hit store shelves. A couple of YouTubers, including Daniel Owen, have discovered serious performance problems in The Outer Worlds 2 that almost mirror Borderlands 4's atrocious launch day performance. One of the most problematic graphics settings is the game's ray tracing mode, which prevents even AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming champ from achieving 60 FPS at resolutions well under 1080p.

The aforementioned YouTuber ran the game across three hardware configurations: one with a Ryzen 5 5600X and a GTX 1070, another with the same chip and an RTX 3080 12GB, and the third with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D paired with an RTX 5090. The two former configurations represent the game's minimum and recommended system requirements on the game's Steam page.

The game struggled to hit 60 FPS on both 5600X-powered configurations. With the GTX 1070, the game was unable to run at even 30 FPS consistently in one of the game's city areas at low settings with FSR set to performance mode at 1080p (540p internal resolution).

Switching to the RTX 3080 12GB technically fared much better, with that GPU achieving almost 60 FPS with the same settings. But regardless, it couldn't maintain a solid 60 FPS at the game's lowest quality settings.

The only configuration of the three that could provide solid performance in the game (at any graphics setting) was the Ryzen 7 9800X3D rig powered by Nvidia's flagship RTX 5090. With these top-of-the-line components, the game ran above 60 FPS at 4k resolution with DLSS set to performance mode (1080p internal resolution) at the game's maximum settings (except for hardware ray tracing).

That said, native 4K resolution and hardware ray tracing proved extremely challenging for the 9800X3D and 5090 to handle. Running the game at native 4k resolution with DLAA at maximum settings (with ray tracing still disabled) was only good enough for 45-50 FPS.

Enabling ray tracing significantly degraded performance. At 1080p with DLSS performance mode (540p internal resolution), the RTX 5090 and 9800X3D could not achieve a solid 60 FPS.

The Outer Worlds 2's performance on modern-day hardware is comically bad, even by Unreal Engine 5 standards. The game struggles to play on the lowest settings on the game's own recommended hardware configuration, and ray tracing is basically unplayable (unless you like 540p gaming on an RTX 5090). The developers seem to have taken a step from Borderlands 4's playbook, a game that also struggles to maintain 60FPS at its lowest graphical settings on modern mainstream PC hardware.

The digital photo frame landscape has looked pretty much the same for the past few years. The best ones come from a few brands, and while new models have come out, the designs have usually focused on new frames and styles versus any real change in the technology or how to use the device. They're pretty simple: Upload your photos and enjoy them anytime on the digital screen.

While Aura's newest frame still embodies that basic concept, the Aura Ink stands out as a fully portable digital photo frame. The portable design is made possible by an E Ink screen like you'd find on a digital notebook or a color e-reader, instead of the usual LCD screen. The photos end up stylized like a newspaper photo, rather than your classic bright-screen display.

The result is a much more muted screen and representation of your photos, with all the benefits we already like about Aura's frames and app (including free and unlimited photo storage). It's a refreshing option in a sea of similar-looking digital frames, and great for anyone who wants a digital photo frame they could mount. I recommend uploading the best of your best pictures on it. This is a frame for your best (and absolute brightest—dim photos will only look darker) photos you'd want to look at all day, rather than fun photos from this weekend.

Photos on the Aura Ink look different than those on other digital frames. The E Ink Spectra 6 technology that powers the screen gives it a slightly sepia-toned look. The screen only uses six color pixels: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. To bring your photos to this type of screen, Aura designed an algorithm to convert photos into pixels of those six tones and still look like the original picture. The result is newspaper-like, with a design that devolves into a multitude of different colored squares if you look closely.

Brighter photos are much easier to enjoy on the Ink's screen. Darker photos, paired with the dimmer E Ink screen, were much harder to see. But a photo of my family at golden hour still showed the sky fading from blue to yellow and orange, for example, and the range of greens of the plants around us. My son's smiling face while wearing his astronaut costume was just as cute, with the various shades of his blond hair still nicely relayed.

Aura did build a gentle front light into the Aura Ink, similar to what you'd find on a Kindle device, but it's not nearly as bright as my Kindle when I crank the brightness all the way up. Compared side by side with my Kindle Colorsoft, which also has a color E Ink screen, the Aura Ink looks to get about half as bright. Aura also changed the physical controls on the device. Instead of a touchbar at the top, there are three buttons on one side: One to flip forward through your photos, one to flip backward, and an “action” button that just shows the battery status with an LED light.

It does look much, much more realistic and photolike than any other photo frame out there, but the photos displayed on it still appear dim compared to a true printed picture, let alone another digital screen. It's best in a well-lit room, with the light sensor in one of the upper corners to activate the front light.

The screen doesn't look different just for fun. It's what makes the Aura Ink fully wireless. While the rest of Aura's lineup needs to be plugged in at all times, as does just about every other digital photo frame on the market, the Aura Ink promises a battery life of about three months on a single charge. Devices like e-readers see similar benefits with this type of screen. The Kindle Colorsoft lasts about eight weeks on a single charge, while the larger Kindle Scribe (2nd Gen) has a similar three-month battery life.

That battery life can vary based on how often the photo changes, which is what takes up most of the Ink's power. If you've ever used an e-paper device like a digital notebook or e-reader, the experience of the flashing screen as it loads the next image will look familiar, but the Aura Ink amps it up with a much longer set of flashes as it runs the next photo through its algorithm to become a six-pixel print. That transition between photos takes less than 30 seconds. Aura defaults to this happening once overnight to both preserve the battery and your eyes during the intense transition phase.

Aura has been trying for years to get us to mount its frames. The Aura's first frame back in 2017, the Aura Classic, was wall-mountable, and then Aura's latest frames, like the Aura Aspen, have had a flat, wall-mountable design. But the downside was the cord running below it for all of these models, which takes away from the clean gallery-wall design it's otherwise well-suited for, and limits the locations it can be hung.

Now, with the Aura Ink's truly cordless design, it's possible to hang it without any cord clutter. The 13-inch screen makes it a little larger than the 12-inch Aura Aspen but smaller than the 15-inch Walden, and is a nice size for hanging. The Ink comes with a little mounting kit of two nails and a small hook that the digital frame clicks into, and it can easily click back off for charging (the charging port is on the side if your hanging spot is near an outlet). I was able to hang it on one of my existing pushpins without issue, and the frame easily blended into my existing gallery wall.

Overall, it's an impressive feat of technology, though I wouldn't call it perfect. I'd like to see the front light get a little brighter. It's considerably more expensive than other digital photo frames, too. But as I look at it on my gallery wall, I have to say that if you didn't already know it was digital, you'd likely have no idea. If you're looking for a frame like that for your home, this is the one to get.

‘I don't have warm shells to plug into'


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an interview alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that the problem in the AI industry is not an excess supply of compute, but rather a lack of power to accommodate all those GPUs. In fact, Nadella said that the company currently has a problem of not having enough power to plug in some of the AI GPUs the firm has in inventory. He said this on YouTube in response to Brad Gerstner, the host of Bg2 Pod, when asked whether Nadella and Altman agreed with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who said there is no chance of a compute glut in the next two to three years.

“I think the cycles of demand and supply in this particular case, you can't really predict, right? The point is: what's the secular trend? The secular trend is what Sam (OpenAI CEO) said, which is, at the end of the day, because quite frankly, the biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it's power — it's sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power,” Satya said in the podcast. “So, if you can't do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It's not a supply issue of chips; it's actually the fact that I don't have warm shells to plug into.” [Emphasis added]

Nadella's mention of 'shells' refers to a data center shell, which is effectively an empty building with all of the necessary ingredients, such as power and water, needed to immediately begin production.

AI's power consumption has been a topic many experts have discussed since last year. This came to the forefront as soon as Nvidia fixed the GPU shortage, and many tech companies are now investing in research in small modular nuclear reactors to help scale their power sources as they build increasingly large data centers.

This has already caused consumer energy bills to skyrocket, showing how the AI infrastructure being built out is negatively affecting the average American. OpenAI has even called on the federal government to build 100 gigawatts of power generation annually, saying that it's a strategic asset in the U.S.'s push for supremacy in its AI race with China. This comes after some experts said Beijing is miles ahead in electricity supply due to its massive investments in hydropower and nuclear power.

Aside from the lack of power, they also discussed the possibility of more advanced consumer hardware hitting the market. “Someday, we will make a[n] incredible consumer device that can run a GPT-5 or GPT-6-capable model completely locally at a low power draw — and this is like so hard to wrap my head around,” Altman said. Gerstner then commented, “That will be incredible, and that's the type of thing that scares some of the people who are building, obviously, these large, centralized compute stacks.”

This highlights another risk that companies must bear as they bet billions of dollars on massive AI data centers. While you would still need the infrastructure to train new models, the data center demand that many estimate will come from the widespread use of AI might not materialize if semiconductor advancements enable us to run them locally.

This could hasten the popping of the AI bubble, which some experts like Pat Gelsinger say is still several years away. But if and when that happens, we will be in for a shock as even non-tech companies would be hit by this collapse, exposing nearly $20 trillion in market cap.

There's no denying that an Austin tech scene, which has been simmering for decades, has reached a boiling point in the past few years. As of 2023, tech jobs accounted for 16 percent of all jobs in Austin—almost double the national average, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Tech giants like Apple, Google, and Oracle all have a presence in the Texas capital, and startups like Mio, Closinglock, and MadeIn are garnering hype and VC funding. The Wall Street Journal may be hedging its bets on the hype it previously bestowed upon the city in the wake of the pandemic, but Austin persists as a kind of Babylon for burned-out techies who are tired of the Silicon Valley rat race.

The scrappy “Keep Austin Weird” era is on the wane, but there's still plenty that feels authentic and lovable in this once-sleepy college town that was content with doing its own thing in the shadows of nearby metropolises like Dallas and Houston. If your heart isn't dead-set on reliving the hazy glory days of the city portrayed in Richard Linklater's classic 1993 film Dazed and Confused, you're all but guaranteed to have a blast while bar-hopping, basking in the sun, and stuffing your face with some of the best barbecue in the world. And of course there's live music. So, so much live music.

Austin's tech scene initially caught a spark in the sprawling hills west of the city—hence the “Silicon Hills” tag—but the influx of Gen X and millennial workers has created an explosion of incubators, coworking spaces, and urban lifestyle hubs that are more centrally located than the environs preferred by the suburbanized old guard that came before them. Whether you prefer a quick drive to the office park or a quick walk to your new “coffice” for the day, our picks have you covered.

1901 San Antonio St., (512) 473-8900

Situated near the Texas State Capitol on the Southwest corner of the University of Texas at Austin, the Otis is a comfortable middle ground between a boutique hotel and an international chain operation. It's far enough from the commotion of both downtown and campus to feel calm, yet just a stone's throw from both. The rooftop pool is clutch for winding down with a Lone Star after a long day of meetings, which can be conveniently hosted onsite at one of the six event spaces, and Acre 41 is the kind of multiuse restaurant that's great for checking emails over coffee in the morning and brokering big deals over a Texas ribeye at night.

700 San Jacinto St., (512) 476-3700

Austin is growing upward at an unprecedented clip, but until it starts putting up New York–style pencil skyscrapers, the Omni Hotel stands out as one of the most iconic pieces of its skyline. This glistening 20-story marvel is just a few blocks from the core of Austin's entertainment district on West 6th Street, though you wouldn't be faulted for hardly leaving the property if a bar crawl on “Dirty 6th” isn't your thing. The rooftop pool offers stunning views of the city and beyond, and the three onsite restaurants provide an array of dining options suitable for all occasions.

1108 E 6th St., (737) 205-8888

Many maverick tech workers are in the sole proprietor/bootstraps phase of their career, which means cutting costs while still feeling luxe (or at least presenting as such) is important. East Austin Hotel offers traditional rooms for a slight upgrade, or you can save some serious cash by booking a “cabin” room with a suite of shared private bathrooms in the middle of the floor. You'll still have access to the pool in the middle of the property, and the hotel's proximity to the laid-back, neighborhood-y vibe of East 6th Street makes it a great pick for aspiring professionals who would prefer to commingle with locals rather than pound the pavement with office drones.

605 Davis St., (512) 542-5300

Rainey Street ain't what it used to be, but this charming enclave of bungalows turned bars still packs more character into a tiny city block than most midsize cities can muster in their entire downtown footprint. It's a solid all-purpose pick for moderate luxury in the middle of one of Austin's most charming and memorable downtown-adjacent neighborhoods.

10901 Domain St., (855) 596-3398

Most out-of-towners would be quite bummed to find out their work trip in Austin is centered around a lifestyle mall that's a 45-minute drive from downtown, but The Domain is actually a pretty great place to spend a few days if duty calls. It's a simulacrum of a walkable city right near blue-chip operations like Apple and Chase, so you might as well lean into the whole thing and shack up at a cool hotel that doesn't feel like a suburban motor inn off the freeway. Lone Star Court is fashioned in the likeness of a hill country lodge, with a pair of conjoined courtyards that center around a teal oval-shaped pool with its own bar and lounge.

7415 Southwest Pkwy., Building 8, Suite 100, (512) 551-4009

Nestled atop a main thoroughfare in the “Silicon Hills” of West Austin is a shiny new AC Hotel that checks all the boxes a techy business traveler might have. It's a short drive to heavyweights like AMD and Dell, and a handful of VCs like LiveOak and Cavvy dot the rolling hills that are on stunning display from the pool and the rooftop bar. The adjacent strip mall offers handy essentials like a local market that serves coffee and sandwiches all day, an upscale Mexican spot with great happy hour specials, and a movie theater with a bar that's a great place to kill a few hours between meetings.

Whether you're looking for a quiet desk for the day or a parachute into a bustling tech-y social scene, the variety of coworking options available in Austin is staggering and has something for everyone. Before you walk in off the street, we strongly suggest checking their website for availability and pricing, and while you're surfing the web, you might as well check out Austin Coworking and Deskpass, as they're excellent resources for updates on events, newcomers to the scene, and deals on participating offices.

310 Comal St., Floor 2, (512) 399-6320

Bond Collective is a solid choice for the post-hipster techies who prefer the laid-back vibe of East Austin over the corporate thrum of downtown or the West Austin hills. Day passes start at $35 for quick drop-ins, and monthly memberships offer access to almost all Bond Collective locations in the US—with many locations in New York, Philly, and the DC area—along with 24/7 access and ad hoc conference rooms if needed.

701 Brazos St., (512) 548-9675

This startup social hall functions more so as an IRL hub for meetups and events for the entrepreneur set, but it also offers quite a few open coworking events throughout the week if you prefer a more lively and interactive environment while you tap away at your laptop. You might meet your next full-stack developer here, or (more realistically) you might swill some beers and play pop-a-shot with some dudes who ditched California for the booming startup scene the Texas capital has been riding high on for several years now.

1700 S Lamar Blvd., #338, (512) 596-2683

Tucked in the back of a new build in the cozy Zilker/South Lamar neighborhood is Fibercove, a bright and buzzy coworking space that boasts off-street parking, a Google Fiber-powered network, a cafe, and a podcast studio where you and your best buds can chat about food and politics with the hopes of going viral. Local favorites like Odd Duck, Tiki Tatsu-Ya, and an Alamo Drafthouse outpost are within a short walk, and the space shares walls with a location of the boozy brunch chain Snooze if mimosas and chilaquiles are in order.

1115 E 11th St.

Austin is home to a staggering number of excellent coffee shops that focus solely on brewing great coffee. It's also chock-full of multiuse all-day drinking spots where the hours melt away and your taste for a cortado in the morning and a cafe de cachapa in the afternoon is joyously accommodated. Radio Rosewood falls in the latter camp. Coffee (and coffee cocktails, no judgment) start flowing at 7 am daily, and the Shortwave Diner truck parked outside slings a variety of diner staples like smash burgers, hot dogs, and breakfast sandwiches throughout most of Radio Rosewood's generous hours of operation.

Figure 8 is one of the most popular purveyors for cafés that don't roast their own beans, which makes it easy to find just about anywhere, but the opportunity to try its outstanding espresso and drip coffee right at the source is one you must enjoy if possible. This low-slung rectangle of a building sits on the edge of a quiet residential area, but the inside is always buzzing gently with activity and caffeination. Order a shot made from African or Central American beans if possible, and keep an eye out for a bin of fresh breakfast tacos near the register if you need a snack.

Multiple locations

With a decade-plus of explosive growth in their rear view, it's fair to say Houndstooth is akin to third-wave roasters like Stumptown, Blue Bottle, and Intelligentsia, all of which are synonymous with their respective cities. Their downtown location lives in the lobby of an office tower right smack in the middle of Austin's business district, which makes it a great place to sip a cortado between meetings or escape the grind of the workday with a cold brew and a croissant.

1505 Town Creek Dr.

Nature is healing, and one of Austin's most beloved all-night hangs has finally resumed its 24/7 schedule. As its name denotes, The Buzz Mill is a lumber mill–themed coffee bar that's great for late-night study sessions, marathon coding sprints, work drinks with the crew, or a mellow place to sip on a drink or two while you wait for whatever it is you were doing all day to flush out of your system.

1201 S Lamar Blvd.

This South Lamar bistro casts a wide net in terms of influence, with contemporary riffs on Texan comfort classics serving as the backbone of the dozen-or-so items that populate its menu. Look no further than the climax of their current dinner offerings—a wagyu strip steak that's plated with tater tots and masa queso—for a cheeky tell of what to expect from their delightfully low-brow iterations on high-minded chefiness.

1900 S 1st St.

Austin is located in Texas, and people in Texas love animal products. On the other hand, Austin is also a hot spot for well-heeled progressives, which means the vegetarian and vegan food is on point if you know where to look. Bouldin Creek Cafe is a funky and colorful mainstay for eco-friendly fare that's elegant enough for a dinner date yet also crunchy enough to please a table of hungover hippies who went a bit too hard at the day rave that dragged on until 4 in the morning.

4710 E 5th St.

Justine's is an Austin-ified update of the French brasserie model of casual indulgence. Its kitchen serves up decadence until midnight on weekends, offering the pre- or post-party set decadent burgers, frites, seafood dishes, and a few stunning salad options that pair wonderfully with an expansive list of cocktails, aperitifs, and wines from all over the price spectrum.

2330 W N Loop Blvd.

For 50 years this North Austin cochina has gifted Texans with upscale Mexican cuisine that joyfully transcends what your average taqueria-goer imagines when food from south of the border comes to mind. Here you'll find stunning platters of wagyu tacos, tangy ceviches, and decadent mole that converge in a way that suggests what might happen when Mexico City answers the question of what a brasserie might look like in a hyper-modern American metropolis.

2305 E 7th St.

Founded by Joe Avila in 1962, this humble East Austin diner infuses hearty brunch fare with stately Mexican tradition. The proper move here is a breakfast plate that typically includes eggs, beans, potatoes, tortillas, and your choice of protein. Their signature dish—the Joey Rocha Plate—is centered around a rich pork guisada and sausage or bacon and is easily one of the most crave-worthy and iconic breakfast dishes in all of Austin. Smaller appetites are accommodated by a full lineup of tacos, including a handful of breakfast tacos alongside more traditional two-biters like barbacoa, chicharrone, and migas.

Anointing one barbecue spot out of the hundreds in the area as “the best” is a fool's errand, so a quick-and-dirty list of knockouts that suit a variety of needs is more appropriate. Know that most have a line well before they open, brisket sells out quickly, and very few are open more than three or four days a week. Terry Black's is an exception to all of these rules, with generous hours, a massive seating area, and an industrious pit that makes it easy to score award-winning brisket for the entire crew at 7 pm on a Monday. La Barbecue is a consensus favorite among chefs and influencers, earning high marks for its outstanding sausage and brisket, along with its approachability—online ordering is clutch when you don't have the time or patience for the line. KG BBQ has the most unique story on this list, with a charismatic Egyptian pitmaster who adds a Middle Eastern spin to familiar Texas staples in the form of sumac rice bowls topped with brisket, barbecue lamb pitas, and cardamom and pistachio rice pudding for dessert.

Similar to barbecue, there is no best breakfast taco spot in Austin. Most locals choose based on proximity and reliability, while natural selection weeds out the bad ones in short order. That said, the handful of locations in the Veracruz All Natural empire offer something for everyone all over town, and most of them are situated in a truck park that usually has coffee, pastries, and other local goodies on offer courtesy of the other vendors. Vaquero Taquero is a solid pick for folks situated near UT or downtown, and the Bouldin Creek location of El Tacorrido slings breakfast tacos (and other styles) out of a walk-up/drive-thru window every day from 7am to midnight.

1133 E 11th St.

This cheeky East Austin post-dive ingests the memories of every Midwestern transplant's favorite windowless dump and polishes them up real nice like, in a convivial nod to the great American institution that is the neighborhood watering hole. Ice cold lager and top-tier boozy slushies wash down satisfying pub grub courtesy of the Delray Cafe truck outside, which slings smash burgers, Detroit-style coneys, and all manner of fried fare until the wee hours of the evening.

406 Walsh St.

Better Half is a great place to start the morning with a breakfast sandwich and a coffee, put your head down, and grind away on your laptop for hours, then celebrate a job well done with a draft cocktail and another sandwich. Its light and airy aesthetic, plus its massive outdoor footprint, make this Old West Austin bar/café hybrid an inviting hub for productivity, lounging our outright shenanigans if the mood strikes.

3901 Promontory Point Dr.

While Austin has seen no shortage of IPA factories come to fruition in the past decade, it's fitting that its most significant opening rolled into town by way of the OP beer scene in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 2019 by a pair of Breakside veterans, the expansive, quasi-suburban footprint of Meanwhile brewing manages to be peak Austin in its amenities, with an massive outdoor space that boasts a stage, picnic tables galore, a kids play area, and a fleet of food trucks that puts many stand-alone truck parks to shame. The beer is also excellent, with a strong focus on crushable lagers, hazies, and the particular brand of West Coast IPAs that Breakside has brewed for award-winning results since the early 2010's.

440 E St. Elmo Rd., G-2

Not unlike Southern California, which happens to be the origin of many recent Austin transplants, you'll find most of the good breweries in an industrial park on the outskirts of the city proper. St. Elmo is such a place, though the plethora of eateries and pickleball courts that share the laneway mean you're not exactly departing to a remote desert of a place when a craving for a crushable kolsch and a massive chicken sandwich hits. Unlike many new school lager factories, St. Elmo commands a diverse range of styles that err on the crispy side but still check a variety of unique boxes. The aforementioned Kolsch, simply named Carl, is the obvious pick for your first pint, but your second could be anything from a Mexican Lager to a Dubai chocolate–inspired pastry stout.

1300 S Lamar Blvd.

Tiki Tatsu-Ya is a colorful and elaborate fever dream of all things tiki. Kitsch is balanced carefully with playfulness and refinement, yielding a fanciful experience that's punctuated by stiff drinks that aren't for the faint of heart. There are few better places to take a small group of friends who are in dire need of a boozy kick in the pants courtesy of a cocktail menu that balances tradition and innovation, with classics like Painkillers and Jungle Birds dancing alongside new-school shareables like the Daruma or the Aku Aku.

1704 E 5th St.

These days it feels like everyone's favorite neighborhood dive is on the verge of ruin, but the Yellow Jacket soldiers on as one of the last grungy gathering places in Austin where chain smoking and kvetching about condos is not only accepted but encouraged. The local-centric scene here is cordial enough to tolerate tourists and newcomers, provided you mind your manners by being chill and not ordering espresso martinis from the bar.

500 Comal St.

No trip to Texas is complete without a night of drunken line dancing, and The White Horse is the preeminent spot for just that. Its proximity to the hipster scene of East 6th means the rough edges that accentuate more suburban line dancing joints are sanded down ever so slightly, making it an approachable option for normies to kick up their boots with minimal jeering from dudes who have two first names and a well-stocked gun rack in the back window of their F-350.

1502 E 6th St.

This dusty saloon is the beating heart of the East 6th music scene, with a robust calendar that's always diverse but generally hems closer to locals and up-and-coming national acts from the blogosphere of Pitchfork, Stereogum, and the like. The vibrant back patio provides an unbeatable vantage point of a typical night out in Austin, complete with carousing youngsters, aging indie hipsters, honky tonk bros, and just about everything in between.

900 Red River St.

This rawkus downtown venue has been rumored to be on the brink of extinction for years, so it's a better time than any to assemble your crew and cut a rug at one of the preeminent LGBTQ-ish clubs before the slow, violent churn of gentrification claims yet another real one. The cramped quarter of the indoor dance floor maximize the party vibes even on weekends, and the outdoor space—which butts up against a massive limestone rock wall to dramatic effect—is a great place to rip a few shots and get down until denizens of the adjacent hotels and apartments call in yet another noise complains.

801 Red River St.

Only in Austin does one of the preeminent midsize outdoor music venues double as a legendary barbecue joint that has its own sauce you've probably seen at your local Kroger or Target. These days the barbecue at Stubb's is a serviceable afterthought to the heavyweight touring acts that grace its stage on a weekly basis, and it's a serious hub of SXSW activity when the music industry's favorite trade show turns the entire city into an ad hoc indie rock boomtown for a week every March.

2015 E Riverside Dr.

Though this legendary indie club opened a few years after the term “emo-core” was coined, its status as a must-play venue during the salad days of the burgeoning punk offshoot was cemented long before emo was we know it became a mainstream genre. In 2011 it moved from its original downtown location to its current spot just south of downtown in the Riverside neighborhood, and a quick scan of its calendar reveals that its bookings are as crucial as ever. It's the platonic ideal of a mid-size venue with excellent sight lines, efficient bar service, and a penchant for booking bands that are often too big for the space by the time their gig comes around.

While the author Pete Cottell isn't local to Austin, his fierce devotion to finding the best live music, barbecue, and dialed-in urbanity has brought him to the shores of the Colorado River more times than he can count. It took a few trips for him to figure out that they're food trucks (not carts, as in his former home of Portland) and that you probably should not trust any barbecue spot with no line and a pile of brisket left around dinnertime. He's deeply concerned about the condo plague that's stricken the beloved East 6th corridor, and he would rather rub elbows with weird uncles from Iowa and Oklahoma in the hours-long Franklin Barbecue queue than get within 20 feet of the Comedy Mothership, or anywhere on “Dirty 6th,” for that matter.

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses are very good smart glasses. If you're into face computers, these will do what you want them to do. They snap pictures, record video, play music, and take calls. You can use AI voice commands to find your way around, translate foreign languages live, or inquire about what kind of spider happens to be dangling right in front of your face at the moment.

The $379 frames are Meta's entry-level smart glasses, and a direct successor to the original that became a smash hit. They are $80 more expensive than their predecessor, but what you get in return is a better 12-MP camera capable of capturing photos and videos at up to 3K resolution. There are also options for recording up to 60 frames per second and shooting videos in slow motion. Battery life also gets a big bump, extending to 8 hours of various use, but more like 5 or 6 with constant use or less if you're recording high-def video the whole time. (The glasses record a maximum of three minutes at a time.)

For most people, the affordability and relative simplicity of the Gen 2 frames are going to make them the most appealing Meta glasses. They don't have quite the GoPro-esque camera capabilities of the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguards, which my colleague Adrienne So liked a lot. They also don't have a display in the lens, like the $799 Meta Ray Ban Display. (We have not been able to review the Display glasses yet because Meta said it prioritized sending review units to “creators,” i.e., influencers.)

I have been using the Gen 2 smart glasses for about a month. Meta handed them out for free to the journalists and influencers at its Connect developer event in Palo Alto in September, and I've been wearing them since then. These feel a lot like the previous pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses I've used. They weigh about the same, offer many of the same visual styles, though there are a few new colors to choose from. (I got cosmic blue.)

Music playback on the frame's speakers sounds fine, but I still prefer wireless earbuds for something I actually want to listen to. Podcasts and phone calls sound great, though—voices seem to shine on the glasses. The touch controls along the sides of the frames work well enough, which is nice considering oversensitive touch controls on wearables can often trigger an unintended reaction like accidentally pausing a track or changing the volume.

The glasses are lightweight compared to the face computers of the past, but they are heavy enough to leave deep red divots on either side of the bridge of my nose after a couple of hours of wearing them. This is probably a skill issue, since I don't have prescription lenses and normally just wear sunglasses.

It's a petty peeve, but I much prefer polarized lenses, which Meta doesn't offer. At least you can get them with Transitions lenses, which is what I tested. Those do a good job of reacting to the light, but I find they don't ever feel quite dark enough to keep me from squinting on a sunny day.

As I wore them on one of my walks through San Francisco, on the shore of Ocean Beach, I came upon a dolphin-like fish that had washed up on the sand. Though I got my camera glasses close enough to the thing that I could smell it, Meta's AI assistant could not tell me what kind of animal it was. It correctly identified that it was very dead and that I should not touch it. It was then able to direct me to a number to call for city animal control services.

Beyond instances like that, I tend to avoid the AI voice interaction because I haven't gotten to the point where it feels natural. Getting it to search something is usually very quick, but doing so requires you to stop dead in your tracks, stare directly at another person's purse or something, and say out loud, “Hey Meta. HEY META. Is this bag Gucci?”

The glasses' AI features are both its best asset and biggest weakness. Features like live language translation and whispered map directions are very helpful. But if you've spent any time curating the AI slop out of your Facebook feed lately, you'll know that Meta just can't help pack a firehouse blast of AI features into everything it does.

The software features are funneled through the same app as Meta's AI services. That's where pictures and videos go by default, and sometimes you have to go into the app to import the files from the glasses. There's a very clear problem with using the app: bad vibes.

When you go into the Meta AI app to look at the pictures or videos you've taken, the first thing you'll see is Meta's terrible new Vibes service; a constant barrage of AI slop videos that Meta just one day foisted upon its app users. Vibes is akin to OpenAI's dubious Sora app, but somehow even worse quality.

Every time I try to go find a picture I've just taken with my glasses of some cute dog, I first have to swipe past AI slop. If I'm lucky, it's a bunch of uncanny AI cats riding motorcycles or dancing to hip hop beats. If I'm unlucky (usually the case), it's a bunch of cringey political videos, like AI Obama getting arrested by ICE or one where an AI President Trump lookalike leans over a visibly pregnant Statue of Liberty who also seems to be giving birth to an egg. It's such a shift from the things that the glasses do best, which is to let you capture and interact with the real world.

Vibes is a service I wish I could opt out of by launching it straight into the sun, but unfortunately, it has become an inescapable part of my Meta Ray-Ban software experience. The thing all of Meta's glasses do really well is remind you that you're wearing a device made by Meta, a company that has a long history of playing hot potato with user data and a leader who has displayed increasingly craven capitulation to power.

The glasses are great, but I find myself feeling hesitant to wear them around in public. I get more double takes and suspicious looks on the bus than I've noticed before. To be fair, that might just be aesthetics, as I've been told by almost all my friends that my face doesn't take to square glasses well. (“You just look wrong,” one told me while I wore the glasses in a restaurant.)

Fashion aside, these devices are in a fraught place. Privacy rights and the absolute explosion of surveillance tech are much harder to ignore these days. Especially as people buy mod kits to disable the indicator light on the Meta glasses that let people see when the Meta glasses are recording, or use their glasses to record themselves harassing workers in massage parlors.

I'm not saying these are glasses for creeps, but I can't help but feel like one while wearing them.

Researchers find that hyper-doped epitaxial Ge films become superconductors at cryogenic temperatures.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers at NYU and the University of Queensland have demonstrated superconductivity in gallium-doped epitaxial germanium, fabricated using industry-standard semiconductor tools. The new material switches to a superconducting state below 3.5 Kelvin and supports dense, wafer-scale Josephson junction arrays, an important building block for quantum and cryogenic RF circuits.

The team's prototype demonstrates millions of superconducting junctions integrated on a single 2-inch wafer. Junctions were lithographically defined and electrically characterized at low temperatures, confirming both superconducting behavior and practical current densities for device integration.

The process relies on molecular beam epitaxy to grow ultra-clean germanium films with gallium dopants inserted directly into substitutional lattice sites. At sufficiently high doping concentrations, the films undergo a bulk superconducting transition. Crucially, the interface remains epitaxial and free of disordered interlayers, which are known to degrade junction performance in hybrid stacks.

The work marks a significant shift from small-batch, layered superconductors toward scalable wafer-level integration on semiconductor-grade substrates. Because the doped Ge films are grown using the same epitaxial techniques used in compound semiconductor and cryo-CMOS production, the platform should be theoretically compatible with existing foundry workflows.

Superconducting qubit arrays and cryogenic microwave front-ends today depend on complex packaging steps to integrate semiconducting control logic with superconducting interconnects. Embedding both domains into a monolithic stack removes key bottlenecks in parasitic capacitance, thermal anchoring, and interconnect reliability, which currently limit performance in high-density quantum systems.

The researchers also emphasize the uniformity of their junction fabrication, showing highly consistent critical current densities across large areas. While the transition temperature remains firmly cryogenic, the manufacturability shift opens the door to wider deployment in quantum computing, low-noise detection, and space-based cryo-RF applications.

For now, the focus turns to larger wafers, reproducibility across fabrication nodes, and coupling between superconducting Ge films and conventional on-wafer logic. If follow-up work confirms these properties, superconducting Ge may offer a pragmatic route to scalable quantum interconnects.

Cold plunging at the gym or having a chilly shower at home has become a popular practice in recent years. But is all the self-inflicted freezing really that good for you? With the promise of boosting your mood, providing mental clarity, and reducing muscle soreness post-workout, it may sound enticing, but it's not for everyone. Aside from making your teeth chatter, there are the notable negatives as well as its positives to consider.

Tasked with the challenge of testing the latest cold-plunge pools earlier this year, I reluctantly jumped on the bandwagon. With my adrenaline pumping and my endorphins having a disco post-plunge, I was hooked and have since became an ice bath advocate. But as with every wellness craze, it's worth keeping up with the ever-changing advice on best practices. Keen to find out more, I asked Gary Brecka, top biohacker and founder of The Ultimate Human, for advice on how to cold plunge for maximum benefit.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newbie wondering what all the fuss is about, take a deep, calming breath and jump right in. Find options for your own ice bath in the WIRED guide to the best cold-plunge tubs, with designs from the likes of PolarMonkeys, CalmMax, Plunge, and more.

Whether it's in the sea, a lake, or an ice bath at your local gym or at home, cold plunging means immersing your body in water that is 39 to 59 defrees Fahrenheit (4 to 15 Celsius). If you don't have a gym membership and don't fancy stripping down to your bathing suit at the local lake, an indoor bathtub filled with icy cold water will do. “You don't need an expensive set up,” says Brecka. “A bathtub with ice works. A horse trough in the backyard works. Dedicated plunge pools are convenient, but you'll get benefits no matter how you create cold exposure. It's consistency that matters more than equipment.”

So how long do you cold plunge and what temperature should a cold plunge be? Brecka suggests two to six minutes as the ideal time. It's long enough to activate the nervous system and short enough to stay safe. If you're new to cold plunging, however, under a minute is plenty.

“What are the benefits of cold plunging?” is the million dollar question you're probably asking yourself, right as you're staring into the tub (along with “Why don't you just have a warm cookie and hot chocolate instead?” which is what I often hear my inner child say.) Brecka suggests persevering for maximum benefit.

“We do a plunge because cold exposure activates your nervous system, improves circulation, and helps your body adapt to stress,” he says. “Cold plunging is not about powering through the shock, it's about letting that shock drive physiological change.”

Some studies show benefits for cold plunging, including from Harvard Medical School. While those studies are encouraging, however, they are not conclusive, and their effects vary considerably across the board.

“Exposure to cold water boosts levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that increases your energy level and makes you feel more alert,” says Brecka. “You can also get a big, measurable spike in dopamine release. This is the neurotransmitter that's linked with feeling pleasure and motivation. That's why I call cold plunging my ‘drug of choice.' It also activates cold shock proteins, which help protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Cold exposure constricts blood vessels, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and helps the body recover faster.”

While it can be beneficial for both men and women, evidence is limited.

“For women, plunging right before ovulation may feel more stressful due to hormonal shifts, so it's best to listen to your body,” says Brecka. “For men, there aren't the same cycle considerations, but the benefits apply across the board.”

While cold plunging has a lot of instant positive effects, it's not safe for everyone. “You're not a polar bear,” points out the American Heart Association. Sudden immersion can cause “cold water shock,” with a sudden increase in breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. You should always check with a doctor for any underlying health conditions before you cold plunge.

“Going too cold, too fast, or too long can cause shock or fainting,” says Brecka. “The main risk is pushing past your body's limits. Always breathe, relax, and build tolerance gradually. I would recommend keeping it under five minutes, especially to start. People with heart conditions should consult a doctor.”

Cold plunging needn't be a public affair to broadcast on your socials. If you're keen to give it a try but are worried about the freezing temperatures, you can start with a cold shower.

“Get comfortable with 30 to 60 seconds at the end of your shower,” says Brecka. “Then progress to cold plunges at 50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit for a few minutes and build down over time. Cold showers trigger some of the same effects. But full immersion in cold water is more powerful as it hits more surface area and drops your core temperature faster. Showers are a great entry point, but plunges are the deeper therapy.”

Trent Alexander-Arnold scored 23 goals and contributed 92 assists in his 354 appearances for Liverpool

Trent Alexander-Arnold says his feelings for former club Liverpool will not change, no matter what reception he receives on his Anfield return with Real Madrid. 

The Spanish giants face the Reds in the league phase of the Champions League on Tuesday, 4 November. 

Alexander-Arnold was criticised by some Liverpool fans for the way he allowed his contract to expire, before eventually leaving in June for a reported cut-price £8.4m so he could join Real Madrid at the Fifa Club World Cup.

"No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool," the 27-year-old full-back told Amazon Prime, when asked if getting a good reception back at Anfield would give him closure.

"I have got memories there that will last me a lifetime and no matter how I am received, that won't change."

He made 354 appearances for his boyhood club, turning out for the final time in May against Crystal Palace, after which they were presented with the Premier League trophy.

Alexander-Arnold was one of three senior Liverpool players - alongside captain Virgil van Dijk and talisman Mohamed Salah - to enter the final year of their contracts last season.

Van Dijk and Salah ended up signing new two-year deals in April, after which the spotlight turned solely on the England defender. 

Posters were put up outside the ground by disgruntled supporters, questioning his loyalty to the club where he had won two league titles, as well as the Champions League, Fifa Club World Cup, FA Cup and Carabao Cup.

"I think whichever way I am received is the decision of the fans," added Alexander-Arnold. "I will always love the club. I will always be a fan of the club. I will always be thankful for the opportunities [Liverpool gave me] and everything that we achieved together will live with me forever."

He also said he would not celebrate if he scored against Liverpool and revealed many of his former team-mates got in touch when the Champions League draw was confirmed.

"I spoke to Robbo [Andy Robertson], Mo [Salah], Ibu [Ibrahima Konate]," added Alexander-Arnold. "They were just laughing. I think everybody knew it was going to happen. We will put our emotions to one side and play the best football we can."

Alexander-Arnold has only recently returned to the Real Madrid squad after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in a Champions League tie against Marseille on 16 September.

But he has yet to make an appearance in the side and likely to start on the bench against Liverpool as 15-time European champions Real - managed by another former Reds player in Xabi Alonso - bid for a fourth successive win in this season's competition.

Alexander-Arnold has endured a difficult time since his Madrid move, struggling to establish himself in the first team, being left out of the England squad and sidelined by injury.

But he praised Real's England midfielder Jude Bellingham for helping him to adapt. 

"He is a great lad and a great friend," said Alexander-Arnold. "It's good to have someone else that is English here. We both understand each other very well and know each other very well. He made settling in a lot easier for me."

Trent Alexander-Arnold insists he won't celebrate if he scores for Real Madrid on his return to Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The England international is set to face Liverpool for the first time since leaving his boyhood club for the Bernabeu in the summer.

“If I was to score, then no I wouldn't celebrate to be honest,” he told Prime Video Sport. “It will be a big difference for me going into the away dressing room, warming up on the other side.

“When I made the decision to move on, it was probably destined that at some point being here I'd play against Liverpool.”

Alexander-Arnold, 27, who has been an unused substitute in Madrid's past two matches after recovering from a hamstring injury, says whatever reception he gets from the home supporters won't change his affection for Liverpool.

He was booed by a significant section of fans after announcing his plan to leave in May, but was ultimately given a warm send-off amid the Premier League title celebrations.

“Whatever way I'm received, is the decision of the fans,” he said.

“I'll always love the club, I'll always be a fan of the club. I'll always be thankful for the opportunities and the things that we achieved together… they'll live with me forever.

“No matter what, my feeling won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime.”

Alexander-Arnold revealed that he spoke to former team-mates Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah and Ibrahima Konate after the draw for the league phase paired the two European heavyweights together.

“We were just laughing,” he added. “I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen. We need to put emotions aside and play the best game we can.

“They are a top team so I knew at some point I'd end up facing them. It's happened so soon. Mixed emotions. It will be a very difficult game, but one I am excited for. Huge game, huge stage.

“Although they haven't had the results of late, they're still a top footballing team, and nobody here thinks it's going to be an easy game.”

Alexander-Arnold also spoke about the influence of fellow England international, club team-mate and close friend Jude Bellingham in convincing him to make the move last summer.

He said: “There was a lot of speculation… the ‘agent Jude' stuff. It was more so in his first season (at Real Madrid).

“We would meet up at England camps and everyone would want to know what it was like behind the scenes. He said it was incredible, and he had never felt anything like it.

“The drive from the whole club, to win and the expectation to win.

“He talked so highly of the club, and I'd made my mind up at the end of the day, I decided I needed a change for me, on and off the pitch. I wanted a new challenge so it was time to go and do that. It's good to have someone else who is English here. It made settling a lot easier for me.”

Premier League rivals Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are all set to go head-to-head in the transfer market to secure a move for FC Porto's star striker Samu Aghehowa. The young Spaniard has enjoyed tremendous success since moving to the Liga Portugal in the summer of 2024. The 21-year-old is a key figure in the Porto squad, but the club are reportedly ready to sanction a move for him.

The Blues were linked with a move for the young Spanish striker in the summer of 2024 and had even agreed to pay £35 million ($44m) to secure his transfer but the move collapsed at the last moment after Aghehowa failed his medical test, following sustaining an ankle injury. The youngster returned to Atletico Madrid before being shipped off to FC Porto.

Aghehowa enjoyed a stellar debut campaign in Portugal as he scored 27 goals across all competitions and provided three assists. In the 2025-26 season, the 21-year-old has scored nine goals in 11 appearances. As Aghehowa continues with stunning form, he has attracted interest from Chelsea, alongside Tottenham Hotspur, according to Correio da Manha. 

The report further adds that former Blues manager and current Porto president Andre Villas-Boas is ready to sanction a move for Aghehowa. The striker's current deal at the Liga Portugal side runs until 2029 and has a €100million (£88m/$115.9m) release clause; however, Villas-Boas could let him leave for €80m as he considers it to be an "irresistible deal".

Correio da Manha also claims that Porto are ready to sell the striker in the upcoming January transfer window due to financial pressure, and the club believes that they are well covered in the striker position and feels that the management will be able to find a suitable replacement for Aghehowa within the roster. 

While the two London clubs are being strongly linked with a move for the Spain international, there is no guarantee that either of the clubs would consider making a bid for the Porto star in the next transfer window, as both teams spent heavily during the summer. 

The other clubs from the English top-flight had shown interest in Aghehowa in the last summer transfer window as Newcastle United and Aston Villa reportedly considered signing him, but both offers were turned down. 

Portuguese outlet Record reported in August that the Magpies had enquired about the striker as they were desperately looking for Alexander Isak's replacement at that time. But despite their strong interest, the Spaniard turned the offer down as he was fully committed to Porto's campaign and was looking forward to winning more trophies. In the case of the Villans, the club made an enquiry with Porto but did not make an advance due to his massive release clause, which the Premier League were not in a position to match. 

After a shock defeat at the hands of Sunderland last weekend, Chelsea returned to winning ways on Saturday as they edged out Spurs 1-0 courtesy of Joao Pedro's first-half strike. The Blues climbed back into the Premier League's top four with a deserved win away at Spurs on Saturday. Enzo Maresca's side were head and shoulders above their London rivals as the disparity between the two teams was clear for all to see throughout the 90 minutes, with Thomas Frank's side registering just three shots in total and one on target.

The Blues next face Qarabag in the Champions League away from home on Wednesday, before hosting Wolves for a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on November 8.

Nashville started strong and held on to an early lead to beat Inter Miami in game two of their first round MLS playoff series, 2-1, on Saturday night. Lionel Messi scored the only goal for Miami, who threatened late but were unable to find a stoppage time equalizer, and could now face a second straight opening round elimination after taking a 1-0 lead.

Miami got off to a signature slow start, with some sloppy defensive play costing them the lead. Rocco Rios Novo reacted late to Hany Mukhtar's lofted ball, Sam Surridge galloped onto it and was clipped while trying to round the stranded goalkeeper. The referee had no choice but to point to the spot, and Surridge converted. 

The Herons created in patches, though. Luis Suarez hit the post. Messi poked wide. Allende should have scored after 30 minutes, but Tadeo Allende missed from close range with the goal gaping. Still, another Miami lapse was costly. They fell asleep on a corner, and center back Josh Bauer simply reacted first to a loose ball. He comfortably hooked home with the goal gaping. 

The second half was all Miami, but not enough. Messi provided a moment. Nashville made the error of allowing him to cut left, and smash into the top corner. It seemed like the inevitable equalizer was coming. But Nashville defended well, cut off angles, and after clearing a last-minute free kick, were good value for the home win. And now, it would seem, anything can happen in the last game of the series.

GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Geodis Park.

Rocco Rios Novo (4/10):

Made a fairly woeful mistake, misjudging a long ball, and gave away a penalty as a result. Nowhere on the second goal.

Ian Fray (6/10):

Got into the scrappy stuff early, and certainly could have been sent off. Will need to keep his cool a bit more in the series final. 

Maxi Falcon (6/10):

Didn't step quickly enough on the Mukhtar through ball before the penalty, allowing Surridge to win the penalty.

Noah Allen (7/10):

Sacrificed for a more attacking setup at the break - which was unfair given that he turned in a solid first half.

Jordi Alba (6/10):

Scampered up and down the left. Played some nice passes, connected with Messi, but could never find the killer ball.

Baltasar Rodriguez (5/10):

Hardly involved in 50 minutes of action, and was dutifully hooked.

Rodrigo De Paul (8/10):

A really composed midfield performance without much support. Smooth on the ball, found all of the right passes. 

Sergio Busquets (5/10):

Dropped into a load of deep positions and left De Paul isolated at times. Undone when the game opened up. Leggy by the end. 

Tadeo Allende (5/10):

Missed a golden opportunity in the first half, and never fully recovered. 

Lionel Messi (8/10):

Basically marked out of the game for 89 minutes, then scored an absolute worldie to give Miami life. 

Luis Suarez (6/10):

Hit the post, and was otherwise pretty quiet. 

Telasco Segovia (7/10):

Added a bit more creativity in the midfield when introduced at half-time.

Mateo Silvetti (6/10):

Hardly involved in an underwhelming second-half showing

Javier Mascherano (5/10):

Went unchanged from the first game win, which he can't really be blamed for. But was then outcoached and will have to face the nerves of a deciding game.

Jannik Sinner clawed closer to Carlos Alcaraz in their Big Titles battle on Sunday when he won the Rolex Paris Masters title.

The Italian defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime for the trophy to claim his first ATP Masters 1000 crown of the season. He now owns 10 Big Titles — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals.

Sinner now trails Alcaraz by just four Big titles. The Spaniard has earned five such trophies in 2025 — three Masters 1000 titles and two major triumphs — to three for the Italian. The 24-year-old has emerged victorious at two majors and one Masters 1000 event.

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




NATPF

The San Candido native has claimed Masters 1000 glory at least once in three consecutive seasons. It is also the second straight year he has earned at least three Big Titles, after winning six in 2024.

The new No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings now owns the fifth-most Masters 1000 titles among active players with five. Only Novak Djokovic (40), Alcaraz (8), Alexander Zverev (7) and Daniil Medvedev (6) own more of the prestigious trophies.

Sinner has won a Big Title for every 6.3 tournaments he has played in his career. Only Djokovic (3.3), Rafael Nadal (3.5), Alcaraz (3.9), Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) have won the events at a higher rate.

There is one more Big Title up for grabs this season, with Sinner and Alcaraz set to headline the field at the Nitto ATP Finals from 9-16 November. Sinner is the defending champion at the year-end championships, which Alcaraz has not yet won.

Maximum coiling of his shoulders is the secret ingredient to his incredible shot.ByJon LeveyPublished Nov 02, 2025 copy_link

Watch almost any top-level tennis player hit a forehand, and you'll notice something subtle but consistent—their off-hand isn't just hanging around. It's active, engaged and perfectly synchronized with the hitting arm. During the takeback, it helps position the racquet and rotate the upper body. This creates structure and stored energy to release into the shot.

For most players, the hands separate during the takeback and the off-arm stays parallel to the net© 2025 Robert Prange

Then there's Carlos Alcaraz. The current men's No. 1 has his own distinctive spin on the technique. Where most players let go of the racquet's throat when the off-arm is just about parallel to the net, Alcaraz hangs on until his left hand is even with his hitting shoulder. This benefits his forehand in a few significant ways:

Creates even greater upper body tension. Mimic Alcaraz's turn and you can feel the stretch in the lats. The added shoulder rotation builds greater stored energy to release into the shot.Faster swing speed without extra motion. Alcaraz's shoulders turn more, but he keeps a nice bend in the hitting elbow and the racquet head even with his chest, just like players with more modest rotation. He uncoils with a loose arm to generate immense racquet head speed without an overly exaggerated swing path.Yes, Alcaraz is something of a unicorn—not everyone can duplicate his range of motion, upper body flexibility or otherworldly timing. But even coming close to his shoulder turn will add extra mph to your forehand.Give it a try the next time you play. After you blast a winner by your opponent, don't forget to crack a big smile just like Carlos.

You'd be forgiven for forgetting -- it's been six years -- but Timea Babos still holds three titles, and with Luisa Stefani by her side, she's not done collecting hardware.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- They are gathered here, the best and the brightest tennis players of 2025. Who, we ask you would-be tennis aficionados, is the only one with multiple WTA Finals trophies in the case at home?

This week the question was posed to a number of people in and around the game -- and many came up empty.

The most popular answer was Katerina Siniakova, the 29-year-old from the Czech Republic with a total of 11 Grand Slam doubles to her credit. But, after losing in the WTA Finals twice in the past three years, she has only a single title, with Barbora Krejcikova three years ago in Guadalajara.

Other prominent vote-getters: Iga Swiatek (2023) and last year's singles winner, Coco Gauff, are proud owners of one title at the year-end championships. This is Elise Mertens' seventh trip to the WTA Finals (with her fifth doubles partner), but she, too, has only one title, captured three years ago in Fort Worth with Veronika Kudermetova.

“OK,” said Kudermetova, squeezing her eyes shut, racking her brain. “Maybe, maybe … it's Babos! Yes, yes!”

Indeed, Hungary's Timea Babos won three straight titles from 2017-19, twice with Kristina Mladenovic and once with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova. Going back to 2015, she qualified five consecutive times.

“Of course I knew that,” Babos said. “It's a unique achievement.”

After an absence of six years, at the age of 32, she's back at the year-end championships.

“Doubles is about partnerships,” Babos said, “and I needed a very good partner. I mean, yeah, obviously I am very proud of that. But I needed Luisa to be here again.”

“Vice versa,” said her partner Luisa Stefani, who is playing in her first WTA Final.

On Sunday night, the No. 7-seeded team has a challenging opening match scheduled against No. 2 seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.

The origin story for Babos and Stefani, like so many others in doubles, has a distinctly random vibe.

Babos finished in the doubles Top 10 for seven consecutive years, from 2015-21, but her ranking drifted into the 50s the past two. She began the season with Nicole Melichar-Martinez, and the pair went 5-3 in their first three tournaments. 

Stefani picks up the story:

“I had a tough end of the 2024 season [knee surgery], so I was looking to get more matches and get my rhythm back. I went to play Linz [Austria] with Ingrid [Martins], a good friend of mine, also from Brazil, but the cut was so high, we didn't get in. 

“I saw Timmy was on the list as well, playing with a singles player [Lulu Sun], so I called her. We had never talked before, but I had her number. I was like, `Hey, Timmy, this is Luisa. Like I'm here, the cut is really strong. Do you want to play together so we can both get in?' ”

Babos was at home in Hungary, about a two-hour drive from Linz.

“I was like, 'It's close. Get some matches. Why not?' ” Babos said.

When they entered the WTA 500 tournament, Babos was ranked No. 84. And then she and Stefani blew through the draw, defeating doubles star Siniakova and Zhang Shuai in the semifinals and Lyudmyla and Nadiia Kichenok in the final. Babos moved up 36 spots in the rankings, and a partnership was born.

They went on to win three more titles, at the WTA 500 Strasbourg and Tokyo as well as Sao Paulo, where Stefani was born. They reached the final in Ningbo, locking down their berths in Riyadh, and the Tokyo win punctuated their regular season.

The pressure of trying to qualify late in the season created some positive chemistry between the two.

“We not only held the pressure good, but we outstepped our own limits,” Babos explained. “It was very tough but fun and good at the same time.”

Added Stefani, “I like her competitive spirit, her passion -- the way she brings it on the court and backs herself up. Like …

“… Basically,” Babos interjected, “I'm nuts a bit.”

The three championship trophies sit in a straight row of the case by the large-screen television in Babos' living room back in Hungary. The last one was handed to her by Martina Navratilova, whose name -- thanks to a record 13 WTA Finals doubles titles -- is on the trophy.

Honesty, both players insisted, was the key to their burgeoning relationship.

“In the beginning, when we didn't know each other you're trying to be too nice, go around certain things,” Babos said. “Maybe don't be direct about what I think she should do better or could do better. This we improved a lot. After honesty, we solved the problems. 

“Obviously, we complement each other good. She stays on the forehand side, which obviously I need. Her skills on the net are very unique. She's one of the best there. I'm glad we found each other.”

You'd be forgiven for forgetting -- it's been six years -- but Timea Babos still holds three titles, and with Luisa Stefani by her side, she's not done collecting hardware.

Anna Blinkova's victory at the Jiangxi Open on Sunday wasn't just a warning sign for her fellow competitors on the Hologic WTA Tour, but to the tennis circuit's translators as well.

Blinkova has been addressing the Chinese crowd in their native language all week -- and after defeating 17-year-old wild card Lilli Tagger 6-3, 6-3 in the final, she adeptly handled her own translation duties in both the trophy ceremony and her post-match press conference. Switching between English and Mandarin with ease, she required only a few pointers from the tournament's translator.

Jiujiang: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The Jiujiang title -- the second of Blinkova's career, following Cluj-Napoca 2022 -- marks the fulfilment of both a tennis goal and a language goal for the 27-year-old. As the Asian swing began in September, she told Bounces that she hoped to get the opportunity to give a interview in Mandarin, a language she has been learning since 2018 and which she felt was now up to the task of her media duties.

Blinkova's results didn't initially pan out, though. She fell in the Beijing first round, then in Wuhan and Guangzhou qualifying. In Jiujiang, however, the World No. 95 came through the draw without losing a set.

"I left home on September 8," she said. "I played so many tournaments and I lost in the first or second round, but I kept working hard every day, practising every day and believing I could still make a good result, even in the last tournament of the season. And I did it!"

Blinkova needed all of her self-belief to hold off Tagger, the teenage sensation who has made a spectacular WTA main-draw debut this week. The Austrian has wowed fans with her tennis in Jiujiang, not least a single-handed backhand reminiscent of the great Justine Henin. That shot was on full display early on, as Tagger unleashed a series of gorgeous down-the-line winners from that wing.

After an opening stretch of four consecutive breaks, Tagger seemed to gain the upper hand after battling through eight deuces, saving four break points, to seal the first hold of the match for a 3-2 lead. But instead, it was Blinkova who elevated her level after that marathon tussle, responding with a run of five straight games to lead 1-0 in the second set. Her own backhand was also proving efficient -- and she was increasingly able to steer traffic away from the Tagger signature shot.

"Her backhand was rock solid, but at some points I felt she started missing with her forehand," Blinkova explained. "So I played a bit more to her forehand in the important moments. I also put a lot of pressure with my return -- I was just a bit more aggressive and solid at the same time.

"I think she's a really great player for her age. She really pushed my limits today, and I had to play my best tennis to beat her."

No. 3 seeds Quinn Gleason and Elena Pridankina lifted the doubles trophy after edging Ekaterina Ovcharenko and Emily Webley-Smith 6-4, 2-6, [10-6] in the final. It was a second career WTA doubles title for Gleason (following Merida 2024 alongside Ingrid Martins), and a first for Pridankina.

Ovcharenko and Webley-Smith were both contesting a WTA final for the first time -- a particularly remarkable breakthrough for 41-year-old Webley-Smith. The Briton played her first professional match in 1999 and has won 27 ITF doubles titles. She reached her singles career high of No. 240 of No. 240 in 2011, and her doubles career high of No. 113 in 2015. This week, Webley-Smith delivered a career-best tournament that's been 26 years in the making.

Six days ago, Sinner and Zverev met in the Vienna final, with Sinner surviving, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, after two hours and 28 minutes.But their Paris clash couldn't have been any different, as Zverev only managed to win one game, holding in the first game of the second set—and Sinner had a break point in that game, too.At the end of the day the Italian was just too sharp, finishing the match with almost twice as many winners as unforced errors, 23 to 12, which includes more than three times as many winners as unforced errors off of his forehand side, 13 to 4.Zverev, meanwhile, had 6 winners and 20 unforced errors."Obviously I'm happy to be in the final but it's not how you want to arrive," Sinner said in his on-court interview. "Playing against Sascha is always a very special occasion, playing in a packed stadium, but today he was clearly not 100%. We saw that he was struggling physically. He had a tight schedule the past months."Yesterday an incredible match he won, two match points down, and it's difficult mentally—also physically, because he made the final in Vienna, then here making semis again. It's an incredible run for him, and we all hope that he gets better for Turin now."

Sydney Sweeney and her ex-fiancé, Jonathan Davino, allegedly had a tense reunion late Saturday night amid the actress' romance with Scooter Braun.

Sweeney was spotted getting into the passenger seat of a car being driven by Davino in Los Angeles Saturday night, according to photos obtained by Page Six.

The “Euphoria” actress, 28, was seen putting her hand in front of her face as the movie producer hit the gas and drove to her house.

A source who was near Sweeney's home told TMZ that they heard the “Anyone But You” star scream at him when she got out of the car.

 “I don't believe you. Please leave, leave me alone,” she allegedly yelled. 

Earlier in the evening, Sweeney had attended a private dinner with a group of friends at Santa Monica hotspot, Giorgio Baldi, to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the 2025 World Series.

After the Dodgers came out ahead in a 5-4 victory just before midnight local time, Sweeney was seen getting into an Uber that drove a few blocks away until pulling up next to Davino's car.

Sweeney — wearing a brown leather jacket, denim shorts and brown suede boots — and Davino swiftly made their getaway.

The “Anyone But You” star's reunion with Davino comes after Page Six reported that Sweeney is enjoying spending time with Braun.

“She enjoys having someone to ask advice from about her career,” a source told us last month.

While the source said that she likes hanging with the music manager, the insider said, “Don't expect any wedding bells… Her number one priority is her career.”

A source previously told us that Braun and Sweeney were very serious as a couple.

“They are full on. It's not a casual relationship,” the source said in October. “It's game on, it's full throttle. They are together.”

Another insider close to the pair informed us that Braun “really, really likes her.”

Sweeney and Braun, who were spotted looking cozy on several public outings, have been romantically linked since September.

At the time, Braun was back on the market after he and his ex-wife Yael broke up in 2021. The former couple, who finalized their divorce in 2022, share three children. 

Meanwhile, Sweeney ended her engagement to Davino earlier this year after seven years together. 

This isn't the first time Sweeney and Davino have joined together since deciding not to go through with their wedding. They also grabbed a low-key lunch in April.

Page Six has reached out to Sweeney's rep for comment.

They went to first base. 

Meghan Markle celebrated the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2025 World Series victory by giving her husband, Prince Harry, a big smooch on the lips.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were seen reacting to the Dodgers' game 7 win against the Toronto Blue Jays in a video posted to Markle's Instagram Story Saturday night.

Harry was seen seated in a reclining chair in what appeared to be a private theater as the “With Love, Meghan” host was heard cheering off-screen.

Markle then materialized and pranced excitedly over to the “Spare” author, who, unenthusiastically, remained in his seat.

She excitedly planted a kiss on Harry's lips as he wrapped his arms around her before she threw her arms up in excitement, yelling, “Oh my god!”

Markle then proceeded to jump up and down with her friend before they embraced, prompting Harry to let out a chuckle. 

The As Ever founder, 44, looked cozy in a black lounge set while Harry, 41, looked laid back in a collared shirt and pants. He appeared to be snacking on a box of popcorn. 

The couple opted for a private screening of the nail-biter game after facing backlash for their date night during Game 4 of the World Series earlier this week.

As Page Six reported, Harry and Markle were dressed in matching blue hats as they sat front row at Dodger Stadium in LA Tuesday.

The duo was seen chatting and laughing throughout the MLB game and even stood up from their seats to clap.

While they appeared to be in high spirits throughout the duration of the face-off, they were criticised for having better seats than several sports legends in attendance. 

Internet users were up in arms when they noticed Harry and Markle sitting in front of former Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax and Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson, who holds a 2.3 percent stake in the LA franchise.

The former athletes seemed unbothered by the seating snub as the Sussexes were seen having a friendly chat with Koufax. Markle and Harry also posed for a photo with Magic and his wife, Cookie Johnson.

Harry and Markle didn't have the warmest welcome from some fans in the stadium and received a few boos when they were shown on the Jumbotron.

On Saturday night, the Dodgers edged the Blue Jays 5-4 in an 11-inning thriller to claim back-to-back championships.

One day after beloved Hallmark star Paul Campbell confirmed that his comedy-infused mystery franchise, “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” has been canceled, shocked fans had already mobilized, launching a petition urging Hallmark execs to reconsider. 

Wearing the red ballcap from one of his character Alden Case's many hilarious disguises, Campbell posted an Instagram photo on October 31, 2025, and wrote, “Show may be cancelled, but he's still on the Case… IYKYK”

A post shared by Paul Campbell (@paulcampbellofficial)

In 2023's “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” Campbell and co-star Aimee Garcia play married couple Alden Case, a chronically unemployed but adorable, quirky guy searching for his purpose, and Birdie Case, a gifted attorney. When Alden signs up for private investigator classes, he gets sucked into a murder mystery, only to find Birdie may hold the key to cracking the case. 

Viewers loved it so much that a petition was started to convince execs to make a sequel. Over 1,300 fans signed the petition and months later, Campbell and Garcia got to reunite for “The Cases of Mystery Lane: Death is Listening,” which premiered in September 2024. 

The cancellation of the franchise hasn't exactly been a secret, but many fans may have missed the news or hoped it wasn't true. In May, Hallmark actor Matt Hamilton — who played dim-witted Officer Newton in both movies — first announced the cancellation on Instagram, writing, “Yes, Paul Campbell and I are building up a nice collection of cancelled shows together. First Turner & Hooch and now this. Not to brag or anything.”

Then, in late September, “Hallmark Mysteries & More” podcast host Eric Rutin shared a screenshot on Instagram of a comment from Campbell on his post about the future of the franchise. Campbell wrote, “We've been cancelled. No more cases for the cases.” 

But Campbell's October 31 post was the final nail in the coffin that fans hoped wouldn't come, and has inspired some to try their best at saving the franchise. 

Fans flooded Campbell's post with comments expressing their disappointment and surprise, including one who wrote, “I can't believe they cancelled it! I was loving the Mystery Lane movies, and YOU as Alden! Huge mistake. I love you! ❤️”

On November 1, Campbell shared in his Stories multiple posts that people shared about a brand new petition started by fan Susan Fraser on Change.org to “urge the decision-makers at Hallmark Channel to reconsider their decision to shelve ‘The Cases of Mystery Lane.'”

“The clever scripts, complete with the show's signature nerdy puns, offered a unique twist on the classic mystery genre – something that is sorely missing right now,” she wrote. 

Garcia also shared a link to the petition in her Stories, writing, “Aww…a petition for more #CasesOfMysteryLane shenanigans 🕵🏽‍♀️🕵🏼”

Even Tyler Hynes, Campbell's buddy and “Three Wisest Men” co-star, shared one of the posts to rally his fans to support the petition. 

Though Campbell continues to be one of Hallmark's biggest stars, with two Christmas movies still to come in 2025 — “The Wisest Men” and “Christmas at the Catnip Cafe” — losing “The Cases of Mystery Lane” franchise likely stings because it was a role he loved so much. 

In 2023, before the first movie premiered, he told TV Insider that it was his “dream role,” explaining, “It's quirky and it's silly and it's clever, and the relationship between the two leads is wonderful. They're real characters. There's humanity. It was everything you could possibly want, plus disguises, fake mustaches. I mean, you can't go wrong.”

Before the sequel premiered in September 2024, he told AssignmentX, “The hope is always that it will continue. When you film it, there's always the idea that, if this were to go on for a hundred episodes, you would be thrilled.” 

Those who want to throw their support behind the new petition can find it here.

Katy Perry is no longer keeping her romance with Justin Trudeau a secret.

During her latest concert in Prague on Thursday, the “Firework” hitmaker made it clear that she's no longer single. In a fan video shared on TikTok, Perry told the crowd that she saw a fan holding a sign asking to marry her.

“This guy is trying to get me to marry him, and he has a ring in his hand,” Perry told the audience. “No! I am dating someone else for crying out f*g loud!”

i can‘t with this woman 😂😂😂 @Katy Perry #katyperry #lifetimestour #prague #concert #katycats 

The “American Idol” judge and former prime minister were first romantically linked in July. At the time, Perry and Trudeau were spotted on a dinner date in Montreal and a stroll in Mount Royal Park.

In October, the two were pictured kissing on a yacht off the California coast.

Just last week, the two went public with their relationship when they packed on the PDA during a date night in Paris.

In a video obtained by TMZ, the couple can be seen walking out of the theater holding hands. They then walked to a waiting vehicle, looking quite happy.

Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Perry is very happy with her and Trudeau's blossoming relationship.

“Katy is really into it. She's very happy,” the source told the outlet. “[Katy] is trying to keep it low-key, and they've spent a lot of private time together. She's not looking to publicize this relationship.”

Trudeau, on the other hand, is said to be enjoying the new chapter in his life. A source told PEOPLE that Perry has become a bright spot for the politician after a tough couple of years.

“He is a much happier person now,” the outlet noted. “Stresses are greatly diminished. And he is intrigued with Katy. They have fun together, laugh a lot, talk about everything. His life is much improved, and his relationship with Katy has had a lot to do with it.”

The singer was surprised to find a fan holding a sign asking to marry her yet again — an offer she previously also turned down at her London show — and explained she's no longer available.

A source also told PEOPLE that Perry and Trudeau are “very much a couple” and always find time for each other despite their busy schedules.

“[They] have been seeing each other as often as possible,” the source told the outlet. “Obviously, she's busy, but so is he. Yet he goes the extra mile to be with her when possible. Especially when it's important.”

This sale is chef's kiss.

Quality cookware comes with a hefty price tag for two major reasons: It lasts longer than the cheap stuff, and it supposedly makes you a better chef. So, when I ponied up hard-earned cash for my first Our Place Always Pan, there were big expectations.

Let's just say that it impressed me so that since then, my kitchen has been nearly taken over by the brand's cookware and small appliances.

Even better, right now, most everything is a whopping 35% off during Our Place's early Black Friday sale — offering the biggest deals of the year.

The non-toxic, non-stick Always Pan has a smart design, with sides high enough to sauté and stir-fry, but low enough for pancake flipping. It's also oven-safe.

It comes with a wood spatula that smartly nests on the handle and an aluminum strainer that makes draining pasta or steaming veggies a cinch. (It's so pretty, I always leave it on my stovetop as well.)

I'm not alone in loving the Always Pan; Oprah called it a “kitchen magician,” and it's among our best luxury gifts inspired by celebrities. There's also an incredible Molly Baz X Crocs collab right now in the prettiest pale lemon colorway, and the sexy Titanium Pro style.

OK, I was in love with my original little pink Wonder Oven, another kitchen multitasker. It air-fries, toasts, bakes and reheats — and fast. It's perfect for small kitchens and has a petite counter footprint.

I may retire it, though, since trying the new Wonder Oven Pro, which is larger and impressively offers even more functionality. (This is the first time that it's been on sale!) I may never turn my regular oven on again.

Besides the myriad options of the original, it also proofs dough for homemade bread and pastries, and has a dehydrating function, to make sulfur-free homemade dried fruit snacks (or whatever dehydrated snacks you fancy).

What to shop next is a difficult choice; I have my eye on so many pieces, from saucepans to tableware. 

If a foodie is on your holiday list, there are giftable sets and suggestions starting under $50.

I love my mom's 1970s Le Creuset, but it has seen better days. This cast-iron stove-to-oven Perfect Pot might just be the one to replace it.

It gets rave reviews for everything from baking bread to family meals, not to mention the hot grips for easy handling are included.

I have some limited-edition mini bowls from the brand, which I've had for years, and they have not so much as chipped since then, despite getting used on a near-daily basis.

I'm so taken with the designs, I might add some dinner bowls for pasta and big salad bowls to my collection now, thanks to this sale.

The stackable set is made from chip-resistant ceramic stoneware and is available in three sizes and three colors (I'm just hooked on the spice hue).

I've since also added a Dream Cooker, which is a slow cooker and pressure cooker in one. 

Using it is the first time I've successfully cooked dried beans, and incredibly, they come out to buttery perfection in 20 minutes. Since the season is turning, I'll be making big pots of my apple pie filling, with maple syrup instead of sugar, that I put on everything all fall long.

The sale is through December 2, but the best things have a way of selling out early, so grab some kitchen heroes while you can.

So, these are not on sale, but I'm so infatuated with the hot grips with charms from the Crocs collab, the joy they will bring to everyday cooking might be worth the little splurge. They fit on the handles of all Our Place cookware, so you don't have to find your giant oven mitts.

However, the other hot grips (sans charms) are indeed marked down to $26 — if you're not a sucker for adorable kitchen accessories like me!

A great gift or a kitchen essential for any baker or chef, this Oeko-Tex certified, 100% cotton twill apron is included in the deals and comes in three colors. 

One shopper wrote, “Got this as a gift for my momma. She loves all the pockets and how sturdy it is!”

This marks Carlile's fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John.

Brandi Carlile returned to Saturday Night Live on Nov. 2 with a commanding performance of “Church & State” and “Human,” both from her newly released solo album Returning to Myself.

	This marks Carlile's fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John promoting their joint project Who Believes in Angels?. On Saturday's show, she took center stage solo, delivering two emotionally charged performances.

	Opening with “Church & State,” Carlile sang of a “failing empire” and sociopolitical unrest in a haunting arrangement co-written with producer Andrew Watt and longtime collaborators Phil and Tim Hanseroth. 

	











	She followed with “Human,” a soaring ballad that reflects on vulnerability and resilience — also the name of her upcoming Human Tour, which kicks off in February 2026.


	The two songs are from Carlile's eighth studio album, Returning to Myself, released Oct. 25. It marks her first solo LP since 2021's In These Silent Days, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, topped the Rock and Americana/Folk charts, and won multiple Grammy awards, including Best Americana Album and awards for “Broken Horses.” It also received seven Grammy nominations overall.




	Since her last solo project, Carlile has remained a central figure in American roots and rock music — curating music festivals (Girls Just Wanna Weekend, Echoes Through the Canyon), forming the country supergroup The Highwomen, and collaborating with legends like Elton John, Joni Mitchell and Tanya Tucker.


	Her SNL appearance follows a busy October that included performing at Mitchell's Joni Jam at the Hollywood Bowl and announcing her return to Europe in fall 2026 after the North American leg of her tour.


	Carlile also appeared in the episode's promos, stealing the scene with a joke about noticing co-star Ashley Padilla's haircut before Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller, who hosted this week's episode. “The second I saw you, I knew you had that new-haircut glow,” Carlile deadpanned — leading Padilla to declare her the new host.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump reminded everyone that New York's mayoral election on Tuesday is about him—to some extent—while making fun of each candidate.


	First, in response to the debate moderator (Kenan Thompson) asking the three main candidates why they would want “the worst job in the world,” former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (SNL host Miles Teller) explained: “As you all know, as soon as you are elected mayor, everyone in this city immediately hates you. And in that way, I am already one step ahead of the game.” 


	Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa (Shane Gillis) then answered succinctly: “I need a job.” And Zohran Mamdani (Ramy Youssef) acknowledged with a smile that what he wants to see in the city—affordable housing, free healthcare, free wifi—would probably not be happening.


	Trump (James Austin Johnson) entered the debate stage after each candidate was asked what they felt was the “biggest problem” they would have to deal with if elected.


	“It's me!” Trump declared. “We can pretend this election is going to be about housing or taxes, but it's about me, because I'm going to be very involved, very hands-on. This guy knows about ‘hands-on,' right Cuomo?”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Something must be done about Sliwa's “Emily in Paris-looking hat,” Trump continued, while Mamdani “looks like the subway takes guy went to work at McKinsey.”


	Trump then an answered a question that had been put to the candidates earlier: their preferred type of bagel.

	“Big Mac with a hole in the middle,” he said confidently.


	“Now I may not live in New York anymore, but I'm always watching, lurking in the shadows,” he continued, segueing into a Phantom of the Opera cosplay. “Maybe I'll add New York mayor to my list of duties.”

Lady Gaga just made her pick for who she wants to see win “Dancing With the Stars.” The pop icon revealed she's cheering for social media star Alix Earle and her pro partner Val Chmerkovskiy to take home the Mirrorball Trophy. On Friday, October 31, Earle shared a playful TikTok dressed as Gaga for Halloween, dancing and lip-syncing to the hit “Paparazzi.” “Gaga ween,” she captioned the post.

Gaga ween 🤸🏼👏🏻 pics up on my IG :)))

The video quickly caught Gaga's attention. In the comments, the singer left a sweet note of support for Earle, writing, “Girl, I love you and I'm rooting for you on DWTS! Thank you for this, it's so sweet,” along with two black heart emojis.

Fans went wild over the interaction, flooding the post with excitement. “The concept of Lady Gaga watching Dancing With the Stars,” one viewer wrote. Another added, “ALIX WAKE UP GAGA COMMENTED.”

Gaga may be cheering from the sidelines now, but she's no stranger to the “DWTS” ballroom. The singer performed during the Season 8 finale in 2009, and her songs have been featured in multiple routines over the years.

Earle and Chmerkovskiy have become standout performers this season. The duo topped the leaderboard on “Halloween Night,” earning a 39 out of 40 for their haunting tango to Billie Eilish's “Bury a Friend.” Cheryl Burke, who served as a guest judge, was the only panelist not to give a perfect 10.

After the episode aired, Earle's stepmom, Ashley, took a jab at Burke on social media, telling her to “go take more Ozempic.” She later apologized for the comment.

Earlier this week, Earle, 24, revealed that her spooky “Halloween Night” performance almost looked very different. In a behind-the-scenes TikTok posted October 30, she explained that the pair originally planned to start their tango buried under a pile of dirt.

We couldn't see and dragged dirt across the whole floor so we had to change the material in the box 😭. @Val 

“This is crazier than expected,” Earle said in the video as she stood in the mock graveyard set. “I mean, it looks pretty cool.”

However, after several rehearsals, the pair realized that the dirt was getting in their eyes and spreading across the ballroom floor. To keep the set clean and safe, producers decided to replace the dirt with rubber mulch.

“We couldn't see and dragged dirt across the whole floor, so we had to change the material in the box 😭,” she captioned the video.

A post shared by Alix Earle (@alix_earle)

Despite the last-minute change, Earle and Chmerkovskiy's performance earned high praise from both fans and judges. The pair scored an additional four points after finishing second in the “Dance-Monster-thon,” bringing their total score for the night to 43.

Earle later joked in the comments that she was still finding dirt and sand in her costume for days and gave a shout-out to the “DWTS” crew for their hard work cleaning up the mess.

“Dancing With the Stars” airs live Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC and Disney+, with next-day streaming on Hulu.

	The federal government is still shut down, food stamps are being cut off for millions of Americans, the Los Angeles Dodgers are still grinding it out with the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series Game 7 and there are big elections in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey on coming this week. So, of course, tonight's Saturday Night Live opened with a fictional Big Apple Mayoral debate.


	As the Kenan Thompson-portrayed New York newsman Errol Louis (“the least famous person to be impersonated on SNL”) spoke truth to aspiring power:  “Why would you want the worst job in the word?”

	











	Returning host Miles Teller played ex-Empire State governor and alleged sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo (“I know this city like the back of a women's back”), and the SNL-fired and later host Shane Gillis put on the red beret to be low-polling Republican candidate and Guardian Angel CEO Curtis Sliwa. Upping the ante, Ramy Youssef showed up as front-runner Zohran Mamdani.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Pitching himself to New Yorkers, Youssef's much mispronounced Mamdani put in bluntly and smoothly in that TikTok kinda way that has characterized the long-shot race that the Assemblyman is almost certain to win: “Once you vote for me, you know you'll feel a little less bad about that chicken and rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen, so why don't you hit me up on the ballot box, girl?”


SNL being SNL, even in what was ultimately one of the most topical but forgettable cold opens in ages, cast member James Austin Johnson showed up as Donald Trump. 


	Swearing that his go-to bagel order is a “Big Mac with a hole in the middle,” the former New York resident cut to the chase and pronounced “this election is about housing and taxes, but we all know it's about me, right?”


	Which, almost everything in America is nowadays — sadly. Then, Johnson's Trump launched into a bit of Phantom of the Opera, with the mask — and then thankfully the seemingly shorter than usual cold open was over with the traditional “Live from New York, it's Saturday night!”

	











	The fourth episode of the Lorne Michaels-created NBC late-nighter's 51st season, SNL tonight sees Teller back as host for a second time. The Top Gun: Maverick and Eternity star is actually the SNL rookie this week compared to musical guest Brandi Carlile. Back for a third time as a solo performer, the 11-time Grammy winner also showed up on SNL in April for a stint with Elton John.


	Next week will see returning Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser make her SNL host debut. The November 15 show will have Chad Powers star Glen Powell playing frontman for the first time. As Deadline exclusively reported earlier this week, SNL will have a double punch of Thanksgiving and Christmas specials later this year too.

D'Angelo has been laid to rest after his death at 51 from pancreatic cancer. The soul legend was honored at a private funeral held Saturday, November 1, in Henrico, Virginia, according to a program shared by HuffPost deputy editor Philip Lewis.

The service, organized by D'Angelo's longtime friend Bill McGee, was described as a “celebration of life.” Bishop Ralland V. Robinson led the ceremony and delivered the eulogy for the “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” singer, while Pastor Jamal Bryant shared a special video message.

A post shared by 804 Hood News (@804hoodnews_)

Stevie Wonder, harpist Brandee Younger, and D'Angelo's former band, The Soultronics, performed during the memorial. The family's message in the program read, “We wish to express our profound gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of support. … Through music, love and light, Michael D'Angelo's spirit will shine forever.”

A post shared by Kareem Smith (@entertainmenttakeover_)

Questlove of The Roots helped organize the service and was personally thanked by the family for his support. On October 30, the musician paid tribute to his longtime friend in Rolling Stone, admitting he had long feared losing him.

A post shared by Eric Johnson (@upstairsaterics)

“Truthfully, I wasn't ready for that gut punch,” Questlove wrote. “I'd been bracing for it for some 25 years — since the deluge of [album] Voodoo in 2000. I always had a looming feeling concerning D like a ‘any moment now I will get ‘the call' feeling. Most of our mavericks who fly that close to the sun never get to see that journey through.”

A post shared by 449 Tea (@449.tea)

He reflected on the loss, adding, “And now here we are at 5:30 a.m. I had seconds to decide: How do I process this new reality? My preference was not to start my Tuesday morning … mourning.”

D'Angelo's family first confirmed his passing (as per Variety) on October 14 after a long battle with cancer. “The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,” they wrote in a statement. 

“After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, October 14th, 2025.”

They continued, “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all to join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.”

The four-time Grammy winner is survived by three children: son Michael Archer, whom he shared with late soul singer Angie Stone, and two younger children, daughter Imani Archer and son Morocco Archer. All three were listed as speakers at the memorial.

A post shared by Shauna Jones (@shauna_blacklens)

In October, Michael, 27, reflected on the pain of losing both of his parents in the same year. “I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers during these very difficult times, as it has been a very rough and sad year for me,” he told People. “I ask that you please continue to keep me in your thoughts as it will not be easy, but one thing that both my parents taught me was to be strong, and I intend to do just that.”

Imani also shared her heartbreak online, calling her father's death an “immeasurable loss.” “You were my biggest hype man, my protector, my biggest musical inspiration, the kindest and most selfless man, and the best father anyone could've ever had,” she wrote on Instagram. 

A post shared by Imani Archer (@imaniarcher)

“Till the very end, you made sure to protect me from anything that would scare or hurt me. I love you so much Daddy. I wish I had more time to spend with you.”

Leading figures across film, television, music and art came together Nov. 1 at the 2025 LACMA Art + Film Gala, including Angela Bassett, Demi Moore, Quinta Brunson, Dustin Hoffman, Tessa Thompson, Elle Fanning, Finneas, Demi Lovato and more.

Other attendees included Emmy-winning Hacks star Hannah Einbinder, F1 actor Damson Idris, Dancing with the Stars competitor Alix Earle, Nobody Wants This star Justine Lupe and Overcompensating creator Benito Skinner.

This year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art honors Mary Corse — the artist whose work across six decades has explored light, perception and subjectivity — as well as Sinners and Fruitvale Station filmmaker Ryan Coogler, who was in attendance alongside producer and wife Zinzi Coogler. Last year's honorees were artist Simone Leigh and director Baz Luhrmann.

The Gucci-sponsored event featured LACMA trustee Eva Chow and Leonardo DiCaprio as co-chairs for its 14th consecutive year.

Proceeds from the annual Art+Film Gala go toward underwriting LACMA's initiative to make film more central to the museum's curatorial programming, while also providing funding for exhibitions, acquisitions and education, in addition to allowing for screenings that explore the intersection of art and film.

Past honorees of the Art+Film Gala include artists Helen Pashgian, Catherine Opie, Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Barbara Kruger and David Hockney, as well as filmmakers David Fincher, Park Chan-wook, Steven Spielberg, Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, George Lucas, Kathryn Bigelow, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Clint Eastwood.

Dropout—the comedy company/streaming service that grew out of the collapse of CollegeHumor about five years back—has posted a pretty major milestone, per Variety. In a new interview with company CEO Sam Reich, the streamer revealed that it's now passed the 1 million paid subscribers mark.

That puts Dropout on roughly the same tier as niche streaming companies like Shudder or Acorn TV, and not far behind a sports streamer like FuboTV. Which isn't bad for a streamer that doesn't license any third-party content, and instead makes all of its own stuff—including format-breaking, improv-heavy game shows like Game Changer and Make Some Noise. (To say nothing of the company's other big flagship show, Dungeons & Dragons actual play series Dimension 20, which had live shows at both Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl in 2025.)

And, sure, those numbers start to look like slightly smaller potatoes compared to a Netflix—which has something like 300 million subscribers planetwide, a number that means its growth is starting to be curtailed by the total number of internet-connected humans on Earth as much as it is by more editorial concerns—or even the much smaller numbers posted by services like Apple TV+ (45 million) or Peacock (41 million).

Again, though: Those are arms of massive corporations, in comparison to a company that employs roughly 40 people, according to the Variety interview, and which makes and owns its own stuff, a rarity in the streaming world. It's also worth noting—at the risk of employing the dreaded “parasocial” word—that the company's subscribers tend to be a lot more committed than the average Netflix binger; it's not for nothing that the service recently unveiled a “Superfans” subscription tier, reportedly by audience request, which basically amounts to fans giving the company more than their normal $6.99 a month as a show of support, with only a few small perks thrown in.

Eric Dane was seen on a rare family outing with wife Rebecca Gayheart and daughter Georgia as he continues to battle ALS. 

The “Countdown” actor was pictured in a wheelchair alongside the model and their youngest daughter, 13, as all three headed out to West Hollywood hotspot Sushi Park on Thursday. 

He appeared to be in good spirits, wearing a casual black T shirt and beige pants, while Gayheart rocked what appeared to be black leather pants and a white tunic. At one point, he wore a black puffer coat.

Daughter Georgia matched her dad's vibe in a black T shirt, as well.

The sighting comes almost a month after the “Grey's Anatomy” alum, 52, revealed that he missed out on the show's epic reunion at the Emmy Awards because he was hospitalized after a bad fall. 

“ALS is a nasty disease,” he told the Washington Post in October, referencing his diagnosis of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

“So I was in the hospital during the Emmys getting stitches put in my head,” he divulged, adding that he was “really upset” about missing the milestone moment. 

The actor explained that “there was nothing I could do about it.”

The father of two publicly shared his diagnosis in April. “I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter,” he told People at the time.

Gayheart — who married the actor in 2004 and also shares daughter Billie, 15, with him — shared how his debilitating condition is affecting their teen daughters in a recent interview. 

“I mean, it's heartbreaking,” the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum told People at an event in September. “My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. It's a tough time.” 

Billie and Georgia are “taking it day by day” as their father faces the progressive neurodegenerative disease, she added. 

“We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love,” Gayheart continued. 

Though the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum hasn't yet found a “positive nugget” in the family's plight, she said they'd become closer as a family. 

“I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not,” she explained, adding that ALS is a “horrible disease.”

The “Urban Legend” actress clarified her relationship with Eric — who had previously been spotted stepping out with Janelle Shirtcliff in the months following his diagnosis — in April.

“We are best of friends. We are really close. We are great co-parents,” she told E! News at the time.

Gayheart and Eric called off their divorce after seven years in March, just prior to him announcing his diagnosis. 

“The Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” actress initially filed for divorce from the “Euphoria” star in February 2018, citing irreconcilable differences.

Famke Janssen has a new Netflix show out this week, with her Dutch crime drama Amsterdam Empire getting a global debut back on October 30. But, deep down, Janssen knowns that people are frequently only interested in asking her about one thing, i.e., a project she was last part of fully 11 years ago (and even then, only as a cameo): Fox's original X-Men movies, where she played psychic powerhouse Jean Grey. In fact, there's only one group that apparently resists the urge to ask Janssen about her time riding the ol' Phoenix on the regular: The Walt Disney Corporation, which has apparently never talked to her, even once, about reprising the role, despite its general nostalgia mining of the old X-properties in recent years.

“Never. Never ever,” Janssen said when asked by Entertainment Weekly if she'd ever had conversations about bringing her version of Jean back for the MCU. (This, despite the fact that a large number of her former co-stars on the franchise will be back for next December's Avengers: Doomsday, including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Rebecca Romjin, and Alan Cumming.) (We can't help but wonder if the absence is because the character's power level throws a bunch of MCU stuff out of whack—or if it's something simpler, like the fact that X-Men: Dark Phoenix, which focused so heavily on Sophie Turner's version of the character, was a disastrous flop for Disney in the immediate aftermath of its big Fox purchase.)

It all sounds pretty academic to Janssen, though, who appears to have gained some level of acceptance about how influential a role (that she herself apparently never cared all that much about) has become. “Every time I do an interview, it's mentioned,” she notes. “It's interesting. I didn't realize that was such a big part. Every interview I do, that will come up, and of everything I say, that is going to be the only thing that's gonna be printed. I should be flattered, I suppose, that this character has resonated with people. It's been so long, but it's nice that people are still talking about her. I'm sure every single time there's a new movie that they're doing… it'll come up again.”

Ariana Grande has officially wrapped filming on Focker-in-Law, the new installment in the Meet the Parents franchise set to bow next year.


	The two-time Grammy-winning pop artist marked the occasion with an Instagram carousel, featuring a first look at her character name, Olivia Jones. Details about who she will be playing have remained under wraps.


	“these past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes… so, so very much ♡ i will miss this bunch terribly. see you next november ! ♡,” she wrote alongside behind-the-scenes images featuring co-stars Ben Stiller, Beanie Feldstein, Skyler Gisondo and Eduardo Franco.

A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)


	Back in September, Stiller told E! News of working alongside the actress-singer: “What's surprising, and maybe not really surprising, is how amazingly she blended in. She's such a pro, she's so funny, she's so talented, obviously as a singer, but also she was so funny and amazing in Wicked. What she's doing in this movie is very unique, it's a very unique character, and we're having a great time and just like to work with her.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Scheduled for release Nov. 25, 2026, John Hamburg serves as writer and director of the fourth film in the franchise, which began with 2000's Meet the Parents. It followed Greg Focker, a nurse who suffers a series of unfortunate events while visiting his soon-to-be in-laws, played by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, who are set to reprise their roles. Teri Polo, who played Pam Byrnes, Greg's girlfriend-turned-wife, is also set to return. The jury is still out whether Barbra Streisand will reprise her role as Roz Focker, Greg's mom, and the EGOT winner has said she's “pissed” about having been paid less than her male co-stars in the franchise.


	Aside from appearing in Focker-in-Law, Grande has a busy slate ahead, with the forthcoming release of Wicked: For Good, her 2026 tour in support of her seventh studio album Eternal Sunshine and voice role in the new animated feature Oh, the Places You'll Go!, based on Dr. Seuss's classic children's book.

Check out highlights from Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys) tearing up the stage during SPN Nashville's Saturday Night Special concert.

Between Prime Video's The Boys: Vought Rising quietly rolling along with production (which is a nice way of saying that not a lot of news is getting out), and Countdown being cancelled (even as fans continue fighting to save it), we thought Jensen Ackles fans might want a little something in their lives that would give them a chance to smile. That's where Creation Entertainment's "The Road So Far… The Road Ahead": Creation Nashville comes in, with Ackles taking the stage to join Louden Swain, Mark Sheppard, and Richard Speight Jr. for the Saturday Night Special – and we've got some highlights to pass along.

Here's a look at some great videos that Creation Entertainment and Fangasm posted from this weekend's Saturday Night Special in Nashville:

An amazing Saturday Night Special in Nashville last night!

In September, Ackles was the subject of a profile interview with Variety, which covered a wide range of topics. Regarding Supernatural, Ackles shared how his 15-season run gave him "the tools" he needed to move on to roles in The Boys, Countdown, and Big Sky. As for his feelings about being most known for playing Dean Winchester, Ackles makes it clear that he wouldn't change it for anything, opening about about how much the Supernatural family still means to him to this day.

Jensen Ackles Credits "Supernatural" For Giving Him "The Tools" His Career Needed: "'Locked-in' is a good word. A lot of it depends on the people involved in the project. 'Supernatural' gave me not just 15 years of a great story to tell and family that I've now come to know and love, but it gave me the tools to continue doing what I'm doing. It also gave me some notoriety so that people like showrunners like Derek or even Elwood Reid, who brought me onto 'Big Sky' and has also brought me onto 'Tracker,' and of course Eric Kripke — it gave me some proof in the pudding that I'm happy to take on whatever kind of challenges these guys throw at me. So I think it was less of, like, 'OK, I have to do this specifically,' and it was more the opportunity to work with people who I admire and trust and know I'm going to have a good time telling a story with, and I've been very fortunate so far."

Jensen Ackles on Being So Identified with Dean Winchester: "I've Always Loved It and Embraced It, Always": "I've always loved it and embraced it, always. And I've met actors that have had very popular characters on very popular shows or movies, and maybe try to shy away from that, like, 'Oh, I don't want to be known for that.' I mean, there's a reason I did it for 15 years! I love that story. I love that character. I love the people I did it with. I would never shy away from or reject anything that has brought me to this place, because I'm very proud of what we all did on that show, and obviously, I continue to talk about it. We go and do these fan conventions, and it's a gathering around a bunch of people who have a similar affection towards these characters and the show, and I will always be proud of what we did with that."

SALT LAKE CITY — On Halloween night, while many were out trick-or-treating or attending costume parties, a brave group of locals chose a different kind of adventure — one that explores the haunted corners of Salt Lake City's historic downtown.

Their final stop? The iconic Salt Lake County Building, a stunning architectural landmark with a chilling reputation.

“There are definitely things happening here,” said Cody Owen, a guide with U.S. Ghost Adventures. “Something is here.”

Owen led a group of ghost-hunting enthusiasts through six of the city's most haunted locations, starting with the historic Capitol Theatre.

“On the second floor, things get moved around. Doors that are locked will be unlocked,” Owen explained. “We refer to one spirit as ‘George.'”

Armed with lanterns and EMF detectors — devices used to detect electromagnetic fields often associated with paranormal activity — the group wandered through the city's eerie landmarks. At one point, the EMF reader lit up green, startling even the most seasoned ghost hunters.

“My big takeaway for why this spirit, why his energy is here… is to warn us,” Owen said. “Whether the spirits are trying to prevent history from repeating itself or simply stay connected, they're here.”

For ghost-hunting enthusiast Gage Ramos, his appreciation for the past is more than just a thrill; it's something he likes to share with others.

“It's something I love doing with friends,” Ramos said.

As the night deepened and shadows grew longer, the Salt Lake County Building stood tall, a silent witness to the city's past, converging with the present – for a few lingering spirits.

                                    While the women accused in the infamous Salem witch trials in colonial America have long since been pardoned, the convictions of hundreds of British women executed under similar laws officially still stand. Now, one local authority in southern England is campaigning to change that.

When it comes to writing any piece of fiction, one of the hardest aspects to nail is the ending. That kind of sucks because it's also one of the most important aspects to get right. Wrapping everything up in a nice little bow whilst simultaneously saying what you intended to say from the start is actually not such an easy feat, as it turns out. This is especially true, considering that you can't please everyone, and that any ending will inevitably disappoint or anger some of the fans.

Perhaps no one knows this better than TV screenwriters, especially in the realm of fantasy, as there have been numerous TV shows that have dropped the ball for their final episodes. While not everyone loathed these finales with a passion, it's important to know that some were fine with them, and some even loved them. There's a lot of debate surrounding these final episodes, but there's no denying that they were extremely controversial, no matter where you stand.

With how long Supernatural lasted, creating a satisfying ending was going to be a difficult, if not insurmountable task. The longer a show gets, the more plot points spring up, and the more loose ends there are to wrap up when it comes time to say goodbye. Granted, many die-hard fans of Supernatural didn't really have anything bad to say about the finale, and it wasn't widely criticized for bad writing or bad character moments like other shows are.

The main reason Supernatural's finale was so divisive was that some felt it was way too long and drawn out, feeling like a gigantic epilogue rather than a proper conclusion. But again, with how long the show ran, perhaps this approach was for the best. Sure, it felt anticlimactic to some, but at least it didn't leave many unanswered questions. All in all, it's not really the most controversial ending to a TV show ever created, but it was still met with its fair share of disappointment. 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a staple of the 90s and early 2000s, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar in the titular role. This series was both a romance, a dark fantasy, and a coming-of-age teen drama all at once, which meant it resonated with a lot of viewers and appealed to a very broad audience. Perhaps it deserved a better finale than it got. It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't inspire the same level of near-unanimous approval as its earlier episodes did.

Those who weren't too pleased with Buffy's conclusion criticized it for its out-of-character moments and its abrupt change in direction, which disgruntled fans claimed were against the reasons they fell in love with the show in the first place. The buzz surrounding this finale, perhaps, wasn't quite as loud as it was for many other TV shows, but it was noticeable enough. Of course, some fans didn't mind the ending so much, but this didn't stop the louder, angrier group from complaining.

Once Upon a Time is a show that fell victim to the classic fault of running longer than it really should've. Many fans felt that it could have been easily wrapped up in six seasons, yet it inexplicably ran for one extra season. This only served to disappoint people, especially the fans who felt that they had already gotten proper closure. Instead, Season 7 tried to change things for the worse, including an absurd number of retcons that left things convoluted and messy.

Fans didn't really like how this unwarranted extension lessened any emotional impact that the finale deserved, and also disliked how much it felt like a cheap cash grab with how it tried desperately to milk the show for what it was worth. On the other hand, some fans were more than happy to receive another season and see some of their favorite characters again, so they didn't really mind if the quality wasn't up to par. It's not the single most divisive finale on TV, but it definitely made a lot of people upset. 

Merlin is a show that lasted five seasons, which is exactly the amount it planned to receive, as the showrunners didn't want to overstay their welcome or have the show grow stale. Unfortunately, some felt it did just that anyway in the final episode. The show was generally pretty light-hearted and contained a fair bit of comedy, despite being for more mature audiences, which is why many felt a bit insulted by its bitter ending.

Instead of getting the satisfying conclusion that fans expected, many were faced with a bleak, depressing ending that nobody could have seen coming in a million years. Some fans also felt that the ending was a bit rushed, but others still enjoyed the final episodes for what they were. Yes, the ending is indeed extremely different from the overall tone of the rest of the series, but for the fans who are quite alright with bleaker endings, it wasn't so bad.

The Vampire Diaries initially seemed like a product of its time, a shameless copycat during the Twilight craze. As it happened, though, the show evolved beyond the bounds of what was expected and outlasted the era from which it came. It lasted nearly an entire decade, but tragically suffered towards the end, which is where many felt it took a sharp turn in the wrong direction. It's no secret that the show is primarily a romantasy series, but the finale doesn't always reflect this.

Those who despised the finale felt that it should have done a better job focusing on the romantic aspects of the series rather than grappling with more philosophical aspects. Many characters also exited in ways that fans felt didn't befit them, and some relationships were never fully elaborated upon or given closure. Of course, not everybody hated the ending to this show, but enough did to be noticeable, which is why it is still commonly debated to this day. 

The True Blood finale unleashed a firestorm of controversy amongst the fanbase for numerous different reasons. The vampire romance show is certainly nothing new or groundbreaking, but many fans of the genre did end up liking it very much. Evidently, it lasted for six years. The conclusion, though, really reached a whole new level of divisiveness in the genre, which nobody could have predicted. Some fans felt satisfied and were able to just move on, but this doesn't mean everyone was able to.

One of the main reasons some hated it was due to character inconsistencies that seemed to come out of nowhere, as well as a perceived decline in the quality of the writing. On top of that, one of the major flaws that people pointed out was that the show lost its sense of excitement and passion, almost like the cast and crew were growing bored by it and no longer felt the love they once had. While this wasn't felt by everyone who watched it, the conclusion was a pretty major event in fan circles for how polarizing it was.

Lost was one of the most revolutionary TV shows of all time, as it served as a hybrid of sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery, and was so much more than it initially appeared to be. The show follows a group of survivors after their plane crashes on an uncharted island. Many of these characters are played by some pretty big names, and all get their own moments to shine as the episodes provide flashbacks that delve into their backstories.

Lost sort of fell off the handle towards the end, but its finale was by far the biggest point of contention amongst its dedicated fans. One of the main reasons that many people disliked it was that many of the mysteries at the core of the show were never answered in a concrete way. But not everybody minded this so much, as some felt it was more fun to work out the answers on your own and develop your own personal theories. However controversial this finale was, the complexity of its story still leaves this series highly rewatchable. 

There's no question that the most divisive series finale in all of fantasy has got to belong to Game of Thrones. It might be appalling to those who hate it, but there are actually people who enjoyed the finale for various reasons. One of the most legendary fantasy TV shows in history, Game of Thrones faced significant backlash in its final season from fans, many of whom felt the show's shortest season was rushed, messy, and sometimes nonsensical.

On the other hand, those who liked the finale were just glad the story got any sort of conclusion at all, because author George R. R. Martin certainly doesn't seem intent on finishing the source material any time soon. While those who liked the finale acknowledge that it does have its flaws and isn't as good as the previous seasons, many felt that it's still comparatively pretty good compared to some of the absolute garbage that can be found on TV. Wherever you stand, there is no denying that this show had a very polarizing finale, perhaps the most polarizing in the entire history of television.

Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.

Georgia Republican lawmaker also claims she didn't know Rothschild family, of her ‘space laser' theory, was Jewish

Republican US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene has said she believes in demons, surmising that they might be aliens who fell from heaven, and claims to have been unaware that key figures in the antisemitic space lasers conspiracy she floated were Jewish.

She made those bizarre remarks as a guest on Friday on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher after winning some fans among Democrats who once loathed her – yet had come to appreciate how the far-right Georgia representative had recently broken with Republicans on various issues. Those include healthcare, Gaza, the federal government shutdown that began on 1 October and the handling of documents pertaining to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was friends with Donald Trump before the latter man won two presidencies.

Greene's appearance on Maher's show perhaps made evident the ideological distance between the congresswoman – who has conspicuously avoided directly criticizing Trump himself – and some of her newer, cross-aisle admirers.

Maher on Friday asked another of his on-air guests, film-maker Dan Farah, to discuss his new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, and how it explores the way some senior US military officials apparently theorize earnestly that “demons” may be responsible for what some colloquially refer to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs.

The Real Time host, who is generally considered to be left-leaning, subsequently asked those on the show: “Do you think demons and the devil are real?”

Greene, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, confidently answered: “Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. And I believe those could be fallen angels.”

As Maher replied: “Fallen angels? The aliens are fallen angels?” Greene continued: “That's possible – I think that's what they could be. That's what makes sense in my worldview.”

The Fifth Column podcast host Michael Moynihan was also participating in the discussion, and Maher called on him to say whether he agreed with Greene. “No,” Moynihan said. “I'm sorry.”

At another point in the show, Maher invited Greene to revisit her infamous 2018 social media screed positing that wildfires that had devastated California were ignited by a laser beam from space under the control of the Rothschild banking dynasty.

The progressive watchdog Media Matters uncovered that post weeks into Greene's first congressional term. And her colleagues at the time voted to remove her from her House committee assignments, with the Rothschild family having repeatedly been subjected to antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Greene on Friday declared to Maher that she initially “didn't even know the Rothschilds were Jewish”.

“Before politics … I [did] not know much of any of this stuff,” Greene said. “I never even said the word ‘Jewish' in the … post.”

Maher pointed out that “‘Rothschild', to a lot of people, is almost synonymous with the word ‘Jewish'”.

Greene replied: “I had no idea … Now I know it's Jewish.”

Amid laughter and applause, Maher retorted: “Right. Well, now we know … That's what I'm here for – to make sure that people in Congress know what the fuck you're talking about.”

“Close Encounters of the Third Kind” is considered a landmark science-fiction film that fueled greater curiosities about the wonders and mysteries of extraterrestrial life. 

Now more than 48 years since its release, the movie is sparking a question that doesn't have an answer. The latest mystery doesn't involve aliens, flashing lights or UFOs, but the fate of an old farmhouse where the movie's alien abduction scene of a 3-year-old boy took place.

“I think people are interested to know what is going on,” said Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell, unaware of the reasons for the issue.

The developer has until November 21 to provide some information. The house, located in the middle of an evolving new 13-lot subdivision, was authorized to be moved by the council nearly a year ago. That has not occurred yet.

Hunter Simmons, the City of Fairhope's Planning Director, said the developers have one year since the council's approval to secure a building permit in order to commence the project. If not, the project's developer can request an extension from the council to have the house relocated at a future date.

“Other than those timelines, there are no other requirements to update the city,” Simmons said.

He said there has been communication between the development team and the city. The developers include Jade Consultants and the appropriately named Encounters Development. Neither returned a call for comment.

Tim Herrington, a Realtor who is also working on the project, emailed AL.com to say there is “no update at this time.”

Simmons said there have been communications between the development team and the city about moving the farmhouse. However, no permit applications have been submitted to the city to do so.

“I have not had anyone voice disappointment that it hasn't been done,” said Erik Cortinas, the city's building official. “Any calls I have received were mainly just curiosity, and people wanting to verify the developer's intention is still to preserve and relocate the structure.”

Simmons said he is hopeful that the development team is performing “due diligence to ensure the preservation and move is successful.”

He added, “We do not want to rush such an endeavor.”

Projects are ongoing at and near the farmhouse. A new Sherwin Williams paint shop is under construction to the immediate south of the farmhouse. That project was approved by the council last October.

In addition, a new office building with an orthodontics practice is under construction near Route 118 and 104. The plans for that project were approved on April 14.

The farmhouse's fate drew attention on social media, where fans of the movie gathered to discuss the need to preserve it. Fairhope city officials got in on the act as well during its Nov. 21, 2024, meeting by posting an alien face marker on a map to show where the house was eventually relocating.

The developers had plans to utilize the house for office space, with access to Route 104. 

However, city officials including Mayor Sherry Sullivan said they were hopeful the development team would create a historic marker or additional wayfinding information connecting the house to a movie considered among the best directed by iconic Hollywood director Stephen Spielberg.

'Close Encounters' house

“There is a history of the arts that people don't necessarily associate with Alabama,” said Max Romanowski, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of South Alabama. “But to have something like this here is something that is very special. The preservation of stuff like this is culturally and historically valuable.”

The potential also exists for an unexpected tourism boom connected to the public's fascination with aliens. In nearby Pascagoula, for instance, the city celebrates a wild story about a local alien abduction during the annual Goula Palooza, held downtown in early October.

Roswell, New Mexico, has been transformed from a small rural town to a tourism mecca for alien enthusiasts and curiosity seekers.

The Fairhope farmhouse does not have an actual connection to alien activity, only the Hollywood kind. 

In the movie, the farmhouse is portrayed as being in Muncie, Ind., and involved the alien abduction of a 3-year-old boy portrayed by child actor Cary Guffey. 

The movie was also filmed in other Alabama cities in 1976, including Bay Minette and Mobile. The movie starred actor Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role of Roy Neary as well as the late actresses Melinda Dillon and Teri Garr.

At the time of the movie's filming, Baldwin County had a population of around 106,000 residents. Since then, the county has more than doubled in size to a population of over 231,000 people.

The farmhouse itself was surrounded by nothing but rural landscape. In recent years, Route 181 has seen extra traffic lanes added. A new Publix grocery store was built almost directly across the interstate from the farmhouse. A Wawa convenience store is a short walk from the house.

Simmons said last year that he was uncertain how the house would be relocated. At the time, he said the city had become inundated with calls and emails from the movie's dedicated fanbase.

The lack of activity has caught some city officials by surprise and uncertainty on the next steps.

“Everything is in the same place,” said Fairhope City Councilman Jimmy Conyers. “I know it's expensive (to move it) but I don't know what happens.”

Boo.

Darkstone Digital, the developer behind the viral hit The Mortuary Assistant, has unveiled its next game: Paranormal Activity: Threshold.

With warnings for language, violence, murder, suicide, and "references to the occult", the horror game lets you play across multiple timelines, hunt and communicate with entities, "perform demonic rituals to alter your fate", and offers multiple endings that "expand the story".

No release date has been revealed as yet, but Steam lists it as "coming soon". You can check out its announcement teaser below:

"Daniel and Jessica Stewart have decided to remodel their first home," the description teases. "Old and dilapidated, they begin to record the adventures of their renovation, but the couple soon discovers their new home hides much more than asbestos and faulty wiring.

"As they dig deeper into the mysterious house, their excitement turns to concern when they uncover strange markings and items hidden within the walls. The more time they spend there, the clearer it becomes that they are not the home's only occupant. Sinking deeper into the influences of a dark presence, Daniel and Jessica are unprepared for the horrifying events that follow."

The Mortuary Assistant is, of course, one of the biggest horror games of the last few years, weaving an unusual story around an unusual job in which a mortuary assistant has to grapple with both the dead and the living dead. It was so successful, in fact, that earlier this year, we learned that production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role.

Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant. Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire actor Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film.

She's made a name for herself as psychic to the stars having worked with the likes of George Michael, Michelle Keegan and Princess Diana. 

Yet Sally Morgan revealed she had the tricky task of telling one Hollywood star the upsetting news that her marriage was about to come to an end. 

Sally, 74, worked with Uma Thurman in the Noughties and told Daily Mail: 'As soon as she walked in I thought "Oh my God, she's about to get rid of her husband. How am I going to tell her this?"

'I told her and she wasn't happy. She didn't like it and I knew I'd never see her again because she didn't like what I said. Then six months later they'd split up.'

Uma, 55, was married to fellow Hollywood heavyweight Ethan Hawke at the time.  

The pair wed in 1998 after meeting on set of the sci-film Gattaca in 1996 and went onto welcome two children together before their marriage fell apart in 2003.

At the time of their split, Ethan, 54, who shares children Maya, 27, and Levon, 23, with Uma was rumoured to have been unfaithful.  

He had been accused of cheating on Uma with their children's nanny Ryan Shawhughes.

The Training Day actor denied the affair but he did begin publicly dating Ryan after he and Uma finalized their divorce in 2005.

Ethan and Ryan went on to marry in 2008 and they are the parents of two daughters: Clementine, 17, and Indiana, 14.

Daily Mail has contacted Uma's representatives for comment.  

Elsewhere in the chat, Psychic Sally revealed her favourite celebrities she's worked with, naming 'sweet' Christine McGuinness, 'funny' Thomas Skinner and 'wonderful' influencer Char Bailey. 

She also explained that she feels a sense of responsibility when it comes to passing on what she sees. 

'When I was a teenager if I saw something around someone that I didn't like, I would "self-edit" so it wouldn't be accurate and they'd go, well that never came true,' she shared. 'So very quickly I learned that you can't self-edit'.

She added: 'But there have been occasions when I've been reading for somebody and I think this person is going to have an accident or be attacked and I'll say, "you should avoid  this or that".

'But that's all you can say. So not to spook them out, but it gives them a bit of a heads up.'

While Sally has millions of fans there are also many out there who have accused her of being a fraud.  

Yet she pays no attention to critics, as she explained: 'I don't say it's a belief system because I think whether you believe I happen to believe in a God or not, if you don't follow any religion, any denomination, you can still have spirit around you.

'You don't have to believe, it's about trusting.'

Sally also revealed what she believes happens after death, explaining that she considers there to be the earth we're on and then divinity - a divine energy. 

She mused: 'There can be really good, lovely people, but we don't all get to there [divinity]. Some people sort of float between.

'I think that when we die we go to another dimension which is heaven.'

Sally sadly lost her husband John in September 2021 following a short battle with coronavirus and she said it brings her comfort to imagine where his spirit is now. 

'I see it like he's gone to a room which has got everything in there he wanted - his garden, his football and all of that, but he can't get out and I can't get in. 

'But one day, when I die, the door's just going open and I'll get in there with him.

'So I think heaven is full of love and I think that this is hard for us to take on board because we grieve so much.

'We say, "I know my John would want to be down here with his grandchildren," but he's OK where he is because we are all meant to go there. 

'This down here on earth is only not even half of our journey, our spiritual journey.'
