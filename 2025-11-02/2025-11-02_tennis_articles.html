                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner clawed closer to Carlos Alcaraz in their Big Titles battle on Sunday when he won the Rolex Paris Masters title. He now owns 10 Big Titles — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals. Sinner now trails Alcaraz by just four Big titles. The Spaniard has earned five such trophies in 2025 — three Masters 1000 titles and two major triumphs — to three for the Italian. The 24-year-old has emerged victorious at two majors and one Masters 1000 event. The San Candido native has claimed Masters 1000 glory at least once in three consecutive seasons. It is also the second straight year he has earned at least three Big Titles, after winning six in 2024. Only Novak Djokovic (40), Alcaraz (8), Alexander Zverev (7) and Daniil Medvedev (6) own more of the prestigious trophies. Only Djokovic (3.3), Rafael Nadal (3.5), Alcaraz (3.9), Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) have won the events at a higher rate. There is one more Big Title up for grabs this season, with Sinner and Alcaraz set to headline the field at the Nitto ATP Finals from 9-16 November.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch almost any top-level tennis player hit a forehand, and you'll notice something subtle but consistent—their off-hand isn't just hanging around. It's active, engaged and perfectly synchronized with the hitting arm. This creates structure and stored energy to release into the shot. 1 has his own distinctive spin on the technique. Where most players let go of the racquet's throat when the off-arm is just about parallel to the net, Alcaraz hangs on until his left hand is even with his hitting shoulder. This benefits his forehand in a few significant ways: Alcaraz keeps his off-hand on the racquet longer to create more upper body coil© 2025 Getty Images Alcaraz's shoulders turn more, but he keeps a nice bend in the hitting elbow and the racquet head even with his chest, just like players with more modest rotation. He uncoils with a loose arm to generate immense racquet head speed without an overly exaggerated swing path.Yes, Alcaraz is something of a unicorn—not everyone can duplicate his range of motion, upper body flexibility or otherworldly timing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You'd be forgiven for forgetting -- it's been six years -- but Timea Babos still holds three titles, and with Luisa Stefani by her side, she's not done collecting hardware. This week the question was posed to a number of people in and around the game -- and many came up empty. But, after losing in the WTA Finals twice in the past three years, she has only a single title, with Barbora Krejcikova three years ago in Guadalajara. Other prominent vote-getters: Iga Swiatek (2023) and last year's singles winner, Coco Gauff, are proud owners of one title at the year-end championships. This is Elise Mertens' seventh trip to the WTA Finals (with her fifth doubles partner), but she, too, has only one title, captured three years ago in Fort Worth with Veronika Kudermetova. Indeed, Hungary's Timea Babos won three straight titles from 2017-19, twice with Kristina Mladenovic and once with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova. Going back to 2015, she qualified five consecutive times. “Of course I knew that,” Babos said. After an absence of six years, at the age of 32, she's back at the year-end championships. “Doubles is about partnerships,” Babos said, “and I needed a very good partner. But I needed Luisa to be here again.” 7-seeded team has a challenging opening match scheduled against No. The origin story for Babos and Stefani, like so many others in doubles, has a distinctly random vibe. “I had a tough end of the 2024 season [knee surgery], so I was looking to get more matches and get my rhythm back. I went to play Linz [Austria] with Ingrid [Martins], a good friend of mine, also from Brazil, but the cut was so high, we didn't get in. “I saw Timmy was on the list as well, playing with a singles player [Lulu Sun], so I called her. I was like, `Hey, Timmy, this is Luisa. Like I'm here, the cut is really strong. Do you want to play together so we can both get in?' Babos was at home in Hungary, about a two-hour drive from Linz. When they entered the WTA 500 tournament, Babos was ranked No. Babos moved up 36 spots in the rankings, and a partnership was born. They went on to win three more titles, at the WTA 500 Strasbourg and Tokyo as well as Sao Paulo, where Stefani was born. They reached the final in Ningbo, locking down their berths in Riyadh, and the Tokyo win punctuated their regular season. “It was very tough but fun and good at the same time.” Added Stefani, “I like her competitive spirit, her passion -- the way she brings it on the court and backs herself up. “… Basically,” Babos interjected, “I'm nuts a bit.” The last one was handed to her by Martina Navratilova, whose name -- thanks to a record 13 WTA Finals doubles titles -- is on the trophy. Honesty, both players insisted, was the key to their burgeoning relationship. “In the beginning, when we didn't know each other you're trying to be too nice, go around certain things,” Babos said. She stays on the forehand side, which obviously I need. Her skills on the net are very unique. You'd be forgiven for forgetting -- it's been six years -- but Timea Babos still holds three titles, and with Luisa Stefani by her side, she's not done collecting hardware.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blinkova has been addressing the Chinese crowd in their native language all week -- and after defeating 17-year-old wild card Lilli Tagger 6-3, 6-3 in the final, she adeptly handled her own translation duties in both the trophy ceremony and her post-match press conference. Switching between English and Mandarin with ease, she required only a few pointers from the tournament's translator. As the Asian swing began in September, she told Bounces that she hoped to get the opportunity to give a interview in Mandarin, a language she has been learning since 2018 and which she felt was now up to the task of her media duties. Blinkova's results didn't initially pan out, though. 95 came through the draw without losing a set. Blinkova needed all of her self-belief to hold off Tagger, the teenage sensation who has made a spectacular WTA main-draw debut this week. The Austrian has wowed fans with her tennis in Jiujiang, not least a single-handed backhand reminiscent of the great Justine Henin. That shot was on full display early on, as Tagger unleashed a series of gorgeous down-the-line winners from that wing. After an opening stretch of four consecutive breaks, Tagger seemed to gain the upper hand after battling through eight deuces, saving four break points, to seal the first hold of the match for a 3-2 lead. But instead, it was Blinkova who elevated her level after that marathon tussle, responding with a run of five straight games to lead 1-0 in the second set. Her own backhand was also proving efficient -- and she was increasingly able to steer traffic away from the Tagger signature shot. "So I played a bit more to her forehand in the important moments. I also put a lot of pressure with my return -- I was just a bit more aggressive and solid at the same time. "I think she's a really great player for her age. 3 seeds Quinn Gleason and Elena Pridankina lifted the doubles trophy after edging Ekaterina Ovcharenko and Emily Webley-Smith 6-4, 2-6, [10-6] in the final. It was a second career WTA doubles title for Gleason (following Merida 2024 alongside Ingrid Martins), and a first for Pridankina. Ovcharenko and Webley-Smith were both contesting a WTA final for the first time -- a particularly remarkable breakthrough for 41-year-old Webley-Smith. The Briton played her first professional match in 1999 and has won 27 ITF doubles titles. She reached her singles career high of No. This week, Webley-Smith delivered a career-best tournament that's been 26 years in the making.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner is into the first Rolex Paris Masters final of his career after a ruthless 6-0, 6-1 semifinal victory over Alexander Zverev.Zverev was coming off a grueling 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5) quarterfinal victory over Daniil Medvedev, which finished late on Friday night.But Sinner needed just 62 minutes to end the German's run at the final four stage, and is now through to his ninth ATP final of the year (going 4-4 in the first eight) as well as the ninth Masters 1000 final of his career (also going 4-4 in the first eight).Additionally, Sinner is now one win away from returning to No. 1, all consecutively, between June 10th, 2024 and September 7th, 2025, when Alcaraz took it back from him after winning this year's US Open.

Six days ago, Sinner and Zverev met in the Vienna final, with Sinner surviving, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, after two hours and 28 minutes.But their Paris clash couldn't have been any different, as Zverev only managed to win one game, holding in the first game of the second set—and Sinner had a break point in that game, too.At the end of the day the Italian was just too sharp, finishing the match with almost twice as many winners as unforced errors, 23 to 12, which includes more than three times as many winners as unforced errors off of his forehand side, 13 to 4.Zverev, meanwhile, had 6 winners and 20 unforced errors. "Obviously I'm happy to be in the final but it's not how you want to arrive," Sinner said in his on-court interview. "Playing against Sascha is always a very special occasion, playing in a packed stadium, but today he was clearly not 100%. He had a tight schedule the past months.
