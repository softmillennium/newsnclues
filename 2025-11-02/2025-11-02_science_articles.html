                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Astronomers have produced the first three-dimensional map of a planet outside our solar system, revealing distinct temperature regions, including one so hot that water vapor breaks apart. Led by researchers at the University of Maryland and Cornell University, the study charts temperatures across WASP-18b, a massive gas giant classified as an "ultra-hot Jupiter" located 400 light-years from Earth. The team applied a method known as 3D eclipse mapping, also called spectroscopic eclipse mapping, marking the first time this technique has been used to build a full 3D temperature map. "This technique is really the only one that can probe all three dimensions at once: latitude, longitude and altitude," said the paper's co-lead author Megan Weiner Mansfield, an assistant professor of astronomy at UMD. "This gives us a higher level of detail than we've ever had to study these celestial bodies." With this approach, scientists can begin charting atmospheric differences across many exoplanets observable by JWST, much as ground-based telescopes once documented Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its banded clouds. "Eclipse mapping allows us to image exoplanets that we can't see directly, because their host stars are too bright," said the paper's co-lead author Ryan Challener, a postdoctoral associate in Cornell University's Department of Astronomy. Eclipse mapping measures tiny variations in that light as the planet moves behind its star, alternately hiding and revealing different regions. By tying these small brightness changes to specific locations on the planet and analyzing them in multiple colors, scientists can reconstruct temperatures across latitude, longitude, and altitude. WASP-18b is well suited for this test because it has about the mass of 10 Jupiters, completes an orbit in only 23 hours, and reaches temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Those properties provide a comparatively strong signal for the new mapping method. The team's earlier 2D map used a single color of light. Combining these layers yields a detailed three-dimensional temperature structure. A circular hot spot sits where the star's light strikes most directly, and winds appear too weak to spread that heat efficiently. That had been predicted by theory, but it's really exciting to actually see this with real observations." Additional JWST observations could sharpen the spatial detail in future 3D eclipse maps. "It's very exciting to finally have the tools to see and map out the temperatures of a different planet in this much detail. It's set us up to possibly use the technique on other types of exoplanets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among them, protists -- tiny, single-celled organisms -- are especially remarkable for their evolutionary significance. For many years, scientists could study them only through genetic data because existing imaging techniques were unable to reveal their complex internal structures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMBL Group Leader Gautam Dey received a Zoom call from collaborator Omaya Dudin, then leading a research group at EPFL. Dudin had just succeeded in adapting a new imaging method to visualize the inner organization of Ichthyosporea (a marine protist closely related to animals and fungi). This breakthrough overcame a long-standing obstacle: the species' tough cell walls. The technique, known as expansion microscopy, was originally developed at MIT and later refined into ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) by Paul Guichard and Virginie Hamel at the University of Geneva. Motivated by this success, Dudin, Dey, Guichard, and Hamel began a long-term collaboration. The EMBL-led Traversing European Coastlines (TREC) expedition offered an ideal opportunity to explore these marine organisms further. Recently published in Cell, the team's findings provide detailed insight into the cellular structures of more than 200 plankton species, especially eukaryotes (organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus). This research marks the beginning of PlanExM, a TREC project designed to map the hidden structural diversity of plankton using expansion microscopy. Expecting only a few dozen samples, the team asked manager Ian Probert for material to test their technique. "We spent three days and nights just fixing those samples. This was a treasure trove we could not let go of," said co-first author Felix Mikus, who completed his PhD in the Dey Group and is now a postdoc in Dudin's laboratory at the University of Geneva. Expansion microscopy, which marks its 10th anniversary this year, physically enlarges biological samples. Remarkably, the cell's internal structures remain intact and stretch proportionally, allowing researchers to enlarge the specimen up to 16 times without using high-powered lenses. "U-ExM is transforming how we explore protist ultrastructure," said co-first author Armando Rubio Ramos, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Geneva. "By combining this technique with high-throughput imaging and comparative analyses, we can begin to decode how cellular architecture has diversified across evolution. "Our adventures with expansion microscopy are only beginning," said Dey. With Thomas Richards from Oxford University joining the collaboration, Dey and Dudin secured a CHF 2 million Moore Foundation Grant to continue expanding their research. "The next step is to selectively look deeper into certain species within this broad collection to answer specific questions, such as understanding how mitosis and multicellularity evolved and the phenotypic diversity that underlie major evolutionary transitions," Dudin said.
