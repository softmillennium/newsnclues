            Five German climbers have died after being caught in an avalanche in the Italian Alps, local authorities said on Sunday.
    


            The climbers had set out on Saturday to scale Cima Vertana in the Ortler mountain range near the village of Solda. The avalanche struck as they headed for the summit.
    


            The cascade of snow and ice swept away members of two separate rope teams. The bodies of two men and a woman were recovered on Saturday while the two other victims, a father and his 17-year-old daughter, were found on Sunday.
    


            Two other climbers escaped unharmed.
    


            The Ortler massif, part of the Italian Alps close to the Swiss border, is a popular destination for experienced hikers and climbers.

            A fire at a general store in northern Mexico has killed at least 23 people, the state governor said Saturday.
    


            The blaze happened at an outlet of the Waldo's chain in the city of Hermosillo, capital of Sonora state, Governor Alfonso Durazo said in an online video address.
    


            “So far, there are reports of 23 people dead and 11 injured who are being treated at different hospitals in the city. Unfortunately, among the victims are minors,” he said. The tragedy “has left a deep sadness among all the people of Sonora,” he added.
    


            Twelve women, five men, four boys, and two girls were among those killed, reported local radio station Uniradio Sonora, citing Carlos Freaner, president of the Mexican Red Cross.
    


            CNN has contacted both the city and state governments for comment.
    


            Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her “heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who died in the fire.”
    


            “I instructed the Secretary of the Interior, Rosa Icela Rodríguez, to send a support team to assist the families and the injured,” she said.
    


            The Sonora Public Security Secretariat said on X that the fire was not caused by an arson attack or other intentional act of violence, without giving more details about the cause.

Iran will not stop uranium enrichment, regardless of the pressure from the US and its allies, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said.

Araghchi told Al Jazeera on Saturday that the US and Israeli airstrikes in June failed to knock out the enrichment program, which Iran maintains is entirely civilian in nature. While some “nuclear materials remain buried under the rubble,” the technology “remains intact,” he said.

“We cannot stop uranium enrichment, and what is not achieved by war cannot be achieved through political means.” 

He added that Iran remains open to reaching a deal with the US through indirect negotiations, but only if Washington stops setting what he described as “impossible and unacceptable preconditions.”

Araghchi also said Iran's missile program is not up for discussion. “It would be foolish if one hands over their weapons.” 

The Omani-mediated US-Iran negotiations were suspended after Israel began its 12-day bombing campaign earlier this year.

Last month, the EU and UK reimposed sanctions on Iran which had been lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which the US withdrew from during President Donald Trump's first term in office. Tehran has since said it is no longer bound by the 2015 agreement, which expired in October.

US President Donald Trump has said his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, earlier this week will pave the way for lasting peace between the nations. 

The two leaders met for the first time in six years Thursday on the sidelines of the APEC summit in Busan, South Korea. Beijing said they reached a consensus to resolve “major trade issues.”

China agreed to suspend its latest rare-earth export controls in exchange for reciprocal US tariff cuts. The agreement also includes a US pledge to reduce tariffs on Chinese imports and suspend investigations into Beijing's maritime and logistics sectors.

“My G2 meeting with President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. “This meeting will lead to everlasting peace and success. God bless both China and the USA!”

Bilateral relations have been strained by years of trade tensions that began when Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term. Under the new deal, the US will lower tariffs on Chinese products from 57% to 47% and suspend export restrictions targeting some Chinese companies. The US will also reduce fentanyl-related tariffs, while China adjusts its retaliatory measures.

Beijing said it will lift its rare-earth export restrictions for one year while it studies long-term plans. The materials used in electronics and military technology were targeted after the US tightened its own controls on exports of advanced semiconductors and chipmaking equipment. 

China also agreed to resume purchases of US soybeans and other agricultural products, which were paused during the recent trade standoff, while most other trade restrictions remain in place.

US President Donald Trump has ordered the Department of War to prepare for possible military action in Nigeria, accusing the West African nation of allowing the killing of Christians by Islamist militants.

Nigeria, a country split between a Muslim-majority north and a largely Christian south, has long been plagued by violence from groups such as Boko Haram, which is responsible for massacres, kidnappings, and bombings nationwide. The attacks, which have killed tens of thousands and displaced over two million since around 2009, target both Christians and Muslims. Though often seen as sectarian, analysts cite land disputes, resource competition, and ethnic tensions as key drivers of the violence.

In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump accused Abuja of failing to protect Christians and warned the US “may very well go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists.”

“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,” Trump wrote. “If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our cherished Christians!” He offered no evidence of the alleged targeting of Christians but warned that “the Nigerian government better move fast” in confronting the insurgency. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth replied to Trump's order on X, saying that his department “is preparing for action.”

Yes sir.The killing of innocent Christians in Nigeria — and anywhere — must end immediately. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities. pic.twitter.com/C0v9RHGoS1

Trump's threat followed a claim on Friday of “mass slaughter” of Christians in Nigeria and his designation of it as a “Country of Particular Concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act, which is applied to states accused of systematic violations of religious freedom.

In a post after Trump announced the designation but before floating the prospect of military action, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu rejected the accusations against Abuja and defended its efforts to protect religious freedom as “a core tenet” of the nation. Tinubu's press secretary, Bayo Onanuga, also called US claims of targeted attacks “a gross exaggeration,” saying “Christians, Muslims, churches and mosques are attacked randomly” and urging Washington to provide military support to fight extremists rather than label Nigeria a nation of particular concern.

Later on Saturday, Onanuga called Trump's threats an “orchestrated game” and said Abuja was “well ahead” of it, noting that Tinubu had met new army chiefs earlier this week, ordering them to immediately “smash” Islamist insurgents with “patriotic zeal.”

President Bola Tinubu was well ahead of the orchestrated game unfolding in America as he told the new service chiefs on Thursday what Nigerians expect of them. No more excuses, he said. Nigerians want results. Here is the excerpt of his speech: “Security threats are constantly… pic.twitter.com/JlJsXJZQwk

Presidential Adviser Daniel Bwala later announced that Trump and Tinubu would meet to discuss US allegations of attacks on Christians, insisting that both leaders “share interest in the fight against insurgency and all forms of terrorism.” Any disagreement over “whether terrorists in Nigeria target only Christians or in fact all faiths and no faiths,” he added, would be addressed “when they meet in the coming days.”

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. The plan proposed by US President Donald Trump for resolving the conflict in the Gaza Strip is currently functioning as intended, Palestinian Ambassador to Russia Abdel Hafiz Nofal told TASS.

""So far, Trump's plan is proceeding normally,"" the diplomat noted.

The ambassador stressed the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. ""There have been violations by Israel, we are aware of that. But the worst outcome would be if the war resumes,"" he said, stressing that the first stage must proceed properly and that the second stage will be the most difficult due to the involvement of international organizations, as well as issues related to the disarmament of Hamas.

In the context of the settlement process, the diplomat also highlighted the importance of three key principles: ""ending the war, releasing the hostages, and ensuring that the Israeli army withdraws from Gaza.""

On October 9, Israel and Hamas, with the mediation of Egypt, Qatar, the United States, and Turkey, agreed to implement the first stage of the peace plan presented by US President Donald Trump.

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. Russia is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela in connection with US military pressure, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.

""We are closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela,"" he said, commenting on The Washington Post report saying that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had sent a request to Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the supply of missiles, radars, and aircraft against the backdrop of US threats to his country.

Earlier, the Miami Herald reported the US administration had decided to attack military targets in Venezuela. According to the newspaper, these strikes could be carried out in the coming days or even hours. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump denied in a conversation with reporters that he was considering strikes on Venezuela or had made a decision on the matter.

According to The New York Times, Trump ordered an end to all attempts to reach a diplomatic settlement with Venezuela on October 7. He also authorized the CIA to begin subversive operations in Venezuela. On October 15, Trump publicly acknowledged that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela. However, he refused to answer whether he authorized the CIA to attempt to assassinate Maduro. The Venezuelan leader has repeatedly stated that his country is facing the most serious threat of invasion by the US in the last 100 years. Washington accuses the Venezuelan authorities of not doing enough to combat drug smuggling. Under this pretext, the US has deployed large forces to the Caribbean region.

On October 21, the Russian State Duma ratified the strategic partnership and cooperation treaty between Russia and Venezuela. According to Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, this ratification is very important given the unprecedented forceful pressure, including direct military pressure, that the US is exerting on Venezuela.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Patel reportedly became furious after revelation he flew to visit girlfriend and agency fired official who oversees fleet

A top FBI official with 27 years standing has reportedly been fired by the bureau after its director, Kash Patel, became enraged by press stories revealing he had used a government jet to travel to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a wrestling match.

Steven Palmer, who had worked at the bureau since 1998, was fired as head of the FBI's critical incident response group which is responsible for handling major security threats as well as overseeing the agency's fleet of jets. He was the third head of the unit to be dismissed since Patel became the second Trump administration's FBI director in February.

Bloomberg Law, which broke the story, said that three unnamed sources had expressed astonishment at the sacking given that Patel's flight schedules were fully public and trackable on websites. A day after her performance, Patel himself had reposted photos showing him together with his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, on his X account.

According to Bloomberg, Patel had become furious over stories published after the event about his use of the FBI jet to go on the date with Wilkins. Soon after, Palmer had been told he could resign instantly or be fired.

The dismissal was made official on Friday.

Flight logs publicly trackable on Flight Aware for Patel's plane, N708JH, show that the jet landed at an airport near Penn State on 25 October. That evening Wilkins performed at a Real American Freestyle wrestling event, and the flight logs show Patel's FBI plane later flying to Nashville.

Records for the movements of the jet N708JH were blocked on Flight Aware as of Sunday. A search for the government jet generates a message saying that it is “not available for public tracking per request from the owner/operator”.

Patel himself has not responded to Bloomberg's report on the dismissal of Palmer. But earlier his spokesman, Ben Williamson, did post a lengthy statement on X in which he called criticism of Patel's jet travel “disingenuous and dumb” and “bad faith whining”.

Williamson pointed out that the director is required under government rules to pay some reimbursement for the travel and claimed Patel had “significantly limited” personal travel compared with his predecessors Chris Wray and James Comey. “He's allowed to take personal time on occasion to see family, friends or his longtime girlfriend,” the spokesman said.

As the Daily Beast has noted, Patel was highly critical of Wray's use of government jets for personal use when Wray was director of the bureau. In 2023, Patel scathingly dubbed Wray “#GovernmentGangster” and accused him of “jetting off on out (sic) tax payer dollars while dodging accountability for the implosion of the FBI on his watch”.

Palmer's dismissal makes him the third head of the FBI critical incident response group to be ditched under Patel. Wes Wheeler was fired in March, and Brian Driscoll in August.

Driscoll is now suing the Trump administration for unfair dismissal claiming he was targeted for showing lack of loyalty to the president.

Patel's travel on a government jet for a date night was first spotted by Kyle Seraphin, a former FBI agent who has become a thorn in the side of the Trump administration. His podcast is caustically critical of the current leadership of the FBI.

“We're in the middle of government shutdown … and this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?” Seraphin said in a recent podcast.

The government shutdown to which Seraphin alluded had entered its 32nd day.

In a separate unflattering development for him, Patel is facing heat from a defense lawyer in Michigan who is objecting to the FBI director's allegations Friday that five young men had been arrested as they planned a Halloween terror attack. The lawyer, Amir Makled, who represents one of the five individuals, said that having reviewed the case he was convinced no such terror event had been in the pipeline.

Makled told Associated Press that the FBI director's claims were “hysteria and fearmongering”. The five men were aged 16 to 20 – and were US citizens and gamers.

“I don't believe that there's anything illegal about any of the activity they were doing,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The US high court will hear arguments on whether Trump's erratic imposition of global tariffs is legally valid

Donald Trump thrives on emergencies. He cried havoc on the very first day of his second term, declaring a national emergency caused by an “invasion” of “illegal aliens” from Mexico. He has since invoked emergencies more than any president since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976.

Next Wednesday, he faces another of his own making, as the US supreme court hears oral arguments on whether his globe-shaking signature economic policy – tariffs – is legally valid.

Trump sees emergency everywhere. From the flow of illegal drugs and precursors from Mexico, China and, somehow, Canada; the international criminal court's investigation of US and Israeli officials; the US's “insufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation”; the Brazilian government's tussle with social platform X and its prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro; crime in Washington DC; and the US's longstanding trade deficits.

The emergencies have served Trump to secure funding to build a border wall and give him the military responsibility for border enforcement, to allow oil drilling on federal land and keep unprofitable coal plants operating, to deploy the national guard in Washington DC. And, of course, to impose tariffs.

Now, the supreme court is scheduled to hear about some of these, in a case brought by a dozen states challenging Trump's contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from Trump's fanciful list of supposed threats to the nation.

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to levy a tariff – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power. But the court should not lose sight of the broader threat to the nation's constitutional democracy: Trump's abuse of the notion of a national emergency to grant himself absolute power to govern unconstrained by anybody.

IEEPA gives the president authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Yet as the plaintiffs noted, using this “to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the US he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the president has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy”. Rather than solving national emergencies, Trump is using emergency powers to manufacture one.

Consider the trade deficit, which occupies an unusually dark place in Trump's imagination – not the result of voluntary, mutually beneficial exchanges between US and foreign businesses and consumers, but the consequence of a twisted world order in which devious foreign countries take advantage of the US.

Whatever it may be, it is neither extraordinary nor unusual. The US began running consistent trade deficits half a century ago, in 1975, bolstered by the US's low savings and the government's large budget deficits, which require pulling capital from abroad and hence boosting demand for foreign goods and services.

Unauthorized immigration, which has been growing for quite some time, also fails to meet the “extraordinary” and “unusual” bars, fueled by US employers' longstanding demand for foreign workers. And even if it did, a tariff on Mexican goods would do next to nothing to solve the problem. Hurting the Mexican economy is more likely to encourage Mexicans to seek jobs north of the border.

It is beyond me how a Canadian TV ad featuring clips of Ronald Reagan warning about the high cost of tariffs and extolling the virtues of free trade amounts to an emergency that justifies the added 10% tariff with which Trump retaliated against Ottawa last Monday. (The White House has not specified what authority the US is using to impose these tariffs.) For that matter, tariffs on legally imported goods from Mexico or Canada cannot possibly end the “emergency” created by drug cartels' illegal drug shipments to the US. Nor can they curb Americans' fentanyl addiction.

Trump's capricious deployment of tariffs is provoking a new set of problems. Inflation has remained relatively subdued – largely because importers anticipated tariffs and stocked up on imports beforehand – but prices on intermediate inputs and consumer goods are starting to rise, denting the competitiveness of American exporters. And most economists expect the inflation shock to hit soon.

Most critically, Trump's trade war is getting hot.

The financial upheaval caused by the worldwide volley of tariffs he unleashed on “Liberation Day” in April calmed down in subsequent months. And yet the world economy remains close to the edge: earlier this month Beijing signaled it was ready to pull the nuclear option in its confrontation with Washington, imposing stringent export controls on rare earths and other minerals over which it holds a near supply monopoly and which are indispensable for defense industries and the entire modern economy.

In a meeting on Thursday at the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, presidents Xi Jinping and Trump agreed to a one-year truce in which China would suspend the latest rare earth export controls and the US would relax its limits on technology exports to Chinese companies, among other concessions. But the odds are shortening that the trade war launched by Trump with no congressional input will go terribly wrong for the US economy and national security. The supreme court might take note.

The trade war is unlikely to be over even if the court bars Trump from using IEEPA. There are other statutes he can rely on. Section 201 of the Trade Act allows the president to impose tariffs or other restrictions if imports are causing or threatening “serious injury” to a domestic industry. Section 301 also allows the president to impose duties to respond to unfair trade practices by another country.

The statutes, however, come with limits. Before retaliating under 301, for instance, the US trade representative must perform an investigation, consult with the country in question and publish its proposed action and the factual findings on which it is based. If not stop the trade war, these constraints could slow it down.

Critically, by putting some limit on Trump's wanton belligerence, the supreme court could, for once, send the message that crying wolf – or “national emergency!” – does not offer blanket cover for the president to run roughshod over the checks and balances essential to liberal democracy.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The gene-edited animals remained healthy when exposed to classical swine fever (CSF), a highly contagious and often fatal disease. The virus was eradicated in the UK in 1966, but there have been several outbreaks since and it continues to pose a major threat to pig farming worldwide.
“Classical swine fever is a devastating disease for livestock and farmers as we saw with the outbreak in the UK, 25 years ago,” said Helen Crooke, mammalian virology deputy leader at the Animal and Plant Health Agency

Their primary purpose is to improve traffic flow and minimize the likelihood of high-speed collisions, particularly dangerous T-bone and head-on crashes.
  Roundabouts have existed and been implemented for over a century. In the 1960s, the modern roundabout emerged in the UK, with added rules for yielding. Unlike intersections with red lights, roundabouts allow vehicles to continue moving at a

B:  Yup, Jin's novels are so fascinating, especially the trilogy: “Legends of the Condor Heroes,” “Return of the Condor Heroes,” and “Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber.”

B:  Wasn't an English version of “Legends of the Condor Heroes” also released in 2018?
A:  Yes, but the debate over the translation of kung fu moves continues — like the evil move “Nine Yin Skeleton Claw.”

B:  Wasn't Liang a pioneer of the “new school” wuxia genre in the 20th century?

TORONTO, Nov 2 (Reuters) – The Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-4 in extra innings of a decisive seventh game of the World Series early on Sunday to become Major League Baseball's first repeat champion in 25 years.

The Dodgers, who were down to their final two outs when Miguel Rojas hit a game-tying homer in the ninth inning, got what proved to be the winning run in the 11th inning when Will Smith hit a solo homer off Shane Bieber.

The Blue Jays, seeking their first World Series title in 32 years, had a chance in the bottom of the frame with runners on first and third with one out, but Alejandro Kirk grounded into a double play that ended the game.

14:33 JST, November 2, 2025

TORONTO, Nov 2 (Reuters) – Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was named Most Valuable Player of baseball's World Series early on Sunday after leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a repeat championship.

Yamamoto forced the decisive seventh game of the World Series with a solid outing against the Toronto Blue Jays on Friday and pitched the final 2-2/3 innings of the clinching game without allowing a single run.

The Japanese right-hander secured the win for the Dodgers when, with runners on first and third and one out, he got Alejandro Kirk to ground into a season-ending and championship-clinching double play.

“I was not sure if I could pitch tonight until I went to the bullpen,” Yamamoto said through a translator after being named MVP. “But I'm glad I was able to.”

In his 17-2/3 innings over the World Series, Yamamoto had a 1.02 ERA and 15 strikeouts while allowing 10 hits, two runs and two walks.

The Japanese right-hander, who the Dodgers signed for 12 years and $325 million in December 2023, is also the first pitcher with three wins in a World Series since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2001.

“I did everything I was supposed to do, and I'm so happy that I was able to win this with these teammates,” said Yamamoto.

There is ""no need"" for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Nov. 2.

""Hypothetically speaking, (a meeting) is possible, but at this point there is no need for it,"" Peskov told the Russian state news agency TASS. ""There is a need for very painstaking work on the details of the (peace) settlement issue."" 

When Putin called Trump on Oct. 16, the U.S. leader said that he would meet Putin in Budapest and talked about ""progress"" being allegedly made in peace talks.

However, the plans for a Putin-Trump meeting were shelved on Oct. 21, with the U.S. president saying that he did not want a ""wasted meeting"" with Putin. He said that a key problem was Moscow's refusal to cease fighting along the current front line.

Trump went even further on Oct. 22, when he imposed sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.

On Oct. 23, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said a Trump–Putin summit remained ""not completely off the table.""

Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev claimed on Oct. 24 that Russia and Ukraine were close to reaching a deal to end the war with U.S. mediation. 

The claim contradicts Moscow's actual stance, as Russia continues to reject any compromise and insists on its maximalist demands, including Ukraine's surrender of the entire Donetsk Oblast as a precondition for peace.

Trump also said on Oct. 25 that he did not plan to meet Putin unless he saw a clear path to a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

""We're going to have to know that we're going to make a deal,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""I've always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing.""

Turkey's largest oil refineries are scaling back purchases of Russian oil and turning to alternative suppliers, as the latest Western sanctions tighten restrictions on Moscow's exports used to fund its war against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 2.

New U.S. restrictions announced on Oct. 22 target Russia's two largest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil, along with their subsidiaries. The measures pave the way for secondary sanctions against foreign institutions that handle transactions with those on the blacklist.

According to Reuters' industry sources, the shift marks a notable change for Turkey — one of the main buyers of Russian oil, alongside India and China.

The SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), owned by Azerbaijan's state oil company, has recently secured four shipments of crude from Iraq, Kazakhstan, and other non-Russian producers for December delivery, Reuters reported.

These purchases amount to between 77,000 and 129,000 barrels per day, significantly reducing the refinery's intake of Russian oil.

Another major Turkish refiner, Tupras, is also increasing purchases of non-Russian oil, including Iraqi grades of similar quality to Urals. 

Two sources told Reuters that the company plans to phase out Russian crude imports at one of its two major refineries, allowing it to continue exporting fuel to Europe without breaching upcoming restrictions.

Tupras has already begun diversifying its crude sources, receiving its first-ever shipment from Brazil earlier this year and expecting a second from Angola in November.

Rosneft and Lukoil are pillars of Russia's economy. Together, they account for nearly half of the country's crude oil exports, around 3.1 million barrels per day, according to Russian estimates.

State-controlled Rosneft, led by Igor Sechin, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, produces about 40% of Russia's oil. Lukoil, the country's largest private energy company, accounts for roughly 15% of the national output and 2% of the global production.

The new sanctions extend far beyond the parent companies, covering six Lukoil subsidiaries and 28 Rosneft enterprises. Among them is Lukoil-Western Siberia, which alone accounts for around 40% of the group's hydrocarbon production.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, entrenched in a long-standing brawl with Brussels and Kyiv, found an unexpected obstacle — U.S. President Donald Trump's U-turns.

Trump's expected Budapest summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — which was to be Orban's crowning achievement — has been canceled.

Adding insult to the injury, it is Orban who now feels the sting of Trump's foreign policy zigzags, facing pressure to cut off Russian energy imports and fearing the impact of new U.S. sanctions on Moscow.

Trump's sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's leading energy companies, prompted rare criticism from Orban, who said on Oct. 27 that the step went too far.

Hungary's leader is set to travel to Washington to meet with Trump on Nov. 7 to explore ways to mitigate the impact of sanctions on his country.

As Russian supplies cover most of Hungary's oil and gas demand, experts say that Orban is likely to stand his ground, especially with the election season heating up.

""Despite mounting pressure from the United States and the European Union, the Orban government appears determined to continue buying energy from Russia,"" Richard Demeny, an analyst at the Political Capital think tank in Budapest, told the Kyiv Independent.

When Trump won the U.S. election last year, Orban was jubilant.

Hungary's leader hoped the U.S. president — who has endorsed him and shares his conservative, anti-immigration views — would disrupt Western unity on continued support for Ukraine.

However, the latest Trump policy shift does not seem to align with Orban's expectations.

Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow while urging European nations — including Hungary — to cease importing Russian oil and gas, a strategy designed to force Moscow into peace talks.

This puts Orban into a tight spot, as his government has declared that swift decoupling from Russian imports without endangering its energy security is impossible, namely due to its geographical location.

""We can't ensure a safe supply for our country without Russian oil or gas sources,"" Hungary's chief diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, said in September. ""For us, energy supplies are a purely physical question.""

The landlocked Central European country is one of the two remaining EU members — alongside Slovakia — still buying Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline.

Unlike much of the EU, Budapest made no steps to reduce its reliance on Russian imports.

Quite the contrary, it increased the dependence on Russian crude from 64% before the full-scale invasion to 86% in 2024, the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) reported.

Hungary also signed a 15-year deal with Russia's Gazprom in 2021 to purchase natural gas mainly via the TurkStream pipeline, seeking increased volumes as the war rages on in Ukraine.

""Orban desperately tries to maintain ties with Russia, repeatedly declaring he would be the first one to return to Moscow,"" said Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs in Prague, underscoring Budapest's political — rather than just economic — motivations.

Experts say that shifting to alternative supplies — such as oil via Croatia and liquified natural gas via Poland — is fully feasible.

Though options exist, ""it's also the question of political willingness and the financial cost of this choice,"" says Andrej Nosko, an energy policy expert and visiting researcher at Matej Bel University in Slovakia.

A comparable example is Czechia, another landlocked country that used the Druzhba pipeline until declaring itself free of Russian oil this April.

Orban, in turn, has shown no inclination toward abandoning Russian energy, which has driven massive profits for Hungary's MOL oil and gas company.

Cheap utilities could also offer valuable political leverage ahead of the upcoming elections. However, as Nosko notes, MOL's profits have not translated into lower fuel prices for Hungarian consumers.

While Trump could use the threat of secondary sanctions to pressure Orban, it seems Hungary is instead seeking ""waivers from new U.S. sanctions and leveraging its strong ties with Trump to avoid having to diversify away from Russian supplies,"" Nosko told the Kyiv Independent.

According to Demeny, Orban might also use a new plan from Hungary's Energy Ministry, which suggests reducing dependence on Russian energy, to show at least some progress toward diversification and thus appease Trump.

When Trump unexpectedly announced on Oct. 16 a summit with Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks, Orban was quick to welcome the initiative.

But the hastily announced plan was scrapped mere days later, reportedly after Washington realized Moscow was not ready to concede on its maximalist demands on Ukraine.

In spite of this, Hungary's foreign minister promptly flew to meet his U.S. and Russian counterparts to assure the public that the summit is still very much on — only the date is yet to be set.

Hosting the summit — the second meeting between Trump and Putin since the former returned to office — would allow Orban to portray himself as a peacemaker, experts say.

It would bolster Orban's ""position on the international stage and against his rising domestic challenger, the Tisza Party's Peter Magyar,"" Demeny noted.

According to Pavlicek, the Hungarian prime minister also seeks to legitimize his foreign policy stance by having other world leaders, namely Trump, share and amplify these views.

Orban's image as a leader who kept his country out of the war while ensuring energy security through ""pragmatic"" ties with Moscow has been a prominent feature of the Fidesz campaign.

The Hungarian strongman needs every advantage for the April 2026 vote, which presents the most serious challenge to his rule in years.

British Transport Police have ruled out terrorism in a knife attack on a train Saturday night that left 11 people wounded including two who have life-threatening injuries. 

Police said on Sunday that two men have been arrested: a 32-year-old and a 35-year-old. 

Officials were also quick to note that both men were British born and point out their ethnicity, something that has become increasingly common among British police forces to avoid online speculation. 

The younger man is Black and the older one is a British national of Caribbean descent, police said. However, they have yet to determine what motivated the attack. 

Counter terrorism police were initially called to join the investigation, but by Sunday morning those officers had been pulled out. 

“At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” said Superintendent John Loveless of the British Transport Police which is conducting the investigation. “We continue work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident. At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident.”

Stabbing attack on a UK train injures multiple people.

The Associated Press

The attack happened after the train left Doncaster in northern England at around 6:30 p.m. en route to London's King's Cross station. Police were called at around 7:42 p.m. after reports of multiple stabbings after the train left Peterborough. 

Witnesses said they saw a man with a large knife running through the train stabbing people. Some passengers hid in toilets.

One passenger, Olly Foster, told the BBC that he was listening to an audiobook when a man ran past him shouting; “Run, run, there is a guy stabbing literally everyone, everything.” 

At first he thought it was a Halloween prank but saw the horror in the faces of other passengers. 

“You could kind of see in their faces they were being serious,” he said. “Everyone was really pushing behind us, really panicking.” 

Mr. Foster said he saw one man who had been stabbed in the head while protecting a young girl.

The train was re-directed to Huntingdon Station where armed officers quickly boarded the carriages and arrested the two men within eight minutes of the first emergency call.

Supt. Loveless said ten people were taken to hospital by ambulance and another person self-presented at hospital. While nine were initially believed to have life-threatening injuries, following assessment and treatment, four have been discharged and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition.

“It's a shocking incident and first and foremost, my thoughts are with the family and friends those who have been affected and those who are injured,” he said.

The attack is the latest in a series of deadly stabbings that have put the country on edge. 

Last week a 49-year-old man was killed and two others injured in a knife attack in London. An Afghan refugee who came to the U.K. in 2020 has been arrested. 

Last month, two men died and three men were injured in an attack at a synagogue in Manchester during Yom Kippur services. A Syrian-born man was shot at the scene by police. 

On Sunday, Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered condolences to the victims of Saturday's attack. “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response,” he said. 

Defence Secretary John Healey said the national threat level for a terrorist attack would remain at “substantial” and he called on people to be more vigilant.

“We're not going to be deflected from carrying out our everyday lives,” he told Sky News. “But I think it requires us all to be more vigilant, more vigilant about our electronic devices, about the risk of cyber fraud and cyber-attack and just be more vigilant for looking out for others around us.”

In a statement King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla “were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack” and added; “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones.”

Conservative Party Leader Kemi Badenoch said it was time for a national conversation about violent crime. “We cannot be a country where people are innocently going about their business and facing this level of violent crime,” she told the BBC on Sunday.

A home for sale in Vancouver. Canadians have been putting money into the red-hot housing market for years, and could be headed for financial pain with a correction underway, Tim Shufelt writes.Isabella Falsetti/The Globe and Mail

Every conversation about financial markets these days eventually veers toward the question of whether we are in a bubble – AI, gold, Big Tech.

But there's another asset bubble already undoing itself in painful fashion, and this one means a lot more to the finances of the average Canadian than the stock market.

Home prices in Canada have been grinding lower for 3½ years and counting. And still, the long-awaited rebound has yet to materialize.

Sales are low. Buyers are in no hurry, and sellers are being forced to reduce their prices.

“It's going to be at least five to 10 years from the peak before we get back to 2022 prices, just because of how frothy valuations got in housing,” said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist with Bank of Montreal. 

“Real estate as an asset class in Canada is pretty-much dead for now.”

How the Toronto condo bubble burst

The era of the shoebox condo is over. Here's how Canada can build livable apartments

When you look back to major housing busts in recent history, this one is tracking fairly close to precedent.

There is enormous variation across regional markets in Canada that needs to be kept in mind. Weak demand and declining values are concentrated in the Toronto and Vancouver areas, which had years of bidding wars and intense speculation. In parts of the Prairies and Atlantic Canada, sales growth is much stronger.

At the national level, the average selling price has declined by about 20 per cent in nominal terms since 2022. Once you factor in inflation, that figure rises to 30 per cent.

That puts Canada's current housing correction in line with both the U.S. housing crash that sparked the 2008 global financial crisis, and Ontario's housing crash of the 1990s.

This one does not have the wave of foreclosures of the former, nor the severe recession and mass unemployment of the latter. But in terms of depth and duration, it's very much on par, so far. In those two prior downturns, it took 10 years and 12 years, respectively, for home prices to recover to their previous highs.

Canada's bear market in housing will drag on simply because it has to rebalance from a confluence of stimulants that is not likely to ever be repeated, Mr. Kavcic said. They include peak demand from millennial buyers, peak immigration to Canada, pandemic-era mobility, excess liquidity from government stimulus, rock-bottom interest rates, and rampant market speculation.

From January, 2005, up to the housing market's peak, the average home price more than tripled in Canada, topping out at about $820,000.

One side effect of a two-decade property boom is that it increasingly put Canadians' homes front and centre of their finances.

Even after the correction, real estate accounts for more than 40 per cent of total household assets, according to Statistics Canada data. (It peaked at 46 per cent). 

Even though Canadians have record high levels of stock-market exposure, equities make up just 26 per cent of the average Canadian's total assets.

Clearly, Canadians' financial well-being is much more dependent on the housing market than the stock market.

This is especially true of lower and middle-income Canadians, since stock ownership is heavily skewed to wealthier brackets.

Having one of the world's hottest markets conditioned a generation of Canadians to treat housing as a financial asset, and even a retirement plan.

Variable-rate mortgages are making a comeback, but some economists are already predicting rate hikes

A recent survey found that half of unretired homeowners plan to rely on the sale of their home to set themselves up for retirement, according to a report released by Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in June.

A similar poll conducted last year found that one-third of Canadians are relying on their home as their only financial plan for retirement, according to a Re/Max report.

The risks of such an approach are now coming to the fore. If you're counting on the equity in your home to finance your retirement any time soon, then you're obviously vulnerable to declining property values. 

Perhaps the stock market is in a bubble that will end badly. Meanwhile, many Canadians are enduring a correction that is already taking a toll on their financial health.

Dutch semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia produces components in Europe before shipping them to China for finishing. The company is a major supplier for Europe's automotive industry.

China will exempt some Nexperia chips from an export ban that was imposed amid an escalating row with the Dutch government, officials said on Saturday.

""We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of enterprises and grant exemptions to exports that meet the criteria,"" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement.

Nexperia produces components in Europe, sends them to China for finishing and then re-exports them back to customers in Europe.

The Netherlands-based company is owned by China's Wingtech Technology. But the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of the semiconductor maker in September, citing security concerns.

This prompted China to announce export controls on the chips in October.

The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, said the exemption for Nexperia chips came after a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.

The Dutch government refused to comment on the reports and said it remained in contact with Chinese authorities ""to work toward a constructive solution that restores balance to the chip supply chain and that is good for Nexperia and our economies.""

Meanwhile, Chinese and European Union officials also held talks on export controls more broadly.

""China confirmed that the suspension of the October export controls applies to the EU. Both sides reaffirmed commitment to continue engagement on improving the implementation of export control policies,"" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said in a post on X.

Nexperia components are mainly found in cars, with the company supplying 49% of the electronic components used in the European automotive industry, according to German business newspaper Handelsblatt.

Although the components are technically replaceable, establishing alternative supply chains poses a major challenge for European automakers and other Nexperia customers.

""Without these chips, European automotive suppliers cannot build the parts and components needed to supply vehicle manufacturers and this therefore threatens production stoppages,"" European auto lobby ACEA warned last month.

In its statement on Saturday, China's Commerce Ministry placed blame on ""the Dutch government's improper intervention in the internal affairs of enterprises"" for causing ""the current chaos in the global supply chain.""

At least three people were killed in a US strike on drug smugglers in the Caribbean, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced. The news comes after the United Nations urged Washington to halt such attacks.

A US strike on an alleged drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean Sea killed three people, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said on Saturday.

This is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the United States says have been carrying narcotics in the Caribbean and Pacific.

""This vessel — like EVERY OTHER — was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling,"" Hegseth wrote in a post on X.

""These narco-terrorists are bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans at home — and they will not succeed,"" he added. 

Hegseth also again compared the alleged drug smugglers to the terrorist group al-Qaeda. 

""The Department will treat them EXACTLY how we treated al-Qaeda. We will continue to track them, map them, hunt them, and kill them,"" he said.

Hegseth also shared video footage showing the moment the boat is hit.

As in previous US government videos, areas on the boat are obscured, making it impossible to verify how many people were on board.

On Friday, the United Nations urged Washington to halt its attacks.

More than 60 people have reportedly been killed in these US strikes since early September, said UN rights chief Volker Türk.

While acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, Türk noted in a statement that these people had been killed ""in circumstances that find no justification in international law.""

""These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable,"" Türk said. ""The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.""

President Donald Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US.

Faculty are forming support networks to connect with each other to protect students and end the genocide in Palestine.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Photos of Palestine solidarity encampments have disappeared from the news, replaced by pictures of immigration agents kidnapping university students and community members, but the campus-based battle to force universities to divest from Israel and weapons manufacturing is still underway.

This a long-term, smoldering battle. “The campuses are definitely as active as they were a year ago from my purview,” says Akin Olla, communications director for the anti-militarist youth organization Dissenters. But, he adds, “The actions look different and are generally less media-friendly.”

While this struggle continues, its shape has shifted, as students who were initially on the front lines of pro-Palestine activism experience additional vulnerability due to the Trump administration's attacks. Many of these students are Muslim immigrants or from immigrant families, while others are queer or trans and confronting a different series of attacks. As a result of these changes, the shape of the work has changed. For one thing, faculty who spoke to Truthout said that campus student groups are working more in coalition to provide some shielding to targeted students, like Students for Justice in Palestine or Muslim student associations.

Faculty across the United States continue to organize: They're supporting students and their movements; organizing their own events; building aboveground and underground safety networks in response to the presence of immigration police on campus; and pushing their own unions and scholarly associations to take political positions.

Since Donald Trump took office in January 2025, people on campuses have experienced a series of rollercoaster events around the status of international, immigrant, and undocumented students and staff. In March, there were a series of high-profile kidnappings of students on visas and green cards like Rümeysa Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil in retaliation for their activism on Palestine. These widely publicized kidnappings were accompanied by the sudden revocation of 6,000 student visas around the U.S., the majority of which were not related to activism or political opinions.

The dramatic crisis of the spring has given way to other forms of exclusion: This summer, the administration made a dramatic reduction in the number of student visas that were issued, leading to a 30-40 percent drop in international students attending school in the U.S. this fall. Then on September 19, the Trump administration issued an executive order about H-1B visas that initially made it seem as if H-1B visa holders would no longer be able to come and go from the U.S. without their employers paying a $100,000 fee. There are currently around 120,000 faculty and university workers holding H-1B visas across the U.S., many of whom travel internationally professionally as part of their research.

There does not seem to be an end in sight to attacks on immigrant, undocumented, and international students, faculty, and staff, nor does there seem to be an obvious line that will not be crossed as the administration escalates its attacks. Jenna Loyd, co-founding member of Sanctuary Campus Network, says that in addition to a spillover from the administration's attacks on immigrants more broadly, the logic is to “attack the whole idea of universities being international spaces.”

Contrary to Republican talking points, universities are not hotbeds of radical leftism. In reality, governing boards react swiftly and punitively to events that rock the boat.

At a small private liberal arts college in the Northeast, a political theorist is facing dismissal for her activism. “Laura,” who chose not to give her real name because she is on the job market, found herself on the wrong side of her institution when she organized a series of speaking events about Palestine. The events featured high-profile speakers and highlighted the interconnectedness of Palestine to other issues, including campus repression of free speech, in an effort to build more solidarity with Palestine on campus.

Faculty active in the pro-Palestine struggle are generally frustrated at the lack of support and activism from their colleagues. Many faculty, says Laura, have an “easy posture of learned helplessness” around difficult issues, insisting disingenuously that the university is not a political space. “It's racism masked behind civility politics,” Laura says.

At the University of Central Florida, Talat Rahman, faculty union president and professor of physics, says that there is unfortunately not nearly as much support for organizing against the genocide as for resisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), although the two causes are interrelated. Rahman says there is a lot of fear on campus, but that “people can only be afraid for so long. At some point you have to live with your own conscience.”

It's no coincidence that the attacks on students and immigrants on campus began with those speaking out against the genocide in Palestine, says Bill V. Mullen, professor emeritus of American Studies at Purdue and secretary-treasurer for American Association of University Professors local 6741. “The opposition to the war against Palestinians has become a hammer to destroy academic freedom…. Whatever your position might even be on Palestine and Israel, you have to acknowledge that this is the mechanism that's being used to try to reshape higher education. The discussion of Palestine is actually a discussion about our work conditions.”

In other words, the repression of pro-Palestine protesters on university campuses, under Joe Biden and under every previous presidential administration, created the opportunity for the anti-immigrant attacks by the Trump administration, as well as other attacks against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and independent governance.

Despite mission statements extolling the benefits of diversity and care for their students, campus administrations have offered little other than platitudes to protect international and undocumented students, leaving it to faculty staff and students to organize and protect each other. The overwhelming majority of university administrations are too risk-averse to offer real support to students facing an expanded immigration dragnet, so some faculty are responding to administrative compliance with ICE and the Department of Homeland Security by forming their own support networks.

One national coordinating group is the new and growing Sanctuary Campus Network, which aims to pool ideas and resources so that faculty on any single campus don't need to reinvent the wheel. The network has been holding large Zoom meetings on the first Friday of each month since December 2024. These meetings often involve a training or presentation from a partner organization, like Muslims for Just Futures or Palestine Legal.

One early project of Sanctuary Campus Network was to develop an immigration-focused Know Your Rights training and slide deck that was adapted specifically for the campus environment. The network encouraged members to give the presentation on their own campuses to disseminate this information as widely as possible while reducing the time that individual faculty need to spend developing materials.

Similarly, the network has a large drive of materials for printing and use by faculty, like signs that can be placed on office or classroom doors indicating that these are private spaces (and therefore closed to immigration agents without a signed judicial warrant). The goal is to use these signs to indicate to students and others who may be targeted which faculty are supportive and where they will be harbored in the event of a raid on campus.

Sanctuary Campus Network is broken up into five regions, and members meet regularly in smaller groups. Rachel Ida Buff, a writer and working historian currently teaching at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who is part of the Midwest region, says that these regional meetings have been “really, really useful,” and validating, allowing faculty to commiserate, share tactics, and build camaraderie with each other. These regional network meetings are especially important as a space to build a collective effort since the number of active faculty on an individual campus may be quite small.

Organizing on campus, like organizing more generally, does not always look like what it looks like in the movies. Laura says that a big part of her role in mentoring student activists is teaching that “activism is not always the flashiest thing.” Instead, it's often about “illuminating how power functions” and other less obvious goals, she says.

Dana Morrison, member of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, explained that one of the group's goals is politicization. On regional public campuses like West Chester, most students work and many live far from campus, leading to a relatively apolitical campus. “How do you [participate in coordinated national events] if on your own campus, nobody has even uttered a political thing in the public space?” Morrison says that “you have to have the soil correct for anything to happen.”

It's not just students on campus who are sometimes relatively apolitical. Sanctuary Campus Network co-founding member A. Naomi Paik pointed out that some faculty have little experience with activism and are just learning to organize. There are places to learn, however: A focus of the network as well as of the American Association of University Professors has been to offer trainings on the various components of organizing, and there are usually at least a small group of faculty members on each campus who do have this experience.

Mullen, who helped organize the second National Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17, 2025, as part of the Coalition for Action in Higher Ed (CAHE), says “overcoming hopelessness is a crucial organizing problem.”  

The Day of Action featured scores of actions on a diverse range of campuses, as well as a full day of online programming organized by CAHE. Mullen says that one of the goals of this year's events was to bring Palestine more directly into the focus of higher ed organizing. CAHE is beginning to transition to an organization from an ad hoc coalition, and is already planning for April 17, 2026.

One of the main challenges of campus activism is the churn of leadership in student groups. Campaigns like divestment struggles are long, much longer than the average tenure of a student activist. Several faculty members mentioned that student organizations that led earlier protests on their campus are in a process of reformation after all the leaders graduated at once.

Faculty have much lower rates of turnover and can be present for a longer campaign, but activist faculty are careful about their role in relationship to students. Morrison says that she and her colleagues are careful to develop campaigns of their own rather than drive campus-wide divestment campaigns. “If we were to define the campaign, name the target, and all that kind of stuff, we'd be taking up space in terms of how we teach students,” she says. Faculty would end up teaching students that their participation is not important.

Instead, Morrison's Faculty and Staff Justice in Palestine chapter organized a successful divestment campaign focused on their labor union. Other faculty have engaged in pressure campaigns within their scholarly associations, like the Sociologists for Palestine campaign.

On some campuses, student groups have merged with off-campus community groups so that students who've graduated can stay involved. This is the case with the Dissenters chapter at North Carolina State University, says Chelsey Dyer, assistant teaching professor of anthropology who serves as the faculty adviser for the group. Dyer says this joint community/campus structure also allows her and other involved faculty to show up to the group more as peer activists than specifically as faculty mentors.

Similarly, Buff says campus sanctuary organizing on her campus in Milwaukee has benefited from collaborations with deeply rooted immigrant organizing in the city, and that Buff herself has benefited from looking to other activists as peers rather than often-fearful faculty colleagues.

The struggle to protect international, immigrant, and undocumented students is deeply entwined with the longer-term struggle for a free Palestine and to build a more liberatory version of higher education itself. Mullen puts it this way: “If both parties have been willing to consent to supporting a mass killing of a population, it's not a shock that both parties participated in the firing of college presidents and the arrests of students.”

The odds are daunting, but faculty like Mullen emphasize that building cross-campus and national networks reduces their isolation — and their fear.

Behind bars I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

“There's nothing wrong with him. If there were, it would say so in his file.”

I heard a licensed mental health counselor say those words to a correctional officer as they stood side by side, watching a man through a large plexiglass window that took up most of the wall of an observation cell, a cell used for people deemed a threat to themselves or others. Inside, the man was visibly unraveling, pacing, talking to someone who wasn't there.

We were in B-4, the mental health unit at Orange County Jail in Goshen, New York, known among incarcerated men and staff as the “bug-out” unit. I was 19 years old, newly incarcerated, and already diagnosed with several mental health disorders. In my naive and inexperienced mind, I thought the man in that cell was going to receive some sort of help. However, on that day, I learned a harsh reality: in New York's jails and prisons, mental health services do not exist unless it is documented and part of your case file.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

When I was arrested in 2014, I came to jail with a psychiatrist's diagnosis already in hand: oppositional defiant disorder, depression, and severe anxiety. I had been prescribed psychiatric medication, and because that paperwork followed me, I was placed on the mental health caseload. In many ways, I was fortunate. Before my incarceration, I was covered under my family's health insurance, which allowed me to see a psychiatrist and receive treatment that many others could not access. That single privilege, the ability to afford care and obtain a documented diagnosis, became the reason I qualified for mental health care in jail. Though the services were limited, I was at least provided monthly check-ins, medication, and placement in a housing unit that catered more to our individual needs than a general population unit would have.

None of it felt like treatment though. There were no therapy sessions, no support groups, and no opportunities to understand what I was experiencing or how to manage it, especially in a place like jail. The unit I was housed in felt less like a place for healing, and more like a warehouse: somewhere to lock away people with visible symptoms until they could be filtered back into general population, which eventually is where I ended up.

In 2017, I was sentenced and transferred to a state facility run by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). I expected some continuity of care. What I found was worse: a system where treatment is reduced to a checklist, and if you are not already “on the books,” you do not qualify. Care inside is determined by paperwork, not people. If you had a psychiatrist before prison, you might be placed on the caseload. If you did not, no matter how much you are struggling, you are likely ignored.

When I told staff that I felt more depressed and even had thoughts of hurting myself, I was told, “That is just the price you pay to feel better.”

This reality was impossible to miss. I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration. I listened to stories from people who had been hearing voices since their teenage years, but whose requests for treatment were denied because they had never seen a doctor before prison. Others described panic attacks, chronic insomnia, or overwhelming anxiety, only to be told, “You are not on the caseload.” Their suffering did not count because it was not already written down in a file.

Correctional officers and even some mental health aides treat mental illness like a hustle, assuming people are exaggerating to get medication, avoid punishment, or score a free high. Unless you came in with schizophrenia or psychosis, you are often brushed aside. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD, conditions that disable so many, are dismissed as mood swings or bad behavior. Instead of being seen as medical issues, they are treated as flaws in character, a reflection of willpower rather than well-being.

DOCCS reports that about 29 percent of incarcerated individuals are currently on the mental health caseload, up from 26 percent in 2022. Yet according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, nearly 50 percent of incarcerated people nationwide live with some form of mental illness. That gap exposes the truth: people are coming to prison already suffering, but if they lacked access to doctors and diagnoses before incarceration, their pain remains invisible.

In 2018, while at Clinton Correctional Facility, I stopped taking psychiatric medication. The side effects — weight gain, fatigue, emotional numbness — became unbearable. When I told staff that I felt more depressed and even had thoughts of hurting myself, I was told, “That is just the price you pay to feel better.” But I did not feel better. What I learned was that in prison, medication is often the only tool offered, and even that is reserved for those whose paperwork qualifies them. Real care such as counseling, trauma-informed therapy, and group support is almost nonexistent. The state treats medication as a substitute for healing rather than one part of it, reducing human suffering to a matter of dosage and compliance.

A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm.

A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm. Constant surveillance, unpredictable violence, long-term separation from family, and the complete loss of control over your own life are not simply stressors; they are traumas that shape every waking moment. Yet the system refuses to acknowledge this. Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself. When someone begins to break down, their behavior is treated as a disciplinary issue rather than a crisis. Instead of receiving treatment, they are written up. Instead of obtaining care, they are sent to solitary. Their file grows, not with diagnoses or treatment plans, but with misbehavior reports. The result is predictable: people leave prison more fragile than when they came in, carrying untreated wounds back into their communities.

The file system does not merely fail people; it protects the institution. By tying care to prior diagnosis, DOCCS shifts responsibility away from itself. If a man spirals into psychosis but was never diagnosed before prison, the state can claim, “There was nothing in his file.” The suffering becomes invisible by design, hidden behind policy language and bureaucratic logic that prioritize liability over lives. This shield saves money, limits accountability, and allows lawmakers to say they are addressing mental health without making real investments. It is austerity disguised as policy, and its consequences are written on the faces of the people it abandons.

Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself.

Mental health care must be available to everyone, not just those with paperwork. Everyone should be screened at intake and again at regular intervals, ensuring that these screenings are conducted by independent clinicians rather than correctional staff. Prisons should offer talk therapy, group sessions, and trauma-informed care in every facility. Staff should be trained to recognize signs of distress and respond with care, not punishment. We need systems that acknowledge incarceration itself as trauma and help people survive it rather than break under it.

We know untreated mental illness drives higher recidivism rates, deepens cycles of poverty and violence, and fuels despair that can end in suicide. New York spends more than $3 billion annually on prisons yet continues to ration care as if acknowledging suffering were too expensive. The truth is, neglect is what proves costly. People return home untreated, destabilized, and at higher risk of reoffending. Communities bear the weight. Families pay the price.

Right now, DOCCS treats mental illness as a logistical problem. But what is happening inside these walls is deeper than that. People are hurting. Some are unraveling. And many are leaving prison with scars that no file will ever record. We cannot medicate our way through this crisis. Healing requires more than prescriptions. It requires care, presence, and a system that sees people rather than paperwork, because what is not written down still matters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","A firefighter, police officer and an FBI agent. The tale of an accused serial law enforcement impersonator","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/steve-farzam-accused-firefighter-impersonator-california","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 11:00:02 GMT","


EDITOR'S NOTE:  This account of the allegations against Los Angeles hotelier Steve Farzam is based on official statements, court documents, investigation reports, interviews with law enforcement officials and people who encountered him over the years, his social media posts and other reporting from CNN.



            At an extravagant reception, hotelier Steve Farzam seemed to literally plunge into marriage, appearing to dive from a helicopter in a rainbow parachute onto the grounds of a luxury hotel north of Beverly Hills.
    


            The parachutist descended from an overcast sky at the lavish 2017 wedding reception, as seen in videos posted online. “Groom or 007?” Farzam wrote in a YouTube description.
    


            It was staged: A stuntman jumped from the helicopter and landed near the crowd amid a downpour of rose pedals. He was surrounded by a ground crew that included Farzam, who slipped out of a bodysuit and switched places with the stuntman. In a white tux, the groom emerged to rousing applause, according to videographer Moziko Wind.
    


            “It was like a magician,” said Wind, who produced the movie-like wedding video. “He claimed that he jumped. People with money, they really want to impress their guests.”
    


            Well-known in the civic circles of the affluent Westside of Los Angeles, Farzam is the son of a longtime hotel owner and former doctor who emigrated from Iran. He's a state certified and licensed paramedic with an associate degree in emergency medical technology; a self-proclaimed do-gooder whose penchant for protecting and serving has occasionally run afoul of the law.
    


            Though often appearing stylish and refined, with an air of unshakable confidence, like a real-life James Bond, Farzam seemed to come undone in recent years.
    


            In January, he was seen in a restricted emergency zone around the Palisades Fire — fully decked out in firefighter turnout gear. By July, he was facing nearly two dozen felony charges, including impersonating a firefighter and assaulting a first responder.
    


            He was chief operating officer of an eco-friendly boutique hotel owned and operated by his family across from the storied Santa Monica pier. On his websites and social media posts, he has portrayed himself for years as a beneficent giver, a man of action: boasting about his paramedic experience, medical helicopter missions in Arizona and volunteer work in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
    


            On social media he praised emergency medical crews and US Border Patrol officers; posted a photo of President Donald Trump in a MAGA cap with the message, “God bless America and our brave patriots who keep us safe;” and urged people to support the tough-on-crime policies of Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, whose office is now trying to put him behind bars.
    


            Farzam's posts shared a common theme: He lauded the courage of first responders, extolled those who serve and safeguard communities and promoted civic engagement and small acts of heroism.
    


            In a blue paramedic uniform, Farzam appeared on “The Tyra Banks Show,” which usually featured chats with Hollywood stars and presidential hopefuls. Farzam offered tips about home survival kits and accident safety, according to a YouTube video. He smiled during his introduction, seeming to revel in applause.
    


            “I have learned over the years that people work for money but they die for admiration and respect,” Farzam, in 2017, told VoyageLA, a digital publication that claims to highlight “LA's most inspiring stories.”
    


            In the waning days of the pandemic, appreciation and recognition came from Los Angeles city and county officials, who, according to posts on Farzam's Instagram, commended Farzam for operating Covid testing centers and hailed him as a leader and role model.
    


            Despite the accolades and online swagger, the Seattle-born son of Jewish Iranian immigrants kept getting into trouble. In the months and years before his July 16 arrest, his behavior grew increasingly erratic, court documents show.
    


            He now stands accused of perpetrating a more than 25-year con that spiraled into a cinematic tale of intrigue, with potentially dire consequences: If convicted, Farzam faces up to 23 years and 10 months in prison.
    


            An FBI and Homeland Security agent, a firefighter, arson investigator and police officer, Farzam has been them all over the years – well, he's appeared to wear each of those hats. In 2011, Beverly Hills police reported catching Farzam and a woman, dressed as security personnel, trying to sneak into the Golden Globe Awards. He told officers they had worked security the previous night and returned to “see all the movie stars,” according to an investigation report. He even created a fictitious fire company, according to prosecutors – an accusation his lawyer has pushed back on.
    


            Who is the real Steve Farzam?
    


            He's no public servant but a great pretender, a serial law enforcement and first responder wannabe, according to court records, official statements and interviews with people who have encountered him over the years. His misconduct, from posing as an arson investigator during the worst wildfires in Los Angeles history to aiming lasers at the cockpits of commercial and law enforcement aircraft, repeatedly put lives at risk, according to prosecutors.
    


            “This is a continuous con to pretend to be a first responder for benefits,” Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Ayvazian, who is prosecuting the case, said at a preliminary hearing last month.
    


            “Whatever those benefits are, financial or whether those benefits are in Mr. Farzam's head, that is not relevant.”
    


            “If Mr. Farzam was in his backyard playing with his fire trucks and his guns with his friends, we wouldn't be here. The reason why we're here is because he put himself out in the community, and he represented himself as a firefighter. He represented himself as a law enforcement officer,” the prosecutor said.
    


            Investigators have been unable to identify a motive in what Ayvazian called “a very strange case.”
    


            “If you look at the entire context of what we've presented in this case … it's a very troubling pattern,” he said of Farzam's behavior.
    


            CNN has sought comment from Farzam's wife and two brothers. One of his attorneys, Alan Jackson, declined to comment on the record. Farzam, 47, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
    


            Jackson, at the preliminary hearing, argued prosecutors failed to produce evidence to support the charges, particularly “zero” proof the targeted aircraft “were flashed by a laser.” About Farzam's presence at a restricted zone during the Palisades Fire, Jackson insisted his client was “there to help.”
    


            “Not one shred of evidence suggests that my client tried to benefit monetarily or benefit in any other way, at the detriment of the community or the government, to falsify his identity as a fireman. He was there to help. He's not charged with any violent crime whatsoever,” Jackson said.
    


            In a motion in support of no bail filed one day before the enigmatic hotelier's mid-July arrest, Ayvazian wrote Farzam “has a long and persistent history involving the impersonation of law enforcement and emergency personnel, fraudulent access to government systems, and unlawful firearm possession.”
    


            Farzam was 21 at the time of his earliest known criminal involvement, in 1999, when he was arrested for impersonating a police officer and committing perjury, according to prosecutors. The charges were dismissed under a plea agreement, court documents show. He pleaded guilty to providing false information on Department of Motor Vehicles documents and giving unlawful registration.
    


            “His conduct spans more than two decades, demonstrating a calculated disregard for the law and a sustained pattern of deception,” according to the motion for no bail in the current case.
    


            Farzam was held without bail until October 24, when a judge set bail at $3 million, according to the district attorney's office. After his release, he was placed on house arrest at an in-patient mental health facility and ordered to wear an ankle monitor. He's not permitted to possess firearms, explosive devices, pyrotechnics, lasers or flashlights. Farzam also was ordered not to contact witnesses in the case. His next court appearance is slated for November 20.
    


            “Where does he stop?” asked James Hirt, a retired special agent supervisor for the California Department of Justice, who investigated Farzam in a major 2014 case involving 60 felony counts. He pleaded guilty to three felonies in that case and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and five years of probation. Eventually the convictions were reduced to misdemeanors and expunged.
    


            “I'm sure all we've ever done is scratch the surface of his nonsense. And that's probably why he keeps doing it.”
    


            A thick blanket of smoke and ash rolled over the southern California horizon that mid-January day during the deadly Palisades Fire. The air was hazy and acrid.
    


            Farzam paid a visit to a restricted evacuation zone, wearing full firefighting gear over his 6-foot, 200-pound frame.
    


            In a white Ford Expedition with exempt plates and red emergency lights, Farzam stopped at a checkpoint manned by the National Guard on January 17 and presented a document showing the vehicle was registered to the fictitious Santa Muerte Fire Department, prosecutors said. That's Spanish for Saint Death, a scythe-wielding skeleton folk saint popular in Latin America as a guardian of outcasts. He said he was an arson investigator, according to prosecutors. After showing his driver's license, the soldiers allowed him in the restricted zone, according to the no bail motion, which didn't indicate what he did or how long he was there.
    


            “God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy,” Farzam wrote on X the next day, with video of crackling, wind-swept flames swallowing up a luxury home.
    

God bless the first responders for their courage and service to all of us during this horrific tragedy. We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes. 🙏 @LACOFD @LAFD @SantaMonicaFire @CAL_FIRE @Cal_OES @MRCAParks… pic.twitter.com/Whc0QKr4VV


            “We will be forever grateful for your dedication and fierce fight all of you put up to save our homes.”
    


            On January 16, prosecutors said, Farzam drove to a checkpoint at the evacuation zone in a vehicle with state exempt plates. He allegedly told a Los Angeles Port Police officer he was with the LA Fire Department. He was allowed to remain in the restricted zone. 



            On March 25, prosecutors said, Farzam was seen on LAPD surveillance footage driving to a National Guard checkpoint at Sunset Boulevard and Amalfi Drive. He identified himself as a security guard. He presented a guard card and gun permit to gain access to the restricted zone.
    


            Santa Muerte is a Mexican folk religion that mixes traditional aspects of Catholicism and ancient Aztec beliefs. The patron saint of death is venerated as a spiritual benefactor of a growing number of marginalized Mexicans and Central Americans who claim they feel unprotected by the state and cast aside by the Catholic Church.
    


            While lighting candles of various colors is part of its veneration, Saint Death has nothing to do with fires or extinguishing them.
    


            Farzam's nonexistent fire department is listed online and in state records as being on North Imperial Avenue in El Centro, a sweltering desert community about 120 miles east of San Diego. Its motto is, “Serving with Courage, Integrity and Professionalism,” according to a website, which includes a volunteer form. The address is actually a UPS Store in a strip mall that also houses a hair salon and spa and a Mexican seafood restaurant.
    


            The creation of the fake agency is “central” to Farzam's scheme, according to prosecutors, who said he “assumed false authority as a high-ranking fire official.” The fabricated role, they say, was exploited to “obtain government-issued exempt license plates, gain unlawful access to restricted emergency zones” and acquire new firearms reserved for peace officers.
    


            The scheme has put Farzam “at the center of a far-reaching, multi-agency criminal investigation involving a sustained pattern of fraud, impersonation of public officials, unlawful acquisition of firearms, and repeated endangerment of public safety,” according to the no bail motion.
    


            The 164-room glass-and-steel, beachfront Shore Hotel – which the Farzam family opened in 2011 – served, according to prosecutors, as “base of operations for several fraudulent activities, including IP addresses linked to false submissions and vehicle registration.”
    


            Farzam's brother Jon, CEO of Shore Hotel, and the hotel's public relations firm have not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            The fictitious fire department has the same initials as the legitimate Santa Monica Fire Department – near where the Shore Hotel is located, prosecutors said. The volunteer fire department was registered as a nonprofit in California in July 2022, according to state records, which show a representative of the Shore Hotel, with its Santa Monica address, as its registered agent.
    


            Farzam's attorney Jackson argued the Santa Muerte Fire Department is a nonprofit legitimately registered with the state and said prosecutors have not established “it was a false firefighter department, and it was just literally made up.”
    


            Ayvazian, the prosecutor, told the court: “We would have to assume that Mr. Farzam is a very low IQ person who is incredibly gullible to believe that he did not know” this is not a “legitimate fire department.”
    


            On September 15, 2022, Farzam went to the Santa Monica office of the California Department of Motor Vehicles and submitted forms to turn over ownership of a Hummer to the fictitious fire agency, according to court documents. He identified himself as “Dep. Chief.”
    


            In all, at least 10 vehicles were “fraudulently registered” under the Santa Muerte name, court records said.
    


            Israel Gonzalez, a special agent for the California Department of Justice, testified at the preliminary hearing that the name of the fire department on DMV documents drew his attention.
    


            “Are you a native Spanish speaker?” asked the prosecutor.
    


            “I am.”
    


            “What does ‘Santa Muerte' mean?”
    


            “The literal definition is Saint of Death.”
    


            The so-called Saint of Death fire company helped Farzam secure guns, prosectors said.
    


            The no bail motion said from February 2023 to January 2024, Farzam posed as a law enforcement officer to unlawfully obtain nine firearms from a licensed dealer. He falsely claimed to be a peace officer with the Santa Muerte Fire Department, arriving at a store in uniform with patches from the fake agency – and a holstered handgun, according to testimony by a Bureau of Firearms special agent.
    


            He drove exempt vehicles and presented forged peace officer IDs and a false peace officer standards and training certificate. The falsified credentials “allowed him to bypass the mandatory Firearm Safety Certificate (FSC) and to purchase handguns not listed on California's Roster of Certified Handguns.”
    


            In one haul, prosecutors said, he drove away with a .22 caliber handgun, a 9mm handgun, a couple of rifles and a 12-gauge shotgun.
    


            Gun store employees recalled Farzam on two occasions pulling out of the parking lot – red and white lights flashing, sirens blaring – as if responding to an emergency call, court documents show.
    


            “He's a 47-year-old man. He's not a child, and he's clearly able to fill out forms,” Ayvazian said of the defendant at the preliminary hearing. “He's not an ignorant fool. He is someone who is doing this as a pattern of conduct, and he is manipulating the different bureaucracies in the state of California to his benefit.”
    


            “Santa Muerte does not exist. It is not an unincorporated city. It's not an incorporated city.”
    


            And there were the bizarre incidents that prosecutors described as “the most dangerous aspect” of his current criminal case.
    


            Farzam is accused of “a series of blue laser strikes directed at commercial, recreational and law enforcement aircraft” near his Brentwood home earlier this year, according to court documents. The FBI has warned laser strikes can potentially disorient or temporarily blind pilots and contribute to a crash.
    


            No aircraft has ever been reported to have crashed because of a laser strike. Still, Farzam's alleged strikes account for the more serious charges against him: multiple felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and assault upon a peace office or firefighter.
    


            On the night of February 21, several aircraft – including a news helicopter, a California Highway Patrol helicopter and three commercial airliners descending into Los Angeles International Airport – reported “being struck by a high-intensity blue laser beam,” according to court documents.
    


            “It was a really frightening night, because that light was so powerful and so bright, it really could've gotten us hurt,” CNN affiliate KABC reporter Chris Christi told the station after Farzam's arrest.
    


            The helicopter was piloted by Morrie Zager. A camera operator also was on board. Christi told the station a “particularly bright blue light” filled the cockpit. It reflected off the windshield and “lit up the entire cockpit.”
    


            “The laser directly struck Zager and (Christi) in the eyes, causing intense pain and temporary blindness, forcing evasive maneuvers,” according to the motion in support of no bail. The helicopter followed and recorded a black SUV. Detectives later identified Farzam as the man seen on news footage stepping out of the vehicle during the attack.
    


            At the preliminary hearing, Zager compared the laser strike in his eye to “a whack in the back of the head with a baseball bat.”
    


            That same night, three commercial airline pilots reported being targeted with blue laser light on the approach to LAX – which led to additional criminal charges against Farzam.
    


            On April 19, prosecutors said, Farzam allegedly pointed a blue laser at an LAPD helicopter.
    


            Jackson, Farzam's high-profile veteran criminal defense attorney, noted a defense expert's testimony that an analysis of video and photos of one strike showed “the diffusion of that light source is inconsistent with the laser.”
    


            “Everything rises and falls on whether or not it was a laser, and they simply failed to produce that information,” Jackson said of the prosecution witnesses.
    


            “If Mr. Farzam was the person who was shooting the item,” Jackson added, “it wasn't a laser.”
    


            A flashlight with blue light was found in Farzam's possession, Jackson said. “They have to have something that says there was a laser and they don't.” The attorney acknowledged investigators found laser pointers in Farzam's home, but none were blue.
    


            Still harder to prove, Jackson said, are the counts of assault on a peace officer stemming from the laser strikes, arguing that Farzam would not or could not have known what kind of aircraft was flying at the time. “At night, against a black sky, in pitch black darkness, you cannot tell the difference between a law enforcement aircraft and a civilian aircraft,” he said. “They have the exact same silhouette.”
    


            “This has been overcharged as assault with a deadly weapon,” Jackson said of the complaint, adding there is “no way” a laser pointer “could be considered a dangerous or deadly weapon.”
    


            Last September, Farzam was at the center of what prosecutors called “a disturbing encounter” at a home in Beverly Hills.
    


            A charge of impersonating a police investigator stems from the incident on September 21, 2024. In a black Ford Explorer registered with the Santa Muerte Fire Department, Farzam pulled up to a driveway and blocked the sidewalk, according to court documents. He wore a tactical jacket emblazoned with the word “INVESTIGATOR.” At the front door, carrying a holstered firearm, he “aggressively demanded” to speak with the homeowner without identifying what agency he represented, according to the no bail motion.
    


            He later told police he was “acting as a private investigator looking into a fight involving the homeowner's son,” according to court documents. Surveillance video showed “Farzam threatening to arrest the boy without identifying himself or citing any legal basis for doing so.”
    


            Farzam, still wearing the tactical jacket and carrying a 9mm handgun, was later pulled over by police in Beverly Hills. The weapon was registered to an acquaintance, who told police he had left the firearm in the vehicle when he borrowed it from Farzam, according to court documents. The acquaintance expressed anger that Farzam had used the weapon. The Ford Explorer was “fraudulently registered” to the fictitious Santa Muerte Fire Department by someone named “Chief Ed Jackson,” the court documents said.
    


            Farzam told police he was conducting a transaction involving the legal transfer of a firearm at the time, according to the no bail document.
    


            During the preliminary court hearing, Farzam's attorney acknowledged a witness in a video noted Farzam “said something about an arrest” during the incident, but “there was no allegation whatsoever that my client was engaged in any kind of self-benefit or violence.”
    


            Farzam is the son of a doctor-turned-hotelier who emigrated from Iran with his wife and their three children, according to an obituary of the eldest Farzam, who died last year. The couple later had two other children. The family settled for a time in Seattle, where the couple purchased their first motel. They later moved to Los Angeles, where the Farzams owned and operated three motels in the 1980s and 1990s – including two that once stood on the site of the Shore Hotel.
    


            Farzam has a bachelor's degree in sociology from California State University, Northridge, and a certificate and associate degree in emergency medical technology/paramedic from Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California.
    


            Farzam later taught at the college. To meet teaching credentials at Southwestern, he submitted an American Heart Association Healthcare Provider card that was “invalid and dishonestly obtained,” the California Emergency Medical Services Authority said in a 2009 letter denying his application for licensing. A college spokesperson confirmed Farzam was an adjunct professor for about a year, beginning in August 2007, but declined to discuss personnel matters.
    


            In the late 1990s, Farzam was a police cadet at the Santa Barbara Police Department. Retired Santa Barbara Officer Charles McChesney, who was on the job when Farzam was training, still remembers him.
    


            One summer night in 1999, McChesney was conducting a traffic stop when a Crown Victoria – the sedan that dominated police fleets for decades – with exempt plates made a sudden U-turn and pulled up behind his patrol car. Farzam was at the wheel.
    


            “He backed me up on a traffic stop. I asked him what he was doing and he gave me a story and handed me a business card saying he had a contract with a state agency to provide some kind of security services,” McChesney told CNN. “I thought, ‘That's kind of weird,' but I let that go.”
    


            Later, McChesney said, he responded to a report of a public disturbance at a downtown apartment complex and found Farzam “in the middle of it.” He said Farzam showed up at the scene and “just made it worse.” At the time Farzam was no longer a cadet or associated with the local police department.
    


            The officer ended up seizing the exempt plates on Farzam's car, McChesney said. He recalled Farzam was “mad” that McChesney had “started looking into him.”
    


            “He was kind of borderline stalking me, and he had sent me one or two mysterious, threatening emails. Some kind of watch-your-back type of thing. And that's when detectives got involved,” he said.
    


            “He does this stupid stuff that seems harmless, right. But then it also got a little bit of a menacing overtone.”
    


            In July 1999, Santa Barbara police learned Farzam's car was registered to “State of California Metro Police Enforcement” and he was identified as an officer, according to the state Emergency Medical Services Authority. The discovery was one of multiple reasons the authorities gave for denying Farzam's paramedic license in 2008. His vehicle had exempt plates, flashing lights, a radio scanner, spotlights, and other police equipment. The denial letter said Farzam was convicted of making a false statement to the DMV and a registration violation.
    


            Lee Carter, a retired deputy district attorney in Santa Barbara, said details of the case he prosecuted are fuzzy after so many years but recalled Farzam was arrested in 1999 on charges of impersonating a police officer and other charges.
    


            “I remember he showed up at a couple of calls all decked out, and there was some circumstantial evidence he drove around in a car outfitted with police lights,” Carter told CNN.
    


            “It worries me that the accusations continue after this length of time. We were the first and he was young. We thought, ‘He's just a young kid making bad mistakes.' Now, three decades later, you say, maybe there's something else going on.”
    


            In 2002, court records show, the LAPD arrested Farzam for “impersonating a firefighter and falsely reporting an emergency.” In a case involving 19 criminal counts, Farzam was convicted of five misdemeanors in 2003. He was sentenced to 182 days in jail and placed on probation, according to prosecutors.
    


            He reportedly identified himself as an off-duty officer and county paramedic. An LAPD investigation “revealed a pattern of behavior consistent with a continual desire to identify yourself as either a police officer, firefighter or any other officious position related to such professions,” the California Emergency Medical Service Authority said in a letter to Farzam.
    


            He was again arrested by the LAPD in 2004 for falsely reporting an emergency. Farzam pleaded guilty to two of six counts and got probation, according to court records.
    


            Then, in 2014, Farzam became embroiled in what prosecutors called the “most significant prior case” against him: a 60-count complaint filed by then California Attorney General Kamala Harris. The case was part of a state Department of Justice investigation.
    


            Prosecutors accused Farzam of using an alias to fraudulently access the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, a vast computer network that connects state public safety agencies to databases for criminal histories, vehicle and driver records and other sensitive information.
    


            Farzam “falsely impersonated an FBI Special Agent during a phone call to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office to influence a driving under the influence prosecution,” according to the no bail motion.
    


            “Representing himself as the real special agent, Farzam falsely claimed the defendant was a key member of a covert federal task force. He spoke directly to a supervising deputy city attorney, who requested official FBI confirmation.”
    


            The source of the information was an informant, a former friend and associate of Farzam who turned on him, according to state DOJ investigation reports obtained by CNN. On May 7, 2014, the informant made an undercover purchase of an assault rifle from Farzam at the hotelier's Brentwood home, the investigation reports show. He recorded the encounter. Farzam allegedly test-fired the rifle into the lawn in his backyard, which overlooks a public school.
    


            On the same day, according to the investigation reports, Farzam called the supervising prosecutor, claiming to be an FBI agent in Los Angeles. He identified himself as “Special Agent in Charge Rafael Garcia” and said he wanted to “get a driving under the influence arrest dismissed for a Santa Monica police officer because she was an informant in the ‘Chapo Guzman case,'” the documents said, referring to now imprisoned Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán, known as “El Chapo.”
    


            If she wanted to know more, Farzam suggested, the prosecutor should “Google Chapo Guzman.”
    


            The prosecutor told a state DOJ investigator the caller was “very personable and talked as if he knew what he was doing,” according to an investigation report.
    


            In June 2014, law enforcement officials seized 16 firearms – including assault-style rifles – a dozen emergency radios, more than 40 forged badges, two counterfeit permits to carry concealed weapons, TSA and airline “Flying While Armed” documents and a CHP Crown Victoria with emergency lights from Farzam's home and business, according to the no bail motion. A 1986 Pierce fire truck was also found on the property, according to an investigation report at the time.
    


            The fire truck, registered under the Santa Muerte Fire Department, was seized as evidence after Farzam's arrest last July, prosecutors said.
    


            Hirt, the retired state DOJ agent, said one item in Farzam's home was particularly humorous. A framed certificate mounted on a wall, reportedly from the Transportation Safety Administration, commended Farzam for thwarting an airline hijacking, Hirt recalled with a laugh.
    


            “I think we would know if that occurred, right,” Hirt said. “We Googled him, never found anything. He just made it up. In his own mind, he was somebody special. And he certainly believed he was not subject to the laws that everybody else was subject to.”
    


            Farzam eventually pleaded guilty to three felony counts: impersonating a peace officer, possession of an assault weapon and unauthorized computer access, according to the no bail motion. His sentence: 90 days in jail and five years' probation. The convictions were ultimately reduced to misdemeanors and expunged in 2022, the court document said.
    


            “He was able to convince the judge that he was not an innocent man but a reformed guy, and that he was going to stop,” Hirt said.
    


            “He's got money. The parents were always there to bail him out. Literally, I was walking into the police department in Santa Monica after serving the search warrant at his hotel and he's walking out with his family. That's how quick they managed to bail him out.”
    


            In 2019, Farzam was in trouble again. A felony complaint by the state attorney general charged him with attempted witness intimidation, identity theft and use of counterfeit court seal, according to the no bail document. The case centered on his alleged attempt to intimidate a former employee who filed a lawsuit against Farzam. He also was accused of creating and submitting a forged order with a counterfeit Los Angeles Superior Court seal in a bid to “compel the removal of unflattering online content,” prosecutors said. A UCLA law professor discovered the forgery and alerted authorities.
    


            “The guy lives in LA. If he only became a screenwriter, he could harness all that,” said Eugene Volokh, the University of California, Los Angeles law professor emeritus who alerted authorities.
    


            Mental health diversion was granted in the case, which, according to prosecutors, was dismissed in 2022. It's not clear what the mental health issue was or what treatment, if any, Farzam received. Mental health diversion connects people with mental health issues to treatment programs and support services in lieu of jail time.
    


            When Farzam was arrested this year on July 16, former state DOJ special agent supervisor Hirt got a call from a colleague who was part of the 2014 investigation.
    


            “You'll never guess who got arrested?” asked the caller.
    


            Hirt knew.
    


            “Nothing's going to stop him,” he said, referring to Farzam. “I'm surprised it took this long to arrest him again. He can't resist. He can't break the habit.”

            Britain was shocked by a mass stabbing attack on a train Saturday evening, targeting passengers as they traveled through central England on their way to London in an incident Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described as “deeply concerning.”
    


            Nine people were left with life-threatening injuries, two of whom were still fighting for their lives in hospital on Sunday, as the British Transport Police declared a “major incident.”
    


            Two suspected attackers were detained within minutes of police receiving their first emergency call, as the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon station.
    


            Authorities have now confirmed they are two British-born males in their 30s. Police are working to determine a motive but say there is no evidence to suggest the attack is terror-related.
    


            Here's what we know about the stabbing attack.
    


            The high-speed London North Eastern Railway (LNER) train departed from the northern city of Doncaster at 6.25 p.m. local time on Saturday evening, bound for London.
    


            The train had just left Peterborough station in Cambridgeshire when the attack took place.
    


            Passenger Wren Chambers told the BBC she initially “heard some screaming and shouting” coming from a carriage or two down, before a man ran down the train with a “very clear wound,” bleeding heavily from his arm.
    


            After seeing more people running past, Chambers grabbed her bag and coat. “I got up and moved forward down the train after them, trying to get (as) far down the train as they can.”
    


            People fled through the carriages seeking safety, with some attempting to barricade themselves in the train's toilets, said other witnesses who saw train seats soaked in blood.
    


            Police received their first emergency call at approximately 7.42 p.m. local time and immediately deployed armed officers. Within eight minutes of the first emergency call, the two suspects were arrested after the train made an unplanned, emergency stop at Huntingdon station.
    


            Armed police officers were seen running down the platform at the station, evacuating passengers while looking to neutralise any ongoing threat, British news agency PA Media reported.
    


            One eyewitness, who gave his name as Gavin, described one of the suspects being struck down by a police Taser. “Essentially, as they got closer to him, started shouting, like, ‘get down get down'… I think it was a Taser that got him down in the end,” he told Sky News.
    


            The trauma-stricken train remained at Huntingdon station Sunday morning, with medical equipment and other debris seen strewn on the platform.
    


            A total of 11 victims received treatment in hospital. 10 people were taken to the hospital by ambulance, nine of whom were in life-threatening condition, while another person later self-presented that evening.
    


            As of Sunday morning, two people remained fighting for their lives, British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless told reporters.
    


            Little other information has been given at this stage about the victims, including their ages.
    


            Eyewitnesses have reported seeing people with stab wounds and heavy bleeding.
    


            Two suspects were arrested on Saturday evening, on suspicion of attempted murder. In an update on Sunday, police revealed both are British nationals in their 30s.
    


            One is a 32-year-old, Black British national, while the other is a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, according to Superintendent Loveless.
    


            Both were born in the UK, he added. They remained in separate police stations for questioning on Sunday morning.
    


            Police are still working to establish a motive, but say there is no indication it was terror-related. “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” Loveless said. “At this stage, it would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause of this incident.”
    


            British defense secretary John Healey described the incident as an “isolated attack” in a Sky News interview.
    


            BTP had initially declared “Plato” – the national codeword when responding to a “marauding terrorist attack” – before later rescinding it.
    


            The UK rarely sees mass casualty events and homicide rates are low compared to other Western nations.
    


            Gun crime is particularly low, with the country recording 5,103 offenses involving firearms over this past year, according to government statistics.
    


            In comparison knife crime has risen overall since 2011. Some 51,527 knife crime offences were recorded by forces in England and Wales in the previous 12 months up until June 2025, according to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). Of those, 15,689 were recorded in London.
    


            British politicians and other key figures expressed their shock at Saturday's attack and offered their condolences to victims.
    


            “My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response. Anyone in the area should follow the advice of the police,” British Prime Minister Keir Starmer wrote on X.
    


            Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened to hear about the stabbings,” and that her “thoughts go out to all those affected.”
    


            In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, King Charles said, “My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.”
    


            “Our deepest sympathy and thoughts are with all those affected, and their loved ones,” he added.
    


            “We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.”
    


            The East Coast Main Line – on which the train was traveling – is one of the UK's busiest and most important railway routes. It connects major cities, running from London King's Cross to Edinburgh Waverly in Scotland.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump sees tariffs — or the threat of them — as a powerful tool to bend nations to his will.

He has used them in an unprecedented way, not only as the underpinning of his economic agenda, but also as the cornerstone of his foreign policy in his second term.

He has wielded the import taxes as a threat to secure ceasefiresfrom countries at war. He has used them to browbeat nations into promising to do more to stop people and drugs from flowing across their borders. He has used them, in Brazil's case, as political pressure because its judicial system prosecuted a former leader who was a Trump ally, and in a recent blowup with Canada, as punishment for a television ad.

This week, the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the Republican president has overstepped federal law with many of his tariffs. A ruling against him could limit or even take away that swift and blunt leverage that much of his foreign policy has relied on.

Trump increasingly has expressed agitation and anxiety about the looming decision in a case he says is one of the most important in U.S. history.

He has said it would be a “disaster” for the United States if the justices fail to overturn lower court rulings that found he went too far in using an emergency powers law to put his tariffs in place. Trump has suggested he may take the highly unusual step of attending the arguments in person.




The Justice Department, in its defense of the tariffs, has highlighted the expansive way Trump has used them, arguing that the trade penalties are part of his power over foreign affairs, an area where the courts should not second-guess the president.

Earlier this year, two lower courts and most judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found that Trump did not have power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to set tariffs — a power the Constitution grants to Congress. Some dissenting judges on the court, though, said the 1977 law allows the president to regulate imports during emergencies without specific limitations.

The courts left the tariffs in place while the Supreme Court considers the issue. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to wield them as he has tried to pressure or punish other countries on matters related — and unrelated -- to trade.

“The fact of the matter is that President Trump has acted lawfully by using the tariff powers granted to him by Congress in IEEPA to deal with national emergencies and to safeguard our national security and economy,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. “We look forward to ultimate victory on this matter with the Supreme Court.”

Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the Trump trade team is working on contingency plans should the high court rule against the Republican administration.

“We do have backup plans,” Leavitt said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures.” “But ultimately…we are hopeful that the Supreme Court will rule on the right side of the law and do what's right for our country. The importance of this case cannot be overstated. The president must have the emergency authority to utilize tariffs.”

Modern presidents have used financial sanctions such as freezing assets or blocking trade, not tariffs, for their foreign policy and national security aims, said Josh Lipsky, a former Obama White House and State Department staffer who is now the international economics chair at the Atlantic Council.

There are other laws that presidents can use to impose tariffs. But they require a monthslong process to justify the rates.

Trump, citing the IEEPA, moves faster and more dramatically. He signs executive orders imposing new rates and fires off social media posts threatening additional import taxes, as he did in late October when he was angered by an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.

“Presidents have typically treated tariffs as a scalpel, not a sledgehammer,” Lipsky said.

In contrast, Trump has used tariffs as the backbone of his national security and foreign policy agenda, Lipsky said. “All of it is interconnected and tariffs are at the heart of it,” he said.

For example, earlier this year Trump had threatened a 30% tariff on European imports, a major increase from 1.2% before he took office. Seeking to secure Trump's support for the NATO military alliance and for security guarantees for Ukraine in its war with Russia, the European Union struck a deal to settle for 15% tariffs.

The EU Commission faced criticism from businesses and member states for giving away too much. But Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič argued the settlement was “not only about the trade. It's about security. It's about Ukraine.”

Trump has been able “to use it in specific circumstances to get better deals — not just trade deals — but better deals overall than he might otherwise,” Lipsky said. “On the other hand, you would say there's probably some backlash.”

Trump's tariff strong-arming has rattled relationships with America's friends and foes. Some have responded by becoming more protectionist or looking to foster relations with China, which has tried to be seen as a promoter of free trade.

There also is the impact on pocketbook. Some businesses have passed on some of the costs to consumers by raising prices, while others have waited to see where tariff rates end up.

Tariffs traditionally have been used just as a tool to address trade practices. 

“There's literally no precedent for the manner that President Trump is using them,” said Emily Kilcrease, who was a deputy assistant U.S. trade representative and earlier worked on trade issues at the National Security Council as a career civil servant during the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations,

“The use of tariffs the way that President Trump is using them is like — just broadscale attack on an economy as a way to incentivize a foreign government to change their posture,” said Kilcrease, now a director at the Center for a New American Security think tank.

But she said the case is not clear-cut. Kilcrease said she thinks there is a “decent chance” the Supreme Court could side with Trump because IEEPA gives the president “broad, flexible emergency powers.”

The case is also coming before a Supreme Court that has thus far been reluctant to check to Trump's wide-ranging use of executive powers.

If the court constrains Trump, it could leave foreign governments questioning whether to try to renegotiate trade agreements recently struck with the Trump administration, experts said. But there are political realities at play too, because reneging on deals could affect other foreign policy or economic priorities. 

The administration could pivot to try to use other laws to justify the tariffs, though that could mean a more complex and bureaucratic process, Kilcrease said.

“It certainly doesn't take tariffs off the table,” she said. “It just makes them a little bit slower.”

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Concerns that antisemitism is on the rise among Republicans burst to the surface this weekend, turning a conference of the nation's leading Jewish Republicans from jubilation over a tenuous ceasefire in the Middle East into a clarion call to stem the spread of anti-Jewish voices within the party. 

The emerging schism was laid bare by a prominent conservative think tank president's defense of talk show host Tucker Carlson's controversial decision to welcome a far-right activist with antisemitic views onto his podcast Thursday, and Carlson's hesitation to challenge some of his views. It prompted nearly every speaker who took the podium at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual conference in Las Vegas to call for rooting out anti-Jewish elements in the GOP.

Still, the meeting's proceedings sent a clear signal that the Republican Party has work to do to reconcile views within its ranks about the path forward for Israel in its relationship with the United States, its staunchest ally. But the voices speaking from the podium Friday and Saturday were united in their condemnation of antisemitism.

“We are at this point in what I consider sort of the early stages of an undeclared civil war within the Republican Party, as it relates to Israel, and antisemitism and the Jewish community,” Republican Jewish Coalition leader Matthew Brooks said in an interview with The Associated Press.




Brooks and the dozens of other speakers who condemned antisemitism within the GOP from the stage before an audience of about 1,000 in the Venetian Resort ballroom in Las Vegas set an ominous tone that cut into the air of celebration many had anticipated over the October ceasefire. 

Brooks had planned to fold some of his concerns into the three-day, annual conference of Republican Jewish elected officials, fundraisers, media personalities and activists. But comments made just before the meeting by Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts denying the conservative group was “distancing itself” from Carlson — a former Fox News host and powerful voice on the right — after his podcast hosted Nick Fuentes prompted a sudden pivot. 

Fuentes has said the Holocaust was exaggerated, and that he believes in a global Jewish conspiracy. Carlson has espoused a white supremacist ideology called the “great replacement theory,” which says people of color are replacing white people and that Jews are furthering the change. 

The video of Roberts' comments sparked outrage from some Heritage staffers, senators and conservative activists. But they also reflect increasing skepticism toward Israel and of Jews among some on the right, complicating GOP efforts to cast the Democratic Party as antisemitic.

For months The Republican Jewish Coalition has been uneasy about Carlson, who has criticized U.S. support for Israel in its war with Hamas and has come under fire for his own far-right views. One is his opposition to Christian Zionism, the belief that some evangelical Christians interpret the Bible as promising the land of Israel eternally to the Jews, thus viewing Israel as belonging to the Jewish people. 

Brooks had named others for contributing to the schism, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and conservative social media figure Candace Owens.

“And it's really going to be our challenge going forward to combat that before it has a chance to grow and metastasize in the Republican Party,” Brooks told the AP. 

That challenge was met by a steady chorus from the podium. 

“Sadly, we're seeing antisemitism on the fringes of our own party,” Tennessee Rep. David Kustoff lamented.

Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida later proclaimed: “In our party we will not tolerate antisemitism.” 

Sen. Lindsay Graham sought to lighten the mood, calling himself a member of the “Hitler-sucks wing of the Republican Party,” prompting laughter. But even as he injected humor, the South Carolina Republican downplayed the threat Fuentes and others pose to the GOP. 

“You can sit in a basement with weird people and say weird things. It's a free country, right?” he added. “But if you ever run for office as a Republican, and you embrace this weird s(asterisk)(asterisk)(asterisk), we're going to beat your brains out.” 

Fuentes, who is 27, has 1 million followers on the social media platform X, and his following is generations younger than Graham, who is 70. Brooks said the leak of a series of TeleGram text messages from National Young Republican leaders in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont praising Hitler, joking about gas chambers and other atrocities, which was published last month by Politico, is a symptom of the division he and the coalition are trying to contain. 

Perhaps that is why dozens of college-age Jewish Republicans attended the conference, cheekily waving red signs emblazoned with “Tucker is not MAGA,” a reference to President Donald Trump's Make-America-Great-Again mantra, during Florida Congressman Randy Fine's presentation. 

There was joy at the event, notably over the release of Israeli hostages, many held for more than two years since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, prompting two years of brutal retaliation in Gaza. 

“I'm sure many of you have spent the last few weeks watching with joy and tears the joyful of Israel's resilient heroes, reuniting with their loved ones,” said Norm Coleman, a former Minnesota Senator and chairman of the coalition's board. “It has been a deeply emotional time for all Jewry.” 

And the testimonials to Trump came from nearly all speakers, praising the Republican president for his role in brokering the ceasefire that resulted in the returned hostages. 

When an image of Trump was cast on screens in the ballroom, the audience rose in cheers to hear his recorded 5-minute address to the group, in which he declared, “No one has been a greater friend to Israel than Donald J. Trump.”

But even enthusiasm over his role was tempered by questions about the terms of the ceasefire, which required Hamas to disarm, disband and have no role in the future of Gaza. Several coalition members saw it as unlikely to hold, especially in light of Israel's renewed strikes in Gaza after it claimed Hamas had violated the ceasefire terms by firing on Israeli soldiers. 

Board member Bobby Schostak of Michigan suggested a lasting peace was possible but would take years. 

“I think we're some distance away from that,” he said. 

Coleman was even more grim, suggesting that Hamas still must be completely eradicated. 

“If they are still part of the equation,” he said. “I think it's going to be very difficult to hold.”

For more than two weeks now during the government shutdown, Imelda Avila-Thomas has been trying in vain to get approved for unemployment compensation to help cover essentials such as food and mortgage payments for her family while she's on unpaid furlough from her federal government job. 

She kept asking questions and was ultimately sent a hyperlink to upload proof-of-income documents, which she did earlier this week. But Avila-Thomas, who works for the Department of Labor in San Antonio, said the system still deems her ineligible for benefits, saying it cannot verify her wages. She wonders whether someone who might help her has also been furloughed.

A mother of a 12-year-old daughter and local union leader, Avila-Thomas is among the thousands of furloughed federal workers trying to navigate the unemployment system — a sharp increase, but still a fraction of the 670,000-plus furloughed workforce, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. The dollar amounts and length of benefits vary by state.

About 26,000 federal workers filed initial claims from Sept. 28 through Oct. 18, according to raw data published by the Department of Labor. Some 3,300 applied in the week that ended days before the Oct. 1 shutdown start.

Furloughed workers have some factors to consider. For instance, if they receive back pay as expected when the shutdown ends, they would need to repay the unemployment aid. For Avila-Thomas, refunding the money later is preferable to taking on debt. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Avila-Thomas has worked at the Labor Department for 16 years. Her husband is a disabled veteran who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs and is still working with pay, but they have had to cut back on tutoring for their daughter, who has dyslexia, and with one income now, they've gone to a food bank.




“This would cover that — the essential basics,” said Avila-Thomas, whose local American Federation of Government Employees covers Labor Department workers in several states. “And yes, in an ideal world, everybody would have six months worth of savings. And the reality is, most of our members are coming to that point where they could no longer pay those regular bills.”

She has applied for part-time work and said she isn't looking for a handout.

Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees relies heavily on state laws and processing.

The specifics vary. Massachusetts has a high-end weekly benefit of $1,105 per week for up to 30 weeks. In Mississippi, it's no more than $235 weekly for up to 26 weeks. Roughly half the states pay less than $600 a week maximum, according to U.S. Department of Labor numbers. 

Not everyone gets the maximum weekly rate. Some states offer fewer than 20 weeks. And the limits can grow in some states when unemployment rates are particularly high.

Around the nation's capital, the maximum weekly payment is $444 in Washington, D.C., $430 in Maryland and $378 in Virginia.

In Texas, where Avila-Thomas lives, the weekly maximum is $605, for up to 26 weeks.

States normally issue payments within two to three weeks after someone's claim is approved, the Labor Department says. And most states also have an initial “waiting week” for which benefits are not paid upfront. Beneficiaries typically receive money for that week only later, if they exhaust all the weeks they're allotted, the National Employment Law Project says. 

States are responsible for verifying an applicant's job and earnings with their federal employer. But the Department of Labor has warned that the shutdown may delay processing of this information by federal agencies. 

Many workers have not received forms normally sent by their employing agencies that are used to verify employment and earnings, according to the National Employment Law Project.

Questions have come up about states' varying requirements that people prove they are job hunting while receiving unemployment checks. The Labor Department has said waivers of the requirement may apply for the furloughed federal workers under state laws, noting they face ethics limits on outside work. And some states have specified that work-search mandates won't apply to these workers, waiving them for several weeks or longer.

But in Texas, Avila-Thomas said she has not received a clear answer. Many of her job matches could present a conflict of interest, she said. The Texas Workforce Commission did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the work requirement for those workers.

About 730,000 federal employees have kept working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, and they are generally not eligible for unemployment benefits. They will receive back pay after the government is reopened. Workers on reduced hours could be eligible for unemployment.

“Excepted” employees working without pay are typically necessary to respond to emergencies or ensure national security, such as air traffic controllers and airport security screeners.

The Trump administration has said pay will continue for some groups, including FBI special agents and military troops. Paychecks never stopped for some other workers whose departments, such as the Postal Service, rely on their own revenues or certain other funding sources.

There have been other wrinkles specific to how this administration has handled the shutdown, as well.

Earlier in October, the Trump administration threatened that back pay for furloughed federal workers would not be guaranteed, though he later backtracked on it. Trump has also sought to lay off more than 10,000 federal workers during the shutdown. A judge has blocked the layoffs while a lawsuit challenging them plays out.

Avila-Thomas said workers like her are ready for the shutdown to end.

“We're ready to get back,” she said. “I think I've driven my family crazy with things and projects.” ___

NEW YORK (AP) — In one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the nation, a line stretched along the side of the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen and Pantry.

Willy Hilaire is homeless, unemployed and 63. He lives in a New York shelter with his two grandchildren and often goes hungry so that they can eat the food he gets from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 

On many days, Hilaire's only food is a hot meal he gets from Holy Apostles in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. With SNAP at risk, he worries there won't be enough for him and the children, forcing more sacrifice.

“I always tell them, ‘Grandpa is there for you,'” he said. “‘Whatever I have, I'll give it to you.'”

Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump's administration must continue to fund SNAP, the nation's biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown. But officials said it was too late to stop recipients from losing benefits on Saturday and that restoring them could likely take at least one week.




One in eight Americans use SNAP but its halt will disproportionately hurt Black Americans like Hilaire. Black people are 13.7% of the population but 25.7% of SNAP recipients. Other racial groups get SNAP at rates lower than their overall share of the population.

Historians and advocates say that's an example of what's known as systemic racism. There may be no formally racist policy at play but America's long history of racism — from slavery to unfair zoning rules — has left Black communities with a series of structural disadvantages, and far less wealth accumulated over generations.

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

White people are nearly 75% of the population but just 35.4% of SNAP recipients, the latest data show.




Meanwhile, Black Americans are just 13.7% of the country but more than a quarter of SNAP recipients, the largest overrepresentation of any ethnic or racial group.

Hispanic people are underrepresented in the SNAP statistics. Asian Americans are overrepresented but much less than Black Americans. And Native Americans get SNAP at basically the same rate that their group is in the general population. 

Asian Americans living in poverty face constraints like lack of English fluency and neighborhood gentrification. In New York City, 253,000 of the 1.5 million Asian residents use SNAP, according to the nonprofit Asian American Federation. Over 91% of them work. But, with limited English proficiency, many are limited in their job opportunities, said CEO Catherine Chen. Families who have lived comfortably in cultural enclaves like Chinatown for one or two generations are getting priced out.

A majority of adult SNAP recipients who can work, do. Some still qualify for SNAP — typically $187 a month — despite holding down one or more jobs, according to nonprofit advocates. They're often low-wage jobs without benefits like paid sick days. 

A report by the National Urban League last year found that the racial income gap has been virtually unchanged for more than 20 years, with Black Americans making 64% of the income of white people, on average. 

“There's so much discrimination in the work force, so much discrimination in America today, that Black people who were enslaved and segregated for 350 years are still fighting for economic parity,” said Marc Morial, president of the civil rights group. “While we have a growing number of African Americans, middle-class Americans, we still have a disproportionate number of poor (Black) Americans.”

At the current pace, it would take anywhere from one to three centuries for most Black Americans to achieve parity with their white peers, depending on where they live, according to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.

This year Black unemployment rose from 6.2% to 7.5%, the highest level since October 2021. Black homeownership fell to the lowest level in four years, according to an analysis by the real estate brokerage Redfin. The Census Bureau found the median Black household income fell 3.3% last year to $56,020. That's around $36,000 less than what a white household earns.

The looming absence of grocery dollars would almost certainly make it harder for families to afford rent, gas and other expenses. Even if SNAP benefits are restored before November ends, nonprofit leaders say low-income residents could face financial setbacks into next year. 

For tribal nations, food and nutrition assistance programs are part of the U.S. government's trust and treaty responsibilities — the government's legal and moral obligations to fund tribes' health and well-being. The U.S. promised to uphold those rights in exchange for the land and resources it took from Indigenous peoples.

However, those rights continue to be chronically underfunded and uniquely vulnerable to government shutdowns, according to a report released last week by the Brookings Institution. The study found that in 2024, more than two-thirds of trust and treaty responsibilities were funded through discretionary spending, meaning they are not guaranteed during a shutdown. It also noted that one of the largest sources of mandatory spending owed to tribes comes in the form of SNAP benefits.

Another U.S. Department of Agriculture program that provides food to income-eligible Native American households, the Food Distribution Program in Indian Reservations, is still operating. But Native Americans already enrolled in SNAP cannot participate in that program. FDPIR President Mary Greene-Trottier said in October that her agency asked USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn for a waiver, which the agency has granted for November, according to a letter Greene-Trottier received on Friday.

She she expects to see a substantial increase in demand for her program once SNAP benefits are shut off. 

“I've heard the pleas from the people in the community and outside the community that are just really concerned with not having enough food to eat and the choices between paying medical bills or utility bills that are increasing,” Greene-Trottier said.

“I can't say this loud enough, but this is the weaponization of food again,” she said, a reference to the U.S. government's historic policies of withholding or cutting off food supplies to starve out tribal nations during the country's expansion.

Meanwhile, tribal nations across the country — including Spirit Lake Nation, Cherokee Nation, Blackfeet Nation, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Shawnee Tribe — declared states of emergency ahead of the loss of SNAP benefits.

The disproportionate need for food stamps among non-white households has contributed to misinformation and stereotypes. Starting in the 1960s the term “welfare queen” became popular, playing to assumptions that poor people of color were profiting off government assistance rather than looking for work.

But two-thirds of the over 40 million SNAP beneficiaries are people you wouldn't expect to work. Thirty-nine percent are children, 20% are elderly and 10% are children or non-elderly adults with disabilities, according to the Urban Institute. 

Pastor Cleo Lewis, who usually conducts street ministry in Phoenix, organized a food drive for the first time to cushion the blow as much as possible for the 30 families he counsels at a local shelter

“We usually are dealing with areas that are spiritually related,” Lewis said. “Now we're having to increase our presence, and dealing with issues of substance and material issues that we know are significant, but we relied on other professionals to deal with this.”

Speaking at a meeting of ASEAN leaders in Malaysia, Pete Hegseth labelled Chinese actions in the disputed waterway “provocative” and said they show a lack of respect for their neighbours.

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Sunday that Washington and Beijing would establish military-to-military communications channels, adding that bilateral ties between the countries have “never been better.”

Hegseth said he spoke with his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, late Saturday on the sidelines of a regional security meeting and that they agreed that “peace, stability and good relations are the best path for our two great and strong countries.”

His remarks posted on X came hours after he urged Southeast Asian nations to stand firm and strengthen their maritime forces to counter China's increasingly “destabilizing” actions in the South China Sea.

“China's sweeping territorial and maritime claims in the South China Sea fly in the face of their commitments to resolve disputes peacefully,” Hegseth said at a meeting with his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on Saturday. 

“We seek peace. We do not seek conflict. But we must ensure that China is not seeking to dominate you or anybody else,” he added.

The South China Sea remains one of Asia's most volatile flashpoints. Beijing claims almost the entire region, while ASEAN members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei also claim ownership of coastal areas and features. The Philippines, a key U.S. ally, has had frequent clashes with China's maritime fleet. 

Manila has repeatedly urged a stronger regional response, but ASEAN has traditionally sought to balance caution with economic ties to Beijing, the region's largest trading partner.

Hegseth said on X he also spoke with President Donald Trump and they agreed “the relationship between the U.S. and China has never been better.” Trump's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea earlier this week “set the tone for everlasting peace and success for the U.S. and China,” added Hegseth, who left Malaysia on Sunday for Vietnam.




The contrasting messages — a sharp warning at the ASEAN meeting followed by conciliatory language online — underscored Washington's effort to balance deterrence with diplomacy amid rising tensions with Beijing.

“This is damage control. More importantly, it reflects two different currents in U.S. relations with China — one that sees China as a threat and another a possible partner,” said Southeast Asian political analyst Bridget Welsh.

In his meeting on Saturday, Hegseth criticized Beijing's recent declaration of the Scarborough Shoal — seized from the Philippines in 2012 — as a “nature reserve.” He told the meeting it was “yet another attempt to coerce new and expanded territorial and maritime claims at your expense.”

He urged ASEAN to hasten the conclusion of a long-delayed Code of Conduct being negotiated with China to govern behavior in the sea. He also proposed developing shared maritime surveillance and rapid-response systems to deter provocation. A “shared maritime domain awareness” network, he said, would ensure that any member facing “aggression and provocation is not alone.”

He also welcomed plans for an ASEAN-U.S. maritime exercise in December to strengthen regional coordination and uphold freedom of navigation.

China rejects U.S. criticism of its maritime conduct, accusing Washington of interfering in regional affairs and provoking tensions through its military presence. Chinese officials say their patrols and construction activities are lawful and aimed at maintaining security in what they consider Chinese territory.

Chinese officials Saturday slammed the Philippines for being a “troublemaker” after Manila staged naval and air drills with the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in the South China Sea. The two-day exercise that ended Friday was the 12th that the Philippines says it has carried out with partner nations since last year to protect its rights in the disputed waters.

Tian Junli, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army Southern Theater Command, said the exercise seriously undermined regional peace and stability. “It further proves that the Philippines is the troublemaker in the South China Sea issue and a saboteur of regional stability,” he said.

ESPN broadcasters Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit poked fun at Oklahoma Sooners kicker Tate Sandell's shorts during the team's win against the Tennessee Volunteers.

Sandell came into the game to attempt a 51-yard field goal in the second quarter and his gameday attire became the topic of conversation. Fowler said the short shorts were ""no longer frowned upon in the sport."" Herbstreit replied, ""It is for me.""

""That should be a penalty. Just dressing like that should be a penalty,"" Herbstreit added. ""What the hell is it? Wearing shorts out there?""

Sandell nailed the field goal to give Oklahoma a 13-10 lead with 1:09 left in the first half.

""Got his Daisy Dukes on and puts it right down the middle again,"" Herbstreit said.

Short shorts or not, Sandell was money the entire night. He was 4-for-4 on field goal attempts, with a 55-yarder being his longest of the night. He also made all three of his extra-point attempts.

After an antisemitism watchdog posted a new video warning about socialist efforts to take over the Democratic Party from within, socialist leaders from across the country embraced the video and its message, appearing unafraid of such accusations. 

The Canary Mission's advertisement included recorded remarks from various leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) describing their opposition to, and in some cases ""hatred"" of the Democratic Party, which one speaker says must be torn down. The video also shared remarks from DSA leaders describing how the Democratic Party, which one of the socialist speakers in the video referred to as ""toxic,"" can be used as a ""tool"" to push forward their aims of destroying the current capitalist society we live in.

At the center of the ad was something Canary Mission referred to as the ""cuckoo analogy.""

""In nature, the cuckoo survives by trickery. It lays its egg in another bird's nest. The unsuspecting parents raise the impostor as their own until the cuckoo grows strong enough to push the true chicks out,"" the video's narrator explains. ""The DSA is the cuckoo inside the Democratic Party.""

But the analogy, which pointed to candidates like self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani, did not appear to bother the socialists it was targeting. Rather, they applauded the video advertisement as a great recruitment tool to get more people to join their ranks.

""New DSA recruitment ad for communists just dropped,"" joked Nicolás Vargas in response to the video. Vargas has been affiliated with the Central Brooklyn branch of the DSA, according to a 2022 DSA national convention resolution on COVID protections. 

""Are you trying to make young people find the DSA more cool?"" quipped Marxist-socialist blogger C. Derrick Varn.

""New recruitment ad unlocked,"" joked Giovanetta Marangoz, co-chair of the New York City Young Democratic Socialists of America. 

Other socialist activists were a little more direct in their view that the Democratic Party must be extinguished.  

""My biggest gripe is the idea that we're being deceptive,"" Allan Frasheri, an at-large delegate to the 2023 DSA Convention who spent time as a co-chair of the University of Florida's DSA chapter, said in response to the video. ""DSA is loud and proud: we are fighting for a worker's party. Only a party of, by and for working people can bring about a better world. The Democratic Party is ultimately one for the billionaires.""

MAMDANI FORCED TO ADDRESS UNEARTHED VIDEO EXPOSING VILE NYPD COMPARISON 

""This is the best DSA ad I've ever seen,"" added DSA organizer Miko Ludoviko. ""The DSA is an anti-capitalist organization with the long-term goal of taking state power. The Democratic Party is a tool we use for local elections, but it remains an enemy of the working class.""

Part of Canary Mission's video focused on New York City's Mamdani, who is running for New York City mayor on the Democratic Party's ticket. He beat out former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic Party primary earlier this year to be the party's candidate. Cuomo is now running as an Independent.  

Mamdani, who is a member of DSA's NYC chapter, brought several DSA members on stage during a ""New York Is Not For Sale"" rally last week. He was also a keynote speaker at the group's national convention in 2023 while serving as a New York state representative.

DSA has admitted to closely collaborating with Mamdani's campaign, including regularly holding meetings with his team.

""With Zohran, we're in basically the best possible position to seize state power that we can be in because, you know, we're like this,"" Goulden said during an August DSA panel, indicating with his fingers that the campaign and organization are very close. Goulden went on to suggest that ""one of the things that made Zohran really successful with his policy rollouts is specifically relying on DSA.""

""We wrote the platform with him. The team was so happy to work with us on this,"" he explained. ""What we explicitly wanted to do was use the power of New York City to provide free gender-affirming care – and I say free in case insurance companies decide to boot us off – free gender-affirming care, not just to people in New York City, but across the country.""

In addition to the responses to Canary Mission's new video, other messaging materials the pro-Israel group has put out, such as a graphic slamming socialists for attempting to ""weaken and ultimately dismantle"" the United States, have similarly been met with praise by DSA socialists. 

For example, in response to a Canary Mission graphic exposing DSA's Red Star Caucus for their stated goal of striving to ""weaken and ultimately dismantle US empire,"" a user on X, who describes themselves as ""DSA's favorite Maoist,"" remarked that the slogan Canary Mission was calling out ""needs to be the line of the DSA as a whole.""

""I will use every tool at my disposal to make it so,"" they added.

""That's right,"" another X user with the handle ""centristmarxist"" said in response to a second graphic slamming DSA's Marxist Unity Group for their stated goal. ""With every tool available to us, we must erode the political, cultural, and physical hegemony of the U.S. police state.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the DSA for comment, but did not receive a response.

Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin tells Fox News Digital that the possibility of far left and moderates winning big on Election Day shows ""the great breadth of our party.""

Zohran Mamdani appears to be on the verge of becoming the next mayor of the nation's most populous city.

And a victory by the 34-year-old democratic socialist state lawmaker from New York City would capsulize the rise of the far left in the Democratic Party.

While plenty of Democrats are fearful of the political consequences and how it would fuel Republican efforts to make a Mayor Mamdani the face of a Democratic Party aiming to usher in socialism, Ken Martin isn't concerned.

""What it shows is the great breadth of our party,"" the chair of the Democratic National Committee said in a one-on-one interview with Fox News Digital this week in Philadelphia as he crisscrossed the 2025 campaign trail.

FIVE KEY RACES TO WATCH IN NEXT WEEK'S ELECTIONS

A likely Mamdani win in New York City, where he holds a double-digit lead in the polls, may be coupled with potential victories by moderate Democrats Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia in the only two states this year to hold gubernatorial elections.

""We have conservative Democrats, we have centrist Democrats, we have progressives and we have leftists. And I've always said that you win elections through addition, not subtraction. You win by bringing people into your coalition and growing your party,"" Martin touted.

'DEMOCRATS ARE NERVOUS' ABOUT POTENTIAL ZOHRAN MAMDANI VICTORY, NEW REPORT WARNS

Martin acknowledged that Democrats ""don't agree on everything. There's a lot of different ideas on how to accomplish our goals, but we're unified around those goals. We're unified around making sure that people's lives are more affordable and that we can create an economy that works for everyone in this country. We're unified in stopping Donald Trump in his authoritarian margin, his shredding of our Constitution.""

As Democrats work to escape the political wilderness after last year's stunning election setbacks, when the party lost control of the White House and Senate and failed to win back the House majority, Republicans portray their rivals as a leaderless party being held hostage by the far left.

But Martin spotlighted his party's diversity, saying, ""Whether you're a far-left Democrat or a conservative Democrat, or anything in between, everyone's welcome into this big tent party of ours.""

The Republican National Committee took issue with the Democrats' big tent.

""Ken Martin's so-called ‘big tent' Party includes communists, antisemites, and illegal aliens, while apparently the only people who aren't welcome are hardworking American families. The inmates are now running the asylum in the Democrat Party, which is why the DNC is broke and proudly backing a communist for mayor of New York City,"" RNC national press secretary Kiersten Pels claimed in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Martin, pointing to the Republican Party, argued that they ""basically have one ideology and do not allow for any dissent.""

Martin was interviewed a few days after a new center-left group named ""Welcome,"" in their inaugural report, argued that left-leaning ideas and rhetoric have badly weakened the Democratic Party. And the group urged Democrats to jettison some of the party's progressive language about race and LGBTQ issues. The news was first reported by Semafor.

Asked for his take, Martin said he had yet to read the report, but he did emphasize that ""the Democratic Party can walk and chew gum at the same time.""

""We can both focus on a core economic message that gives people in this country a sense that we're going to fight for their economic future, that they'll have an opportunity to get ahead... and also, at the same time, stand up and fight for our values. Make sure that no one gets left behind. Make sure that... people who are being harassed or bullied or pushed out of the conversation are protected.""

New York Post columnist Douglas Murray assesses the state of Britain's government, economy and society on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.'

U.K. police offered new details about victims and suspects following Saturday night's stabbing spree aboard a train in Huntigdon, Cambridgeshire.

Multiple patients remain in life-threatening condition after the stabbing, which left at least 11 people wounded. Police say the suspects were ""born in the U.K.,"" and remain in custody as of Sunday morning.

""This is a shocking incident and my thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families,"" British Transport Police Superintendent John Loveless said in a statement.

Loveless described the two suspects as, ""32-year-old man, a black British national, and a 35-year-old man, a British national of Caribbean descent."" They were both arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, he said.

Loveless added that nine people were reported initially to have life-threatening injuries, but most have since recovered.

""Following assessment and treatment, four have been discharged and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition,"" Loveless said.

""We declared a major incident yesterday and Counter Terrorism Policing were initially supporting our investigation, however, at this stage there is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident. This is a British Transport Police investigation. We continue work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident. At this early stage it would not be appropriate to speculate on the causes of the incident,"" he added.

Israel has confirmed that three more bodies recently returned by Hamas are not those of hostages taken by the terrorist group over two years ago.

Hamas handed over the remains of three people on Friday, as part of its obligations under the Gaza ceasefire struck last month. None of those are of the remaining hostages that Hamas has yet to return, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Saturday.

“The remains we received are not our hostages,” the office said, without providing any more information.

Israel's confirmation is the latest instance of Hamas's failure to uphold its duties under the ceasefire, the first phase of which required the terrorist group to release all living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of it taking effect.

Nearly a month later, 11 hostage remains are still due to be returned to Israel, and pressure is mounting.

President Donald Trump's patience has worn thin with the pace of the release, with him recently warning of potential action from other countries if Hamas did not move quickly.

NEWARK, New Jersey — Those thinking former President Barack Obama no longer has electoral influence in New Jersey would find that opinion challenged on Saturday night in Newark. 

Long lines wrapped around the venue, hundreds of smiling faces, and the deafening cheers at the mere mention of his name dominated the energy inside the Essex County College gymnasium, where Obama took the stage to rally support for Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), the Democratic candidate in Tuesday's gubernatorial race. 

He was met by applause, whistles, yells, and excited chants from all corners of the venue. Much to the delight of attendees, he came equipped with his trademark dry humor jokes and a repeated line telling people, “Don't boo. Go vote.”

His message for the evening? Elections matter.

“If you meet this moment, if you believe change can happen, you will not just elect Mikie Sherrill your next governor, you will not just put New Jersey on a path to a brighter future, you will set a glorious example for this nation,” Obama told hundreds of supporters who started lining up around the block early in the morning ahead of the rally. 

Obama said Sherrill will build a “stronger, brighter future” for New Jersey that will spread “light” across the country.

“Lord knows, we need that light. We need that inspiration. Because, let's face it, our country and our politics are in a pretty dark place right now,” Obama said. 

“We need leaders like Mikie, public servants who are in it for the right reasons, who are focused on the future, and who will always stay connected to the people that they were elected to serve. Her opponent? Not so much,” he continued.

Sherrill is facing Republican Jack Ciattarelli in the race for the open governor's mansion to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy (D-NJ). Though the congresswoman held a sizable lead for most of the general election season, recent polling shows her in a dead heat with Ciattarelli — hence the last-minute rally effort with the former president and other high-profile senators leading up to Election Day.

Obama's stop in Newark came a few hours after he stumped for former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Norfolk, Virginia, who is also running for governor on Nov. 4.

His endorsement of Sherrill will test whether he still holds considerable sway over the Democratic electorate and can influence voters who sat out the 2024 election to come out in an off-cycle year to cast a ballot. He lent his voice to radio and digital ads leading up to Saturday's rally. 

He said Sherrill is among the “tough people” he's met in his life, noting her military background as a pilot, work as a federal prosecutor, and life as a mother.

“Apparently, that was a little bit too easy. She decides to run for Congress. I get tired just thinking about it,” Obama quipped.

During the speech, he acknowledged that people voted for Trump in the last election because they were “understandably frustrated with inflation and high gas prices and the difficulty of affording a home, and they were worried about their children's futures.” He also noted that in 2024, he heard from many people who told him the election “didn't matter.” 

“If nothing else, these nine months should have cured us of that idea, because the stakes are now clear,” he said. “We don't need to speculate about the dangers to our democracy. They're here.”

“It's not as if we did not see some of this coming,” Obama added. “I'll admit it's worse than even I expected. But I did warn y'all.” 

He poked fun at the GOP's cracking down on and eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in universities and agencies.

“They never miss a chance to scapegoat minorities and blame DEI for every problem. You got a flat tire? Must be DEI. Your wife kicked you out? Who knew?” Obama said.

He wrapped up his speech by encouraging people to stand with their convictions and reminded them that despite the “dark” emotions being felt by the public, this “contest of ideas, it's not new.” 

“I still believe our best days are ahead of us,” Obama said.

WHO IS MIKIE SHERRILL? MEET THE DEMOCRATIC PICK FOR NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR

Sherrill, who spoke before Obama took the stage, said she understood that New Jersey was a critical crossroads as one of only two gubernatorial races in 2025. 

“We are waging a battle at this very moment for the future of our nation and New Jersey has always answered the call to defend this country and our values,” Sherrill said. 

“In these difficult times, when everything seems to come down to our election, when people across the nation look at me with fear and despair in their eyes, when they asked me, ‘Is New Jersey up for this moment?'” she asked, interrupted by cheers.

“You guys just stole my line — my answer was hell yeah,” Sherill added.

She said her campaign focuses on opportunities for New Jersey, stating that “we believe it doesn't matter who your parents are, it doesn't matter where you were born, you should get a shot.” 

She focused heavily on her plans to install a state of emergency declaration to freeze electricity costs for at least a year after utility costs rose 22% from the previous year. She also spoke to Trump's energy policies, arguing he is “getting rich off the higher utility prices that New Jersey families are being forced to pay,” and the freezing of funds for the Hudson Tunnel project.

“Whether it's Medicaid, the one big beautiful betrayal, or the Gateway Tunnel, guess what? Jack Ciattarelli is nowhere to be found,” Sherrill said. “And when he is forced to talk about it, does he defend New Jersey? Does he commit to buying that money back for New Jersey? Does he say, ‘Hey, I'm serving you no matter what the cost.' No on every single occasion.”

“Jack has decided, I'm going to defend Trump. He even gives Trump an ‘A'. Guess what? I give Trump an ‘F,'” Sherrill said.

Sherrill said as governor, her fight “doesn't and can't end at the border of New Jersey.”

“We've got to take on all those hits coming from Trump and Washington, D.C.,” she said.

“As I stand here, I feel nothing but courage,” she added. “New Jerseyans give me courage, and I'm sure the nation feels that way, too. Courage to make change, to take on special interests, the status quo, the systems that aren't working to deliver for people, for families, to give every kid a shot. So, anger and courage are the daughters of hope.”

Saturday's rally kicked off with speeches from local labor unions and county and state officials, as well as an energetic performance by the local senior citizens' East Orange Silver Steppers dance troupe. 

The featured songs of Saturday's rally were “Hit The Road Jack” by Ray Charles, a knock at Ciattarelli, as well as “Hey Mickey” by Sweet California, a nod to Sherrill.

All speakers had the same message: voters cannot sit by and be complacent in Tuesday's election.

“If you're not in this fight, you're nowhere,” Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said. “You have to be in this fight. You can't be home, you can't be on the sidelines, you can't argue on TV or put things on Twitter. You got to get out. You got to vote.” 

Other big names in Democratic politics took the stage, including Murphy, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), New Jersey's congressional Democratic delegation, and Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin. All pleaded with supporters not to “sit on the sidelines” and instead vote in the Garden State's competitive gubernatorial election on Nov. 4.

Ahead of Obama's appearance, Booker joked, “I miss Obama … and I miss her husband, too.” 

Booker spent his speech blasting the Republican trifecta in Washington, D.C., with the senator calling it “one of the most outrageous periods of American history.” He said President Donald Trump's policies have seeped across state lines, pointing to cuts to Medicaid and immigration operations occurring in cities across the country.

“This is one of those moments — it's a rare one for our state — where this election has become about something so much bigger,” Booker said.

“All over the United States of America, people are looking at New Jersey, and I will tell you right now, we are the people of hope. We are the light that's rising,” he added.

Several of the speakers called Ciattarelli “100% MAGA” — a line Democrats have used for months as Sherrill's campaign has worked to tie the Republican candidate to Trump in order to show that he would be an extension of the administration and won't fight for New Jersey.

Martin said Ciattarelli and Trump are “two sides of the same bad coin.” 

At one point, a supporter required brief medical assistance. Murphy, after calling for first responders, quipped, “I was starting to tell you what the state would look like if Jack were left and then somebody collapsed. Who could blame them?”

Booker also said the election is about “defending New Jersey from Donald Trump and his minions.”

British Transport Police responded to reports of a mass stabbing aboard a train bound for London at around 7:30 p.m. local time. Police said at the time that “multiple people” were stabbed on the train, which was stopped at Huntingdon Station, near Cambridge.

Armed police officers arrested two suspects at the scene shortly after, whose identities have not been disclosed. Of the 10 passengers injured in the attack, nine are suffering from life-threatening injuries.

Witnesses described a chaotic scene, with passengers trampling over each other and hiding in bathrooms during the attack. One witness also told the Times that there was “blood everywhere,” and recalled seeing at least one man with a large knife.

Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is within single digits of socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a new poll revealed.

The poll, conducted by AtlasIntel, has Mamdani leading the race with 40.6% support and Cuomo trailing behind at 34%. Cuomo is just outside the margin of error of plus or minus 3%.

The result is one of the best of the race for Cuomo since his loss in the Democratic primary.

His campaign celebrated the result and said it represented new momentum in the race.

“The gap is closing fast — we can feel it on the ground everywhere from the Bronx to Staten Island. At this rate, we win the race. Keep going strong,” Cuomo said in a statement shared with the Washington Examiner.

“Six points in this election is nothing,” the former governor later told reporters Saturday.

Cuomo also said he believed voters have learned since the primary and don't believe Mamdani's promises.

“What has happened is, in the primary, Zohran got away with his TikTok band and a smile, whatever he said, he smiled, and he had his slogans, ‘Freeze the rent,' ‘Free buses,' ‘Free food,' and that was enough,” Cuomo said.

“What has happened since is people have [found] out what he's about, and there is no free food, and there are no free buses, and he can't raise corporate taxes statewide and dedicate it to New York [City]. That can't happen,” he added.

As of recently, the poll is somewhat of an outlier. Three other recent polls — from Emerson College, Marist University, and Quinnipiac University — showed Mamdani with a 26-point, 16-point, and 10-point lead.

The AtlasIntel poll has one of the largest samplings, 1,587 likely voters, and was conducted from Oct. 25 to 30.

Andrei Roman, the CEO of AtlasIntel, told the New York Post that Mamdani's left-wing policies appear to have motivated voters. “From not being inspirational to being really hated and terrifying people — that's a major difference. That's what's happening with Mamdani,” he said.

“I think Cuomo's chance in this election is to mobilize an anti-Mamdani vote within mostly the moderate Democratic base that voted for him in the primary but also with independents and Republicans and also mobilize a strategic vote by some of Sliwa's voters,” he added.

CUOMO WARNS TRUMP WILL ‘TAKE OVER NEW YORK CITY' IF MAMDANI ELECTED MAYOR

Most polls have shown Mamdani in the lead, and he's favored to win the election. But the socialist has urged his supporters not to get comfortable.

“I continue to be confident, but I never let that confidence become complacency,” he said when asked about the poll.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Figueroa Street in Los Angeles is a hellhole of child prostitution and organized crime. The New York Times feature on this strip calls it “one of the most notorious sex-trafficking corridors in the United States.”

“In the shadows, Figueroa had become more violent,” the New York Times reported. “The younger the girl, the more customers would pay, which meant preteens were often being robbed and assaulted by groups of older girls trying to make quota. The traffickers who governed the street were worse. Tonight Ana was waving at cars in front of a tire shop when a trafficker pulled up on the wrong side of the street, climbed out and beat one of the girls near Ana over the head with a pistol.”

COMPETITION HEATS UP FOR NANCY PELOSI'S SEAT

Girls as young as 12 walk this street and try to fill their nightly quota of six or more tricks. That is, hundreds of men sexually prey on and exploit dozens of teenage girls every night. That this street exists in America is a shame beyond words.

This evil has its source, on one level, simply in evil. Prostitution is often called the world's oldest profession.

But also, Figueroa's hideous industry exists because of policy choices made at the federal, state, and local levels. The California Democratic Party is a leading cause. Its efforts to legislate the sexual revolution into being, its opposition to the rule of law, and its embrace of open borders have all made Figueroa Street possible.

And LA isn't the only place in America where prostitution is thriving thanks to the efforts of liberal politicians and tastemakers.

The states, in our federalist system, are called the laboratory of democracy. The petri dish of Figueroa Street is the result of California Democrats' experiments in dismantling all norms of decency, removing all constraints on sexual perversion and predation, giving some criminals infinite leeway, and attacking organized religion.

San Francisco's Scott Wiener, a liberal Democratic state senator who is running for Congress, is a leader in this progressive crusade.

A central part of his gay-rights efforts in 2022 was passing a bill forcing police to back off of street prostitution. “This Pride Month,” Wiener said, “as we see a surge in violence against and harassment of the LGBTQ community, it is more important than ever to get rid of a law that targets our community.”

Specifically, Wiener's bill legalized loitering for the purpose of prostitution. Wiener argued that gay and transgender people were disproportionately arrested or questioned by police, and so equity required the repeal of the state law that banned loitering for prostitution.

The result was what you would expect, the New York Times reported. The job of the LA police “grew even more challenging when California repealed the law allowing the police to arrest women who loitered with the intent to engage in prostitution. The repeal, known as SB 357, was intended to prevent profiling of Black, brown and trans women based on how they dressed. But when it was implemented in January 2023, the effect was that uniformed officers could no longer apprehend groups of girls in lingerie on Figueroa, hoping to recover minors among them. Now officers needed to be willing to swear they had reason to suspect each girl was underage — but with fake eyelashes and wigs, it was nearly impossible to tell. One girl told vice officers that her trafficker had explained things succinctly: ‘We run Figueroa now,' he said.”

Protecting the lifestyle they wanted to protect, Wiener and other California progressive Democrats also protected the business of pimping out 12-year-olds for sex.

Wiener's LGBT agenda has also included driving religion out of public life. This, too, has harmed children in a way that may have added to the child-prostitution problem.

In 2023, Wiener passed SB 407, which in effect prohibited observant Christians, Jews, and Muslims from adopting or fostering children in California. All foster or adoptive parents under this law must swear they will support a child in identifying as the opposite sex. This could include surgery or hormone treatments to make the child appear as the opposite sex. Also, adoptive and foster parents are forced to support homosexual activity by their children.

About half of the girls on Figueroa Street came from the foster care system, the New York Times reported. Even before SB 407, “California's foster care system was buckling under the weight of demand. There were too many children, too few good homes.” Wiener's law banned millions of California couples from adoptive or foster care, exacerbating the problem.

Democrats' lockdowns also played a role. California, and particularly LA, closed schools longer than most places in the United States, and outlawed all sorts of healthy activity and gatherings.

LA Unified School District barred the schoolhouse doors for 13 months, longer than almost any other district in America. Recreation centers and gyms were all closed through even late 2020, and community leaders realized what the lack of positive outlets would do to children and families.

Local officials defended the draconian lockdowns, saying, “It absolutely is worth it to do everything you can to slow the spread of a deadly virus that wreaks havoc on people's lives.” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) compared his COVID approach favorably to that of Florida and said his harsher lockdowns saved lives.

Figueroa shows some of the long-term costs of those lockdowns. The New York Times reported, “In recent years, the officers had seen the magnitude of child sex trafficking explode. Part of that boom happened during the pandemic, when many girls were out of school and immersed in social media, where traffickers lurked. Teachers who would ordinarily follow up on absences or report signs of neglect could not.”

That's only California. Prostitution and trafficking are problems across the country. And in many states and counties, you can find laws and local policies that explicitly protect prostitution. Behind these rules is often George Soros's money.

Prostitution is illegal in Virginia, but in Fairfax County, the state's most populous municipality, dozens of brothels sell sex in plain view. County Supervisor Pat Herrity said about 80 to 100 “illicit massage businesses” are “operating in plain sight today” in the county, the Fairfax Times reported.

The reason: The Soros-funded prosecutor has policies against prosecuting prostitution cases or cases involving immigrants.

Commonwealth's Attorney Steve Descano was elected in 2022, and his primary source of funding was Soros's Justice and Public Safety PAC.

Soros's nonprofit groups are top lobbyists for the legalization of prostitution. Soros's Open Society Foundations published a book titled 10 Reasons to Decriminalize Sex Work.

Justice for All, another top donor to Descano, funds “legal services and protections to individuals engaged in consensual sex” as part of fighting the “criminalization of sex work.”

This is why an obvious brothel was allowed to operate in a residential neighborhood in Fairfax, steps from a school bus stop, for months. Police told residents, “Our hands are tied,” which clearly meant, The county won't prosecute if we bring prostitution charges. Sure enough, police eventually built a prostitution case and brought charges, which Descano's office promptly dropped. Only action by the state's Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares, drove the brothel out of business.

Likewise, Descano has a policy against pressing charges that could have “immigration consequences.” In practice, that means native-born Americans in Fairfax are more prosecutable. It also means the sex trade, which preys especially on immigrant girls and women, gets largely ignored.

Lax immigration enforcement also fuels the prostitution industry. Women and girls who are trafficked are almost always in desperate situations. Girls in great families could become drug addicts or run away from home, but disproportionately, illegal immigrants or unaccompanied minors end up in these dire straits where they can be exploited.

The Biden administration, starting on its first day, ran an experiment in open borders. It changed policies so that anyone who arrived at the border and claimed asylum could enter the country and stay here (until, theoretically, one day getting an asylum hearing).

The predictable result was a massive influx of illegal immigration, which inevitably fed the black market economy, including prostitution.

In the 1970s, the Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck famously described it as the “most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing.” In a 2012 poll of prominent economists, just 2 percent said that rent-control laws have had “a positive impact” on the “amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing in cities that have used them.” (The Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler sarcastically proposed a follow-up survey question: “Does the sun revolve around the earth?”)

Unsurprisingly, then, economists and policy wonks have almost universally disparaged New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal to “freeze the rent.” Headlines like “Zohran Mamdani's Socialist Housing Plan Could Crash New York's Rickety Rental Market” and “A Rent Freeze Is Not the Answer to New York's Housing Crisis” have proliferated. My colleague Michael Powell, summing up the prevailing expert sentiment, described the proposal (among others) as “magic realism.”

But maybe his proposal is closer to political realism. The expert consensus holds that the way to bring down housing costs is to build more housing; and the best way to do that is to remove the regulatory barriers to a construction boom. When I interviewed Mamdani about his housing plans, however, he emphasized that although more building is necessary, it is not sufficient—or sufficiently fast. “We absolutely have to expedite the process by which we build new housing,” he told me. “But we can't do that unless we also address people's immediate needs.”

In many places, especially those where the housing shortage is most severe, the politics of building new units is toxic. The perceived costs of development often inspire intense opposition while the benefits take years, even decades, to materialize. This dynamic cannot be neatly separated from ideal housing policy. Mamdani argues that “freeze the rent” is not just a way of delivering relief from exorbitant housing costs; it is the only way to get enough voters on board with a growth agenda. A growing body of real-world evidence suggests that he has a point.

The case against rent control is simple and powerful: Housing is too expensive because there isn't enough of it, and rent control makes that shortage worse. Most studies find that, by limiting how much profit developers can earn, rent caps make them less likely to build new housing. Meanwhile, if landlords can't raise rents enough to cover the rising costs of maintaining their existing units, then those apartments will fall into disrepair or be taken off the market.

Among experts, the preferred solution to the housing crisis is to relax regulations around what kinds of housing can be built. But this approach, often called YIMBYism—“Yes in My Backyard”—has some practical problems. One is popularity. Although reams of empirical evidence show that building new homes tends to reduce housing prices in a given area, most city dwellers have the opposite intuition about it. They associate new development with rising rents, a higher cost of living, and displacement of existing residents—also known, collectively, as gentrification—and often oppose new development on those grounds.

Another problem is timing: Even if laws are passed to allow more housing to be built, people won't feel the results for years. “This is the core challenge for the YIMBY worldview,” Christopher Elmendorf, a law professor at UC Davis who has conducted several surveys on voter attitudes toward housing development, told me. “How do you get voters on board with an agenda that violates just about every law of electoral politics?”

One answer, somewhat counterintuitively, might be rent control. In a 2022 paper, the political scientists Anselm Hager, Hanno Hilbig, and Robert Vief used the introduction of a 2019 rent-control law in Berlin to study how access to rent-controlled apartments influenced local attitudes toward housing development. The fact that the new law included an arbitrary cutoff date (it applied only to buildings constructed before January 1, 2014) allowed the authors to create a natural experiment, comparing otherwise-similar tenants in otherwise-similar buildings.

Heading into the experiment, the authors hypothesized that having access to a rent-controlled apartment would keep tenants in their existing units longer and therefore make them more resistant to neighborhood change. Instead, they found the opposite: Residents who lived in rent-controlled apartments were 37 percent more likely to support new local-housing construction than those living in noncontrolled units. (Hilbig cautioned to me that “there is some uncertainty, since the confidence intervals are really large,” but that “the effect is definitely sizable.”) This gap was largest in neighborhoods that had experienced the sharpest rental-price increases over the previous decade. The authors concluded that by guaranteeing price stability, rent control eases residents' fears that new housing will make their current living situation unaffordable. “The takeaway for me is that when people feel protected, when they feel secure, they become much less scared of change,” Hilbig told me.

Rent control is also a clear political winner. Depending on the poll, it garners anywhere from 75 to 85 percent support among voters. In a 2024 survey of 5,000 voters across the country, Elmendorf and his co-authors gave respondents a series of choices between several different state-level policy platforms—each consisting of a random set of positions drawn from 39 different policy issues—and calculated how likely each issue was to cause respondents to switch their support from one platform to another. To the authors' surprise, they found that rent control is, as Elmendorf put it to me, “one of the most important issues in state politics today,” more salient to voters at the state level than even such hot-button issues as immigration and policing. And, unlike the process of building new housing, passing a rent-control law can deliver tangible benefits almost immediately.

Taken together, the Berlin study and Elmendorf's survey suggest that rent control could be very useful to a politician seeking to woo voters, and to make residents more open to new housing development. (This of course still leaves the question of who builds or invests in new housing—more on that in a minute.)  Mamdani seems to understand this dynamic. “Freeze the rent,” his signature proposal, would halt rent increases for people living in the roughly 30 percent of city units designated as “rent stabilized” under law, whose annual rent increases are determined every year by a board appointed by the mayor. (This policy generally does not apply to either existing market-rate units or new units.) But his agenda also includes a commitment to use city funds to build 200,000 new units of housing over 10 years—a target that would slightly exceed the 185,000 new multifamily units of all kinds built in the city from 2010 to 2020. Mamdani has also expressed support for a YIMBY wish list of policies, including streamlining permitting rules, up-zoning wealthy neighborhoods, allowing apartment buildings to be built near transit, and relaxing regulations to allow for cheaper construction.

“It's important that when a New Yorker sees housing constructed in their neighborhood, they know that this is actually part of a larger housing plan,” Mamdani told me, citing both rent control and stronger tenant protections. “And so the arrival of additional neighbors won't be considered something that would then expedite displacement within that same neighborhood.”

Whether Mamdani is capable of pulling off this synthesis, or even willing to try, is unclear. He might not even be able to “freeze the rent” in the first place. The annual price increase of a rent-stabilized apartment is set by the Rent Guidelines Board, a government agency that New York's outgoing mayor, Eric Adams, is reportedly considering packing with appointees who are unlikely to support Mamdani's agenda, and Mamdani might not have the legal authority to replace them.

Perhaps more important, Mamdani has sent mixed signals on just how committed he is to building more market-rate housing. His platform states that he will meet his housing goals by tripling the city's production of “publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes”—an incredibly narrow type of housing that is extremely difficult to produce at scale in New York City. In interviews, Mamdani has hedged on this position, claiming that he has changed his mind on “the role of the private market in housing construction.” Even so, he has continued to send contradictory messages, including his refusal to take a position on several pro-housing ballot measures. “The truth is that no one really knows what he's going to do,” Alex Armlovich, a senior housing analyst at the Niskanen Center and a member of the Rent Guidelines Board, told me. “We're all left staring at these vague, conflicting statements he's made and trying to make sense of them.” (Armlovich said that whether he would vote for a rent freeze would be “context dependent.”)

Setting aside the specifics of New York City government, though, Mamdani may have hit upon a winning political formula for cities and states struggling to respond to the housing crisis. When I put Mamdani's argument about rent control to YIMBY organizers—the people who are working to pass pro-housing laws in cities and states across the country—I expected them to roll their eyes. Instead, they lit up. In nearly every blue state that has passed significant pro-housing legislation, they explained, introducing some form of rent control has been crucial to getting those bills across the finish line. “It was absolutely essential,” Alex Brennan, the executive director of Futurewise, a Washington State think tank that helped spearhead an ambitious housing-reform package that passed in May, told me. “Saying that we're going to have a lot more housing five or 10 years from now isn't enough. Legislators want to know: What happens in the meantime? What are we going to do for those folks whose rents are increasing by double digits every year? We needed an answer for those people.”

Ron Davis: The biggest myth about the YIMBY movement

I heard similar stories from organizers in other states, including California and Oregon. “We've seen this over and over,” Henry Honorof, the director of the coordinating team of Welcoming Neighbors Network, a national umbrella organization for dozens of YIMBY-aligned organizations, told me. “When major expansions in housing availability in blue places succeed, they usually pass alongside tenant protections and rent stabilization.”

The same dynamic appears to apply in New York City. Andrew Fine, the policy director of Open New York, the city's most prominent YIMBY organization, told me that outgoing Mayor Adams's relative success in getting housing built had much to do with the passage of a 2019 law that strengthened tenant protections. The law, Fine said, made progressive legislators more comfortable with pro-building policies. Fine spent much of the 2010s working on housing policy for the city. He watched as concerns around gentrification and displacement stymied dozens of proposed housing projects and efforts to change the city's zoning laws. “That fear pervaded every single housing conversation in the city,” he told me. “We learned very quickly that you're not going to get any support for new housing in an environment where people are scared of being priced out.”

Rent control might be good for getting voters on board with more building, but that doesn't make it good policy on its own. Rent-control laws must be carefully designed to avoid the outcomes that economists have long warned about. Most of the recent state-level rent-control laws, including those in California, Oregon, and Washington, tie their annual rent caps to the overall inflation rate so that landlords can keep up with their own rising costs. These laws also typically allow landlords to raise the rent to the market rate—subject to rent control moving forward—when a tenant moves out, which helps keep those units on the market. Mamdani's rent freeze would have neither of these qualities. (When I pointed that out, he said he was “not blind to the pressure that landlords face” and would find ways to reduce their major expenses, which include insurance premiums, utility bills, and property taxes.)

Rent control can also scare off investors and developers, even if the policy doesn't apply to new construction, as Montgomery County, Maryland, learned when it passed a rent-stabilization law in 2023 only to watch new-housing investment plummet. Avoiding a similar outcome in New York, and other cities, might require some extremely skillful diplomacy, if it can be done at all. “What my investors care about is whether a given political climate is going to be hospitable to their investments not just tomorrow, but five or 10 years from now,” Bruce Fairty, the chief development officer at Cypress Equity Investments, a national housing developer, told me. “A policy like ‘Freeze the rent' would almost certainly have a chilling effect.”

Another risk inherent to pairing a populist, fast-acting policy like freeze the rent with a series of politically tricky, slow-acting technocratic reforms, like eliminate height requirements for single-stair buildings, is that the technocratic reforms might never get done. Making it easier to build new homes requires upsetting powerful actors who benefit from the existing system. Tellingly, Mamdani has refused to take a position on a set of pro-housing New York City ballot measures, on the grounds that he is having “active conversations with labor leaders, elected officials, and other stakeholders.” If Mamdani becomes mayor and can't or won't defy the interest groups that oppose housing reform, housing won't get built. Meanwhile, repealing a rent freeze would be a nightmare for any politician who tries it. Without enough new construction, the housing crisis will only get worse over time, tempting city leaders to engage in even more egregious forms of rent control, which will in turn make building homes even harder. This could trigger the kind of cycle that leads economists to compare rent control to bombing.

So combining rent control with YIMBY policies is no sure thing. But the status quo, in New York and many other cities, is intolerable. The housing crisis has metastasized for years while leaders have failed to figure out the politics needed to address it. If rent control offers a way to break through that impasse, it might be worth the gamble.

Are we too quick to agree on the dangers of consensus?

The Trump administration is by its own account devoted to stamping out obesity, cancer, and many other chronic diseases in America. But its public-health officials are also attuned to a very different sort of threat: a faulty cast of mind. “Groupthink is the fundamental problem,” said National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya in May. The nation's scientific institutions have become hidebound.

According to Bhattacharya, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and other top figures in the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, the pandemic brought this problem to the point of crisis. A small group of elite scientists settled upon the use of masks and lockdowns to fight the coronavirus. They closed ranks around their strategies and expelled dissenters. All of this was classic groupthink, the MAHA crowd has argued: a psychological phenomenon that occurs when people's tendency to go along with the crowd prevents them from considering other courses of action. As a result, in their view, the public-health response to the coronavirus turned into catastrophe. Kids fell behind in school. Drug-overdose numbers exploded. Poor nations starved from supply-chain disruptions.

Now the government is out to quash this plague of poor decision making. In June, when Kennedy sacked all 17 members of the nation's top vaccine-advisory panel, a Health Department spokesperson said that it was a remedy for “vaccine groupthink.” Upcoming changes to the U.S. dietary guidelines have been cast as a way of fighting groupthink too. Both Bhattacharya and the MAHA leader Calley Means have decried the groupthink infestation in our scientific institutions. And two months before his nomination to be FDA commissioner, Marty Makary published an entire book about the perils of medical groupthink. Health Department Press Secretary Emily Hilliard told me via email that Kennedy is “confronting groupthink by rebuilding a culture where scientists can question, debate, and follow evidence freely so that truth—not conformity—drives public health decisions.” The epidemic of consensus, as he sees it, must be stopped.

Yet, ironically, MAHA's core concern—that the nation's most seasoned public-health experts have been rendered senseless over many years by a groupthink dynamic—is itself the product of a shaky sort of group belief. The phenomenon of groupthink has been studied now for decades. More than 1,300 academic papers and dozens of books have been published on the topic. Even after all of this time and effort, the evidence is wanting. In fact, most experts now believe that the old story of groupthink being a prime cause of bad decision making is wrong. Some don't think that the phenomenon is even real.

“A very curious thing has been taking place in this country—and almost without our knowing it,” the journalist William H. Whyte Jr. warned in a story touted on the cover of the March 1952 issue of Fortune: College kids had gotten meek and group-oriented. Corporations were hiring social scientists to cultivate conformity in their workers. Even literary heroes had been growing more submissive, Whyte claimed. Riffing on George Orwell's 1949 dystopian nightmare Nineteen Eighty-Four, which popularized words such as doublethink, he dubbed this new American herd mentality groupthink.

The coinage went viral. As his biographer later noted, groupthink was a “broad term that could be used to cast any number of aspersions.” And in mid-century America, there were so many aspersions to be cast! “If you want creativity, abandon the groupthink and concentrate on the lonethink,” begins a news report from an advertising conference in 1959. (“Meetings are for meatheads,” one groupthink-hating executive declared.) One columnist with the New Pittsburgh Courier even slapped Whyte's label on the United Nations, suggesting that countries, like individuals, had a primal aversion to yielding their sovereignty to the groupthink of world governance.

Whyte's concept started to appear in management textbooks, too, identified as a concerning philosophy in which people “begin to worship the group.” But the idea really found its place in academia when Irving Janis, a Yale psychologist, borrowed Whyte's buzzword to label a novel bureaucratic disease that he'd identified. In a 1971 article for Psychology Today titled “Groupthink,” Janis described how the White House had been overcome by a psychological contagion in the lead-up to the Bay of Pigs invasion. Despite their brainpower, President John F. Kennedy's famously eggheaded advisers had fallen prey to a crowd mentality that had caused them to set aside their misgivings about the attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's government so as to preserve, as Janis put it, the cozy and cohesive “we-feeling” of the group. Groupthink explained not just the Bay of Pigs, he claimed, but also the government's failure to anticipate Pearl Harbor, the Korean War stalemate, and the quagmire in Vietnam.

This rebranding of groupthink, from Whyte's pop critique of 1950s corporate life to the specific management dysfunction described by Janis, raised its stakes dramatically: Now the epicenter of the problem was in Washington, and an Ivy League scientist was saying that the contagion was to blame for many world-shaking tragedies. In his follow-up book from 1972, Victims of Groupthink, Janis insisted that he was only laying out a “hypothesis,” and he acknowledged that he had no idea what percentage of fiascos were really caused by group pressures that could impel people to set aside their misgivings. But his idea took off just the same.

In the years that followed, whenever a big-time screw-up happened, someone would swoop in and attribute it to groupthink. That included academics, who cited Janis in the context of many of the 20th century's lousiest decisions, including: Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Ford's decision to market the Edsel, Chemie Grünenthal's distribution of the drug thalidomide, the Carter administration's approach to rescuing American hostages in Iran, and NASA's launch of the Challenger space shuttle. Over the course of two generations, then, from the Boomers through Gen Xers, groupthink had come to signify a dark energy that seemed to exert its power at the worst possible times.

Sally Riggs Fuller, an organizational sociologist and a retired University of South Florida professor, remembers hearing about groupthink in a decision-making seminar taught by Ramon Aldag, her graduate-school adviser at the University of Wisconsin at Madison School of Business. He was giving the standard groupthink spiel, starting with the Bay of Pigs and explaining Janis's model. This was part of the management-studies canon in the late 1980s. “Students loved it,” Aldag told me. But Fuller was skeptical. The groupthink story sounded wrong.

After class, Fuller said, she hustled to Aldag's office. “I think there's a lot of other explanations for those bad decisions,” she told him. For a decade before grad school, Fuller had worked various office jobs in the aerospace industry, and she felt that she had a good understanding of how groups made hard decisions. Usually, several factors came to the fore: internal power struggles, organizational self-interest, the legacy of past decisions. It wasn't just some herd mentality, she insisted. Aldag suggested that she start digging through the scientific literature so that they could evaluate the published evidence.

By the time Fuller and Aldag had done enough research to give a talk at a 1990 professional meeting, the picture wasn't pretty. The baseline problem, both Fuller and Aldag told me, was that Janis had more or less dreamed up his groupthink model based on his own intuitions and inferences: It was an armchair theory—he hadn't measured anything. The concept was so sticky and compelling, though, that others started mining histories of notorious debacles for more examples of the same. “It's a lot of retrospective sensemaking,” Aldag said. (Janis died in 1990, a few years before Fuller and Aldag's critique of his idea was published in an academic journal.)

A few experimental studies of groupthink had been attempted over the years, but these were plagued with methodological problems. Researchers would construct hypothetical decision-making scenarios for groups of college students, and then measure dozens of variables to test Janis's model. When a handful of those findings came back as “statistically significant,” researchers concluded that their study provided “partial support” for the theory, Fuller said. “We were aghast at what these academics were doing,” she told me. Contrary to Janis's theory, the evidence suggested that tight-knit groups—ones with that cohesive “we-feeling”—tend to make better decisions, Aldag said.

“Groupthink is a compelling myth,” Fuller and Aldag argued in their contribution to an academic journal's special issue for the 25th anniversary of Janis's theory. “Despite a quarter century virtually devoid of support for the phenomenon, groupthink refuses to die.” Other papers in the journal took more specific aim at the theory. One argued that what Janis took to be a herd mentality might just as well be seen as deliberate, venal compliance. In other words, the misguided bureaucrats weren't so much “victims” of groupthink as they were savvy operators who were minding which way the political winds were blowing. Another paper, by the Stanford psychologist Roderick Kramer, drew upon newly declassified documents to reanalyze the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam cases from Janis's book, and found that much of the new evidence did not support the original interpretation. According to Kramer, neither case showed groupthink; they both showed “politicothink.” (Needless to say, Kramer's coinage has not caught on.)

That special issue marked a turning point for the academic bandwagon that Janis had kicked off. “It would be hard now to get a groupthink paper published in a top journal,” Aldag, who is retired but still sits on editorial boards, told me.

The implosion of Janis's model has left groupthink in an odd place. In popular discourse, the word has taken on a life of its own, as an insult deployed without clear reference to any theory of psychology. “I don't think people always know what it means,” Fuller said. Dominic Packer, a Lehigh University psychologist who has written about groupthink, told me that the term has become a useful pejorative. “It's what the other people think,” he said. “You never hear people say it to their own group.”

Taking potshots at groupthink has become especially popular on the political right, where rugged individualism is beloved and elite consensus makers are not. From 2016 to 2023, Tucker Carlson often signed off from his weeknight Fox News show with a tagline declaring it “the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.” Before taking roles in government, both Makary and Bhattacharya joined the chorus in their appearances on Fox News, taking whacks at the groupthink in the U.S. pandemic response.

To be sure, there is something deeply familiar about the idea that human beings will sometimes follow the crowd because they cherish their place in the group. Yet the claim that our public-health mistakes can be pinned on some special force called groupthink is both unhelpful and misguided. For one thing, the label implies that we'd all be better off if a monkish master of “lonethink” could be recruited to weigh the science on their own, and then arrive at the objective answer to a thorny problem, such as whether to shut down schools and when to reopen them. But decisions like these are usually carried out in the face of competing values, squabbling constituencies, and genuine uncertainty about the facts. Deciding what to do requires negotiation and democratic politics. It's a group activity.

Indeed, the failure of our leaders to explain that public health is never just a matter of “following the science” may be one of the pandemic's most enduring fiascos. Now the MAHA crusaders themselves seem ready to repeat that error in extravagant ways. “This group is going where the science takes them,” Hilliard, the HHS spokesperson, told me when I asked about Kennedy's decision to stack the nation's vaccine-advisory panel with a group of his like-minded associates. To insist that this was necessary to rescue the committee from “vaccine groupthink” is to get the matter backward: It labels a triumph of systematic decision making—one that has saved countless lives—as a tragedy; it courts disaster rather than forestalls it. (Hilliard did not respond to a question about the scientific controversy surrounding groupthink.)

Well-managed groups operating under clear and transparent rules—groups such as the vaccine-advisory committee and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (which Kennedy seems ready to also dismantle)—are some of the most powerful and trustworthy decision-making tools that we have. They are guided by published research and hard-won experience on how to avoid bad group decisions. For example, group leaders should not impose their views at the outset, and should make it clear that they value candid input from the team.

But our MAHA leaders don't appear to be heeding this advice. “A core aspect of the Trump administration is that these leaders are not willing to admit a single mistake ever,” Packer told me. That might drive team members to hide their own mistakes, and to never criticize their bosses, even when leadership is screwing up, he said. Any group decision comes with a degree of acquiescence and a leap of faith. But the best decisions involve bringing groups together, hearing out their different views, and not denying that we have a social nature. Our nation's thinking isn't broken, and this administration shouldn't try to fix it.

Hovering moms and dads are following their kids all the way to campus.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On an August Sunday 35 years ago, I moved into my freshman-year college dorm. My parents, who had traveled with me from Southern California to New England, took me to buy my first winter coat and snow boots, along with a houseplant that the store clerk described as “hard to kill,” and then we made our way to campus. My new roommate invited me to go shopping for Blu Tack so that we could hang posters in our room. I hugged my parents goodbye and headed out.

This was a fairly typical beginning to 1980s college life. Parents waved from the curb, cried in the parking lot, and maybe sent a care package two weeks later. I scheduled weekly calls with my parents for Sunday evenings, phoning from our room's landline before heading to dinner. The college experience was marked by rupture, the sometimes messy yet necessary transition from dependence to independence.

These days, the break looks different. And in some cases it doesn't look like a break at all.

A new term has entered the lexicon of college administrators: the trailing parent. These are the mothers and fathers who follow their children to campus—not just metaphorically, with daily texts about grades, outfits, or friendship drama, but physically. They rent an apartment in Atlanta, Austin, or Boston for four years, a pied-à-terre to facilitate frequent visits. They buy a condo in Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles so that their sophomore can have a place to crash—and so that they can drop by their kid's place with soup when the sniffles arrive. Some parents trail their study-abroad kids across the world, moving for a semester to Florence or Barcelona to be close by “just in case.”

College administrators and other education colleagues in my circle have told me that although such stories used to be noteworthy, they're now so common as to barely raise an eyebrow. One recalled that the mom of an Ole Miss first-year stayed in the family's new campus-adjacent apartment last fall to provide logistical and moral support during sorority rush, lending her daughter a hand in fixing hair or nursing a hangover. A Colorado couple whose daughter had a rocky freshman year told the Associated Press that they bought an apartment in Portland, Oregon, and moved there to live with their daughter while she attended college.

The paradigmatic helicopter parent hovered from a distance and in most cases didn't follow their child to college. The trailing parent touches down. Danielle Lico, who spent two decades working in student affairs at George Washington University, told me about a mom who several years ago rented a downtown-D.C. condo near campus to live with her daughter, whom she even walked to class. “We had to tell the mom that she wasn't actually permitted to sit next to her kid in class,” Lico said. “She would sit outside of the classroom, and then they would walk back to the apartment together every day for four years.”

Read: The ethos of the overinvolved parent

Not all college students love having their parents close by. The administrator of a study-abroad program told me about a mom who moved to France for proximity to her daughter. For weeks, the mother phoned the program's office, asking to arrange a visit. The daughter refused and didn't return her mother's calls. Eventually, the mother gave up and flew home to the United States. Reddit is full of similar accounts: One commenter shared an anecdote about a kid who transferred colleges to get away from his parents, after they bought a home next to his campus.

Some colleges appear to be subtly trying to head off parental overengagement. Brie McCormick, who runs residential life at Northeastern University, told the campus publication Northeastern Global News that she encourages families not to let their kids visit home early in the school year. An overseas-study program on whose board I serve asks moms and dads not to visit until the winter holidays, explaining that children need to establish roots in their new country, uninterrupted. Jason Campbell-Foster, the dean of students at Boston University, wrote in a school publication that he urges parents to trust the scaffolding they've built, to “have confidence that you've chosen a place that cares for your child, that wants them to be successful, and that will give them the space and support that they need to learn from mistakes.”

Even parents who don't trail physically are finding new ways to insert themselves into the college experience—starting with dorm rooms, as The Atlantic has reported. When my daughter began college, this fall, she had seemingly consumed hours of TikTok videos about dorm-room decor; she knew the right “fairy lights” to buy and how to elevate her bed for more storage. When I grumbled about some of the purchases (“I didn't need a plush throw for my dorm room”), she shared that some students' parents had hired decorators, and that her mom and I had gotten off easy.

Parents who were used to keeping track of their child's academic progress during high school sometimes seek the same level of engagement when their child is in college. A friend who teaches at Stanford was recently packing up his notes at the end of a class when he noticed an undergraduate standing at the lectern. When he made eye contact with the student, she thrust a cellphone into his hand. “It's for you,” the student mumbled. It was the student's mother, calling to complain about a grade on a paper. (I wonder where this ends. One day, might we see parents joining the workforce alongside their 20-somethings, setting up cubicles down the hall? Don't worry, honey. I'll be in the break room if you need me.)

Whether parents are physically in the same city as their college student, surveilling their child via GPS, or simply in daily phone or text contact with them, I worry about how all of this proximity is affecting kids. What seems like an act of devotion risks undercutting a central purpose of college.

Read: The new age of endless parenting

Every generation finds new ways to parent, and every generation frets about it. Maybe the trailing parent is simply the next logical step in an era when adolescence stretches longer. Or maybe it's something more worrisome: an inability to let go, to allow children the gift of separation. An important step toward adulthood is the experience of stumbling—sometimes badly—and discovering that you can stand on your own. It might be hard for an undergraduate to develop independence if their parents are constantly available, helping them navigate every crisis. “We would certainly have parents call anytime we did sorority or fraternity rush and somebody didn't get into the chapter they wanted,” Danielle Lico told me, and parents would hire “high-powered lawyers to get their kids out of trouble.” If a student is in a spat with a roommate or doesn't get into a class they want to take, that's a chance for them to learn to cope with conflict and setbacks—which they won't get to do if they jump to asking for direction from home.

Many colleges and universities have informal parent Facebook groups, which function as a clearinghouse for questions and provide a window into the psyche of modern moms and dads. “Have any of your kids experienced a mouse problem in the dorms?” “My student doesn't want to go to office hours because the professor (who is visiting from another school) is awful.” “If the bathroom doesn't have hand soap … who do the kids call??” These are all normal concerns a college student might ask about. Yet these forums seem to imply that the responsibility for answering these questions lies with parents rather than with their kids.

An unspoken message from the trailing parent is: We don't think you can handle college on your own. A 20-year-old who grows accustomed to dropping off laundry with a parent each weekend might conclude that they're not yet ready for the world. But college is, among other things, an exercise in independence. As much as it's important for students to learn Russian history and statistics, it's even more important for them to learn to be adults.

The US experiments on tens of thousands of beagles. After a shocking case, will it come to an end?

Animal rights advocates often contrast humanity's dismal treatment of animals farmed for food with our adoration bordering on worship of pet cats and dogs — the point being that these distinctions between animals that are equally sentient are arbitrary, hypocritical, and pointlessly cruel.

The comparison makes an important point, but it also conceals a grimmer reality: Humans treat the animals that we categorize as beloved companions horribly, too, breeding millions of them in puppy mills and even experimenting on tens of thousands of them every year in labs. And that in turn reveals something more fundamental about our relationship to animals. Whether they're chickens, pigs, or dogs, the problem is the same: Nonhuman animals are commodities with no rights and few legal limits on what can be done to them.

Nevertheless, because of their relatively privileged position in human society, lab experimentation on dogs has attracted intense scrutiny in recent years. In 2022, the Virginia-based beagle breeder Envigo, which was one of the top suppliers of dogs for lab research in the country — essentially a factory farm for lab animals — shut down under pressure from a Department of Justice probe alleging that the company was grossly mistreating its dogs, even by the minimal standards set by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).

Then, last week, the second largest remaining supplier of beagles to labs across the US (used for research including drug toxicity testing), Ridglan Farms outside Madison, Wisconsin, agreed to close its dog sales operation by July 2026 to avoid being prosecuted for felony animal cruelty. (Ridglan will still be allowed to conduct on-site animal research, for which it uses a small share of its dogs, but it won't breed dogs to supply to other labs.)

At an evidentiary hearing last year, former Ridglan employees said they'd performed crude surgeries on beagles without pain relief, including removing prolapsed eye glands and cutting out their vocal cords, a measure meant to reduce noise from the densely packed barking dogs. “It still haunts me every day,” testified Matthew Reich, who worked at Ridglan from 2006 to 2010.

After Ridglan closes, only one major supplier of dogs for lab research will remain in the country. Dog experimentation in the US, in other words, might be approaching its end.

What's remarkable about these two closures is how exceedingly unusual they are. For the minority of lab animals who are protected under the Animal Welfare Act (rats and mice, along with several other classes of animals, are not covered by the law), research labs and breeders across the US are subject to federal oversight and inspections, where violations are routinely uncovered, from banal failures like filthy conditions and unfed animals to grotesque ones like accidentally scalding monkeys to death with industrial cleaning equipment.

But consequences of the kind that could actually prevent more animals from being mistreated are rare to nonexistent. The US Department of Agriculture can issue fines, which legally max out at $14,575 per violation, though the agency often discounts them significantly; the USDA's Office of Inspector General has called penalties for violating the AWA “basically meaningless,” treated by violators as “a cost of doing business.”

Although Envigo and Ridglan agreed to close under deals with law enforcement, the primary driving force behind these outcomes was arguably — and, in Ridglan's case, certainly — years of investigative work and pressure from animal rights advocates. Envigo became a major regional story after PETA released an undercover investigation there in late 2021. Ridglan, meanwhile, which houses around 3,000 beagles at any given time and sells them to university and private labs, had been the target of an undercover investigation by activists from the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE).

In 2017, the activists entered the farm and found dogs confined in small, dirty stacked metal cages inside foul-smelling windowless sheds, spinning around in circles from boredom. They removed three beagles from the facility, in a tactic DxE calls “open rescue.”

Following that investigation, the three activists — Wayne Hsiung, Eva Hamer, and Paul Picklesimer — were charged with felony burglary and theft, which came with the potential to each spend more than a decade in prison. But those charges were dropped last year, and, in a remarkable reversal, Hsiung, along with a coalition of local animal advocacy groups, managed to flip the case on its head: They successfully petitioned a Wisconsin judge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Ridglan for animal cruelty.

It was a momentous result for animal advocates (including several people I personally know who'd been campaigning against Ridglan in Madison, where I live), and perhaps DxE's greatest achievement to date. (In August 2021, before I was at Vox covering these issues for a living, I wrote to the Dane County district attorney to urge him to drop charges against the activists.) The judge's decision implicitly affirmed something that the animal rights movement has been saying for decades. Law enforcement systematically ignores the abuse of animals in large-scale enterprises like factory farms and labs, and these facilities often rely on the privilege of nonenforcement to operate. In her order granting the activists' petition for a special prosecutor, Judge Rhonda Lanford found probable cause to believe Ridglan violated Wisconsin's animal cruelty laws, writing that the local district attorney had failed to act despite receiving reports of potential animal welfare violations.

The animal research community's response to these findings has been mostly to close ranks. No prominent pro-animal research organization has, to my knowledge, publicly voiced concern over alleged conditions at Ridglan or called for accountability.

Americans for Medical Progress (AMP), a nonprofit that advocates for biomedical research using animals, told me in a statement that “Ridglan filled an important role in advancing veterinary medicine. … As that research capacity diminishes, it could become much harder for researchers to study and discover new ways to treat diseases in dogs and other animals. Responsible, well-regulated research remains essential to improving animal health and ensuring veterinarians can provide the best possible care.” (Ridglan's dogs are used in both human and veterinary research, not solely for veterinary applications.) Last year, an AMP representative told Science magazine that Ridglan's staff “put animal welfare first. They really abide by all of the strict regulations — everything that is in place.”

Proponents of animal research see themselves as locked in an existential war over the legitimacy of experimenting on animals (particularly animals that Americans treat as family), a war that has increasingly engaged members of the general public and politicians on both the left and right. The animal research community does not want to give an inch to animal rights advocates, nor accept limits on researchers' autonomy to use animals as they see fit.

The rest of us, though, do not have to buy that premise. We have a choice of whether to accept the infliction of extreme suffering on gentle, trusting beagles, particularly for research with such an uneven record of helping humans. As Harvard bioengineer Don Ingber told me earlier this year, “everyone admits that animal models are suboptimal at best, and highly inaccurate more commonly.” If that's true, it surely can't be the case that science sees animal life as infinitely expendable.

Although ethical limits are sometimes framed as opposed to scientific progress, they are, in fact, constitutive of it. The slow unraveling of dog experimentation suggests that our better moral judgments can override institutional inertia — but it also shows how arbitrary the lines are that we draw between species, and how much further we have to go beyond the animals we've decided to love.

﻿How to change your mind on the climate's future, according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie

Climate stories usually start the same way: fire, flood, loss, collapse. The charts are grim. The vibes are worse. But there's another story in the numbers that starts with what's working, what's already being built, and how far we've actually come.

Hannah Ritchie is a data scientist at the University of Oxford and the author of Clearing the Air, a book that offers encouraging answers to some of our hardest questions about the climate. She's a “data optimist” who doesn't ignore the dangers of climate change, but recognizes how the world is decarbonizing faster than most of us realize.

The real bottleneck now, Ritchie argues, isn't technology so much as belief. Belief that progress is still possible without shrinking our world; belief that the cleaner option can also be the better, cheaper one; belief that the future is worth racing toward.

I invited Ritchie onto The Gray Area to talk about the dueling climate narratives of denial vs. despair, where individual choices meet systemic change, and how the politics of clean energy are quietly shifting. We also get into nuclear, agriculture, carbon removal, and the kind of story that might move people from doomscrolling to building.

As always, there's much more in the full podcast, so listen and follow The Gray Area on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts. New episodes drop every Monday.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What changed your mind about the path we're on? 

Two things. First, zooming way out. If you look across decades and centuries, humans have solved a staggering number of problems. Poverty, hunger, child and maternal mortality, life expectancy — almost any human-development metric you pick has improved dramatically, especially in the last 50 years. You don't get that perspective from the news cycle; you get it from long-run data. We are capable of solving big problems.

Second, zooming in on climate. We are still in a bad place and progress has been too slow. But we have made progress, and there are now objective trends you can't see in a headline: the collapse in the costs of solar, wind, and batteries; the pace at which those technologies are being deployed; the rate at which grids are getting cleaner. If you step back and look at the data, the scale and speed of these shifts are unmistakable.

But your views have shifted, right?

They shifted a lot. Fifteen years ago, I was a doom person. I was convinced climate change would make my life unlivable. The change wasn't a personality transplant; it came from the data. Stepping back, getting the long view, and then watching the cost curves and deployment numbers bend changed my mind.

We seem stuck between denial and despair. Why is the nuanced middle so hard to sustain?

Partly human psychology: We're tuned to scan for threats. Partly media dynamics: Nuance doesn't perform. Extremes get clicks and shares, so that's what we see. If your information diet is headlines and feeds, you'll mostly encounter the “nothing to see here” take or the “end times tomorrow” take. Even journalists tell me they want to publish more measured stories – and then watch them die in traffic. It's kind of a feedback loop between what's produced and what we reward.

The question you get most often is: Are we doomed? I think what people are really asking is whether anything we do — innovation, growth, building — really makes a difference. How do you think about our agency at this stage of the crisis? 

“Every tenth of a degree matters. Even if we miss a target, pushing for a lower peak still saves lives and ecosystems. It's not binary.”

We have a lot of agency. All credible pathways show the range of future temperatures is driven by choices we make now. People imagine “the threshold” – cross 1.5°C or 2°C and it's over. But impacts are incremental. 1.6 is worse than 1.5, 1.7 worse than 1.6. That means every tenth of a degree matters. Even if we miss a target, pushing for a lower peak still saves lives and ecosystems. It's not binary.

And agency isn't just “individual” or “systemic.” That's a false choice. Governments and firms make the substitutes available, affordable, and easy — clean power, efficient buildings, EVs, good transit, better food options. But once those exist, people have to choose them. Individuals create the demand signal that drives the systemic change forward.

You note that the world is improving faster than people think, but the public mood is still grim. How much do people actually care about climate action?

More than we assume. International surveys show majorities in every country say climate change is real and want more action – including in the US. There's polarization, and the partisan gap in the US is larger than elsewhere, but even many Republicans express support. Crucially, Republicans underestimate how many other Republicans care. It's a quiet consensus.

“Saying you care,” of course, isn't the same as paying a premium. The lesson I take is: People are receptive to solutions, but the alternatives have to be there and affordable. Many cannot and will not pay more. Build good substitutes at good prices and adoption follows.

Politically, asking people to give up things they like is a hard sell. Substitutes are better than sacrifice. Is that what makes you optimistic?

Yes. Ten years ago, even after the Paris Agreement, solar and wind were far more expensive than coal and gas. It seemed implausible to me that the world would voluntarily choose costlier energy for decades. Then the costs collapsed. Solar is down around 80 to 90 percent, wind around 70 percent, batteries around 90 percent in a decade. In many places, solar and wind are simply the cheapest new power. The short-term economic incentive now aligns with the long-term climate imperative. That's a very different political proposition than “pay more now for a benefit later.”

So growth and climate action aren't opposites anymore. The bottleneck is belief.

Exactly. Some countries still see growth as “drill, baby, drill.” The US has elements of that mindset. Contrast that with China, which sees internal-combustion engines and fossil power as 20th-century tech, and wants to build the 21st-century industries: solar, wind, batteries, EVs, electrification. The belief that “green = decline” lingers in some places, but it's increasingly disconnected from the economics.

How do you talk to people who are skeptical or even hostile?

The psychology matters. With skeptical audiences, it often helps to lead with energy security, innovation, and local benefits rather than abstract global climate goals. “Build” beats “ban.” People respond to positive visions — more reliable, cheaper, cleaner energy; better air; less dependence on petrostates — more than to austerity pitches.

You point out that red states have built a lot of clean energy — sometimes more than blue states. What's going on?

Look at the data: A huge share of US wind was built in red states along the wind belt. Texas is surging on solar and batteries. Often the driver wasn't “net-zero,” it was local air quality, landowner income, or energy independence. State-level rules that make it feasible to build quickly matter a lot. So there's a split: State politics can be pragmatic and pro-build even when national politics are combative or, lately, restrictive toward new renewables.

Internationally, rich-world hypocrisy has long been a problem: “Don't develop the way we did.” Is that still blocking progress?

It was real and still lingers. Countries like mine [the UK] built prosperity by burning fossil fuels without constraint. Many poor countries understandably want energy to escape poverty. Telling them “you can't” rings hypocritical, especially when rich countries still use far more fossil energy per person today.

But dynamics are shifting. One promising sign is surging exports of affordable Chinese solar to countries like Pakistan and across Africa. That opens a leapfrog path — build modern systems without locking into coal and gas. We should still worry about equity and early adopters tend to be the wealthy within those countries. A national grid that delivers low-cost electricity to everyone, and can power industry, remains essential so progress doesn't deepen internal inequality.

Let's hit a few contested topics. Nuclear: misunderstood workhorse or unacceptable risk?

It's one of the most misunderstood. Nuclear is very low-carbon and uses little land. The fear centers on safety, anchored to three high-profile events: Three Mile Island (no deaths), Fukushima (no direct radiation deaths), and Chernobyl (estimates vary, somewhere around 400–4,000 deaths). Any death is tragic, of course, but we have to compare orders of magnitude. Fossil fuels kill millions annually through air pollution every year, even before you count climate impacts. On a per-unit-of-electricity basis, nuclear is hundreds to thousands of times safer than fossil fuels. Closing nuclear while keeping coal and gas running makes no safety sense.

Agriculture is a quieter giant in the climate world. How big a deal is it?

Enormous. We turn half of the world's habitable land into farms. Agriculture is the leading driver of biodiversity loss, deforestation, freshwater use, and water pollution. For climate, it's roughly a quarter to a third of global emissions. And impacts vary hugely by product. Animal products generally require more land and cause higher emissions than plant-based foods; larger animals tend to be worse. If everyone went vegan tomorrow, agricultural land use would fall by around 75 percent.

But this isn't all-or-nothing. We'll get more impact if half the population cuts back a lot than if a small share goes fully vegan. Meat reduction — especially from high-impact products — is one of the most powerful personal levers.

Are there climate things we obsess over that don't really move the needle?

Yes. Plastic, from a climate perspective, is one. People fixate on recycling. I recycle and you should too. but the carbon benefit of recycling plastics is marginal compared with the climate impact of the stuff we put in our bags. In the UK you pay for plastic bags; culturally, forgetting your tote feels like a moral failing. Meanwhile, the food choices that dwarf the bag's footprint get little thought. It's not that recycling is pointless; it's that we misallocate attention. Focus where the impact is largest.

Okay, where is the largest impact for ordinary people?

Support the buildout — politically and personally. Back leaders and policies that make clean options cheaper and easier. Then choose those options: Switch to clean power when you can, electrify cars and home heating as the options become affordable, ride good transit, reduce high-impact foods.

Just as important: how we talk about this. A public that sees the benefits of clean energy — cheaper bills, cleaner air, quieter cities, more reliable systems — gives governments and companies the “permission” to go faster. Culture makes policy possible.

Motivation is the perennial question. How do we move people?

Story matters. The danger story was necessary to wake the world up. Most people are awake now. The next job is the solutions story. We need a credible vision of the world we want in 2050 and a believable path to get there. People need to know there is a path, and that walking it brings collective benefits: health, security, prosperity. “Here's what we're building and why you'll like living there” beats “Here's what you must give up.”

Paint that 2050 picture. If we mostly get this right, what does everyday life look like?

Energy is cheaper and more reliable. Most countries control much more of their own supply. They're less vulnerable to distant shocks. Cities are quieter and cleaner; air is better. We use less energy to deliver more services because the system is more efficient end-to-end. Transport is largely electrified. Buildings are comfortable without waste. And we have more resilience — to weather, to geopolitics — because the system is diversified and local where it makes sense.

You dedicate the book to your niece, Mava, who may live to see the 22nd century. What do you hope she says about us in 50 years?

That we were at a crossroads and chose well. That we used the position we're in — and the tools at our disposal — to build a safer, cleaner, fairer world for her generation and the next. Pride would be nice. Relief might be closer to the truth. But the choice is ours.

So…are we doing it?

We can. And in many places, we are. The optimistic story is an opportunity, not an inevitability. My job — our job — is to push so that opportunity becomes the path we take.

Eligibility for a major student-loan forgiveness program for public servants is officially narrowing.

On October 30, President Donald Trump's Department of Education announced the final rule to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.

The rule delivers on an executive order Trump signed in March to redefine what ""public service"" means, including ensuring that employers who participate in activities that do not align with the administration's political views will be barred from qualifying for PSLF.

""The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service — not to subsidize organizations that violate the law, whether by harboring illegal immigrants or performing prohibited medical procedures that attempt to transition children away from their biological sex,"" Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement.

Advocacy groups said they plan to sue the administration over the changes to PSLF.

""This is a direct and unlawful attack on nurses, teachers, first responders, and public service workers across the country,"" advocacy groups Democracy Forward and Protect Borrowers said in a statement, adding: ""That's why we will soon see the Trump-Vance administration in court.""

The Department of Education said the changes will go into effect on July 1, 2026. Here's what you need to know.

Are you enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Have a story to share about student loans? Contact this reporter at asheffey@businessinsider.com.

The department's final rule changes the definition of a ""qualifying employer,"" which previously used to be any government or nonprofit entity. The department said it will now exclude employers that have ""substantial illegal purpose,"" including: supporting terrorism; helping transgender people transition; working with undocumented immigrants; and engaging in a ""pattern"" of violating state laws.

""When an organization has a pattern or practice of engaging in certain illegal conduct, they have a substantial illegal purpose because a significant amount of their activities are supporting illegal activity,"" the department's fact sheet said. ""Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good.""

The fact sheet said that employers following the law will not be impacted, along with those found to have ""minor compliance issues.""

The fact sheet said that the education secretary will weigh evidence of illegal activity to determine whether it is substantial enough to disqualify the employer from PSLF. Employers will receive notice and an opportunity to review the allegations of illegal activity, and they'll also be able to rebut the department's findings.

Borrowers will also receive a notice that their employer has been notified that they might no longer be eligible for PSLF. The department said the PSLF Help Tool, which helps borrowers find qualifying employers, will be updated to reflect any pending eligibility determinations.

If an employer is disqualified from PSLF, the fact sheet said they can reapply to be a qualifying employer after 10 years, or they can enter a ""corrective action plan"" before being disqualified to maintain PSLF eligibility. Borrowers are not able to appeal their employer's qualifying status themselves.

Once an employer no longer qualifies for PSLF, any payment borrowers make to that employer after July 1, 2026 will not count toward PSLF progress. However, any retroactive payments will not be disqualified.

Inside a glass-walled lab at Tesla's engineering headquarters, dozens of workers act out the motions of everyday life: lifting a cup, wiping a table, pulling open a curtain.

They repeat each action hundreds of times during eight-hour shifts, and their work is captured by five cameras attached to their helmet and a heavy backpack. CEO Elon Musk sometimes stops by to watch, and Tesla investors visit regularly for demos.

It's like being a ""lab rat under a microscope,"" one former worker told Business Insider.

The goal is simple: Teach Optimus, the company's robot, how to move like a human.

Musk has identified Optimus as a crucial part of the business. During the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk said that it ""has the potential to be the biggest product of all time"" and said the company would eventually produce 1 million units per year. He has also projected that Optimus would account for around 80% of the automaker's value one day.

Tesla intends for Optimus to perform a wide variety of tasks, including factory work, household chores, and caregiving. The work of the ""data collection operators"" is designed to pave the way for Optimus to replace human labor.

Business Insider spoke with five current and former workers to understand how Optimus is trained. They said the role is physically demanding, occasionally absurd, and always meticulous. They sprint, squat, and dance. If their movements are deemed not ""human enough,"" one worker said, their performance is critiqued.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

Tesla is one of many tech companies, including Figure and 1X, attempting to replicate complex human behavior in a robot. The ultimate goal, as with much of the AI industry, might be autonomy, but an army of flesh-and-blood workers props up the sleek demos and lofty promises.

Training a robot to be human isn't glamorous.

Most data collectors start out wiping down a table, sometimes for weeks. ""You take a step, wipe the table, go into a reset pose, and do it all over again,"" one former worker said. It's ""rinse and repeat until break time.""

The workers receive detailed documents about how to perform simple tasks, and they're guided by a thick, constantly evolving manual, three workers said. They're also paired up with a peer to ensure the tasks are performed correctly, five people said.

""Tesla is very strict on how everything needs to be done,"" one worker said. ""It can be very tough mentally and physically.""

Since data collection started, workers have largely used motion capture suits to teleoperate the robot — teaching it with manual movement. In June, the company told workers it was pivoting away from motion-capture suits and teleoperation and toward collecting data using only cameras, Business Insider previously reported. The change followed the departure of program director Milan Kovac.

The worker-mounted cameras point in all directions, helping precisely place the data collectors in the environment, workers said. They said the team was told it would be faster to scale data collection without the motion-capture suits.

Since the June shift, the company has incorporated multiple new training processes, including stationing cameras around workers while they perform tasks, three workers said. 

Jonathan Aitken, a robotics expert at the University of Sheffield, told Business Insider that the camera towers could supplement the data by providing a broader view of the environment.

Workers are sometimes outfitted with haptic gloves, which track the minute movements of their hands, three employees said. Musk has said Tesla has spent considerable energy trying to develop a human-like hand for Optimus, calling it ""an incredibly difficult engineering challenge.""

Workers have also recorded themselves mirroring each other's movements, three people said. At the company's Fremont, California, plant, data collectors have organized vehicle parts and worked on conveyor belts while wearing the headset and backpack, two people said. Experts who spoke with Business Insider said that collecting different data points for the same task can be helpful for training.

Other tasks are so simple that a former worker likened them to ""teaching a baby."" Two data collectors said they recorded themselves working on brain teasers designed for actual babies: putting rings on by size and color, or putting shapes into their corresponding slots.

Tesla has also begun using AI-generated prompts to help train the robot, three people said. During some training exercises, workers receive a series of AI-generated prompts via a headset, which is attached to the 30- to 40-pound backpack via wires. Though they're often wearing the backpack, it sometimes sits nearby on a chair or table.

Workers said the exercises have included squatting, doing the ""Chicken Dance,"" acting like a gorilla, pretending to vacuum, sprinting for several yards, pretending to golf, and twerking. Workers are expected to perform each exercise within three to five seconds, the workers said. Two people recalled instances where some tasks made them uncomfortable, including AI-generated requests to crawl on all fours or remove a piece of clothing.

Aitken said the seemingly random tasks could help Tesla understand which areas it needs to improve on.

""How do you know you've covered the entire range of things you'll need it to be able to do?"" he said.

The work can take a physical toll, four people said. One former worker described it as ""basically doing cardio all day.""

One former worker said they sustained a back injury while training the robot. They said the unbalanced weight of the backpack made it feel like they were constantly ""walking with a limp."" They said they went on medical leave as a result.

""I lost feeling in my right leg and had a sharp pain in my back,"" they said.

Workers said they saw colleagues sustain back and neck injuries due to the nature of the role.

Some people experienced problems during teleoperation, which can involve motion-capture suits and a virtual reality headset. A mix of poor image quality and the length of time workers spent wearing the gear triggered severe motion sickness, three people said. They said it could be especially disorienting when the robot fell over.

""You'd have the feeling you're falling because you're seeing through its eyes, but you'd be standing upright,"" one worker said.

For now, teleoperation is mostly reserved for investor visits.

""The investors want to see the bots moving in action,"" one former worker said. ""When we're in mo-cap, we're controlling the bots so it looks more fluid.""

Investors are sometimes accompanied by Musk, who has brought his 5-year-old son X to see the robot, two former workers said. One of the former workers compared the demos to ""putting on a big show.""

""It felt like theater,"" the former worker said.

Half the time, two workers said, the robot tumbles over when performing tasks that require bending or leaning, sometimes damaging expensive equipment. It's typically strapped into the gantry — a supportive rig that keeps the robot upright — unless it's performing tasks that involve traveling more than a few feet, three workers said.

Aitken said the robot should be able to remain upright with ease in a controlled environment like Tesla's offices. ""Having it stand up and maintain balance should be one of the first things you look at,"" he said.

Musk said during Tesla's recent earnings call that the robot is a 24/7 presence at the company's engineering headquarters and walks around the office and escorts people to meeting rooms.

Elon's Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce  revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer!  Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1

At one point, more than 100 people worked on data collection, three people said. The company cut dozens of data collectors in September following twice-yearly performance reviews.

Workers are scored on how well they perform the tasks, five people said. They receive feedback on everything from bodily angles to positioning.

The data collectors have an online dashboard with grades based on data quality and quantity. Each worker is expected to gather at least four hours of usable video footage per shift, five people said. If the video footage is deemed unsatisfactory — if the worker's positioning isn't quite right, for instance — workers can be penalized.

For the workers who train it, Optimus' performance metrics are less clear. When training relied primarily on teleoperation, data operators could press a button to see if Optimus would perform the task. (More often than not, it couldn't, three people said.) Now, these evaluations are less common, and the workers said they have less transparency into the robot's progress.

In company videos, Optimus can be seen walking, folding laundry, performing kung fu moves at the ""Tron Ares"" premiere, and handing out candy in Times Square.

A robot demo ""is always the very best demo they could show you,"" Alan Fern, an AI and robotics expert at Oregon State University, told Business Insider.

""When you see something like it performing kung fu, it looks like it's doing something intelligent, which leads people to extrapolate its capabilities, but that's just not true,"" Fern said. ""It's just reacting to its environment. There is not a cognitive thought behind it.""

Musk, meanwhile, continues to tout a grand vision. ""It won't even seem like a robot,"" he told investors in October. ""It'll seem like a person in a robot suit.""

For now, Optimus is still learning through repetition, trial and error, and endless hours of human labor.

When Michael Permana realized his software engineering job at Amazon was at risk, he didn't panic. He took paternity leave.

Permana's job security concerns began in February 2023, when he was placed on a performance improvement plan — a move he saw as a clear sign his job was in serious jeopardy.

""I was desperate because from what I'd heard, once you are in a performance improvement plan, you are on your way out at Amazon,"" said the 47-year-old, who lives in California.

He began looking for work immediately but knew it might take a while to land a new role, and he was worried about not being able to earn a paycheck when he had a mortgage to pay.

Then he had an idea. His daughter had been born the previous May, and he still had a few remaining months of paternity leave before it expired when she turned one year old. By temporarily stepping away from work, he thought he might be able to prolong his employment at Amazon while he searched for a new role.

""I took the opportunity while I could to delay time,"" he said.

It paid off. Less than a month after returning to work, Permana received a job offer for a software engineering position at MobilityWare, a mobile game developer.

While layoffs across the economy remain low by historical standards, white-collar workers have been disproportionately affected — and a hiring slowdown has made it harder for them to secure new roles. Business Insider has spoken with dozens of people laid off by major corporations as companies implement strategic shifts — including shedding management roles, reallocating resources toward AI initiatives, pushing out underperformers, and cutting costs across the board.

Some of these workers saw their layoffs coming, but many others were caught off guard — citing factors like long tenure, a lack of performance issues, and the seemingly strong financial position of their employers.

Rather than simply working hard and hoping for the best, some workers have prepared for the worst — deploying strategies like getting a head start on their job search, launching a side business, or secretly working a second job.

Laura Ulrich, director of economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said some workers may be feeling anxious about job security because lower hiring levels have raised concerns about their ability to find a new role if a layoff were to occur. And because hiring was so much stronger in many industries just a few years ago, the shift may feel especially stark.

""If you become unemployed, it's become much harder to find a job,"" she said.

Ulrich added that the hype surrounding the potential of AI technologies has also given some workers reason to worry about their job security — even as the full impact of these technologies remains to be seen.

Eduardo Noriega first began worrying about his job security at Microsoft in 2009, when the company laid off about 5,000 workers. He was spared, but it was a wake-up call.

""When I saw the layoff, I realized that job security isn't real,"" said Noriega, who's in his 50s and lives in Seattle.

After weighing his options, Noriega concluded that his best chance at financial stability was to build a business he could rely on if he ever lost his job. He said it was one of the best career decisions he's ever made.

By the time he was laid off by Microsoft this past May, he'd spent nearly a decade building a staffing firm outside work hours — and was earning more from it than from his software engineering job. He said he had been hesitant to quit and give up the steady paycheck, but the layoff gave him the push he needed to go all in.

""I never dared to quit,"" he said. ""And then Microsoft presented the layoff, and for me, that was like an exit.""

Many of the workers Business Insider spoke with who had the greatest concerns about job security — and who took steps to guard against it — had either been laid off in the past or witnessed significant cuts at their employers.

After getting laid off from four tech jobs between 2020 and 2023, Reed, who is in his 30s and lives in New York, was desperate for some level of job security. Business Insider verified his identity, but he requested to use a pseudonym due to concerns about professional repercussions.

After his fourth layoff, Reed had a eureka moment.

""I was like, the only way for me to combat not continuously being unemployed is to have two jobs,"" he said.

As of earlier this year, Reed was on track to earn about $280,000 working two full-time remote jobs. He said his typical workweek is about 60 hours, and neither employer knows about the other gig — but he thinks it's worth it for the additional job security.

""I need these two jobs to sustain my life with my partner,"" he said, adding, ""I don't really have a choice.""

Not all job jugglers are as ambitious as Reed. Some, like John, a millennial software engineer based in California, are boosting their job security by taking on a part-time role on the side. He expects to earn about $225,000 this year, including around $60,000 from his part-time gig. John said his main employer knows he has a side gig of some sort, but doesn't know the specifics of the role — or how many hours he devotes to it.

In addition to his part-time gig, John has become less concerned about his job security as he has developed his network over the years. If he were to be laid off from his primary job, he said he knows several startup founders and hiring managers in his industry who he believes would help him find employment.

""I'm pretty confident that I'd be able to secure another full-time job in pretty short order,"" he said.

Earlier this year, a strategic shift at Intel led Kent Ha, then a digital marketing strategist, to believe that his team's jobs were in jeopardy. He'd already been laid off twice over the past decade — in 2015 and 2020 — and wanted to avoid a lengthy spell of unemployment. So in June, he contacted his financial advisor to help him prepare financially — and started applying for jobs.

""I figured worst case, I'd land another offer and have a backup plan,"" he said. ""Best case, I'd keep my job and wouldn't have to make any changes.""

When the feared layoff came in July, Ha was already in the middle of a job search. While he's still looking for work, he's glad he got a head start.

For some workers, the best way to ease their job security concerns is by accumulating savings that can help them stay afloat during unemployment — or give them the freedom to leave a job that doesn't feel stable.

Phil Coachman, formerly a senior cloud solution architect at Microsoft, said that the company's layoffs conducted in 2023 raised significant concerns about his job security. Other frustrations with his role followed, and in July 2024, he began looking for a new opportunity.

""I just didn't feel happy there anymore,"" said Coachman, who's in his 40s and lives in Pennsylvania. ""I wanted to just continue making cool stuff and not have this constant fear of losing my job every week.""

However, Coachman's search proved challenging, and by January of this year, he decided to resign in order to focus on his job search. He said the ""rainy day fund"" he'd built over the years helped him feel comfortable doing so.

""I had enough savings that even if it would take me a year to find a job, I would be fine,"" he said. ""So it was just getting the courage to take that jump.""

While his savings helped him stay afloat during his job search, Coachman said deciding to rely more on his network after he resigned is what landed him a new job. A former Microsoft colleague referred him for a role at the AI startup Databricks, which led to an interview — and, in April, a job offer.

His network couldn't protect him from being laid off, but it helped him end his spell of unemployment — and made him feel a bit less concerned about his job security going forward.

""Finding my next gig was 100% through my network,"" he said, adding, ""It's real connections with people that I think make all the difference.""

Elon Musk isn't afraid to commit to the bit.

One day before he officially acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, he shared a video on his account that showed him carrying a sink into the social media platform's former headquarters in San Francisco.

""Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!,"" Musk wrote.

During Friday's episode of the ""All-In"" podcast, Musk said that the video, which now has 1.2 million likes and 202,000 reposts, almost didn't happen.

""Well, I think the store was confused because my security team was asking for any kind of sink, and normally, people wouldn't ask for any kind of sink because you need a sink that fits in your bathroom or connects to a certain kind of plumbing,"" Musk said. ""So, they're trying to ask, 'What kind of faucets do you want?' No, I just wanted a sink.""

Musk said the store almost didn't sell them a sink out of concern.

""The store was confused that we just wanted a sink and didn't care what the sink connected to,"" Musk said. ""They were, like, almost not letting us buy the sink because they thought maybe we'd buy the wrong sink.""

""It's just rare that somebody wants a sink for sink's sake,"" Musk said.

Representatives for Musk and X did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Twitter, now known as X, underwent major changes after Musk completed his takeover, including layoffs, office closures, and the discontinuation of the original blue checkmark verification feature.

Another significant shift happened this March when Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, acquired X in an all-stock deal.

""xAI and X's futures are intertwined,"" Musk wrote. ""Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.""

Grok, a generative chatbot that debuted on the social media platform in November 2023, is just one example of how Musk is encouraging synergy.

The chatbot, powered by a large language model with the same name, can answer users' queries on X and in Tesla vehicles. It also has a stand-alone website.

Although Musk has shared plans to expand Grok's capabilities, the system has encountered some challenges. In July, the chatbot faced criticism after it shared several antisemitic posts, prompting xAI to apologize for its ""horrific behavior.""

""After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot,"" the company wrote on X.

The incident occurred days before xAI debuted Grok 4, the latest iteration of the chatbot.

This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Christina Kantzavelos, 37, a therapist and chronic illness advocate based in Óbidos, Portugal, a town about 52 miles north of Lisbon. She left California at the end  of 2022 and lived nomadically in Europe until settling in Portugal in 2024. She still rents a home in California and has clients in the US. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

It was early summer of 2024 that I first decided that I wanted to make Portugal my permanent home.

I've been to a lot of different countries in Europe, and I've had the privilege of visiting and spending longer periods of time in them. For me, Portugal just feels the most comfortable. There's a lot happening where you feel like you can be involved or contribute to the community very easily. There's an openness, and I like that there's a mixture of locals as well as foreigners. I have felt very welcomed here so far.

It's nice to know things are happening and going on. I'm not that far from Lisbon, where a lot of bands come to play. And I love the access to nature and the good weather — it's reminiscent of California, where I grew up. It's a very nice balance.

I love the fact that sunshine is just a drive away, even if it seems like it's raining somewhere. You can be at the beach and in the snow, theoretically, on the same day. There are just so many rivers and beautiful hikes, and the air just seems so clear. Those are the aspects of the lifestyle I enjoy.

Overall, my nervous system just feels safer here. For me, it really comes down to my health and the fact that I feel better overall. I just feel less inflamed, more energized, more vibrant overall.

I work mostly Pacific Standard Time; however, I coach clients from the Midwest to the East Coast and also internationally.

It's pretty ideal. Generally speaking, I wrap up around 10 p.m., so I'm in bed at a reasonable hour.

It's been great to have slow mornings. It's nice that I can go see doctors, or go get treatments, or go do things that are related and helpful to my health during the day, and get that over with, and then work. I actually really like that switch of workflow.

People here seem to work to live versus live to work in the US.

I feel like in the US it is shifting in a healthier direction, but the lifestyle in Portugal seems more conducive to living, and I really enjoy that.

It's also more affordable overall. I try to eat mostly organic, and I can do that here more affordably versus in the US, where I'd be left with very little money at the end of the month.

For two people, between the grocery store and the farmer's market, a week's worth of groceries costs 125 euros, or about $145. Eating mostly organic food, that would've easily cost me closer to $300.

I rent my house in Joshua Tree, California, which is a little bit more affordable than big cities where I was before, like San Diego and Los Angeles. For point of reference, my three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot apartment in Portugal is 1,300 euros a month.

For something like this in San Diego, this would probably be at least $5,000 a month for a location where I am walking distance to town and for what I have access to.

Where I am, I feel like there's a lot around community and families: they're doing family dinners on Sunday, where everyone gets together, or group lunches. There are a lot of festivals, and there are a lot of community events.

I'm a European citizen and I'm now a resident of Portugal; however, I still don't have access to their healthcare, so everything is out of pocket. 

It's still less expensive: I went to the osteopath, and I paid 40 euros for an hour of treatment. Seeing an osteopath out of pocket in California was quite expensive — it was $275 for 30 minutes.

I have to get weekly lymphatic massages for one of my health conditions. And for an hour and a half, I pay 40 euros. To receive that in California, I think it was closer to $175 for an hour and a half.

When I was living in Greece, I needed a small emergency surgery, and I was charged 50 euros for that — and that was at a private institution. If I'd gone to an ER in the US, that would've probably cost me $5,000.

I know folks who've had to open a GoFundMe for their healthcare. That just doesn't make sense that we need to crowdfund to get our healthcare covered when we pay so much for health insurance in the US. I see it almost every day in my work, insurance denying someone's health treatment.

It's depressing. It breaks my heart. I'm so grateful that I have this privilege, but it doesn't make sense that we should have to leave our own country to be able to afford to be healthy.

Nervous system dysregulation is tied so closely to our health — the mind-body component is huge. If we're not feeling comfortable or safe in the environment we're living in, it can impact our health big time. I've noticed a really huge difference in my overall health, even without the treatments here.

I've received only love, support, and curiosity from my clients thus far. I feel so much better. I do feel like I'm fully able to take care of my health and feel confident, safe, and secure in where I am.

It's not rare that we go overseas or to different states or places for our health. If we go somewhere and we realize, ""Wow, I see a difference,"" it's worthwhile for us to make the move.

Investors are increasingly turning to bank quantitative investment strategies for protection that will react faster during sudden market upsets.

Volatility has eased after a mid-October bout of turmoil, with the Cboe Volatility Index back below the past year's average. Risks appear to be fairly mixed. On the one hand, there's the possibility of an AI-driven stock melt-up into year-end. On the other hand, strategists point to high valuations and the reliance on a narrow set of companies to lead the rally.

With politics among the biggest stressors for Americans, and the political gender gap growing among young people, it can be hard to stay motivated when divisions feel more contentious than ever.

Few people understand that like Ella Emhoff, the daughter of former U.S. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and stepdaughter of former Vice President Kamala Harris.

Getting offline is a good first step.

""I think what has kept me the most invigorated around politics and just social change is seeing everyone else empowered by it, coming to things like ZCON and being able to talk about it,"" Emhoff recently told CNBC Make It at the Gen Z-focused conference put on by United Talent Agency. ""When we're online, it can feel so insular and feel like everything's happening to us, whether it be with immigration, with wars, with genocide, with the climate.""

With so much happening, Emhoff says she finds power in focusing on small changes within her control, and actions she can take toward them.

""Small changes impact big change,"" she says. ""Even going and volunteering at a shelter or with dogs or feeding the homeless, anything like that is going to create positive impact. The more you engage with that in your day-to-day, bigger things will feel more achievable.""

These small and ongoing projects of purpose are more achievable and enjoyable no matter the result, versus large and intangible goals, Dr. Jordan Grumet, a hospice medical director and author writing about purpose, previously told Make It.

On the other hand, scrolling and consuming every bad headline won't do much for your emotions or your feelings of being able to enact small changes. ""Get off your phone, engage in your community,"" Emhoff says. ""It's going to make you feel better. I promise.""

The 26-year-old says turning to offline creative pursuits, like her work as a textile artist and her recently relaunched Soft Hands Knit Club, helps too.

Working in a creative field has its own challenges. But Emhoff says her mother, Kerstin, who works as a film producer and heads a creative entertainment studio, has always given her the best outlook on her career.

""One of the best things she's told me is just don't give up,"" she says. ""When you're in a non-traditional career path like I am, it's really easy to want to give up when the stream of income is lost, or you're feeling like your engagement is down and you want to just quit and get a normal job. I love to threaten her that I'm going to go and just get a corporate job, but she's always been a really big proponent of the message I have in mental health and crafting and community, and it's pushed me a lot farther than I ever thought.""

Emhoff says she's also gotten good advice from her stepmother Harris, especially about recovering from a setback after losing the 2024 presidential election.

""After she gave her concession speech, she sat down with us and said, 'This is not the end. This is just a bump in the road.' And I really do believe that,"" Emhoff says. ""There have been hard times before. We are in an especially hard time. But we have gotten out of hard times, and the only way to get through that is with believing and not letting up.""

""I think we collectively need to get into that same headspace of just kicking butt,"" she adds.

While many investors welcome a windfall, the rules for inherited individual retirement accounts are complicated — and mistakes can be costly.   

Since 2020, certain inherited accounts are subject to the ""10-year rule,"" and heirs must empty the balance by the 10th year after the original account owner's death.  

Plus, some non-spouse beneficiaries, commonly adult children, must begin taking required minimum distributions, or RMDs, in 2025 over the 10-year period, or face a hefty IRS penalty. 

Inherited IRA planning is important amid the ""great wealth transfer,"" with more than $100 trillion expected to change hands through 2048, according to a December report from Cerulli Associates.   

Stories for investors who are retired or are approaching retirement, and are interested in creating and managing a steady stream of income:

Here are three of the biggest inherited IRA mistakes and how to avoid them, according to financial advisors.

For non-spouse heirs, ""the [inherited IRA] rules can get complex fast, and it's critical to know your options,"" said certified financial planner Brett Koeppel, founder of Eudaimonia Wealth in Buffalo, New York.

The ""10-year rule"" and new RMD requirement for 2025 apply to most non-spouse beneficiaries, such as adult children, if the original IRA owner reached RMD age before their death.

If you fail to take inherited IRA RMDs for 2025, you could be subject to a 25% IRS penalty on the amount you should have withdrawn. However, you could reduce that fee to 10% by disbursing the correct amount within two years and filing Form 5329. In some cases, the IRS may waive the penalty entirely.

If you inherit a pretax IRA, you can expect to pay regular income taxes on withdrawals, which may require tax planning during the 10-year drawdown, experts say.

Some heirs aim to take only their RMD for the first nine years and a lump sum in year 10. But this could mean ""significant taxes in that final year of distribution,"" said CFP John Nowak, founder of Alo Financial Planning in Mount Prospect, Illinois. He is also a certified public accountant.

Instead, you should run multi-year tax projections to decide the best withdrawal amounts for each year, experts say. For example, it might make sense to accelerate distributions during temporary lower-income years.

Another common mistake is failing to change inherited IRA assets, according to CFP Jamie Bosse, a senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.

Ideally, the investments should match your risk tolerance, goals and timeline. ""It's your money now and should be allocated according to your needs,"" she said.

However, when choosing investments, you need to weigh your tax liability, yearly RMD and income needs, said Nowak with Alo Financial Planning.

For example, holding certificates of deposit in your IRA with a maturity date beyond your RMD window could be ""difficult or costly to distribute,"" he said.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took ""no"" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude.

Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast.

When asked what she was like as a 25-year-old prosecutor, Harris responded: ""She was fearless. She didn't hear 'no it can't be done.'""

Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home.

""All the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom, and I asked the judge: 'Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend,'"" Harris said.

""And the clerk was like: 'no, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day.' And I would not leave, and they called the case.""

This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California.

""Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed,"" she added.

In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump.

Harris admitted that she experienced imposter syndrome in her career, especially when she was first elected district attorney in 2004.

""And there I was, sitting in the office, and I thought: 'Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States,'"" the former vice president said on the podcast, adding that she felt a great responsibility in her role.

However, she put a positive spin on imposter syndrome, saying there's nothing wrong with having a little humility.

""I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, "" she said.

At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her.

""When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are,"" she added.  ""That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself.""

In this article

American consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree.

Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad ""liberation day"" tariffs.

Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.

And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.

LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.

The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.

Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.

That translates to around $132 per shopper.

Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.

""For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.

""While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,"" Schulz said.

""That's a choice no one wants to have to make.""

Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.

Schultz agreed, calling it an ""unfortunate reality"" that many consumers will have to face.

""That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,"" Schulz said.

""I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want,"" he said. ""However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.""

LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.

Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.

Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.

In this article

The focus on dividend stocks is growing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another rate cut. Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return.

In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

We start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. In Q3 2025, Valero returned $1.3 billion to stockholders via $351 million in dividends and $931 million in share repurchases. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.52, VLO stock offers a yield of 2.7%.

Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180.

""We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution,"" said Mehta.

The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026.

In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield.

Mehta ranks No. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%.

We move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. On October 14, Albertsons announced a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on November 7. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, ACI stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.

Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company ""accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform.""

Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines.

The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. In fact, For U membership increased more than 13% year-over-year in Q2 FY25, reaching over 48 million active participants. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth.

Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. He expects ACI stock to deliver a total return of close to 50%, including dividends.

Feinseth ranks No. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.2%.

Finally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield.

Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. In a preview on the Q3 results of the companies in the U.S. midstream space, Scotto stated that Williams and Targa Resources (TRGP) are her favored names into the earnings.

Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, ""WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects.""

Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.

Scotto views WMB's February analyst day as the next catalyst for the stock. The analyst expects WMB to increase its EBITDA growth target from the range of 5% to 7% to high single digits or more.

Scotto ranks No. 270 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.7%.

At one point, it was Europe's most valuable company. 

Now, as Danish pharmaceutical group Novo Nordisk prepares to publish its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the picture looks very different.

CNBC's Charlotte Reed will travel to Copenhagen to speak with the company's new CEO Mark Doustdar, a 30-year veteran of the company, who has been in the top job since August. 

It's not been an easy ride so far, with the group announcing a sharp decline in sales, pressure on profit, a round of jobs cuts and continued competition from U.S. rivals when it comes to the blockbuster obesity drug market.

Despite this, Berenberg is positive on the stock, saying Novo has hit ""peak uncertainty.""

""Novo's superior growth profile and best-in-class R&D returns warrants a higher valuation premium to its peers,"" the bank added. 

Other analysts are less forgiving. 

Jefferies recently cut the stock's rating to underperform, citing competitive pressure in the U.S. and pricing concerns. Meanwhile, UBS analysts are concerned Novo's 8 billion Danish krone ($1.23 billion) one-off cost related to its restructuring has not been fully reflected on the bottom line, while adding that investors are continuing to question the group's lack of consumer experience in the American market.

On Oct. 17, U.S. President Donald Trump told a press conference that the price of Novo's blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic would be ""much lower"" as part of the administration's negotiations over pricing with the company.

The share price has been under pressure since the start of the year.

Novo Nordisk is also preparing to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting on Nov. 14 to elect a new board. This follows the shock resignation of the company's chair and 6 other directors amid speculation of a dispute with the holding company Novo Holdings.

This disruption at the top has done little to slow down M&A activity, however. Last week, Novo entered the bidding war for biotech group Metsera with a $9 billion bid to rival Pfizer's. Novo said in a statement that the acquisition would be ""in line with the long-term strategy of... treating millions more people living with obesity and diabetes.""

Earlier in October, Novo offered $5.2 billion for Akero Therapeutics, an American group focused on treating liver disease.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Analysis: Bitcoin's 'Silent IPO' and Holder Base Transformation","https://bitbo.io/news/bitcoin-silent-ipo-analysis/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 07:00:17 GMT","

Recent analysis by Jordi Visser suggests that Bitcoin's current price consolidation is not a sign of weakness, but rather a critical transition resembling a traditional IPO distribution period.

Despite risk assets like tech stocks and gold rallying, Bitcoin has remained stagnant, leading to widespread frustration. As Visser observes:

“Twitter is filled with variations of the same anxious question: ‘Why isn't BTC pumping with everything else?'”

He notes the correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq broke down in late 2024, confusing traders who expected Bitcoin to move with broader markets.

Instead, Visser argues, Bitcoin is experiencing a period where early holders are methodically distributing their coins—much like post-IPO selling in traditional markets.

A compelling example cited is the Galaxy Digital earnings call, where Mike Novogratz revealed the sale of $9 billion in Bitcoin for a single customer. Visser explains:

“This isn't retail panic. This isn't some trader getting shaken out. This is one of the OG players in the space methodically exiting a massive position.”

On-chain data corroborates this, showing dormant coins from early adopters becoming active, with distribution unfolding gradually rather than through panic selling.

Data on bitcoin long term holder supply and hodl waves can help visualize these trends.

Visser distinguishes the current period from past bear markets by emphasizing robust fundamentals:

ETFs, institutional adoption, and network security are all strong. He states:

“The sellers aren't selling because they've lost faith. They're selling because they've won.”

Retail capitulation and negative sentiment are seen as typical during such ownership transitions, not as signs of collapse.

Drawing parallels to post-IPO phases in companies like Amazon and Google, Visser argues that as Bitcoin ownership becomes more distributed, volatility will likely decrease and the asset will mature into a more stable, institutional-grade investment. As he puts it:

“Each Bitcoin that transfers from concentrated hands to distributed hands makes the network more resilient. Makes the price more stable. Makes the asset more mature.”

This transition, he concludes, sets the stage for deeper institutional adoption and positions Bitcoin for long-term resilience.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Enters Deep Red Zone — Impact On Price?","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:7594b35ae094b:0-bitcoin-coinbase-premium-gap-enters-deep-red-zone-impact-on-price/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 17:00:46 GMT","

The price of Bitcoin closed the historically bullish month of October on a loss for the first time in seven years. While the month started in typical fashion—on a bullish tear, the intense downturn didn't begin until October 10, when US President Donald Trump threatened new trade tariffs on China.

Now, although the United States and China seem to have found a temporary truce, the cryptocurrency market has been unable to find similar relief. In fact, the latest on-chain data suggests that US investors are still less optimistic about the digital asset market, specifically Bitcoin.

Negative Coinbase Gap Premium Coincides With Massive ETF Outflows 

In a November 1st post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the world's largest cryptocurrency has seen extremely low demand in the United States in recent days. The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which has entered a deep red territory in the past few days.

This on-chain metric measures the difference between the Bitcoin price on the US-based Coinbase exchange (USD pair) and the global Binance exchange (USDT pair). A positive difference indicates that the flagship cryptocurrency has a higher value on Coinbase than on Binance.

When the Coinbase Premium Gap is positive, it implies that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively. On the flip side, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap typically indicates heavy selling pressure for the market leader.

According to data highlighted by Maartunn, this on-chain metric is back around -$80, reflecting significant selling pressure from the US institutional players. This reduced demand can be seen with the disappointing performance of the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent days.

Data from SoSoValue shows the Bitcoin ETFs registered a total net outflow of more than $191 million on Friday. This marked the third consecutive day of negative outflows, having seen withdrawals of nearly $500 million each on Wednesday and Thursday.

From a historical perspective, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap is often correlated with periods of sluggish or downward movement for the BTC price. Hence, with the current intense selling pressure from large US investors, it is difficult to see the premier cryptocurrency making a strong recovery in the coming days.

Bitcoin Price At A Glance

As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $110,200, reflecting a measly 0.9% jump in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is down exactly 1% in the last seven days.

Bitcoin's quantum reckoning may still be years away, but the fear has already arrived. Breakthroughs from Google, Caltech, and IBM have reignited debate over a looming “Q-Day”—the moment when a quantum computer could shatter the cryptography securing Bitcoin and decentralized finance.

Yet experts warn that the real danger may come first from people—not equations—with panic, premature market reactions, and slow developer preparation could shake confidence long before any code actually fails.

In crypto, panic spreads faster than reason. The market may run on code, but emotion still moves the price.

Yoon Auh, founder of post-quantum cryptography company BOLTS Technologies, warned that even one mistaken claim about quantum computers breaking Bitcoin could set off a chain reaction, pointing to a recent flash crash in the market last month.

“Crypto had a little flash crash,” Auh told Decrypt. “A $50 to $100 million sell-off—basically nothing in traditional markets—triggered massive losses across blockchain assets. That shows how fragile the system still is.”

Earlier this month, a single post from President Donald Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese imports triggered the largest single-day crypto wipeout in history, erasing $19 billion in liquidations as Bitcoin briefly plunged below $102,000.

Auh said the same dynamic could unfold after a quantum scare: “Imagine hearing someone say, ‘[Elliptic-curve cryptography] can be broken now, maybe not instantly, but soon.' Everyone would rush for the exit. The system would trip over itself.”

The industry has seen it before. In 2017, a false 4Chan post claiming Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had died erased billions in market value before traders realized it was fake. The sell-off showed how quickly trust can collapse when information outruns verification.

Quantum computers operate on principles that differ from anything in classical computing. Instead of bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states at once. When qubits become linked—a property called entanglement—they can process many possibilities simultaneously. That property makes certain kinds of math, like factoring and discrete logarithms, exponentially more efficient to solve.

In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could, in theory, break the encryption securing everything from credit cards to Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin relies on elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, which turns private keys into public ones through equations that are easy to compute, but practically impossible to reverse.

A large-enough quantum computer could run Shor's algorithm to invert that math, revealing the private key behind any exposed public key on the blockchain.

Bitcoin's specific system, known as secp256k1, uses these elliptic-curve equations to generate and verify signatures. A quantum computer powerful enough to perform these calculations could recover private keys and empty wallets associated with visible public keys. A 256-bit elliptic-curve key provides roughly the same classical security as a 3,072-bit RSA key—extremely strong by today's standards.

For now, that danger remains theoretical. The world's largest quantum processors—IBM's Condor with 1,121 qubits and Caltech's neutral-atom array exceeding 6,000 qubits—are far from the millions of physical qubits needed to produce even a few thousand logical qubits for fault-tolerant computation.

Current research suggests that around 2,000 to 3,000 logical qubits would be required to break Bitcoin's elliptic-curve encryption with Shor's algorithm. Reaching that level will likely take another decade or more, though optimistic projections by IBM and Google place such machines in the early to mid-2030s.

“The quantum threat to cryptography is real and serious,” Edward Parker, a physicist at the RAND Corporation, told Decrypt. “Some people think quantum computers will never threaten encryption, and that might be true. But there's enough risk that we need to prepare well ahead of time.”

That measured caution often gets twisted online, and warnings meant to spark discussion and preparation instead fuel a wave of alarmism, and exaggerated ‘quantum apocalypse' rhetoric.

The U.S. government is already moving in that direction. A 2022 presidential directive, National Security Memorandum 10, ordered federal agencies to begin upgrading to post-quantum encryption—a rare case of long-term coordination across departments. Parker pointed to research in 2023 led by cryptographer Michele Mosca that put the median estimate for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer around 2037.

Research scientist Ian MacCormack agreed that public fear has run ahead of what the technology can actually do.

“Quantum computers are nowhere near powerful enough to break RSA-2048 or any encryption of meaningful size,” he said. “Getting the error rates down and combining thousands of qubits to do something practical will take time, money, and trial and error.”

MacCormack said the mystique of quantum computing, however, often amplifies fear.

“People hear about quantum computing and it sounds god-like or incomprehensible,” he said. “But regardless of its potential, it's just an incredibly difficult engineering problem. Developing quantum-resistant encryption will almost certainly happen faster than building a quantum computer capable of breaking current encryption.”

Coin Metrics co-founder and Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter recently called quantum computing “the biggest risk to Bitcoin.” In his essay ""Bitcoin and the Quantum Problem,"" he notes that nearly a quarter of all Bitcoin—about 4 million coins—already sits in addresses that have exposed public keys. Those are theoretically vulnerable once practical quantum decryption arrives. Confidence in Bitcoin's unbreakable math could fracture long before the math itself does.

Even though the threat is distant, experts say the time to act is now—but it depends on broad coordination.

Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of post-quantum cybersecurity company QuSecure, said the next step is clear: elliptic-curve cryptography has to go.

“You'd need to replace that with one of the post-quantum standardized algorithms like ML-DSA,” she told Decrypt.

ML-DSA, short for Module Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, is a new post-quantum cryptography standard developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It's built on lattice-based math, a branch of cryptography that hides information within multidimensional grids of numbers.

Cracking those grids would require solving what's known as the “Learning With Errors” problem—an equation so complex that even a powerful quantum computer can't untangle it efficiently. That makes ML-DSA far more resistant to decryption than the elliptic-curve systems used in Bitcoin today.

Only a few blockchains today are truly quantum-resistant, while most are still adapting to post-quantum cryptography.

Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) was built for quantum safety, using the XMSS hash-based signature scheme standardized by NIST. Cellframe and Algorand use lattice-based algorithms from the NIST suite—Crystals-Dilithium, FALCON, and NTRU—allowing flexible, modular upgrades as standards evolve. IOTA relies on Winternitz one-time signatures in its “Tangle” network, protecting transactions from quantum key recovery. Nervos Network combines classical and lattice-based systems in a hybrid model that enables gradual migration to post-quantum security.

Major chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana remain in transition. Ethereum's 3.0 roadmap includes active research and testnets for post‑quantum signatures, while Bitcoin's modular Taproot and Schnorr upgrades provide the groundwork for integrating future quantum‑safe cryptography.

That kind of upgrade is feasible, but politically complex. Bitcoin's security model relies on network-wide consensus among miners, developers, and node operators. Any cryptographic change would require a fork, and that process takes years of discussion and testing.

“Quantum computing can sound abstract,” Krauthamer said. “But the fix is surprisingly straightforward. We already have the math. Governments are mandating quantum-safe standards, and finance will follow. The hard part is making people care before it's urgent.”

Most experts say the safest path is gradual: add post-quantum support now through new address types or hybrid signatures, get custodians and wallets to use them for new funds, and slowly migrate older wallets. That prevents the chaos of everyone rotating keys at once—a scenario that could damage confidence faster than any real quantum attack.

Bitcoin contributors have already explored post-quantum signatures and hybrid schemes in developer forums. The challenge isn't finding algorithms; it's deciding when and how to deploy them.

Scott Aaronson, a computer science professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Bitcoin's decentralized model makes upgrades difficult.

“With Ethereum and most other chains, someone can decide to migrate to quantum-resistant crypto when it becomes urgent,” he told Decrypt. “With Bitcoin, you'd need a majority of miners to agree to a fork. And something like $100 billion worth of early coins are still protected only by ECC.”

That lack of central authority could slow adoption. A split or rushed rollout might fracture the network. Still, many Bitcoin developers argue that once a viable upgrade path exists, consensus will form around working code.

Ethereum and Solana have more flexible governance and could adapt faster. Bitcoin's caution has protected it from bad ideas, but that same conservatism makes big changes hard to implement.

A quantum computer powerful enough to break Bitcoin's encryption doesn't exist yet. Current prototypes count qubits in the thousands, but not the millions of error-corrected qubits required for stable, scalable attacks.

Late last month, Google announced a new milestone in its quantum research: Its 105-qubit “Willow” processor completed a physics simulation in just over two hours that would take the Frontier supercomputer more than three years to reproduce. The experiment used 65 active qubits across 23 circuit layers, and achieved median two-qubit gate errors near 0.0015. The result marked a verifiable quantum speed-up but posed no threat to encryption—progress, not peril.

Even researchers who view quantum computing as a long-term threat say the real danger is still years away.

“I think quantum computation has a reasonable probability—say, more than five percent—of being a major, even existential, long-term risk to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Christopher Peikert, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan, told Decrypt. “However, it doesn't appear to be a real risk in the next few years. Quantum-computing technology and engineering still have too far to go before they can threaten modern cryptography.”

The harder part, Peikert added, will be performance once post-quantum systems are deployed. “Post-quantum signatures use much larger keys,” he said. “Since cryptocurrencies rely on many signatures for transactions and blocks, switching to post-quantum or hybrid signatures would significantly increase network traffic and block sizes.”

As for near-term protection, Peikert said the best mitigation is behavioral, not technological.

“In the short term, one should avoid revealing public keys on a public network until absolutely necessary, and give those keys short lifetimes,” he said. “Longer-term, core protocols should be carefully updated to incorporate post-quantum cryptography for the most important functionalities and assets.”

Express agrees that quantum computing won't break Bitcoin anytime soon; what matters is whether the community can stay calm when it does.

Elon Musk, the Tesla billionaire whose electric car company holds more than $1 billion worth of bitcoin, has again warned the U.S. is hurtling toward bankruptcy (just as U.S Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issued a surprise bitcoin endorsement).

Musk, who has set crypto alarm bells ringing by moving some of the near-$1 billion worth of bitcoin he also controls via his rocket company SpaceX, helped U.S. president Donald Trump back into the White House last year with his dire warnings of imminent financial catastrophe.

Now, as traders brace for the “mother of all” Federal Reserve pivots, Musk has warned it's not possible to solve the U.S. debt crisis without growing the economy at a fantastic pace—something that bitcoin supporters think will blow up the bitcoin price.

“It would be accurate to say that even unless you could go like super draconian … on cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country then …. there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis,” Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan. 

U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $38 trillion U.S. debt pile.

“The interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget and growing. This is crazy,” Musk told Rogan during their marathon, three-hour conversation.

Musk, who joined the Trump administration via his Doge department of government efficiency, dramatically fell out with president Donald Trump earlier this year over Trump's signature tax and spend bill that's expected to add trillions of dollars to the national debt over the next decade. 

Musk then confirmed speculation his new America Party would adopt bitcoin, calling the U.S. dollar and other so-called fiat currencies that aren't backed by assets, “hopeless.”

However, Musk appears to have since all-but given up on the idea of preventing the U.S. from falling into “bankruptcy” via cost-cutting. 

“Even if you implement all these savings, you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when America becomes goes bankrupt,” Musk said. 

“I came to the conclusion that the only way that the only way to get us out of the debt crisis and to prevent America from going bankrupt is AI and robotics. We need to grow the economy at a rate that allows us to pay off our debt.""

The spiraling U.S. debt pile topped $38 trillion last month, up, $500 billion in October alone, according to analysts with The Kobeissi Letter.

“It is a horrible, no good situation,” Anthony Pompliano, a bitcoin and crypto influencer and the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, wrote in an emailed note.

“The only thing I know to do is opt-out of the broken system with some portion of my economic value. The higher the national debt goes, the higher bitcoin will go. And it doesn't appear either of them will stop any time soon.”

The bitcoin price has soared in recent years alongside the swelling U.S. debt pile, with traders this year naming its rally along with gold as the “debasement trade.”

“In the long term, the investment case for bitcoin and other risk assets remains intact,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and cofounder of The Coin Bureau, said via email.

The bitcoin price topped $126,000 per bitcoin in early October but has failed to maintain the rally that's seen it more than double from its 2024 lows, dropping back as traders pile into gold and stocks while the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to further cut interest rates and loosen its monetary policy.

“We're seeing easing monetary conditions across the globe—not just the U.S.—so fiat currency debasement is inevitable,” Puckrin said. ""In the short term, though, volatility still reigns supreme. Any trader considering high leverage in this market should think long and hard before committing.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has opined that ""incorruptibility"" is the blockchain's ""most important"" property. 

The billionaire prodigy has once again amplified the ZKSync project on social media, which serves as the scaling solution for the layer-1 network. ZK-rollups help to dramatically reduce gas fees and speed up transactions. 

The ZKSync Atlas upgrade, which was launched earlier this October, makes it possible to process up to 30,000 transactions per second (TPS). 

Earlier, Buterin opined that ZKsync had been doing ""a lot of underrated and valuable work"" within the ecosystem. 

Is Ethereum actually incorruptible? 

That said, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, one of the most vocal Bitcoin enthusiasts, argues that the ship had already sailed with Ethereum Classic (ETC), the original chain that did not implement the DAO hard fork back in 2016 following the infamous hack. 

Some Bitcoin proponents also took issue with Ethereum's ""premine"" and the lack of a supply cap. 

Other critics also took issue with the fact that the blockchain had ditched proof-of-stake. 

One commentator has also noted that Ethereum heavily relies on layer-2s, which makes it rather vulnerable. ""Ethereum L1 is practically incorruptible. But L2s are not there yet. And since Ethereum's long-term strategy relies on L2s, we cannot call Ethereum fully incorruptible until they mature,"" one commentator said.

Ethereum's been buzzing lately, huh? Talk of a price surge is in the air, and let me tell you, it's catching the eye of everyone from hardcore investors to casual observers in the crypto space. Some experts are throwing around predictions that ETH could hit $10,000 by 2025-2026. But what's the real deal behind this optimism? Let's dive into what might be fueling the Ethereum hype train and what it means for crypto payroll systems.

First off, we can't ignore the elephant in the room: institutional demand. More and more, big financial players are waking up to Ethereum's potential. This isn't just about them buying up ETH; it's about them getting involved in decentralized finance (DeFi) and crypto banking. Startups in the fintech area are gonna want to hop on this bandwagon and create products that cater to this growing market.

Take Ethereum's smart contracts, for example. They can help startups automate complex financial agreements, which is a win for cost reduction and trust. And let's not forget the crypto payroll systems that could arise from this trend, allowing companies to pay employees in cryptocurrency effortlessly. As institutional interest grows, so does the number of startups interested in crypto banking solutions.

Now let's talk tech. The upcoming Pectra upgrade is looking to make Ethereum more scalable and efficient, which is exactly what businesses using crypto payroll systems need. With lower transaction fees and faster processing times, Ethereum can support a range of applications, from stablecoin salaries to decentralized lending platforms.

But it doesn't stop there. New technologies like Web3 and AI are also coming into play. Startups can leverage these innovations to provide tailored financial services. Crypto payroll isn't just some passing fad; it could be a legit alternative to traditional banking.

And then, there's the regulatory environment. It's evolving, and the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) are serious business. They're bringing strict compliance rules to crypto payroll platforms, aiming to boost consumer protection and fight against money laundering. But for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it could create a bit of a headache.

SMEs have to deal with stuff like licensing, AML/KYC compliance, and transaction monitoring. Sure, it might bump up their costs, but in the long run, it could create a more secure space for crypto transactions. 

As crypto payroll systems gain traction, there are plenty of myths floating around. Here are the top 10 myths debunked:

What does all this mean? Ethereum's price predictions and institutional demand are clearly shaping the future of crypto payroll systems and the financial landscape. Assuming the Pectra upgrade and regulations keep pace, it seems like crypto payroll is heading for the mainstream. Early adopters might just find themselves in a prime position to capitalize on these changes.

The Ethereum price prediction discussion has intensified after steady bids returned to large-cap cryptocurrencies. Ethereum holds the second spot in terms of value and remains the primary settlement token for DeFi and NFTs. The focus now is whether momentum can carry ETH through year-end and what could benefit most if it does.

This is where Remittix enters the discussion. It is an ETH-aligned build that aims to convert on-chain value into money that can reach bank accounts. The angle is simple. If an Ethereum Price Prediction is bullish, a payments-first ETH project like Remittix can gain because demand is tied to use.



Ethereum currently trades near $3,892 with a market cap of around $470 billion and a 24-hour volume near $24 billion, signalling active flows into the crypto market. The $3,800 area acts as a nearby support, and $4,000 remains a level to watch for a break. A hold above support keeps the Ethereum Price Prediction tilted upward in the near term. A clear reclaim of $4,000 would add confidence to that view.

Over the last week, news highlighted steady interest tied to exchange-traded product flows and key spot levels. Analysts noted that $3,800 support and $4,000 resistance are guiding intraday bias, with ETF flows adding follow-through when topside breaks hold.

Sentiment is cautiously positive while range conditions persist. In brief, the base case Ethereum Price Prediction leans constructive if the price holds above support and volume stays firm.





Compared with ETH, which anchors the settlement layer, Remittix focuses on the last mile. The Remittix DeFi project aims to move value from wallets to real bank accounts in many countries. That ties performance to actual payment demand, not only to market cycles.

If an Ethereum Price Prediction calls for higher activity and fees, a payment rail that converts on-chain value into fiat can benefit from the same lift and gain. This makes Remittix a cleaner play on utility within the broader crypto market.

Remittix is audited and the team is verified, and RTX holds the number one rank for Pre-Launch Tokens on Skynet with a Grade A score near 80. The wallet beta is live and expanding to more iOS users, with the top ten weekly purchasers invited.

The project reports that it has sold over 681 million tokens, is priced at $0.1166, and has raised over $27.7 million. Listings are secured with a third listing in progress. A 15% USDT referral is live, a $250,000 giveaway is active, and the RTX50 code offers a 50% bonus for a limited time as the raise nears $30 million.

Here Is What Stands Out About Remittix As Investors Look For The Best Crypto To Buy Now:

Ethereum Price Prediction narratives work when there is a clear link to usage. ETH provides the base, and projects that help people move money across borders can magnify gains when activity rises. Remittix sits in that lane and ties value to payment outcomes.

If ETH breaks and holds above key levels into the year-end, the projects that convert those flows into bank money can lead the move. That is why Remittix stands out as attention shifts to utility.

Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance.  Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there.

The crypto market has faced one of its longest and toughest periods for altcoins. Many investors who held through this phase are sitting on steep losses, with prices struggling to recover despite strong macro signals. Analyst Michael van de Poppe believes this exhaustion phase could be nearing its end.

According to him, the recent correction after the Federal Reserve's latest meeting has shaken market confidence, but the underlying data shows a shift is coming. The Fed decided to cut rates by 25 basis points and plans to end quantitative tightening by December 1. This move could mean that the tightening phase of the cycle is almost over—a condition that has historically marked the start of new bull markets.

In previous cycles, similar monetary policy changes have triggered massive runs in crypto. In 2020, when the Fed began cutting rates and launched quantitative easing, Bitcoin and altcoins entered a powerful bull phase. On the flip side, the tightening and rate hikes that began in late 2021 started the bear market investors are still feeling today.

This time, conditions again point to a transition. Inflation is no longer the Fed's main concern; employment and economic growth are taking priority. Weak labor and business data could force the Fed into more rate cuts. That would boost liquidity and create a favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

Van de Poppe said that gold, often a signal of risk-off sentiment, has recently peaked and fallen by nearly 10 percent. Historically, when gold cools off after a strong run, money begins flowing back into risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto.

Bitcoin remains in a tight range around the $109,000 level, but its valuation compared to assets like gold and copper suggests it is undervalued. Van de Poppe expects this lag to close as liquidity shifts, potentially sending Bitcoin toward $150,000–$170,000 in the coming quarters.

As Bitcoin regains momentum, altcoins are likely to follow. Many smaller cryptocurrencies are already showing signs of bullish divergence, a pattern that often marks the beginning of a recovery.

While the market reaction to the Fed meeting was negative in the short term, the longer-term setup looks increasingly favorable. The end of quantitative tightening, possible rate cuts, and a cooling gold market all point toward a return to risk-taking.

This combination could mark the early stages of a new cycle. Altcoins, which have been in deep correction for months, may finally see relief once Bitcoin breaks key resistance around $112,000.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain has earned its place in sports as core infrastructure","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:8dde5f138094b:0-blockchain-has-earned-its-place-in-sports-as-core-infrastructure/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Opinion by: Dima Saksonov, founder and CEO of Atleta Network

The sports industry has become the distribution channel for blockchain's mainstream moment. Leagues, teams and venues are running verifiable ticketing, identity and rights-management systems as mission-critical infrastructure that operates at stadium scale.

This shift has positioned sports organizations as decisive buyers that carry blockchain into everyday fan experiences.

In the earlier cycles, crypto chased shortcuts to make a name in the mainstream, and the sports industry (eagerly looking for a fresh revenue stream) has become the first to embrace this novel take on finance. Naming-rights deals put exchange logos on NBA arenas, as crypto sponsorships in sports reached a national level.

While this generated crypto brand awareness, the focus remained on visibility over embedding real, tangible value within the sports ecosystem itself. Since the last cycle, the follow-through has been an operational agenda that includes ticketing fraud prevention, verifiable player data, smarter fan engagement and transparent contracts.

Solving real problems on and off the field

Sports run on operational efficiency. This cycle, the supply side finally caught up: Blockchain teams are shipping production-ready ticketing, identity and settlement modules. The practical path is consolidation on a single, purpose-built network that clubs can standardize on across venues and partners. This allows leagues to finally integrate these systems into stadium operations, opening new revenue streams and deepening fan engagement through transparent and immutable technology.

Blockchain-based ticketing curbs fraud and enforces secondary-market rules; verifiable onchain data supports transparent athlete metrics for scouting and fantasy; and smart contracts automate multiparty agreements for sponsorships and endorsements. Analysts project that the blockchain market in the sports industry will have increased from approximately $2.05 billion in 2024 to $10 billion by 2035.

Closed, single-purpose products cannot meet league requirements. Leagues need a standardized settlement layer with one policy surface, one fee model and one observability stack. A single purpose-built sport-optimized network lets fans use one account in official team apps, while clubs plug in to the same compliant infrastructure for ticketing, loyalty and payouts.

The result is a unified loyalty identity anchored to a single network and recognized across participating leagues and clubs. Digital collectibles and perks live in one wallet and one marketplace rail, improving liquidity, data integrity, supportability and user trust.

The essential use cases — tickets, data trails, loyalty and rights management — are clear, but there remains a shortage of robust prototypes in the field. That gap highlights the need for production-grade modules that have been audited for privacy and compliance.

Governance and integrity workflows are moving, too. Blockchain architectures can enhance integrity utilized for doping control and credential verification, ensuring audits are tamper-evident and access-controlled across organizations. In practice, that means more transparent chains of custody for athlete data and faster verification for staff credentials at major events.

Fans don't need to learn new tooling. A secure mobile ticket that unlocks the turnstile, a digital collectible that redeems for a seat upgrade or a verifiable vote on a club initiative are familiar actions wrapped in better rails. Today, the wiring for the fan has disappeared. A blockchain-backed ticket can feel exactly like a normal one: You open an email, flash a QR code and walk through the turnstile.

You don't need to know how QR codes work or that the email itself operates on a different protocol to use all three layers effortlessly. The chain hums in the background, while the experience stays familiar. The lasting lesson is that product-market fit lies in repeatable, embedded interactions.

The excitement of sports reaches fans across all ages and geographies, extending beyond typical crypto user profiles. When secure mobile tickets, verifiable collectibles and loyalty mechanics live inside official team apps, the chain functions as an invisible rail that meets people where they already are. Stadium routines, including entry scans, seat upgrades and postgame rewards, become repeat onchain interactions that build familiarity week after week.

Where the value accrues

Budgets have begun to migrate from splashy sponsorships to multi-year software and settlement contracts that touch every matchday like ticket issuance, access control, loyalty accrual and rights accounting.

Vendors that demonstrate measurable drops in ticket fraud, predictable secondary-market royalties and faster payout logic for performance incentives will win league-wide agreements. Procurement will favor a single network that integrates with existing fan databases and stadium turnstiles, hides wallet complexity inside official apps and provides auditable data to regulators on demand.

This reframes how to judge “winning” chains. Venue-scale throughput in tight windows matters; think hundreds of thousands of scans around kickoff, as do privacy guarantees that pass data-protection audits. A common settlement layer reduces risk while simplifying vendor management.

The stack must be modular on a single chain: pluggable data availability, configurable permissions and standards for verifiable credentials recognized across the network without fragmenting the fan journey. Ultimately, the winning solutions will deliver on three core promises: transparency, automation and verifiable settlement.

Sports are no longer just a marketing vehicle for crypto; they are a proving ground where blockchain becomes indispensable infrastructure. Fans are already interacting with the technology when they buy a ticket, vote on a team decision or trade a verified digital collectible, often without even realizing it.

The next phase of adoption is driven by practical wins that make venues safer, settlements cleaner and fan journeys smoother — the kind of incremental gains that compound across seasons.

One chain that earns its place in stadium infrastructure earns a path into mainstream consumer life.

Home » Crypto Market News » How Israel Became a Global Hub for Blockchain Innovation

From classrooms to military units, a look at the driving engines behind Israel's Web3 surge.

For a country of just 9.3 million people, Israel has emerged as a global force in blockchain and Web3 innovation. 

From elite military tech units to top-tier universities and a booming startup scene, the nation has built an ecosystem that turns ambitious ideas into market-ready solutions, attracting billions in venture capital and producing some of the sector's most influential startups. How did they do it?

Israel's rise in deep-tech and cybersecurity is the foundation for its blockchain success. Home to over 1,400 deep-tech startups, including five AI unicorns, the country ranks among the world's leaders in data analytics and machine learning research.

Sponsored

Cybersecurity, Israel's strongest sector, alone drew 38% of all tech investment in 2024 and has grown 86% over the past decade, more than double the broader tech sector.

Much of this innovation originates in Israel's unique mix of military and academic expertise. Many blockchain founders are veterans of elite Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tech units such as Unit 8200 and Mamram, often called Israel's “Silicon Valley in uniform.” These programs train hundreds of specialists each year in cybersecurity, cryptography, and data infrastructure. These skills translate seamlessly into blockchain and Web3 startups.

One standout initiative is the Mamram Blockchain Incubator (M.B.I), launched by the Mamram Alumni Association, which includes over 8,000 veterans of the IDF's central computing unit. The incubator collaborates with major blockchain players like StarkWare, Fireblocks, Collider VC, and Gornitzky & Co to help early-stage ventures scale.

Israeli universities play a critical role in bridging military tech and private startups. Institutions such as the Technion, Weizmann Institute, and Hebrew University were early to integrate cryptography and blockchain into their programs, providing a steady talent pipeline.

Known as “Silicon Wadi”, the high-tech business cluster along Israel's coastal plain grew out of the 1960s defense and academic research ecosystem. Today, it stands as one of the world's most active startup hubs, continuing to drive innovation across cybersecurity, AI, and blockchain.

Israel, the home of blockchain startups like StarkWare and Fireblocks, is often described as the “startup nation” and stands out for its entrepreneurial mindset.

The culture prizes quick problem-solving, agility under uncertainty, and a high tolerance for risk, traits that fit the fast-moving world of blockchain and Web3. Failure isn't feared, but treated as a learning step that fuels smarter innovation.

A good example is Bancor, one of Israel's earliest and most ambitious blockchain startups. Launched in 2017 as a decentralized liquidity protocol, Bancor raised $153 million in one of the largest ICOs of its time. 

The project weathered market crashes and regulatory scrutiny, but its early experiments with automated market makers (AMMs) helped lay the foundation for modern DeFi. Bancor's approach went on to inspire the next generation of Israeli and global DeFi innovators.

A big part of Israel's rise in blockchain comes down to networking and mentorship. Tech veterans, investors, and successful founders regularly share their knowledge and connections with newcomers, while angel investors help early-stage teams secure both funding and guidance.

In fact, the share of angels making more than five investments jumped from 8% to 32% in 2024, and those making more than eight investments doubled to 10%.

As of 2024, Israel's Web3 ecosystem includes over 145 startups categorized into 12 sectors including blockchain infrastructure, custody, cybersecurity, gaming, hardware, NFTs, payments, risk management, real-world assets, social platforms, and trading and finance.

Respectively, the ecosystem has attracted roughly $4.5 billion in venture capital, which is about 4.5% of the global Web3 VC investment. 

For a country of just 9.3 million people in 2024, Israel's Web3 funding is remarkably high. Per capita, it outpaces most nations, showing just how influential Israel has become in the global blockchain space.

Universities such as the Technion, Weizmann Institute, and Hebrew University supply research expertise in cryptography and mathematics, working closely with startups to turn theory into practical blockchain solutions. 

Programs from Startup Nation Central connect startups to global markets, facilitating scaling and international partnerships. 

Since a significant portion of startups focus on developing solutions for global challenges, it's no surprise that most of them form partnerships with major international organizations. Companies such as GK8, Unbound, Curv and Simplex have drawn strong interest from major industry players.

Israel's Web3 scene also boasts several unicorns or startups valued at over $1 billion. Notable names like eToro, Fireblocks, and StarkWare highlight the country's growing impact in the global blockchain market.

Israel's blockchain ecosystem thrives at the crossroads of talent, capital, and institutional support. Cutting-edge research, startup accelerators, and global partnerships have created a self-sustaining engine that turns early-stage ideas into market-ready solutions.

With venture capital pouring in, Israel is set to fuel new startups and reinforce its standing as a global hub for blockchain. As Web3 and decentralized technologies grow worldwide, the country looks poised to help shape the future of the sector.

Israel has become a Web3 hub thanks to its mix of military-trained tech talent, top universities, a thriving startup ecosystem, and strong venture capital support. The country excels in blockchain, cybersecurity, and decentralized technologies, making it a global leader in innovation.

Israel's Web3 ecosystem has attracted roughly $4.5 billion in venture capital, about 4.5% of global Web3 funding. Angel investors and venture funds actively mentor and fund early-stage startups.

Israel's unique combination of military tech expertise, academic excellence, strong mentorship networks, venture capital, and a culture that embraces risk and innovation makes it a standout Web3 hub.

The NFT world has changed a lot, right? Gone are the days when it was all about digital art. Now, it's about utility and real value, and the Milk Mocha project is a prime example of this shift. It shows us that NFTs can be functional assets in a living ecosystem. Let's take a moment to unpack Milk Mocha's innovative approach and how it can redefine crypto payroll solutions for SMEs. This could enhance engagement and value for both employers and employees.

So Milk Mocha's NFTs aren't just pretty pictures. They're keys to something bigger. The $HUGS token is the only currency you can use to buy these NFTs, which creates a solid link between the collectibles and the token itself. This means they have real, recurring value. In crypto payroll, we could do something similar. Imagine linking tokens to real, functional benefits like employee rewards or governance participation. That would be something, wouldn't it?

Community involvement is huge for Milk Mocha. The Milk Mocha DAO lets token holders be part of decision-making. They can help decide themes for future NFT collections. This kind of model makes people feel involved and invested. It's important for any crypto payroll solution. If SMEs adopt this community governance model, it could boost employee satisfaction and retention. Imagine a workplace that listens and engages with its employees.

Another thing Milk Mocha does is employ deflationary mechanics. Tokens get burned during transactions and NFT upgrades. This may reduce the total supply and increase the value over time. For SMEs, a similar deflationary mechanic could help maintain or even increase token value. This might encourage employees to hold on to their tokens. It's not a bad idea, especially with stablecoin adoption on freelancer platforms rising.

Milk Mocha connects the digital and physical worlds by linking NFTs to real merch. This means employees can enjoy perks like early access to exclusive products. It makes the experience richer. If SMEs bridge the gap between digital assets and physical goods, it could create a more rewarding crypto payroll system. Employees want both digital and real-world benefits, after all.

The lessons from Milk Mocha could shake up the way SMEs adopt crypto payroll solutions. A utility-driven token ecosystem, community engagement, and deflationary mechanics could make for a more satisfying employee experience. The rise of Web3 business banking and crypto-friendly payroll platforms makes this transition easier. It opens doors for companies to hire globally with crypto and pay employees in digital currencies.

As ""Pay Me in Bitcoin"" becomes a trend among tech workers, SMEs must adapt. The insights from Milk Mocha's NFT model could help create a sustainable and motivating crypto payroll ecosystem. It could go beyond simple payments to actually engaging and rewarding employees.

Milk Mocha teaches us that for crypto payroll to work, we need to create real utility and value for tokens. Flexibility and transparency are key, as is fostering community governance. Brand engagement can't be overlooked. As the crypto-HR intersection evolves, businesses that embrace these principles will be set up for success. With potential recurring demand and employee loyalty, Milk Mocha shows us how digital collectibles can be the functional, in-demand heart of a digital economy.

Did you know that NFT marketplace trading volumes for Ethereum NFTs topped $18 billion in 2023, signaling an unstoppable rise in digital art and collectibles? As more people join the NFT space, understanding how NFT marketplaces work has never been more important. This guide explains what an NFT marketplace is, how it's powering the boom in Ethereum NFTs, and what you need to know—whether you're buying, selling, or creating. We'll cover leading platforms, compare their features, walk through step-by-step processes, share security tips, and show how creators benefit. Read on for everything you need about NFT marketplaces, with trusted examples from the best in the business.

An NFT marketplace is a digital platform where you can buy, sell, create (mint), or trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) like digital art, music, game assets, and more. Unlike regular crypto exchanges, which focus on fungible assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, NFT marketplaces handle unique, one-of-a-kind items linked to the blockchain, making each asset provably rare.

The core difference is that a standard crypto exchange matches buyers and sellers of identical coins, while an NFT marketplace matches buyers and sellers of distinct digital collectibles. For most users, the Ethereum blockchain is the main stage for NFTs, supporting vast ecosystems such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens. However, multichain options now exist too, with Polygon, Solana, and Cardano offering their own NFT experiences. Still, Ethereum's early dominance means most of the highest-profile NFTs trade there.

💡 Pro Tip: Before your first NFT purchase, always double-check which blockchain the marketplace supports—fees and supported wallets can differ.

OKX offers a secure, beginner-friendly NFT marketplace, making it easy to discover, buy, or create NFTs on Ethereum and other leading networks. Thanks to robust security and clear onboarding, even first-time users can confidently explore the world of digital collectibles.

Choosing the best NFT marketplace depends on what matters to you: fees, features, community, or security. Here's a quick look at the most popular Ethereum NFT platforms—plus how they compare on essentials:

💡 Pro Tip: OKX's NFT marketplace stands out for security (with anti-phishing alerts and escrow), fast onboarding, and fees lower than Opensea and LooksRare.

Keeping up with trending NFT collections helps you spot opportunities and stay ahead of market shifts. On major marketplaces like Opensea and OKX, you can explore rankings for Ethereum NFTs based on metrics like volume traded, number of sales, and rising floor prices.

Here's how to discover what's hot:

Some trending Ethereum NFT collections (as of early 2024):

To find hidden gems, watch for new projects that show sudden spikes in volume and positive community buzz.

With the OKX NFT marketplace, you can use advanced filters to search by trending stats, rarity, or last sale price—perfect for spotting the next breakout hit before it goes mainstream.

Getting started with buying and selling NFTs is increasingly simple, especially with beginner-friendly platforms like OKX.

Have you ever wondered how many people use Ethereum apps every day? In 2024, there were over 1 million daily active users on Ethereum dapps, spanning everything from DeFi protocols with billions in total value locked (TVL) to NFT marketplaces and blockchain-powered games. Ethereum apps (also called ""eth dapps"" and ""crypto apps"") now touch nearly every part of digital life—finance, art, gaming, social, and much more.

In this guide, you'll learn what Ethereum apps are, how experts rank the best, and step-by-step ways to get started—whether you want to swap tokens, join DAOs, mint NFTs, or try the latest on-chain game. We'll cover the top DeFi, NFT, gaming, productivity, and social apps for 2025, provide direct links to explore them, and share must-know security tips. Plus, discover how the OKX Wallet and OKX Discover portal make your journey smoother and safer. Let's dive in!

Ethereum apps, also known as decentralized applications (dapps), are blockchain-based programs that run on the Ethereum network rather than a central server. These crypto apps are open, permissionless, and transparent—meaning anyone can use or interact with them. Whether you're swapping tokens, minting NFTs, playing blockchain games, or managing your crypto wallet, you're using Ethereum dapps.

The purpose of Ethereum apps is to give users greater control, security, and flexibility. They eliminate middlemen, reduce fees, and unlock new types of on-chain interactions unthinkable in traditional finance and tech.

Many categories make up the Ethereum dapp ecosystem:

💡 Pro Tip: OKX offers a secure gateway to discovering and connecting with all major Ethereum dapps directly from their platform and wallet.

When you see a list of ""top"" ethereum apps, what makes them stand out? Key metrics help rank and compare dapps:

These metrics matter because they:

To view dapp stats in real-time, use:

OKX's ranking transparency and direct metric feeds let you confidently find the most active and safest Ethereum apps to try.

Before you use any Ethereum app, you'll need a crypto wallet. The most popular choices are browser extensions and mobile apps, like MetaMask, OKX Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. These wallets create your secure ""key"" to access all ethereum apps.

Setting up is easier than you think. Here's your fast-track:

OKX Wallet is designed for beginners, offers built-in phishing protection, and supports thousands of Ethereum dapps across desktop and mobile.

Download OKX Wallet

💡 Pro Tip: Always double-check app URLs and use hardware wallets for large balances.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the backbone of Ethereum dapps, powering swaps, lending, and yield opportunities. Here are the standouts for 2025:

You can connect directly to all these dapps with OKX Wallet and use OKX to bridge funds from other networks if needed.

Explore DeFi with OKX

NFTs have exploded in popularity. Now, creators and collectors can mint, trade, and showcase unique items across platforms.

Minting tools include:

OKX Wallet lets you store, view, and trade NFTs inside your wallet. The in-app NFT Explorer shows collection activity and floor prices so you can mint or shop on the go.

Web3 social and on-chain identity are Ethereum's most human sides. No more gatekeepers—your username, posts, and following live on-chain.

Using OKX Wallet, users can log in to dapps and web3 platforms with their ENS or other identity—enabling smooth social connections and verified, on-chain addresses.

Ethereum's gaming landscape is booming with on-chain economies, tradable loot, and user-powered worlds. Here's what's hot:

To get started:

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) let you and others run organizations via on-chain rules and votes—no CEOs needed.

Top DAO platforms:

OKX Wallet supports DAO interactions, letting users join, participate, and even launch new communities directly from their wallet.

Managing crypto doesn't stop at trading or collecting. Analytics and dashboards help you track, analyze, and optimize your portfolio effortlessly.

Analytics/insights:

You can link your OKX Wallet in most dashboards to track both centralized and decentralized assets in one view.

Safety is critical in the world of Ethereum apps. Common risks include phishing scams, rogue dapps, and fake links—especially when connecting your wallet.

To stay safe:

💡 Pro Tip: OKX is a fully audited platform with robust wallet security checks. The OKX Wallet includes scam-filtering and gives warnings about risky dapps.

Ethereum never stands still. Here are the trending dapps and emerging categories for 2025:

Track trends and new launches via DappRadar's Hot Apps, OKX Discover, and top crypto news feeds. OKX's Discover feed is updated daily—pinpoint ""hot"" trends before the crowds.

Focus on your goals—do you want to swap tokens, mint NFTs, or join a DAO? Always check the app's TVL, unique wallet activity (UAW), audits, and the team's community reputation. Safety and fit matter more than hype.

No app is 100% safe, but look for regular security audits, open-source code, and security plugin compatibility. Start with apps linked from official/community portals and stay updated on new safety tools. Using trusted platforms like OKX adds extra protection.

MetaMask is popular, but not required. Alternatives like OKX Wallet or Coinbase Wallet work on both desktop and mobile, and many support multi-chain networks and better security features. Choose what fits your needs and device best.

Visit analytics portals like DappRadar, Alchemy, or OKX Discover. Dashboards at Dune, Nansen, and Etherscan provide live stats on usage, transaction volume, and trending dapps. Many wallets also offer built-in analytics views.

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) connect your wallet/app to the blockchain. Top providers include Infura, Alchemy, and QuickNode, each with high reliability and speed. The right RPC keeps dapps running fast and error-free.

Ethereum apps empower you to do much more—from DeFi investing, NFT trading, on-chain gaming, building social identities, joining DAOs, or automating your personal finance with analytics dapps. There's something for every interest and experience level.

Start by picking a secure wallet (like OKX Wallet), choose dapps that match your goals, and always double-check sites for safety. The world of ethereum apps is growing fast—check out OKX Discover or wallet integration for instant access to the latest and best options. 

Risk disclaimer: All dapp activities carry risk. Never share your seed phrase or private keys with anyone. Work only with audited, well-reviewed apps and use safety plugins to minimize threats.","{'href': 'https://www.okx.com', 'title': 'OKX'}","cryptocurrency"

According to macro analyst Jordi Visser, dormant bitcoin is moving again and new buyers are stepping in. Visser spoke on Anthony Pompliano's podcast and wrote about the trend on Substack, saying old holders are slowly selling while fresh investors pick up coins on dips. He compared what's happening to an IPO (initial public offering), where early backers cash out and ownership spreads to a wider group.

Price Action Has Been Flat And Frustrating

Bitcoin traded between $109,000+ and $110,500+ over the last seven days, a range that has left traders impatient. Reports show the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returned “fear” readings since Wednesday and averaged fear during the prior week. Yet every pullback has been met by buyers, which suggests accumulation is taking place even as sentiment reads poorly.

Network Signals Remain Strong

Visser pointed to several industry signals as evidence that this is not a collapse. ETF approvals keep arriving, the bitcoin network hashrate has hit new highs, and stablecoin activity is growing.

It was a busy week with many macro catalysts (Us-China, Fed, Mag7 earnings and Zelle/Stabledoins). Pomp and I go through it all and how the last two months look for assets. https://t.co/1mv6FCNYGF

Those facts are being cited by analysts who argue the market is redistributing holdings rather than unraveling. In other words, supply is moving from long-idle wallets into hands that buy on weakness. What This Means For Volatility 

Based on Visser's view, the current phase could continue for some time. He estimates an IPO-like cycle can last about six to 18 months in traditional markets, and while bitcoin moves faster, the process may still stretch toward the six-month mark on his timeline.

When distribution finishes, one likely result is lower volatility, because ownership will be scattered across more participants instead of concentrated among early believers. No Loud Signal Expected To Mark The Shift 

Reports have disclosed that the change may not start with a big breakout or collapse. Instead, the market could simply stop grinding and begin a clearer move as distribution completes.

That lack of a single trigger is frustrating for traders who want a clear sign, but it is familiar to anyone who has watched post-IPO stocks settle after lock-up expiries.A Measured Take On The Market 

Visser's interpretation is cautious rather than bullish hype. He does not promise a rapid rally. He points to steady on-chain activity and institutional interest as the backbone supporting his thesis.

Home - Crypto Presales - Remittix ICO Heads Into Closing Stages With A Huge 50% Bonus! Why Do Many Believe It Will Replicate SHIB's & Dogecoin's Historic Runs?

Renewed excitement keeps building in the cryptocurrency market as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin remain in the limelight among investors. Retail enthusiasm stirred up by news of a Dogecoin ETF and fluctuations in the price of Shiba Inu has set off a round of speculation in altcoins.

In such an environment, Solana-based projects and utility-driven tokens are gaining traction as investors look for platforms offering real-world use cases. Amongst the newer projects, Remittix (RTX) has positioned itself well, blending innovation with real-world practicality in DeFi space solution provisions for making payments.

Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000992, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $5.83 billion and a trading volume of $171.77 million in the last 24 hours, up 27.25%. 











Dogecoin is at $0.1849, up 1.96% in the last 24 hours, and retains a market capitalization of $27.9 billion, though its trading volume has fallen 40.26% to $2.07 billion. Interest in DOGE has been revived following news of a potential Dogecoin ETF, reflecting how signals from institutions can influence retail trading patterns.












The Solana ecosystem does look promising, with more and more projects implementing DeFi and cross-chain capabilities into their systems. Among the low gas fee crypto initiatives is Remittix, choosing Solana's network for faster and cheaper transactions, hence making such platforms practical alternatives to Ethereum-based solutions.

Remittix is a token that changes hands at $0.1166 each, while it has been able to raise over $27.7 m in private funding. Over 681.8 m RTX tokens have already been sold, indicating strong community engagement of interest.


Recently, it expanded the Wallet Beta Testing Program to iOS users, allowing the top 10 purchasers every week to give their valuable feedback for refinement of the platform.

Moreover, the Remittix team has acquired full CertiK verification and is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, which attests to its commitment to security and transparency. That includes a 15% referral rewards program, crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries, and a $250,000 community give-away that sets up the token for utility and growth potential.











How Remittix Is Turning Utility Into Market Strength

Investor confidence, practical use cases, and community-driven features place Remittix among the most promising projects in DeFi during 2025. While all attention is turned to the latest events around Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Solana-based initiatives, RTX is quietly getting ready for mainstream with tangible real-world applications.

With strong market momentum, robust security credentials, and an expanding user base, Remittix has shown just how a utility-first token can take center stage among meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE. Practical payment solutions and active community involvement show that RTX is not only following trends but is actually building for long-term crypto adoption.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","The New Era of Money: CBDCs, XRP, and the Future of Digital Transactions","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/future-of-finance-cbdcs-and-xrp","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 12:45:39 GMT","

The race for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) is heating up, with central banks around the globe vying to get their digital currencies out the door. This shift is changing the game for fintech startups and established players like Ripple. Here's a closer look at how CBDCs are altering the digital finance landscape, Ripple's positioning of XRP as a bridge currency, and the new opportunities emerging in payments.

CBDCs are digital versions of a country's fiat currency, created and regulated by the central bank. Their arrival is set to shake up the way we think about money, including how we move, store, and use it. This change presents significant operational challenges for fintech startups, compelling them to adapt their traditional business models to fit with CBDC infrastructure.

With the growth of CBDCs, disintermediation might occur, wherein consumers increasingly rely on bank-sponsored digital wallets, which could limit fintechs' access to customer funds and transaction activities. But, on the flip side, this also paves the way for innovative products and services that can harness CBDC functionalities, such as automated payment systems and investment mechanisms tied to digital currency holdings.

Ripple has consistently placed itself at the forefront of the financial evolution, and acquiring Hidden Road—a global prime brokerage—was a strategic move to bolster its position in institutional finance. This acquisition enables banks and hedge funds to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem without going through intermediaries.

As banks begin rolling out their own stablecoins, Ripple's mission to interconnect isolated financial networks via the XRP Ledger becomes even more pertinent. XRP's unique ability to serve as a bridge between disparate systems positions Ripple as a vital player capable of linking these emerging silos, ensuring smooth transactions in a fragmented financial scene.

XRP stands out as a prime bridge currency, facilitating swift and cost-effective cross-border transactions. Unlike traditional banking systems or many stablecoins that depend on middlemen, XRP settles transactions on-chain in mere seconds. This is crucial in a world where banks are launching their own digital currencies, potentially creating isolated ""walled gardens"" of liquidity.

While stablecoins from banks may offer stability and regulatory confidence, XRP's decentralized nature allows for transactions across various regulatory landscapes. This positions XRP as a complementary asset, rather than a rival to stablecoins, enhancing its utility in global digital transactions.

The emergence of CBDCs and stablecoins opens up new avenues for innovation within Web3 banking. Fintech startups can harness CBDC capabilities to develop fresh financial solutions catering to consumers and businesses alike. For example, cross-border crypto payroll solutions can drive financial inclusion, enabling unbanked populations to access digital financial services.

As demand for crypto payroll solutions surges, companies may also find value in paying salaries in cryptocurrencies, tapping into the trend of workers seeking roles with crypto compensation. This not only boosts employee satisfaction but also positions firms as forward-thinking players in the ever-evolving digital economy.

The rise of CBDCs and the strategic positioning of Ripple's XRP are set to redefine digital finance. Fintech startups need to adjust to this new environment by upgrading their tech and aligning with regulatory standards. As banks scramble to launch their own digital currencies, Ripple's focus on connectivity and liquidity is a timely approach for this new reality.

In this swiftly shifting financial ecosystem, it seems that CBDCs, stablecoins, and decentralized currencies like XRP will coexist, shaping the future of digital transactions. By embracing innovation and collaboration, fintechs can navigate the obstacles and capitalize on the opportunities of this transformative financial period.

The case then moved to the Civil, Commercial, and Administrative Court. The investor sought repayment of Dh 1.5 million along with Dh100,000 in damages for financial loss, missed investment opportunities, legal fees, and other related costs. The defendant's lawyer argued that the civil case should be suspended pending appeal, maintaining that his client did not misappropriate the money, citing his criminal acquittal.

The criminal acquittal does not negate receipt of the funds; it only negates criminal intent. The court emphasised that transferring the money to another party without completing the purchase constituted unjust enrichment under Article 318 of the UAE Civil Transactions Law, which requires repayment of money taken without a legitimate reason.

TORONTO — Anticipation is building on what the federal government might say in Tuesday's budget about the buzziest corner of the crypto world.

Stablecoins, the kind of crypto asset that aims to mirror real-world currencies rather than replace them, have been growing fast enough to raise fears they could eventually destabilize Canada's finances if the country doesn't change its approach.

There have been increasing calls to simplify the rules to make it easier to launch Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins, and stem the potential outflow of capital from the country.

“At a minimum, from a sovereignty perspective, Canadians should want a Canadian stablecoin,"" said Didier Lavallée, chief executive of digital assets company Tetra Digital Group.

Concerns have risen since the United States passed legislation this past summer that establishes clear rules around the sector, and further entrenched U.S.-dollar dominance in the space that touts faster and cheaper money transfers.

Because stablecoins are meant to reflect the value of conventional currencies, issuers need to buy hard assets like dollars to back them up. No Canadian-dollar pegged stablecoins means more money flowing out of Canada, and into U.S. dollars and U.S. government bonds.

""Canada should also weigh the merits of federal stablecoin regulation,"" said Ron Morrow, executive director of payments at the Bank of Canada, in a September speech.

His former colleague Timothy Lane, who stepped down as deputy governor in 2022, was a little more blunt in an October report for the Global Risk Institute.

""Stablecoins are becoming too important to be ignored,"" said Lane.

""There is now an increasing sense of urgency about establishing a coherent framework for regulating stablecoins in Canada.""

Peter Routledge, head of Canada's banking regulator, has also said he's worried about the fast moving space and will be watching the budget closely on Nov. 4, while John Ruffolo, managing partner at Maverix Private Equity, has been one of the most outspoken in the need to respond.

One of Ruffolo's biggest worries is that some people and businesses could start to leave money in the stablecoin sphere, rather than in bank deposits.

That's already how stablecoins first gained traction: as a stable place for crypto-traders to park money between bets, without having to exchange it back into conventional currencies.

Given banks use deposits as an anchor for lending, he's warned that even if five per cent of Canadian bank deposits, or some $135 billion, went into U.S. stablecoins, it would have a knock-on effect of erasing as much as $675 billion in domestic lending capacity.

The rising calls have increased expectations of some movement from the federal government, but given how slowly past promises like open banking have actually rolled out, some companies like Tetra aren't waiting around for change before pushing ahead with their own stablecoins.

“Financial innovation in this country takes quite a long time,” said Lavallée.

Because Tetra is already registered as a Canadian trust company, Lavallée sees an easier road than others to getting regulatory approval through the current system.

Tetra's efforts have also had a boost from major backers like Wealthsimple, National Bank, ATB Financial and Shopify, which chipped in on a $10 million financing to help ready a stablecoin for release aimed at early next year.

Elsewhere, Transactix Financial Inc. announced plans in May to move forward on its own token, and just last week Loon Technology Inc. announced it had raised $3 million to get its own Canadian-dollar stablecoin going.

The companies are all working to navigate an existing system that some, at least, aren't so concerned about.

“I think it's working well,” said Grant Vingoe, head of the Ontario Securities Commission that's taken a lead role in stablecoin oversight.

While the U.S. has used legislation, Canada's approach to working with each issuer is more adaptable in the fast-moving crypto space, he said.

“There's a lot to be said for a more tailored, direct engagement approach, where you express your concerns and requirements ... rather than try and codify it once and for all.”

So far that approach has yielded a single issuer, Circle, getting the blessing of regulators for its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin.

But Vingoe is also still skeptical about how much uptake there will actually be for stablecoins.

“I think it's still an open question whether stablecoins will be used extensively as a payment mechanism.""

Improvements to the existing payment system could end up being better or more efficient, he said.

Some have pointed to central banks possibly issuing their own digital currencies, though the Bank of Canada has shelved work on such efforts.

Conventional banks are also working to adapt to the rising interest.

Swift, the private system that underpins global banking money flows, announced in late September that it was working “at pace” to add a blockchain-based digital ledger to allow real-time, round-the-clock cross-border payments.

Banks including RBC and TD Bank Group are among the more than 30 involved in the effort.

Vingoe also pointed to concerns about how widely stablecoins are used for illicit purposes, and said that overall Canada should find its own path, rather than imitating others.

“I worry a little bit about speed leading to sort of a bandwagon effect.""

While it's not clear how much growth there may be in Canada, the global market is expected to balloon.

Citigroup said in a September report that it sees the total pool of stablecoins growing from about US$200 billion at the start of 2025 to US$1.9 trillion by 2030 as its base case, or US$4 trillion in its bull case.

As for the federal government, Finance Department spokesman Benoit Sabourin said in an statement that they're working on it.

“The government continues to work closely with federal and provincial regulators to assess these risks and evaluate measures that could be considered to mitigate them, while ensuring that opportunities are not missed.”

DEX token ASTER surged as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) purchased approximately 2 million of them, sending a wave of speculative demand across the market. 

Investors interpreted the purchase as a signal of confidence from one of crypto's most influential figures, and ASTER climbed nearly 20% in response.

The underlying project behind ASTER is a rebranded derivative platform that merged from older tokens (including APX) and relaunched with a token-generation event in September 2025. ASTER's max supply is 8 billion tokens, with over half allocated to community incentives such as airdrops and strategic distribution. 

The platform packages itself as a hybrid decentralized exchange offering perpetuals and spot trading across multiple chains, with features like hidden orders and high leverage.

CZ's public endorsement — where he described ASTER's launch as a “strong start” — added fuel to the rally. On-chain data cited by analysts show ASTER's wallet amassed large sums of USDT and became one of the largest on BNB Chain outside of Binance itself. 

Although the jump is real, the risk of retreat is equally tangible. High token supply, intense competition (especially from rivals like HYPE), and a narrative-heavy boost rather than clear, sustained fundamental breakthroughs mean traders should remain vigilant of price spikes.

Yet again, the digital economy was caught off guard when Amazon Web Services suffered its second major outage this year on Oct. 20, crippling exchange platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood and the analytics service Coinmarketcap. It was followed by a second, smaller outage just 10 days later.



According to Amazon's initial report, the Oct. 20 outage was caused by a malfunction affecting one of its internal subsystems that manages its domain name service, leading to connectivity issues in multiple services. It resulted from a faulty update, and it ended up taking out Amazon's critical U.S.-East-1 region. This is a massive hub of servers that powers many of the country's top internet services. For two hours, numerous trading platforms, streaming services, payment providers and gaming networks were inaccessible to users globally.



No doubt, Amazon's engineers were working overtime to try and fix the outage, and to the company's credit the vast majority of services that reported problems were back online within a couple of hours. But the incident once again highlights the hazards of relying on centralized infrastructure, coming just months after a similar outage in Amazon's eu-north-1 region. Going offline causes pain in just about every business, but for the crypto industry, where billions of dollars in value are traded by the hour, such events are unacceptable.





Although it's quite rare for centralized cloud platforms like Amazon to go down, it does happen from time to time. And when it does, the impact is very often monumental, affecting millions if not billions of people globally. A case in point, just six months earlier, Amazon suffered a similar disruption, taking out two of the world's biggest crypto platforms — Binance and Kucoin — for several hours. Amazon isn't alone in this either, for rival clouds like Google and Microsoft Azure have suffered crippling outages of their own. In fact, Azure was down for several hours on Oct. 29, with reports suggesting it took offline numerous websites and online services.



The problem with centralized infrastructure is that it's, well, centralized. The weakness of these platforms is that they introduce single points of failure, due to the way they rely on critical components that, if taken offline, cause the entire system to come crashing down. It might be as simple as something like a computer server or a database that contains vital configuration settings, or a lone network connection that lacks redundancy. These vulnerabilities exist in every cloud, and no matter how diligent operators are they'll always present a risk.



Coinbase was among the first services to report problems in the wake of Amazon's mishap, and it stepped up quickly to reassure its users that their funds are safe and secure. But this clarity doesn't fix the underlying issues of frozen transactions and delayed market orders —hat occur when systems go offline without any warning. The longer the delay, the more the price of an asset might move, meaning the trader cannot capitalize on this. They may even lose money if the price of an asset dips shortly after they entered a position, and they're unable to sell.



While it's impossible to calculate the exact impact, it's likely that the paralysis inflicted on traders caused them pain and financial losses.





One possible way to prevent this is for crypto exchanges to at least partially switch to a more resilient, decentralized infrastructure that eliminates these single points of failure. By operating some key modules of the trading system on a distributed network of servers, exchanges will all but eliminate the potential for such calamities.



For an industry that prides itself on decentralization and constantly lauds its benefits, to be so reliant on vulnerable centralized cloud platforms for their own infrastructure feels like hypocrisy. While blockchain networks are distributed across many hundreds of nodes, very few exchange platforms can say the same, instead choosing to host all of their infrastructure on one or another cloud provider.

Fortunately, Monday's outage was not quite as serious as previous incidents have been, because Amazon had most services back up and running within a couple of hours, but nonetheless it should serve as a wakeup call for the crypto industry to get its act together. Decentralized cloud infrastructure still has teething problems around latency, network coordination and scalability, but it's maturing rapidly to support a hybrid cloud strategy at the very least. By distributing their data and systems across an expansive network, exchanges can become virtually immune to the total blackouts caused by an outage of this kind. 



Centralized clouds will always have their place due to their immense scale, high performance, enterprise-grade security and the specialized services they offer, which decentralized alternatives cannot match. They will likely remain the backbone of the internet for many years to come, but they will never be able to replicate the resilience of decentralized alternatives. With crypto exchanges commanding billions of dollars of customer funds in a market where every second counts, they need to step up and make sure this episode doesn't happen again.

Can AI Music Ever Feel Human? It's Not Just about the Sound

A personal experiment with the artificial intelligence music platform Suno's latest model echoes a new preprint study. Most listeners can't tell AI music from the real thing, but emotional resonance still demands a human story

This week I logged on to Suno, an artificial intelligence music platform. I had just read a new study that found that most participants couldn't distinguish Suno's music from human compositions, and I wanted to try it for myself. I thought of a song that meant something to me—Buffalo Springfield's “For What It's Worth.” I'd first heard the tune when I was 17 years old, sitting in my stepfather's kitchen in rural Virginia as he sang and strummed a guitar he'd made by hand. Released 30 years earlier, in December 1966, the song was a response to the Sunset Strip curfew riots—counterculture-era clashes between police and young people in Los Angeles. With my own guitar in hand, I'd set to learning the chords, trying to understand the feeling it had given me.

Now, at the computer, I prompted the AI to create a “folk-rock protest song, 1960s vibe ... male vocals with earnest tone.” The generation took seconds.

With my headphones on, I listened, imagining myself in a cafe as the song came on the sound system. Though knowing it was AI-generated made me look for signs of artificiality, I doubted I could have distinguished it from a human-made song. And though it didn't give me a frisson or make me want to play it on repeat, most songs don't.

The paper on AI music, a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed, drew from thousands of songs on a Reddit board where users post Suno-generated music. The researchers then presented the study's participants with pairs of songs and asked them to identify which of these tunes had been generated by AI. The team found that participants chose correctly 53 percent of the time—close to guessing—though when they were presented with stylistically similar human and AI songs, their accuracy reached 66 percent. But AI generation models update frequently, and by the time the study was released as a preprint, a more advanced Suno model was available.

Our relationship to music has changed in lockstep with technology. In a 2002 interview, David Bowie mused that everything about music would soon change. He predicted the transformation of its distribution and the disappearance of copyright. And to emphasize how easy it would be to access, he said, “Music itself is going to become like running water or electricity.” That hardly seemed to be a prophecy. Napster, the music sharing platform launched in 1999, had already opened the taps with electronic music sharing and piracy, making music distribution easier than ever. Then, in 2003, the iTunes store began selling songs at 99 cents a pop, and in 2008 Spotify's monthly subscription service opened the taps even wider. Since 2023 Suno has contributed to the volume of music shared online. Spotify recently announced that, over the past year, it removed 75 million “spammy” music tracks to maintain the quality of its offerings, though it is unknown how many, if any, of the removed tracks were created with Suno.

But even as AI music improves, I can't help but wonder how it will fit into our lives. I grew up with mixtapes, the precursors to playlists, made for workouts, road trips or simply sharing. They were built up from songs that either I or my friends loved. I can't imagine someone handing me a thumb drive of AI-generated tracks and saying, “There are infinitely more where these came from!”

Yet history teaches us not to underestimate how a few ingenious humans can harness new technology to express themselves. In the 1970s, as disco DJs extended and edited songs for the dance floor, remix culture was born. In the 1980s, hip-hop artists sampled funk, soul and rock songs to create new tracks. I grew up hearing people call sampling lazy and liken it to theft; a federal judge opened a 1991 landmark sampling opinion with the biblical quote “Thou shalt not steal.” When Danger Mouse spliced Jay‑Z and the Beatles into The Grey Album in 2004, the music label EMI sent cease‑and‑desist letters. Fans, however, staged “Grey Tuesday” to distribute the mash-up in protest. We now recognize art in the edit, and DJs have moved from the corner to the marquee.

But DJs have always had a relationship to their music—they sample songs they love. Although one might argue AI (which also has copyright issues) is trained on music humans love, we can't easily feel that connection; the most we can really say is that it has, in a sense, a terroir.

I struggle to see how AI music will win us over. By 2015 and 2017, research was already showing that people couldn't distinguish between human- and computer-made music. And years earlier, in 1997, composer and computer pioneer David Cope created music software. An audience that heard a pianist play its output alongside a piece by Johann Sebastian Bach thought the software's composition was the actual Bach.

So while it's reasonable to fear that talented musicians might never be heard because millions who don't play an instrument or sing are flooding the Internet with AI songs, I suspect most AI music will, like most other music, be forgotten or never noticed. Even with exceptional human music, we want more than virtuosity—an origin story, a connection. Similarly, a few rare, extraordinary AI songs will no doubt be attached to cultural moments—movies, videos, memes—or will be created by AI-music studios that give people more control over the output than text prompts can and that may allow for the creation of more innovative and personal songs.

This isn't to say that we shouldn't be cautious of musical machines. A decade after player pianos and phonographs entered mass production in the 1890s, composer John Philip Sousa warned that amateur musicians would disappear and people would become “human phonographs.” The fear wasn't misplaced. Historically, many families made music together, and that tradition has faded. Whereas parents and children used to play in the living room, teenagers now sit alone in their bedroom and blast songs on headphones. In comparing music to electricity, Bowie was speaking of a similar loss. He said musicians should be prepared to do a lot of touring, implying that live performance would be the only way to create genuine connection with audiences—“that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left,” he added.

When my stepfather taught me to play “For What It's Worth,” he was sharing a song he first heard on the radio when he was nine years old and that, at age 11, he'd learned to play by listening to a vinyl LP he'd bought for a couple of dollars. These days I hear the song often in coffee shops and yoga classes—it's back in vogue, as good a fit for today's social concerns as it was in 1966—and I notice it every time, not for its melody or lyrics or virtuosity but for its story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The bold idea that spacetime doesn't exist","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102011219.htm","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 14:31:50 GMT","

The question of whether spacetime truly exists should not be particularly controversial or even conceptually difficult once we understand what is meant by ""spacetime,"" ""events,"" and ""instants."" Believing that spacetime is a real, physical entity is no more defensible than believing in the old idea of a celestial sphere. Both are human-centered frameworks that help us describe and organize what we observe, but neither actually represents the underlying nature of reality.

Even so, declaring that spacetime does not exist often provokes disagreement across fields such as modern physics, philosophy, and science communication, as well as in popular science fiction.

This raises a deeper question: what would it mean if everything that has ever occurred or ever will occur somehow ""exists"" right now as part of an interwoven fabric?

Events are not locations

It's easy to imagine past events -- like losing a tooth or receiving good news -- as existing somewhere. Fictional representations of time travel underscore this: time travelers alter events and disrupt the timeline, as if past and future events were locations one could visit with the right technology.

Philosophers often talk this way too. Eternalism says all events across all time exist. The growing block view suggests the past and present exist while the future will come to be. Presentism says only the present exists, while the past used to exist and the future will when it happens. And general relativity presents a four-dimensional continuum that bends and curves -- we tend to imagine that continuum of the events as really existing.

The confusion emerges out of the definition of the word ""exist."" With spacetime, it's applied uncritically to a mathematical description of happenings -- turning a model into an ontological theory on the nature of being.

A totality

In physics, spacetime is the continuous set of events that happen throughout space and time -- from here to the furthest galaxy, from the Big Bang to the far future. It is a four-dimensional map that records and measures where and when everything happens. In physics, an event is an instantaneous occurrence at a specific place and time.

An instant is the three-dimensional collection of spatially separated events that happen ""at the same time"" (with relativity's usual caveat that simultaneity depends on one's relative state of rest).

Spacetime is the totality of all events that ever happen.

It's also our most powerful way of cataloguing the world's happenings. That cataloguing is indispensable, but the words and concepts we use for it matter.

There are infinitely many points in the three dimensions of space, and at every instant as time passes a unique event occurs at each location.

Positionings throughout time

Physicists describe a car traveling straight at constant speed with a simple spacetime diagram: position on one axis, time on the other. Instants stack together to form a two-dimensional spacetime. The car's position is a point within each instant, and those points join to form a worldline -- the full record of the car's position throughout the time interval, whose slope is the car's speed.

Real motion is far more complex. The car rides along on a rotating Earth orbiting the sun, which orbits the Milky Way as it drifts through the local universe. Plotting the car's position at every instant ultimately requires four-dimensional spacetime.

Spacetime is the map of where and when events happen. A worldline is the record of every event that occurs throughout one's life. The key question is whether the map -- or all the events it draws together at once -- should be said to exist in the same way that cars, people and the places they go exist.

Objects exist

Consider what ""exist"" means. Objects, buildings, people, cities, planets, galaxies exist -- they are either places or occupy places, enduring there over intervals of time. They persist through changes and can be encountered repeatedly.

Treating occurrences as things that exist smuggles confusion into our language and concepts. When analyzing spacetime, do events, instants, worldlines or even spacetime as a whole exist in the same sense as places and people? Or is it more accurate to say that events happen in an existing world?

On that view, spacetime is the map that records those happenings, allowing us to describe the spatial and temporal relationships between them.

Spacetime does not exist

Events do not exist, they happen. Consequently, spacetime does not exist. Events happen everywhere throughout the course of existence, and the occurrence of an event is categorically different from the existence of anything -- whether object, place or concept.

First, there is no empirical evidence that any past, present or future event ""exists"" in the way that things in the world around us exist. Verifying the existence of an event as an ongoing object would require something like a time machine to go and observe it now. Even present events cannot be verified as ongoing things that exist.

In contrast, material objects exist. Time-travel paradoxes rest on the false premise that events exist as revisitable locations. Recognizing the categorical difference between occurrence and existence resolves these paradoxes.

Second, this recognition reframes the philosophy of time. Much debate over the past century has treated events as things that exist. Philosophers then focus on their tense properties: is an event past, present or future? Did this one occur earlier or later than that one?

These discussions rely on an assumption that events are existent things that bear these properties. From there, it's a short step to the conclusion that time is unreal or that the passage of time is an illusion, on the identification that the same event can be labelled differently from different standpoints. But the ontological distinction was lost at the start: events don't exist, they happen. Tense and order are features of how happenings relate within an existing world, not properties of existent objects.

Finally, consider relativity. It is a mathematical theory that describes a four-dimensional spacetime continuum, and not a theory about a four-dimensional thing that exists -- that, in the course of its own existence, bends and warps due to gravity.

Conceptual clarity

Physics can't actually describe spacetime itself as something that actually exists, nor can it account for any change it might experience as an existing thing.

Spacetime provides a powerful description of how events happen: how they are ordered relative to one another, how sequences of events are measured to unfold and how lengths are measured in different reference frames. If we stop saying that events -- and spacetime -- exist, we recover conceptual clarity without sacrificing a single prediction.

High-order harmonic generation (HHG) is a process that transforms light into much higher frequencies, allowing scientists to explore areas of the electromagnetic spectrum that are otherwise difficult to reach. However, generating terahertz (THz) frequencies using HHG has remained a major obstacle because most materials are too symmetrical to support this conversion.

Graphene has long been a promising candidate for HHG research, but its perfect symmetry restricts it to producing only odd harmonics -- frequencies that are odd multiples of the original light source. Even harmonics, which are essential for expanding practical uses of this technology, have been much harder to achieve.

Quantum Materials Break the Barrier

In a recent study published in Light: Science & Applications, a research group led by Prof. Miriam Serena Vitiello has achieved a major advance in optical science. By working with exotic quantum materials, the team successfully extended HHG into new and previously unreachable parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

Their work centers on topological insulators (TIs), a special class of materials that behave as electrical insulators inside but conduct electricity along their surfaces. These materials exhibit unusual quantum behavior due to strong spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry. Although scientists had predicted that TIs could support advanced forms of harmonic generation, no one had yet demonstrated it experimentally -- until now.

Amplifying Light With Quantum Nanostructures

The researchers designed specialized nanostructures called split ring resonators and integrated them with thin layers of Bi2Se₃ and van der Waals heterostructures made from (InₓBi₁₋ₓ)2Se₃. These resonators significantly intensified the incoming light, allowing the team to observe HHG at both even and odd THz frequencies, an exceptional accomplishment.

They recorded frequency up-conversion between 6.4 THz (even) and 9.7 THz (odd), uncovering how both the symmetrical interior and the asymmetrical surface of the topological materials contribute to light generation. This result represents one of the first clear demonstrations of how topological effects can shape harmonic behavior in the THz range.

Toward Next-Generation Terahertz Technology

This experimental achievement not only validates long-standing theoretical predictions but also establishes a new foundation for developing compact terahertz light sources, sensors, and ultrafast optoelectronic components. It gives researchers a new way to study the complex interplay between symmetry, quantum states, and light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.

As industries continue to demand smaller, faster, and more efficient devices, such progress highlights the growing potential of quantum materials to drive real-world innovation. The discovery also points toward the creation of compact, tunable terahertz light sources powered by optical methods -- an advance that could reshape technologies in high-speed communications, medical imaging, and quantum computing.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A warming Earth could accidentally trigger a deep freeze","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251102011216.htm","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:04:13 GMT","

For most of Earth's history, scientists have viewed the slow breakdown of silicate rocks as the planet's main natural thermostat. In this process, rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, lands on exposed rocks, and gradually dissolves them. The carbon and calcium released eventually flow into the oceans, where they form the raw materials for shells and limestone reefs. These materials lock carbon into the seafloor for hundreds of millions of years.

""When the planet warms, rocks weather faster and absorb more CO2, allowing the Earth to cool down again,"" explains Dominik Hülse.

Yet, there have been times when the planet froze over completely, covered in ice from pole to pole. The researchers note that this cannot be explained by rock weathering alone, meaning other forces must have been involved in these dramatic cool-downs.

A crucial clue lies in how the ocean stores carbon. As atmospheric CO2 levels rise and the planet warms, more nutrients such as phosphorus are washed into the sea. These nutrients fuel algae blooms that draw in carbon through photosynthesis. When the algae die, they sink to the ocean floor, carrying that carbon with them.

In a warmer climate, however, rapid algae growth also leads to lower oxygen levels in the water. With less oxygen, phosphorus tends to be recycled rather than buried in sediments. This creates a powerful feedback loop: more nutrients lead to more algae, which consume more oxygen as they decompose, which in turn releases even more nutrients. At the same time, large amounts of carbon become trapped in marine sediments, ultimately cooling the planet.

For years, Hülse and Ridgwell have been developing an advanced computer model of Earth's climate system that includes these complex interactions. ""This more complete Earth System model does not always stabilize the climate gradually after a warming phase, rather it can overcompensate and cool the Earth far below its initial temperature -- a process that can still take hundreds of thousands of years, however. In the computer model of the study this can trigger an ice age. With the silicate weathering alone, we were unable to simulate such extreme values,"" explains Dominik Hülse.

Their results suggest that when oxygen levels in the atmosphere were lower, as they were in Earth's distant past, these nutrient feedbacks became stronger and could have driven the severe ice ages that marked early geological history.

As humans today add more CO2 into the atmosphere, the planet will continue to warm. But according to the scientists' model, it could lead again to a cooling overshoot in the long run. However, the next event will likely be milder, because today's atmosphere contains more oxygen than in the distant past, which dampens the nutrient feedback.

""At the end of the day, does it really matter much if the start of the next ice age is 50, 100, or 200 thousand years into the future?"" asks Ridgwell. ""We need to focus now on limiting ongoing warming. That the Earth will naturally cool back down is not going to happen fast enough to help us out.""

The research received support from the MARUM-based Cluster of Excellence ""The Ocean Floor -- Earth's Uncharted Interface."" Hülse now aims to use the model to explore how Earth has sometimes rebounded surprisingly quickly from past climate shifts and how the ocean floor played a role in those recoveries.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A new microscopy breakthrough is revealing the oceans' invisible life","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251101000359.htm","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 04:59:03 GMT","

Plankton are the unseen drivers of life on Earth. These microscopic organisms produce a large share of the planet's oxygen and form the base of the ocean food chain. They are also astonishingly diverse, with tens of thousands of species already identified and many more waiting to be discovered. Among them, protists -- tiny, single-celled organisms -- are especially remarkable for their evolutionary significance. For many years, scientists could study them only through genetic data because existing imaging techniques were unable to reveal their complex internal structures.

A Pandemic Collaboration Sparks Discovery

During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMBL Group Leader Gautam Dey received a Zoom call from collaborator Omaya Dudin, then leading a research group at EPFL. Dudin had just succeeded in adapting a new imaging method to visualize the inner organization of Ichthyosporea (a marine protist closely related to animals and fungi). This breakthrough overcame a long-standing obstacle: the species' tough cell walls.

The technique, known as expansion microscopy, was originally developed at MIT and later refined into ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) by Paul Guichard and Virginie Hamel at the University of Geneva. Their improvements made the protist's cell walls permeable, allowing scientists to clearly observe its inner architecture for the first time.

Motivated by this success, Dudin, Dey, Guichard, and Hamel began a long-term collaboration. Three years later, their partnership has produced an unprecedented body of knowledge about hundreds of protist species and laid the groundwork for a ""planetary atlas"" of plankton.

The EMBL-led Traversing European Coastlines (TREC) expedition offered an ideal opportunity to explore these marine organisms further. Recently published in Cell, the team's findings provide detailed insight into the cellular structures of more than 200 plankton species, especially eukaryotes (organisms whose cells contain a membrane-bound nucleus). This research marks the beginning of PlanExM, a TREC project designed to map the hidden structural diversity of plankton using expansion microscopy.

Exploring Marine Microbes in Unprecedented Detail

At Roscoff, France -- one of the first TREC expedition sampling sites -- the Station Biologique maintains one of Europe's most comprehensive collections of marine microorganisms. Expecting only a few dozen samples, the team asked manager Ian Probert for material to test their technique. Instead, they gained access to over 200 species.

""We spent three days and nights just fixing those samples. This was a treasure trove we could not let go of,"" said co-first author Felix Mikus, who completed his PhD in the Dey Group and is now a postdoc in Dudin's laboratory at the University of Geneva.

How Expansion Microscopy Works

Expansion microscopy, which marks its 10th anniversary this year, physically enlarges biological samples. A sample -- containing cells, tissues, or single-celled organisms -- is embedded in a transparent gel that absorbs water and expands. Remarkably, the cell's internal structures remain intact and stretch proportionally, allowing researchers to enlarge the specimen up to 16 times without using high-powered lenses.

""When combined with regular light microscopy methods, expansion microscopy allows scientists to bypass the standard wavelength barriers which limit how small a structure can be resolved using light microscopy,"" said Guichard and Hamel.

Mapping the Cellular Skeleton of Life

Using samples from Roscoff and a second collection in Bilbao, Spain, the team conducted one of the most comprehensive studies ever of the cytoskeleton -- the filament network that supports and organizes eukaryotic cells. They focused on microtubules (hollow filaments that help cells maintain shape, divide, and move) and centrins (proteins involved in organizing microtubules).

""We were able to map features of microtubule and centrin organization across many different eukaryotic groups,"" explained Hiral Shah, EIPOD Postdoctoral Fellow in EMBL's Dey and Schwab groups and co-first author of the study. ""The scale of the study, with many species characterized in each group, opens up the possibility to make evolutionary predictions. For instance, dinoflagellates, one of the most diverse groups found in oceans across the planet, are well-represented in our study. We were able to map the presence of tubulin and centrin structures associated with the cell cortex or the flagella in these species.""

Revealing Evolutionary Patterns Through Microscopy

""U-ExM is transforming how we explore protist ultrastructure,"" said co-first author Armando Rubio Ramos, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Geneva. ""By combining this technique with high-throughput imaging and comparative analyses, we can begin to decode how cellular architecture has diversified across evolution. It's a bridge between molecular data and the physical organization of life at the microscopic scale.""

The results not only illuminate how eukaryotic cells are organized but also offer clues about the evolutionary development of their internal structures. The research highlights expansion microscopy's power as a tool for studying even complex environmental samples collected directly from the ocean.

Toward a Planetary Atlas of Microscopic Life

""Our adventures with expansion microscopy are only beginning,"" said Dey. ""This is perhaps the first high-resolution microscopy technique that has the potential to match the scale and ambition of large biodiversity genomics projects, enabling us in the near future to associate new multiomics data with cellular physiology at scale across the tree of life.""

With Thomas Richards from Oxford University joining the collaboration, Dey and Dudin secured a CHF 2 million Moore Foundation Grant to continue expanding their research.

""The next step is to selectively look deeper into certain species within this broad collection to answer specific questions, such as understanding how mitosis and multicellularity evolved and the phenotypic diversity that underlie major evolutionary transitions,"" Dudin said.

Astronomers have produced the first three-dimensional map of a planet outside our solar system, revealing distinct temperature regions, including one so hot that water vapor breaks apart. The findings appear in Nature Astronomy, published October 28, 2025.

Led by researchers at the University of Maryland and Cornell University, the study charts temperatures across WASP-18b, a massive gas giant classified as an ""ultra-hot Jupiter"" located 400 light-years from Earth. The team applied a method known as 3D eclipse mapping, also called spectroscopic eclipse mapping, marking the first time this technique has been used to build a full 3D temperature map. The work expands on a 2D eclipse map the group released in 2023 using highly sensitive observations from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

""This technique is really the only one that can probe all three dimensions at once: latitude, longitude and altitude,"" said the paper's co-lead author Megan Weiner Mansfield, an assistant professor of astronomy at UMD. ""This gives us a higher level of detail than we've ever had to study these celestial bodies.""

With this approach, scientists can begin charting atmospheric differences across many exoplanets observable by JWST, much as ground-based telescopes once documented Jupiter's Great Red Spot and its banded clouds.

""Eclipse mapping allows us to image exoplanets that we can't see directly, because their host stars are too bright,"" said the paper's co-lead author Ryan Challener, a postdoctoral associate in Cornell University's Department of Astronomy. ""With this telescope and this new technique, we can start to understand exoplanets along the same lines as our solar system neighbors.""

Spotting exoplanets is difficult because they are typically far dimmer than their stars, often contributing less than 1% of the total light. Eclipse mapping measures tiny variations in that light as the planet moves behind its star, alternately hiding and revealing different regions. By tying these small brightness changes to specific locations on the planet and analyzing them in multiple colors, scientists can reconstruct temperatures across latitude, longitude, and altitude.

WASP-18b is well suited for this test because it has about the mass of 10 Jupiters, completes an orbit in only 23 hours, and reaches temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Those properties provide a comparatively strong signal for the new mapping method.

The team's earlier 2D map used a single color of light. For the 3D version, they reanalyzed the same JWST data from the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) across many wavelengths. Each color probes different layers of WASP-18b's atmosphere and corresponds to a specific temperature and altitude. Combining these layers yields a detailed three-dimensional temperature structure.

""If you build a map at a wavelength that water absorbs, you'll see the water deck in the atmosphere, whereas a wavelength that water does not absorb will probe deeper,"" Challener explained. ""If you put those together, you can get a 3D map of the temperatures in this atmosphere.""

The 3D analysis identifies spectroscopically distinct zones on the planet's permanent dayside, which always faces the star because the planet is tidally locked. A circular hot spot sits where the star's light strikes most directly, and winds appear too weak to spread that heat efficiently. A cooler ring encircles the hot center near the limb of the planet. Measurements also show reduced water vapor within the hot spot compared with the planet's average.

""We've seen this happen on a population level, where you can see a cooler planet that has water and then a hotter planet that doesn't have water,"" Weiner Mansfield explained. ""But this is the first time we've seen this be broken across one planet instead. It's one atmosphere, but we see cooler regions that have water and hotter regions where the water's being broken apart. That had been predicted by theory, but it's really exciting to actually see this with real observations.""

Additional JWST observations could sharpen the spatial detail in future 3D eclipse maps. Weiner Mansfield noted that the method opens new opportunities to study many ""hot Jupiters,"" which number in the hundreds among the more than 6,000 confirmed exoplanets. She also aims to apply 3D eclipse mapping to smaller, rocky worlds beyond gas giants like WASP-18b.

""It's very exciting to finally have the tools to see and map out the temperatures of a different planet in this much detail. It's set us up to possibly use the technique on other types of exoplanets. For example, if a planet doesn't have an atmosphere, we can still use the technique to map the temperature of the surface itself to possibly understand its composition,"" Mansfield said. ""Although WASP-18b was more predictable, I believe we will have the chance to see things that we could never have expected before.""

This research was supported by the James Webb Space Telescope's Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program.

“If we're going to build a circular, sustainable economy, the chemical industry is a big, complex problem that we must address,” said Professor Erwin Reisner from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. “We've got to come up with ways to de-fossilize this important sector, which produces so many important products we all need. It's a huge opportunity if we can get it right.”

Now, a team led by the University of Cambridge is exploring innovative approaches that could eventually “de-fossilize” this vital industry.

Their breakthrough involves a hybrid device that brings together light-absorbing organic polymers and bacterial enzymes to transform sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into formate, a clean fuel that can power additional chemical reactions.

This “semi-artificial leaf” replicates photosynthesis, the natural process plants use to turn sunlight into energy, and operates entirely on its own power. Unlike previous designs that relied on toxic or unstable light absorbers, this new biohybrid model uses non-toxic materials, runs more efficiently, and remains stable without extra additives.

In laboratory tests, the team successfully used sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into formate and then applied it directly in a “domino” reaction to synthesize a valuable compound used in pharmaceuticals, achieving both high yield and purity.

According to findings published in Joule, this marks the first instance where organic semiconductors have served as the light-capturing component in such a biohybrid system, paving the way for a new generation of eco-friendly artificial leaves.

The chemical industry remains a cornerstone of the global economy, producing a vast range of goods—from medicines and fertilizers to plastics, paints, electronics, cleaning agents, and toiletries.

“If we're going to build a circular, sustainable economy, the chemical industry is a big, complex problem that we must address,” said Professor Erwin Reisner from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who led the research. “We've got to come up with ways to de-fossilize this important sector, which produces so many important products we all need. It's a huge opportunity if we can get it right.”

Reisner's research group specializes in the development of artificial leaves, which turn sunlight into carbon-based fuels and chemicals without relying on fossil fuels. But many of their earlier designs depend on synthetic catalysts or inorganic semiconductors, which either degrade quickly, waste much of the solar spectrum, or contain toxic elements such as lead.

“If we can remove the toxic components and start using organic elements, we end up with a clean chemical reaction and a single end product, without any unwanted side reactions,” said co-first author Dr. Celine Yeung, who completed the research as part of her PhD work in Reisner's lab. “This device combines the best of both worlds – organic semiconductors are tuneable and non-toxic, while biocatalysts are highly selective and efficient.”

The new device integrates organic semiconductors with enzymes from sulfate-reducing bacteria, splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen or converting carbon dioxide into formate.

The researchers have also addressed a long-standing challenge: most systems require chemical additives, known as buffers, to keep the enzymes running. These can break down quickly and limit stability. By embedding a helper enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, into a porous titania structure, the researchers enabled the system to work in a simple bicarbonate solution — similar to sparkling water — without unsustainable additives.

“It's like a big puzzle,” said co-first author Dr. Yongpeng Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in Reisner's lab. “We have all these different components that we've been trying to bring together for a single purpose. It took us a long time to figure out how this specific enzyme is immobilized on an electrode, but we're now starting to see the fruits from these efforts.”

“By really studying how the enzyme works, we were able to precisely design the materials that make up the different layers of our sandwich-like device,” said Yeung. “This design made the parts work together more effectively, from the tiny nanoscale up to the full artificial leaf.”

Tests showed the artificial leaf produced high currents and achieved near-perfect efficiency in directing electrons into fuel-making reactions. The device successfully ran for over 24 hours: more than twice as long as previous designs.

The researchers are hoping to further develop their designs to extend the lifespan of the device and adapt it so it can produce different types of chemical products.

“We've shown it's possible to create solar-powered devices that are not only efficient and durable but also free from toxic or unsustainable components,” said Reisner. “This could be a fundamental platform for producing green fuels and chemicals in future – it's a real opportunity to do some exciting and important chemistry.”

The research was supported in part by the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the European Research Council, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the Royal Academy of Engineering, and UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Erwin Reisner is a Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. Celine Yeung is a Member of Downing College, Cambridge.

The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses are very good smart glasses. If you're into face computers, these will do what you want them to do. They snap pictures, record video, play music, and take calls. You can use AI voice commands to find your way around, translate foreign languages live, or inquire about what kind of spider happens to be dangling right in front of your face at the moment.

The $379 frames are Meta's entry-level smart glasses, and a direct successor to the original that became a smash hit. They are $80 more expensive than their predecessor, but what you get in return is a better 12-MP camera capable of capturing photos and videos at up to 3K resolution. There are also options for recording up to 60 frames per second and shooting videos in slow motion. Battery life also gets a big bump, extending to 8 hours of various use, but more like 5 or 6 with constant use or less if you're recording high-def video the whole time. (The glasses record a maximum of three minutes at a time.)

For most people, the affordability and relative simplicity of the Gen 2 frames are going to make them the most appealing Meta glasses. They don't have quite the GoPro-esque camera capabilities of the $499 Oakley Meta Vanguards, which my colleague Adrienne So liked a lot. They also don't have a display in the lens, like the $799 Meta Ray Ban Display. (We have not been able to review the Display glasses yet because Meta said it prioritized sending review units to “creators,” i.e., influencers.)

I have been using the Gen 2 smart glasses for about a month. Meta handed them out for free to the journalists and influencers at its Connect developer event in Palo Alto in September, and I've been wearing them since then. These feel a lot like the previous pair of Ray-Ban Meta glasses I've used. They weigh about the same, offer many of the same visual styles, though there are a few new colors to choose from. (I got cosmic blue.)

Music playback on the frame's speakers sounds fine, but I still prefer wireless earbuds for something I actually want to listen to. Podcasts and phone calls sound great, though—voices seem to shine on the glasses. The touch controls along the sides of the frames work well enough, which is nice considering oversensitive touch controls on wearables can often trigger an unintended reaction like accidentally pausing a track or changing the volume.

The glasses are lightweight compared to the face computers of the past, but they are heavy enough to leave deep red divots on either side of the bridge of my nose after a couple of hours of wearing them. This is probably a skill issue, since I don't have prescription lenses and normally just wear sunglasses.

It's a petty peeve, but I much prefer polarized lenses, which Meta doesn't offer. At least you can get them with Transitions lenses, which is what I tested. Those do a good job of reacting to the light, but I find they don't ever feel quite dark enough to keep me from squinting on a sunny day.

As I wore them on one of my walks through San Francisco, on the shore of Ocean Beach, I came upon a dolphin-like fish that had washed up on the sand. Though I got my camera glasses close enough to the thing that I could smell it, Meta's AI assistant could not tell me what kind of animal it was. It correctly identified that it was very dead and that I should not touch it. It was then able to direct me to a number to call for city animal control services.

Beyond instances like that, I tend to avoid the AI voice interaction because I haven't gotten to the point where it feels natural. Getting it to search something is usually very quick, but doing so requires you to stop dead in your tracks, stare directly at another person's purse or something, and say out loud, “Hey Meta. HEY META. Is this bag Gucci?”

The glasses' AI features are both its best asset and biggest weakness. Features like live language translation and whispered map directions are very helpful. But if you've spent any time curating the AI slop out of your Facebook feed lately, you'll know that Meta just can't help pack a firehouse blast of AI features into everything it does.

The software features are funneled through the same app as Meta's AI services. That's where pictures and videos go by default, and sometimes you have to go into the app to import the files from the glasses. There's a very clear problem with using the app: bad vibes.

When you go into the Meta AI app to look at the pictures or videos you've taken, the first thing you'll see is Meta's terrible new Vibes service; a constant barrage of AI slop videos that Meta just one day foisted upon its app users. Vibes is akin to OpenAI's dubious Sora app, but somehow even worse quality.

Every time I try to go find a picture I've just taken with my glasses of some cute dog, I first have to swipe past AI slop. If I'm lucky, it's a bunch of uncanny AI cats riding motorcycles or dancing to hip hop beats. If I'm unlucky (usually the case), it's a bunch of cringey political videos, like AI Obama getting arrested by ICE or one where an AI President Trump lookalike leans over a visibly pregnant Statue of Liberty who also seems to be giving birth to an egg. It's such a shift from the things that the glasses do best, which is to let you capture and interact with the real world.

Vibes is a service I wish I could opt out of by launching it straight into the sun, but unfortunately, it has become an inescapable part of my Meta Ray-Ban software experience. The thing all of Meta's glasses do really well is remind you that you're wearing a device made by Meta, a company that has a long history of playing hot potato with user data and a leader who has displayed increasingly craven capitulation to power.

The glasses are great, but I find myself feeling hesitant to wear them around in public. I get more double takes and suspicious looks on the bus than I've noticed before. To be fair, that might just be aesthetics, as I've been told by almost all my friends that my face doesn't take to square glasses well. (“You just look wrong,” one told me while I wore the glasses in a restaurant.)

Fashion aside, these devices are in a fraught place. Privacy rights and the absolute explosion of surveillance tech are much harder to ignore these days. Especially as people buy mod kits to disable the indicator light on the Meta glasses that let people see when the Meta glasses are recording, or use their glasses to record themselves harassing workers in massage parlors.

I'm not saying these are glasses for creeps, but I can't help but feel like one while wearing them.

Hulu (Base, Monthly)

YouTube (Monthly)

Sling (Orange and Blue, Monthly)

DirecTV (Choice, Monthly)

Cable TV died only to return as live TV streaming services. Some familiar names are still around, like DirecTV, but even more have popped up as wholly unique entities. TV looks a lot different than it did a decade ago, with cord-cutting going mainstream, and TV giants ditching the proprietary boxes and hardware leases in favor of streaming over the internet.

Although the best live TV streaming services make it easier to watch live TV (often for cheaper), the internet has introduced its own problems. A large roster of brands has fragmented channel lineups, and ongoing negotiations with streaming platforms have meant channels disappear from some networks overnight. So what's the best? I went on a deep dive into channels, DVR, sports, on-demand videos, and increasingly confusing add-ons and pricing to understand where the live TV streaming market is at, and which service you should spend your money on.

Be sure to check out our Best Indoor TV Antennas and Best TVs guides for more.

How You Can Stream Live TV for Free

Most live TV streaming services will cost you money, and they aren't cheap, with the going price sitting above $80 per month. However, a new model for streaming live TV has been growing in popularity over the last several years known as FAST, or free ad-supported television.

There are several FAST services available, with some of the more popular options being Tubi, Roku TV, Pluto, and Peacock. The channels you find on FAST services don't mirror those of a traditional live TV provider, so you shouldn't expect to see major networks like Discovery, at least in the same form you find them on cable. There are thousands of FAST channels, and most of them focus on a specific genre or even a specific series.

For instance, Tubi has dedicated channels for Johnny Carson, The Carol Burnett Show, and Baywatch, while Pluto TV includes dozens of channels dedicated to sitcom re-runs, as well as a channel dedicated solely to Dateline re-runs. You won't find much in the way of live sports or new, live premieres, but FAST services are great if you just want TV for TV's sake.

How You Can Stream ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox Live

ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox are all broadcast through local affiliates, so you'll need a live TV streaming service that can deliver local affiliates. YouTube TV, Hulu Live TV, Fubo, and DirecTV support all four, but some services are different. Sling, for instance, includes NBC, ABC, and Fox, but it doesn't have CBS. And Philo doesn't offer any local affiliates.

How We Tested

Half of the battle with live TV streaming services is even understanding what you're getting. Although some of the confusion of cable's past is gone, a lot of it remains. Sling Orange & Blue, for instance, includes local affiliates, but unlike other services I looked it, it doesn't comes with CBS. There are dozens of examples just like this if you go through all of the channel lineups.

That's where I started. I created a grid of the top 100 channels according to Nielsen to better understand what each service offers. That helps contextualize how much you're paying. DirecTV is expensive, for instance, but it doesn't have major holes in the channels lineup like Sling TV, which you have to make up with paid add-ons.

I used these services for about three weeks, cycling between them each time I sat down to watch TV. I never experienced any outage problems, so my focus shifted to usability in the app. The goal is to have a modernized app with the features of a streaming platform (like user profiles) while maintaining the familiarity of a traditional cable service with a robust guide and easy channel switching.

Beyond usability and channel selection, I focused in on a few other key elements. Chief among them was DVR. Most live TV streaming services offer unlimited cloud DVR, but some do it better than others. DirecTV, for instance, allows you to record DVR up to 72 hours in the past. Sling, on the other hand, charges for unlimited DVR.

Hulu

Hulu (Base, Monthly)

Hulu (Premium, Monthly)

If there's an easy sell in the world of live TV streaming services, it's Hulu Live TV. Hulu and Disney+ are subscriptions you probably want anyway, and adding live TV with a comprehensive lineup of plans and ESPN Unlimited just makes sense, especially when Hulu is charging around the same price as YouTube TV.

Hulu has just a slightly less comprehensive lineup of channels compared to YouTube TV, but it still covers all the bases. You get ESPN channels, along with regional sports networks like FanDuel and local affiliates like ABC, NBC, and CBS.

You get the major channels, including big networks like Discovery, and a full roster of national news stations, including Fox, CNN, and MSNBC. The only place Hulu loses out is with secondary channels. Channels like Science, Hallmark Family, and MTV 2 are paid add-ons, even though the main channels on these networks are included with the base plan.

My big gripe with Hulu is its frustrating interface. Even before introducing Live TV, Hulu had a rough app, and that hasn't changed. It's cluttered and clunky, and although there's still a guide with useful category sorting, the app still feels like it's fighting with itself. Unlike YouTube, which separates YouTube and YouTube TV into separate apps, there's only one Hulu app. Further, the future of Live TV isn't clear. Disney has said it will phase out the Hulu app, integrating it into Disney+. That includes Live TV, and it's unclear how it'll work when that happens.

Still, the thing that makes Hulu Live TV so attractive hasn't changed. You get an awful lot for your money, combining go-to streaming apps between Hulu and Disney+, a solid channel lineup of live TV, and ESPN Unlimited to create a package that's hard for most services to contend with.

Google

YouTube (Monthly)

What I love about YouTube TV is that it's easy. There's one plan that comes with a complete roster of channels for a reasonable price, and only a handful of add-ons that truly feel like add-ons (i.e., Spanish-speaking channels and movie channels). You don't need a spreadsheet to understand what you're getting with YouTube TV. With all the major channels you want and unlimited DVR, everything is built into the base plan.

Along with broad national channel coverage, YouTube TV includes local channels in most areas. Even in Missouri, where I live, YouTube TV has all of my local channels, including ABC, Fox, NBC, and CBS. You'd be shocked at how few live TV streaming services include all of your local affiliates. However, while affiliate inclusion is great, YouTube TV is spotty when it comes to regional sports networks.

YouTube TV has a simple lineup of offerings, so it makes sense that it has an equally straightforward app. It's my favorite app out of any of the streaming services I tested. It's lightning fast without even a hint of lag, and it's available everywhere, from smart TVs like those from Hisense, Samsung, Vizio, LG, and Roku, to streaming devices from Amazon and Apple, not to mention game consoles.

Although YouTube TV has a comprehensive lineup of channels, apps, and features, it's also one of the most expensive live TV streaming services around, and there aren't any ways to save money with a smaller channel lineup. In addition, it doesn't include any extras like you get with Hulu Live TV. It would be great to have, for instance, YouTube Premium included to unlock ad-free YouTube videos and YouTube Music.

YouTube TV recently removed Disney from its offerings, cutting ESPN, ABC, and Disney proper. The company says these channels may come back in the future, but that seems unlikely immediately. Still, it's clear why YouTube TV is such a popular option. It's easy, and if you can float the monthly price, you won't have to worry much about random channels falling through the cracks because of renewal deals or add-ons to pick up a single extra channel.

Sling

Sling (Orange and Blue, Monthly)

Sling (Orange, Monthly)

Sling (Blue, Monthly)

Sling (Select, Monthly)

I won't mince words: Sling TV is confusing. It has, by far, the most confusing lineup of plans and add-ons out of any of the live TV streaming services I tested. There are a handful of core plans, none of which encompass the scale of Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, or DirecTV, as well as about half a dozen add-ons to bring the channel roster up to par. This modular approach is annoying while shopping, though it also means you can save quite a bit of money by only picking up what you need.

The core of Sling is Blue and Orange. The Blue plan focuses on news and entertainment, while the Orange plan cuts news like MSNBC and CNN in favor of an array of ESPN channels. It's clear Sling wants folks to pick up the Orange & Blue plan that combines these channel lineups. It's about 30 percent cheaper getting them together than it is purchasing them separately (and about $30 cheaper than most other providers).

The Orange & Blue plan, which I recommend for most people, covers the major bases, but it loses out on some of the secondary channels available elsewhere. For instance, you get ESPN channels and Fox Sports 1, but not Fox Sports 2 or the Big Ten Network. You'll need an add-on for those.

Most of Sling's add-ons are $6 extra per month, minus the sports add-on, which is $15. The add-ons fill in the gaps depending on what you're most interested in. The entertainment add-on includes Cartoon Network and MTV, for instance, while the movies add-on comes with Grit, TCM, and FXX. You can pick up all of the extras for $27 per month with Blue & Orange or $21 per month with other plans. Even with the full package, however, Sling comes in a few dollars below YouTube TV and Hulu Live TV, and there are opportunities to get your monthly price even lower by cutting some packages.

For apps, Sling has just about everything you could want. Roku, Samsung, LG, Apple, and Google TV are all supported, as are boxes from Cox, Xfinity, and even TiVo Stream. Mobile apps are available, and there's an app for the Xbox (though not the PlayStation 5).

Although not as responsive as YouTube TV, the app felt smooth on my TCL QM8K. You can create profiles, see upcoming games, and favorite channels in the guide so they're easy to find.

DirecTV

DirecTV (Choice, Monthly)

DirecTV (Entertainment, Monthly)

DirecTV (Ultimate, Monthly)

DirecTV (Premier, Monthly)

If you want cable without the box, DirecTV is what you're after. It's only fitting that the only familiar satellite service on this list is the best cable replacement, and DirecTV lives up to its name—for better and worse. On the plus side, there's a massive channel selection, particularly on the Choice plan and above. DirecTV includes most of the top 100 channels I looked at, along with major regional sports networks like FanDuel and NBC Sports.

And just like the satellite plans of yore, DirecTV charges a pretty penny. Plans climb all the way to $170 per month if you want movie channels like Starz and Showtime, and even DirecTV's cheaper Choice and Entertainment plans come in $10 to $15 more than Hulu Live TV and YouTube TV.

Still, you get quite a bit for your money. In addition to a broad channel lineup, DirecTV includes ESPN Unlimited with every plan, along with ad-supported versions of Disney+ and Hulu with the Choice plan and above. Unlimited DVR also comes standard, as does unlimited streams at home (and up to three outside of your home).

You can build your own plan with DirecTV's Genre Packs, though the cost ends up being more expensive than just picking up one of the full plans from the get-go. For most people, the Choice plan is the best option. It includes quite a few more channels than the cheaper Entertainment plan, including the NFL and MLB Networks, along with truTV, Pop, and Science. The more expensive Ultimate plan has more channels, but they're mainly secondary channels like Disney Junior and Nat Geo Wild.

The DirecTV app is available on Fire TV, Google TV, Apple TV, Roku, and Samsung TVs (2017 and newer), and you'll also find apps on mobile devices and in your browser. Notably, there aren't any apps for game consoles, which is a shame because DirecTV's app feels sluggish. It's great in the browser, but testing on my TCL QM8K TV, there was always a bit of a hang as I navigated through channels. I suspect this will only be exaggerated on less powerful devices, like a cheaper Roku Streaming Stick.

I don't love the interface, but there are solid features. You can favorite channels and sports teams to easily find them, as well as turn on live scores. The most frustrating aspect is the home screen. It's useful for seeing your favorite channels, but leaving a channel will return you to this home screen rather than the guide.

Fubo

Fubo (Pro, Monthly)

Fubo (Elite with Sports Plus, Monthly)

Fubo (Deluxe, Monthly)

Fubo makes a big deal about the number of channels it carries, and by the numbers, it has a ton of channels indeed. It's missing a lot of the important ones—TBS, Discovery, CNN, and Univision chief among them—but if you want both The Weather Channel and AccuWeather, Fubo has your back. Fubo may not have all the channels that Hulu Live TV or YouTube TV have, but it goes deep in one area: sports.

ESPN Unlimited is included with every plan. Fubo has the most comprehensive list of regional sports networks out of any of the live TV streaming services I tested. FanDuel and NBC Sports take center stage, but Fubo also carries smaller regional networks, from MASN and MSG in the northeast to Space City in Houston. You'd suspect that the cheapest Fubo Sports plan is all you need, and if you just want a few local affiliates and ESPN Unlimited, you can get by with that plan. I wouldn't recommend anything less than Fubo TV Pro for most people, though, which carries the regional sports networks.

If you jump up to the most expensive plan (Elite with Sports Plus), you also get access to NFL Red Zone, plus a free Apple TV 4K and 4K streaming. Red Zone and 4K upgrades are available elsewhere, but it's great to see both included as a package, especially for such a sports-focused service.

Fubo's app is solid, too. Testing on a Google TV system, it felt responsive without much in the way of lag as I was flipping through the guide. It's not as clean as YouTube TV's interface, particularly with the sports emphasis, but an app that feels responsive is all I can really ask for.

It's available on most devices, including Fire TV, Google TV, Apple TV, and Roku, as well as TVs from Vizio, Samsung, LG, and Hisense. There's also an Xbox app (though no PlayStation app) and native apps for Android and iOS.

Philo: This almost made the main list, though I decided against it due to the limitations. It's, by far, the cheapest option out of any of the live TV services I tested, with its only plan (Core) coming in at just $33 per month. It's just extremely limited. You have a far smaller channel roster compared to the other services I tested, mainly due to the fact that Philo doesn't include any local affiliates like NBC or ABC, nor any regional sports networks. You might not care about local news or sports, though, and Philo is excellent if you fall in that camp. The channel lineup hits all the highlights, including the massive Discovery network, drama channels like AMC and TNT, and reality-focused channels like MTV and Lifetime. Philo also throws in over 100 ad-supported free channels, along with ad-supported versions of AMC+, HBO Max, and Discovery+. And to better support this entertainment and reality TV focus, it has the best DVR out of any service I tested. Unlimited cloud DVR comes standard with your plan, and Philo retains your recordings for a full year—just about every other service tops out at nine months.

One of the draws of live TV streaming is that it doesn't require an antenna, instead leveraging your internet connection to deliver live television. However, a TV antenna can help fill in the gaps of cheaper live TV services like Sling or Fubo, particularly when it comes to local affiliates.

Our favorite indoor TV antenna is the Mohu Leaf 50 Amplified, which you can pick up for about $50. It covers up to 60 miles, which should reach most local affiliates, assuming you live within an hour of a major city. If you want to see your local channels, you can enter your address at AntennaWeb.

Mexico City's Azteca Stadium is a 15-kilometer journey from the Zócalo—more or less the center of the metropolis of 18 million inhabitants. The drive can take the 18 minutes predicted by Google Maps, but it can easily exceed an hour if you happen to be in the middle of what my driver calls “the peak,” the time when the city's perpetual swarm of cars swells to bursting.

The first feeling on seeing the Coloso de Santa Úrsula— the nickname given to the stadium where both Pelé and Maradona played legendary games—is that of being in a place suspended between past and future. The venue's seemingly immobile dinosaur skeleton exterior hides a vast work in progress as the whole stadium is being modernized for 2026 World Cup.

On March 26, 2026, a friendly match between Mexico and Portugal will serve as a dress rehearsal for the June 11 inaugural ceremony and subsequent first World Cup match.

Azteca Stadium as it looks today with work in progress.

The icon of Mexican soccer is undergoing an unprecedented metamorphosis. Renovations to Azteca Stadium, essential to its status as a designated venue for five matches, are in their most critical and visible phase.

The goal is to modernize the Colossus to meet the most demanding international standards, improving the spectator experience and the functionality of the facility while maintaining its historic soul.

The current state is that of a construction site in full swing. The stands, completely empty and devoid of their signature signs and colors, reveal the gray of concrete and scaffolding. The empty bleachers, lit by the white lights of a construction site, are enlivened only by teams of technicians and engineers working day and night. The field, the heart of the stadium, is now a sea of dirt and mud, where heavy machinery works to level and reinstall the drainage system and put in the state-of-the-art hybrid surface that combines natural grass with advanced ventilation, drainage, and air injection systems.

The main structure of the stadium was only reinforced while keeping its iconic shape intact.

The stadium may be new inside, but the outside is keeping its identifying features. The main structure of the stadium has only been strengthened, but not significantly altered. However, the upgrades do include some flash. The exterior will be embellished with LED banners mounted on the characteristic columns and cross beams that will enhance the appearance of the stadium and allow for colorful choreographed light shows.

From the field level, the biggest change is immediately noticeable: The new metal and glass ring roof is almost complete and will protect much of the stands. “We didn't want to erase the original silhouette,” a team engineer explains, “but to update it with lighter materials that can better withstand the climate and integrate photovoltaic systems invisible to the naked eye.”

The project—by KMD Arquitectos in collaboration with Populous—completely renovates the electrical, water, and ventilation systems, and includes the installation of a smart energy management system. It also introduces new FIFA evacuation standards. While the official capacity of the Azteca is about 83,000, the renovations would take the facility closer to 90,000 seats, although neither the government nor FIFA has confirmed the final number. For sure, it will radically change the experience: individual ergonomic seats replace many of the old seats, increasing space and comfort for every spectator. Accessibility and sight lines for fans have been optimized thanks to a revised bleacher layout.

The new ring roof is made of metal and glass, and the bleachers have been redesigned for comfort and visibility.

Populous, the firm responsible for the design of the new team benches and canopies, moved the entire technical production area from the west side to the east side to accommodate the World Cup's many broadcasters and an updated field layout. Fans will notice the benches on the sidelines are partially buried below ground level, giving them an unobstructed view of the game.

The new canopies are inspired by the tessellation of the Telstar and Azteca balls from the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, echoing hexagonal and pentagonal motifs that immediately recall Mexican identity. Let us not forget that next year, Mexico City's stadium will become the only venue in the world to have hosted three editions and three inaugural matches of the World Cup.

The cladding over the benches is made of ETFE, a lightweight plastic material that is highly resistant to corrosion and temperature variations. It's transparent and stronger than glass, insulating the seats from the elements and allowing for even natural lighting. The new benches include automotive-style padded seats, data and power outlets, and a programmable LED lighting system that turns on in sync with goals or events on the field.

More than 23,000 square feet of LED screens will be installed inside and on the facade of the stadium, supported by 1,200 antennas for Wi-Fi 6 connectivity. The entire retail system will be cashless, there are new restrooms, and the sound systems throughout the venue have been improved.

The security system is getting 200 new cameras for monitoring and surveillance to protect spectators. Elevators and circulation routes have been improved, with accessibility upgrades for people with disabilities. New hospitality areas will cover more than 75,000 square feet, and food services, previously scarce inside the stadium, will be fully integrated. The press area will be moved to a corner and the new locker rooms will be located centrally, under the east stand, instead of in the current location behind one of the goals.

The new hospitality areas will cover more than 75,000 square feet with improved accessibility.

Reconstruction will also affect the stadium entrances, simplifying spectator access and outflow: Stairs and corridors have been widened, significantly improving pedestrian flow and reducing bottlenecks, a critical problem in the previous layout.

Finally, the work is not limited to the interior. The perimeter of Azteca Stadium is also teeming with activity. Road and pedestrian accesses are being reorganized and a large, modernized, and better planned parking lot is being built.

Alejandra Frausto, Mexico City's secretary of tourism.

“The Azteca should not just be a stadium, but a place that the city feels is its own even on days without soccer,” says Mariana Torres, urban planner for the project. “The challenge is for regeneration not to become gentrification.”

The urban intervention, coordinated by the Mexico City government, will include new pedestrian areas, bike lanes, parking lots with electric charging stations, and shuttles to reduce traffic during events.

The goal is to cut transportation-related emissions by 30 percent on game days and transform the area into a new city hub. Green spaces, a multifunctional plaza with local restaurants and stores, and a year-round urban park will be created around the stadium.

During the weeks of the World Cup, the entire capital will be involved. “With the goal of making soccer an inclusive celebration, the Mexico City government will establish nineteen Fest Zones in all neighborhoods, where residents and visitors will be able to experience the passion of the World Cup for free,” says Alejandra Frausto, Mexico City's secretary of tourism. At a presentation for the media, her team unveiled some of the details Mexico City has planned ahead of the tournament, including a large Museo del Futbol near the Azteca Stadium.

The digital photo frame landscape has looked pretty much the same for the past few years. The best ones come from a few brands, and while new models have come out, the designs have usually focused on new frames and styles versus any real change in the technology or how to use the device. They're pretty simple: Upload your photos and enjoy them anytime on the digital screen.

While Aura's newest frame still embodies that basic concept, the Aura Ink stands out as a fully portable digital photo frame. The portable design is made possible by an E Ink screen like you'd find on a digital notebook or a color e-reader, instead of the usual LCD screen. The photos end up stylized like a newspaper photo, rather than your classic bright-screen display.

The result is a much more muted screen and representation of your photos, with all the benefits we already like about Aura's frames and app (including free and unlimited photo storage). It's a refreshing option in a sea of similar-looking digital frames, and great for anyone who wants a digital photo frame they could mount. I recommend uploading the best of your best pictures on it. This is a frame for your best (and absolute brightest—dim photos will only look darker) photos you'd want to look at all day, rather than fun photos from this weekend.

Photos on the Aura Ink look different than those on other digital frames. The E Ink Spectra 6 technology that powers the screen gives it a slightly sepia-toned look. The screen only uses six color pixels: white, black, red, yellow, green, and blue. To bring your photos to this type of screen, Aura designed an algorithm to convert photos into pixels of those six tones and still look like the original picture. The result is newspaper-like, with a design that devolves into a multitude of different colored squares if you look closely.

Brighter photos are much easier to enjoy on the Ink's screen. Darker photos, paired with the dimmer E Ink screen, were much harder to see. But a photo of my family at golden hour still showed the sky fading from blue to yellow and orange, for example, and the range of greens of the plants around us. My son's smiling face while wearing his astronaut costume was just as cute, with the various shades of his blond hair still nicely relayed.

Aura did build a gentle front light into the Aura Ink, similar to what you'd find on a Kindle device, but it's not nearly as bright as my Kindle when I crank the brightness all the way up. Compared side by side with my Kindle Colorsoft, which also has a color E Ink screen, the Aura Ink looks to get about half as bright. Aura also changed the physical controls on the device. Instead of a touchbar at the top, there are three buttons on one side: One to flip forward through your photos, one to flip backward, and an “action” button that just shows the battery status with an LED light.

It does look much, much more realistic and photolike than any other photo frame out there, but the photos displayed on it still appear dim compared to a true printed picture, let alone another digital screen. It's best in a well-lit room, with the light sensor in one of the upper corners to activate the front light.

The screen doesn't look different just for fun. It's what makes the Aura Ink fully wireless. While the rest of Aura's lineup needs to be plugged in at all times, as does just about every other digital photo frame on the market, the Aura Ink promises a battery life of about three months on a single charge. Devices like e-readers see similar benefits with this type of screen. The Kindle Colorsoft lasts about eight weeks on a single charge, while the larger Kindle Scribe (2nd Gen) has a similar three-month battery life.

That battery life can vary based on how often the photo changes, which is what takes up most of the Ink's power. If you've ever used an e-paper device like a digital notebook or e-reader, the experience of the flashing screen as it loads the next image will look familiar, but the Aura Ink amps it up with a much longer set of flashes as it runs the next photo through its algorithm to become a six-pixel print. That transition between photos takes less than 30 seconds. Aura defaults to this happening once overnight to both preserve the battery and your eyes during the intense transition phase.

Aura has been trying for years to get us to mount its frames. The Aura's first frame back in 2017, the Aura Classic, was wall-mountable, and then Aura's latest frames, like the Aura Aspen, have had a flat, wall-mountable design. But the downside was the cord running below it for all of these models, which takes away from the clean gallery-wall design it's otherwise well-suited for, and limits the locations it can be hung.

Now, with the Aura Ink's truly cordless design, it's possible to hang it without any cord clutter. The 13-inch screen makes it a little larger than the 12-inch Aura Aspen but smaller than the 15-inch Walden, and is a nice size for hanging. The Ink comes with a little mounting kit of two nails and a small hook that the digital frame clicks into, and it can easily click back off for charging (the charging port is on the side if your hanging spot is near an outlet). I was able to hang it on one of my existing pushpins without issue, and the frame easily blended into my existing gallery wall.

Overall, it's an impressive feat of technology, though I wouldn't call it perfect. I'd like to see the front light get a little brighter. It's considerably more expensive than other digital photo frames, too. But as I look at it on my gallery wall, I have to say that if you didn't already know it was digital, you'd likely have no idea. If you're looking for a frame like that for your home, this is the one to get.

There's no denying that an Austin tech scene, which has been simmering for decades, has reached a boiling point in the past few years. As of 2023, tech jobs accounted for 16 percent of all jobs in Austin—almost double the national average, according to the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Tech giants like Apple, Google, and Oracle all have a presence in the Texas capital, and startups like Mio, Closinglock, and MadeIn are garnering hype and VC funding. The Wall Street Journal may be hedging its bets on the hype it previously bestowed upon the city in the wake of the pandemic, but Austin persists as a kind of Babylon for burned-out techies who are tired of the Silicon Valley rat race.

The scrappy “Keep Austin Weird” era is on the wane, but there's still plenty that feels authentic and lovable in this once-sleepy college town that was content with doing its own thing in the shadows of nearby metropolises like Dallas and Houston. If your heart isn't dead-set on reliving the hazy glory days of the city portrayed in Richard Linklater's classic 1993 film Dazed and Confused, you're all but guaranteed to have a blast while bar-hopping, basking in the sun, and stuffing your face with some of the best barbecue in the world. And of course there's live music. So, so much live music.

Austin's tech scene initially caught a spark in the sprawling hills west of the city—hence the “Silicon Hills” tag—but the influx of Gen X and millennial workers has created an explosion of incubators, coworking spaces, and urban lifestyle hubs that are more centrally located than the environs preferred by the suburbanized old guard that came before them. Whether you prefer a quick drive to the office park or a quick walk to your new “coffice” for the day, our picks have you covered.

1901 San Antonio St., (512) 473-8900

Situated near the Texas State Capitol on the Southwest corner of the University of Texas at Austin, the Otis is a comfortable middle ground between a boutique hotel and an international chain operation. It's far enough from the commotion of both downtown and campus to feel calm, yet just a stone's throw from both. The rooftop pool is clutch for winding down with a Lone Star after a long day of meetings, which can be conveniently hosted onsite at one of the six event spaces, and Acre 41 is the kind of multiuse restaurant that's great for checking emails over coffee in the morning and brokering big deals over a Texas ribeye at night.

700 San Jacinto St., (512) 476-3700

Austin is growing upward at an unprecedented clip, but until it starts putting up New York–style pencil skyscrapers, the Omni Hotel stands out as one of the most iconic pieces of its skyline. This glistening 20-story marvel is just a few blocks from the core of Austin's entertainment district on West 6th Street, though you wouldn't be faulted for hardly leaving the property if a bar crawl on “Dirty 6th” isn't your thing. The rooftop pool offers stunning views of the city and beyond, and the three onsite restaurants provide an array of dining options suitable for all occasions.

1108 E 6th St., (737) 205-8888

Many maverick tech workers are in the sole proprietor/bootstraps phase of their career, which means cutting costs while still feeling luxe (or at least presenting as such) is important. East Austin Hotel offers traditional rooms for a slight upgrade, or you can save some serious cash by booking a “cabin” room with a suite of shared private bathrooms in the middle of the floor. You'll still have access to the pool in the middle of the property, and the hotel's proximity to the laid-back, neighborhood-y vibe of East 6th Street makes it a great pick for aspiring professionals who would prefer to commingle with locals rather than pound the pavement with office drones.

605 Davis St., (512) 542-5300

Rainey Street ain't what it used to be, but this charming enclave of bungalows turned bars still packs more character into a tiny city block than most midsize cities can muster in their entire downtown footprint. It's a solid all-purpose pick for moderate luxury in the middle of one of Austin's most charming and memorable downtown-adjacent neighborhoods.

10901 Domain St., (855) 596-3398

Most out-of-towners would be quite bummed to find out their work trip in Austin is centered around a lifestyle mall that's a 45-minute drive from downtown, but The Domain is actually a pretty great place to spend a few days if duty calls. It's a simulacrum of a walkable city right near blue-chip operations like Apple and Chase, so you might as well lean into the whole thing and shack up at a cool hotel that doesn't feel like a suburban motor inn off the freeway. Lone Star Court is fashioned in the likeness of a hill country lodge, with a pair of conjoined courtyards that center around a teal oval-shaped pool with its own bar and lounge.

7415 Southwest Pkwy., Building 8, Suite 100, (512) 551-4009

Nestled atop a main thoroughfare in the “Silicon Hills” of West Austin is a shiny new AC Hotel that checks all the boxes a techy business traveler might have. It's a short drive to heavyweights like AMD and Dell, and a handful of VCs like LiveOak and Cavvy dot the rolling hills that are on stunning display from the pool and the rooftop bar. The adjacent strip mall offers handy essentials like a local market that serves coffee and sandwiches all day, an upscale Mexican spot with great happy hour specials, and a movie theater with a bar that's a great place to kill a few hours between meetings.

Whether you're looking for a quiet desk for the day or a parachute into a bustling tech-y social scene, the variety of coworking options available in Austin is staggering and has something for everyone. Before you walk in off the street, we strongly suggest checking their website for availability and pricing, and while you're surfing the web, you might as well check out Austin Coworking and Deskpass, as they're excellent resources for updates on events, newcomers to the scene, and deals on participating offices.

310 Comal St., Floor 2, (512) 399-6320

Bond Collective is a solid choice for the post-hipster techies who prefer the laid-back vibe of East Austin over the corporate thrum of downtown or the West Austin hills. Day passes start at $35 for quick drop-ins, and monthly memberships offer access to almost all Bond Collective locations in the US—with many locations in New York, Philly, and the DC area—along with 24/7 access and ad hoc conference rooms if needed.

701 Brazos St., (512) 548-9675

This startup social hall functions more so as an IRL hub for meetups and events for the entrepreneur set, but it also offers quite a few open coworking events throughout the week if you prefer a more lively and interactive environment while you tap away at your laptop. You might meet your next full-stack developer here, or (more realistically) you might swill some beers and play pop-a-shot with some dudes who ditched California for the booming startup scene the Texas capital has been riding high on for several years now.

1700 S Lamar Blvd., #338, (512) 596-2683

Tucked in the back of a new build in the cozy Zilker/South Lamar neighborhood is Fibercove, a bright and buzzy coworking space that boasts off-street parking, a Google Fiber-powered network, a cafe, and a podcast studio where you and your best buds can chat about food and politics with the hopes of going viral. Local favorites like Odd Duck, Tiki Tatsu-Ya, and an Alamo Drafthouse outpost are within a short walk, and the space shares walls with a location of the boozy brunch chain Snooze if mimosas and chilaquiles are in order.

1115 E 11th St.

Austin is home to a staggering number of excellent coffee shops that focus solely on brewing great coffee. It's also chock-full of multiuse all-day drinking spots where the hours melt away and your taste for a cortado in the morning and a cafe de cachapa in the afternoon is joyously accommodated. Radio Rosewood falls in the latter camp. Coffee (and coffee cocktails, no judgment) start flowing at 7 am daily, and the Shortwave Diner truck parked outside slings a variety of diner staples like smash burgers, hot dogs, and breakfast sandwiches throughout most of Radio Rosewood's generous hours of operation.

Multiple locations

Figure 8 is one of the most popular purveyors for cafés that don't roast their own beans, which makes it easy to find just about anywhere, but the opportunity to try its outstanding espresso and drip coffee right at the source is one you must enjoy if possible. This low-slung rectangle of a building sits on the edge of a quiet residential area, but the inside is always buzzing gently with activity and caffeination. Order a shot made from African or Central American beans if possible, and keep an eye out for a bin of fresh breakfast tacos near the register if you need a snack.

Multiple locations

With a decade-plus of explosive growth in their rear view, it's fair to say Houndstooth is akin to third-wave roasters like Stumptown, Blue Bottle, and Intelligentsia, all of which are synonymous with their respective cities. Their downtown location lives in the lobby of an office tower right smack in the middle of Austin's business district, which makes it a great place to sip a cortado between meetings or escape the grind of the workday with a cold brew and a croissant.

1505 Town Creek Dr.

Nature is healing, and one of Austin's most beloved all-night hangs has finally resumed its 24/7 schedule. As its name denotes, The Buzz Mill is a lumber mill–themed coffee bar that's great for late-night study sessions, marathon coding sprints, work drinks with the crew, or a mellow place to sip on a drink or two while you wait for whatever it is you were doing all day to flush out of your system.

1201 S Lamar Blvd.

This South Lamar bistro casts a wide net in terms of influence, with contemporary riffs on Texan comfort classics serving as the backbone of the dozen-or-so items that populate its menu. Look no further than the climax of their current dinner offerings—a wagyu strip steak that's plated with tater tots and masa queso—for a cheeky tell of what to expect from their delightfully low-brow iterations on high-minded chefiness.

1900 S 1st St.

Austin is located in Texas, and people in Texas love animal products. On the other hand, Austin is also a hot spot for well-heeled progressives, which means the vegetarian and vegan food is on point if you know where to look. Bouldin Creek Cafe is a funky and colorful mainstay for eco-friendly fare that's elegant enough for a dinner date yet also crunchy enough to please a table of hungover hippies who went a bit too hard at the day rave that dragged on until 4 in the morning.

4710 E 5th St.

Justine's is an Austin-ified update of the French brasserie model of casual indulgence. Its kitchen serves up decadence until midnight on weekends, offering the pre- or post-party set decadent burgers, frites, seafood dishes, and a few stunning salad options that pair wonderfully with an expansive list of cocktails, aperitifs, and wines from all over the price spectrum.

2330 W N Loop Blvd.

For 50 years this North Austin cochina has gifted Texans with upscale Mexican cuisine that joyfully transcends what your average taqueria-goer imagines when food from south of the border comes to mind. Here you'll find stunning platters of wagyu tacos, tangy ceviches, and decadent mole that converge in a way that suggests what might happen when Mexico City answers the question of what a brasserie might look like in a hyper-modern American metropolis.

2305 E 7th St.

Founded by Joe Avila in 1962, this humble East Austin diner infuses hearty brunch fare with stately Mexican tradition. The proper move here is a breakfast plate that typically includes eggs, beans, potatoes, tortillas, and your choice of protein. Their signature dish—the Joey Rocha Plate—is centered around a rich pork guisada and sausage or bacon and is easily one of the most crave-worthy and iconic breakfast dishes in all of Austin. Smaller appetites are accommodated by a full lineup of tacos, including a handful of breakfast tacos alongside more traditional two-biters like barbacoa, chicharrone, and migas.

Anointing one barbecue spot out of the hundreds in the area as “the best” is a fool's errand, so a quick-and-dirty list of knockouts that suit a variety of needs is more appropriate. Know that most have a line well before they open, brisket sells out quickly, and very few are open more than three or four days a week. Terry Black's is an exception to all of these rules, with generous hours, a massive seating area, and an industrious pit that makes it easy to score award-winning brisket for the entire crew at 7 pm on a Monday. La Barbecue is a consensus favorite among chefs and influencers, earning high marks for its outstanding sausage and brisket, along with its approachability—online ordering is clutch when you don't have the time or patience for the line. KG BBQ has the most unique story on this list, with a charismatic Egyptian pitmaster who adds a Middle Eastern spin to familiar Texas staples in the form of sumac rice bowls topped with brisket, barbecue lamb pitas, and cardamom and pistachio rice pudding for dessert.

Similar to barbecue, there is no best breakfast taco spot in Austin. Most locals choose based on proximity and reliability, while natural selection weeds out the bad ones in short order. That said, the handful of locations in the Veracruz All Natural empire offer something for everyone all over town, and most of them are situated in a truck park that usually has coffee, pastries, and other local goodies on offer courtesy of the other vendors. Vaquero Taquero is a solid pick for folks situated near UT or downtown, and the Bouldin Creek location of El Tacorrido slings breakfast tacos (and other styles) out of a walk-up/drive-thru window every day from 7am to midnight.

1133 E 11th St.

This cheeky East Austin post-dive ingests the memories of every Midwestern transplant's favorite windowless dump and polishes them up real nice like, in a convivial nod to the great American institution that is the neighborhood watering hole. Ice cold lager and top-tier boozy slushies wash down satisfying pub grub courtesy of the Delray Cafe truck outside, which slings smash burgers, Detroit-style coneys, and all manner of fried fare until the wee hours of the evening.

406 Walsh St.

Better Half is a great place to start the morning with a breakfast sandwich and a coffee, put your head down, and grind away on your laptop for hours, then celebrate a job well done with a draft cocktail and another sandwich. Its light and airy aesthetic, plus its massive outdoor footprint, make this Old West Austin bar/café hybrid an inviting hub for productivity, lounging our outright shenanigans if the mood strikes.

3901 Promontory Point Dr.

While Austin has seen no shortage of IPA factories come to fruition in the past decade, it's fitting that its most significant opening rolled into town by way of the OP beer scene in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 2019 by a pair of Breakside veterans, the expansive, quasi-suburban footprint of Meanwhile brewing manages to be peak Austin in its amenities, with an massive outdoor space that boasts a stage, picnic tables galore, a kids play area, and a fleet of food trucks that puts many stand-alone truck parks to shame. The beer is also excellent, with a strong focus on crushable lagers, hazies, and the particular brand of West Coast IPAs that Breakside has brewed for award-winning results since the early 2010's.

440 E St. Elmo Rd., G-2

Not unlike Southern California, which happens to be the origin of many recent Austin transplants, you'll find most of the good breweries in an industrial park on the outskirts of the city proper. St. Elmo is such a place, though the plethora of eateries and pickleball courts that share the laneway mean you're not exactly departing to a remote desert of a place when a craving for a crushable kolsch and a massive chicken sandwich hits. Unlike many new school lager factories, St. Elmo commands a diverse range of styles that err on the crispy side but still check a variety of unique boxes. The aforementioned Kolsch, simply named Carl, is the obvious pick for your first pint, but your second could be anything from a Mexican Lager to a Dubai chocolate–inspired pastry stout.

1300 S Lamar Blvd.

Tiki Tatsu-Ya is a colorful and elaborate fever dream of all things tiki. Kitsch is balanced carefully with playfulness and refinement, yielding a fanciful experience that's punctuated by stiff drinks that aren't for the faint of heart. There are few better places to take a small group of friends who are in dire need of a boozy kick in the pants courtesy of a cocktail menu that balances tradition and innovation, with classics like Painkillers and Jungle Birds dancing alongside new-school shareables like the Daruma or the Aku Aku.

1704 E 5th St.

These days it feels like everyone's favorite neighborhood dive is on the verge of ruin, but the Yellow Jacket soldiers on as one of the last grungy gathering places in Austin where chain smoking and kvetching about condos is not only accepted but encouraged. The local-centric scene here is cordial enough to tolerate tourists and newcomers, provided you mind your manners by being chill and not ordering espresso martinis from the bar.

500 Comal St.

No trip to Texas is complete without a night of drunken line dancing, and The White Horse is the preeminent spot for just that. Its proximity to the hipster scene of East 6th means the rough edges that accentuate more suburban line dancing joints are sanded down ever so slightly, making it an approachable option for normies to kick up their boots with minimal jeering from dudes who have two first names and a well-stocked gun rack in the back window of their F-350.

1502 E 6th St.

This dusty saloon is the beating heart of the East 6th music scene, with a robust calendar that's always diverse but generally hems closer to locals and up-and-coming national acts from the blogosphere of Pitchfork, Stereogum, and the like. The vibrant back patio provides an unbeatable vantage point of a typical night out in Austin, complete with carousing youngsters, aging indie hipsters, honky tonk bros, and just about everything in between.

900 Red River St.

This rawkus downtown venue has been rumored to be on the brink of extinction for years, so it's a better time than any to assemble your crew and cut a rug at one of the preeminent LGBTQ-ish clubs before the slow, violent churn of gentrification claims yet another real one. The cramped quarter of the indoor dance floor maximize the party vibes even on weekends, and the outdoor space—which butts up against a massive limestone rock wall to dramatic effect—is a great place to rip a few shots and get down until denizens of the adjacent hotels and apartments call in yet another noise complains.

801 Red River St.

Only in Austin does one of the preeminent midsize outdoor music venues double as a legendary barbecue joint that has its own sauce you've probably seen at your local Kroger or Target. These days the barbecue at Stubb's is a serviceable afterthought to the heavyweight touring acts that grace its stage on a weekly basis, and it's a serious hub of SXSW activity when the music industry's favorite trade show turns the entire city into an ad hoc indie rock boomtown for a week every March.

2015 E Riverside Dr.

Though this legendary indie club opened a few years after the term “emo-core” was coined, its status as a must-play venue during the salad days of the burgeoning punk offshoot was cemented long before emo was we know it became a mainstream genre. In 2011 it moved from its original downtown location to its current spot just south of downtown in the Riverside neighborhood, and a quick scan of its calendar reveals that its bookings are as crucial as ever. It's the platonic ideal of a mid-size venue with excellent sight lines, efficient bar service, and a penchant for booking bands that are often too big for the space by the time their gig comes around.

While the author Pete Cottell isn't local to Austin, his fierce devotion to finding the best live music, barbecue, and dialed-in urbanity has brought him to the shores of the Colorado River more times than he can count. It took a few trips for him to figure out that they're food trucks (not carts, as in his former home of Portland) and that you probably should not trust any barbecue spot with no line and a pile of brisket left around dinnertime. He's deeply concerned about the condo plague that's stricken the beloved East 6th corridor, and he would rather rub elbows with weird uncles from Iowa and Oklahoma in the hours-long Franklin Barbecue queue than get within 20 feet of the Comedy Mothership, or anywhere on “Dirty 6th,” for that matter.

Cold plunging at the gym or having a chilly shower at home has become a popular practice in recent years. But is all the self-inflicted freezing really that good for you? With the promise of boosting your mood, providing mental clarity, and reducing muscle soreness post-workout, it may sound enticing, but it's not for everyone. Aside from making your teeth chatter, there are the notable negatives as well as its positives to consider.

Tasked with the challenge of testing the latest cold-plunge pools earlier this year, I reluctantly jumped on the bandwagon. With my adrenaline pumping and my endorphins having a disco post-plunge, I was hooked and have since became an ice bath advocate. But as with every wellness craze, it's worth keeping up with the ever-changing advice on best practices. Keen to find out more, I asked Gary Brecka, top biohacker and founder of The Ultimate Human, for advice on how to cold plunge for maximum benefit.

Whether you're a seasoned pro or a newbie wondering what all the fuss is about, take a deep, calming breath and jump right in. Find options for your own ice bath in the WIRED guide to the best cold-plunge tubs, with designs from the likes of PolarMonkeys, CalmMax, Plunge, and more.

Whether it's in the sea, a lake, or an ice bath at your local gym or at home, cold plunging means immersing your body in water that is 39 to 59 defrees Fahrenheit (4 to 15 Celsius). If you don't have a gym membership and don't fancy stripping down to your bathing suit at the local lake, an indoor bathtub filled with icy cold water will do. “You don't need an expensive set up,” says Brecka. “A bathtub with ice works. A horse trough in the backyard works. Dedicated plunge pools are convenient, but you'll get benefits no matter how you create cold exposure. It's consistency that matters more than equipment.”

So how long do you cold plunge and what temperature should a cold plunge be? Brecka suggests two to six minutes as the ideal time. It's long enough to activate the nervous system and short enough to stay safe. If you're new to cold plunging, however, under a minute is plenty.

“What are the benefits of cold plunging?” is the million dollar question you're probably asking yourself, right as you're staring into the tub (along with “Why don't you just have a warm cookie and hot chocolate instead?” which is what I often hear my inner child say.) Brecka suggests persevering for maximum benefit.

“We do a plunge because cold exposure activates your nervous system, improves circulation, and helps your body adapt to stress,” he says. “Cold plunging is not about powering through the shock, it's about letting that shock drive physiological change.”

Some studies show benefits for cold plunging, including from Harvard Medical School. While those studies are encouraging, however, they are not conclusive, and their effects vary considerably across the board.

“Exposure to cold water boosts levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that increases your energy level and makes you feel more alert,” says Brecka. “You can also get a big, measurable spike in dopamine release. This is the neurotransmitter that's linked with feeling pleasure and motivation. That's why I call cold plunging my ‘drug of choice.' It also activates cold shock proteins, which help protect cells from oxidative stress and inflammation. Cold exposure constricts blood vessels, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and helps the body recover faster.”

While it can be beneficial for both men and women, evidence is limited.

“For women, plunging right before ovulation may feel more stressful due to hormonal shifts, so it's best to listen to your body,” says Brecka. “For men, there aren't the same cycle considerations, but the benefits apply across the board.”

While cold plunging has a lot of instant positive effects, it's not safe for everyone. “You're not a polar bear,” points out the American Heart Association. Sudden immersion can cause “cold water shock,” with a sudden increase in breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. You should always check with a doctor for any underlying health conditions before you cold plunge.

“Going too cold, too fast, or too long can cause shock or fainting,” says Brecka. “The main risk is pushing past your body's limits. Always breathe, relax, and build tolerance gradually. I would recommend keeping it under five minutes, especially to start. People with heart conditions should consult a doctor.”

Cold plunging needn't be a public affair to broadcast on your socials. If you're keen to give it a try but are worried about the freezing temperatures, you can start with a cold shower.

“Get comfortable with 30 to 60 seconds at the end of your shower,” says Brecka. “Then progress to cold plunges at 50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit for a few minutes and build down over time. Cold showers trigger some of the same effects. But full immersion in cold water is more powerful as it hits more surface area and drops your core temperature faster. Showers are a great entry point, but plunges are the deeper therapy.”

In the midst of an unprecedented AI buildout, Meta is spending more than most. The company is building two massive data centers, and reporting indicates there will be as much as $600 billion in spending on U.S. infrastructure over the next three years.  

Those figures might not raise eyebrows in Silicon Valley, but they're starting to make Wall Street nervous. 

The issue came to a head this week as Meta reported quarterly earnings, which showed the company's operating expenses jumping $7 billion year-over-year and nearly $20 billion in capital expense. It was the result of intense spending on AI talent and infrastructure, which has yet to bring in meaningful revenue for the company. When analysts pressed for more specifics, Mark Zuckerberg made it clear the spending was just getting started. 

“The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need, both for the AI research and new things that we're doing, and to try to get to a different state on our compute stance on the core business,” Zuckerberg told analysts on the call. “Our view is that when we get the new models that we're building in MSL in there and get like truly frontier models with novel capabilities that you don't have in other places, then I think that this is just a massive latent opportunity.” 

If his goal was to reassure investors, it didn't work. By the end of the call, Meta's share price had plummeted in value. Two days later, the rout has only deepened. The Meta's stock dropped 12% by the closing bell on Friday, representing more than $200 billion in lost market cap. 

It's dangerous to read too much into stock prices, and in strict financial terms, Meta's quarterly earnings weren't that bad. ($20 billion in quarterly profit is nothing to complain about.) But this was the first quarter in which Meta's aggressive AI spending on both talent and infrastructure had a visible impact on the company's bottom line. Even more alarming was that, aside from a lot of enormous data centers and well-compensated AI researchers, it wasn't clear what the money actually bought.  

Analysts pressed Zuckerberg on why he was spending so much on AI, and when they could expect to see revenue from the growing spending. But the call came at an odd spot in Meta's planning, with no clear budget for projected spending and no available product that could anchor a revenue forecast. As a result, Zuckerberg was left with only general claims about the promise of AI.  

“There are going to be all kinds of new products around different content formats, and we're starting to see that,” he asid during the call. “And then there are the business versions of all these too, like business A … the other part is how more intelligent models are just going to improve the core business and improve the recommendations that we make across the Family of Apps and improve the recommendations in advertising.” 

Meta isn't the only company spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, so it's worth teasing out why this same spending isn't spooking investors at Google or Nvidia, both of which had a great quarter. OpenAI is the biggest offender, spending the same amount with far less financial cushion than Meta.  

There really are concerns that we're creating a bubble, and if we are, Meta's core business will let it ride things out better than most. 

But if you ask Sam Altman why he's spending hundreds of billions of dollars on compute, he'll tell you he's operating one of the fastest growing consumer services in human history — and one bringing in $20 billion a year in revenue. We can argue about how sustainable the growth rate is (that's a separate blog post), but there really is a fast-growing product at the bottom of all the OpenAI hype. A fast-growing ARR figure goes a long way to answer questions. 

Meta doesn't have a product like that, and it's not clear where it's going to come from.  

The company's most powerful AI product is the Meta AI assistant, which Zuckerberg noted on the call has more than a billion active users. But those numbers are surely juiced by the three billion active users on Facebook and Instagram, and it's hard to see the current version of Meta AI as a competitor to ChatGPT. There's also the Vibes video generator, which really did boost daily active users, but has limited business impact beyond that.  

The most ambitious project is the Vanguard smart glasses released earlier this month. However, the glasses feel more like an extension of Meta's Reality Labs work than a real attempt to harness the power of LLMs.  

Put simply, these are promising experiments, not fully formed products. 

It's telling then that when he was pressed on infrastructure spending, Zuckerberg's response wasn't to point to the recent launches, but to focus on the next generation. 

Zuckerberg stressed, while emphasizing the pending impact of the Superintelligence Lab's new models, that he was very excited about new products.  

“It's not just Meta AI as an assistant,” he said. “We expect to build novel models and novel products, and I'm excited to share more when we have it.”  

But this was an earnings call, not a product launch, so all he could say was that there would be more to share “in the coming months.” 

As the market response showed that answer is wearing thin.  

To be fair, it's only been four months since Zuckerberg restructured his company's AI team, and the new Superintelligence team hasn't had time to launch an earthshaking AI product yet. But as the company spends billions of dollars to stay competitive in AI, there's still no clear indication of what role Zuckerberg wants to play in the new industry.  

Will Meta AI use the company's detailed store of personal data to grow into a ChatGPT competitor? Is Vibes the first step in a consumer entertainment play, building off Meta's targeted ad system? Or maybe Zuckerberg's references to “business AI” are hints at a more detailed enterprise play? 

So far, it's anyone's guess. Whatever the answer, the pressure is on Meta to find it — and soon.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently said that the company is doing “well more” than $13 billion in annual revenue — and he sounded a little testy when pressed on how it will pay for its massive spending commitments.

His comments came up during a joint interview on the Bg2 podcast between Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the partnership between their two companies. Host Brad Gerstner (who's also founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital) brought up reports that the company is currently bringing in around $13 billion in revenue — a sizable amount, but one that's dwarfed by more than $1 trillion in spending commitments for computing infrastructure that OpenAI has made for the next decade.

“First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that,” Altman said. “Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. I just — enough. I think there are a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares.”

“Including myself,” Gerstner interjected.

Altman then added that there are critics who “talk with a lot of breathless concern about our compute stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy our shares.”

In fact, he said that although there are “not many times” when he wants OpenAI to be a public company, “One of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous ‘OpenAI is about to go out of business' [posts], I would love to tell them they could just short the stock, and I would love to see them get burned on that.”

Altman acknowledged that there are ways the company “might screw it up” — for example by failing to get access to enough computing resources — but he said that “revenue is growing steeply.”

“We are taking a forward bet that it will continue to grow, and that not only will ChatGPT keep growing, but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds, that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing, that AI that can automate science will create huge value,” he added.

Nadella, who laughed through much of Altman's answer, also claimed that OpenAI has “beaten” every business plan that it's given Microsoft as an investor.

Gerstner returned to the subject of OpenAI's revenues and IPO plans later in the interview, when he speculated about the company reaching $100 billion in revenue in 2028 or 2029.

“How about ‘27?” Altman countered.

At the same time, he denied reports that OpenAI plans to go public next year.

“No no no, we don't have anything that specific,” Altman said. “I'm a realist, I assume it will happen someday, but I don't know why people write these reports. We don't have a date in mind, we don't have a board decision to do this or anything like that. I just assume it's where things will eventually go.”

X11's practical absence of any security mechanisms for user sessions means you should probably not run any kind of low-trust UI program anyway, as there is no prevention of keystroke injection or screen recording, but that's a design flaw that will never be solved. That doesn't mean that EoP style attacks like these should be ignored or underestimated, though.

reply

Any program you run on a computer (especially a Linux computer, which lacks modern OS security measures and has constant privesc kernel holes) exposes you to security flaws. There has yet to be any computer system designed that a hacker can't break out of. If you intentionally download and execute a program, you are rolling the dice, regardless of what the software is.What's insane about all these discussions is that NOBODY IS HACKING X SERVERS. There's a thousand other kinds of software on Linux that there is real malware for. But nobody is trying to hijack your X11 session. This imagined threat is a red herring designed to bolster the argument for Wayland's horrible designs.

The deal here is that the only way to fix X11's security issues is by breaking all those types of workflows and forcing application rewrites to implement them in authenticated ways.So if you are going have to go and break all that stuff, why not fix a crapload of other problems while you are at it?Calling Wayland ""X13"" may have avoided a lot of misunderstandings, but it probably would of caused others.

I'm not for it, don't want it, but I can't help myself but to see that as the future, as fraud ramps up even more, gets cheaper and businesses feel they have no other way to combat it except adding more tracking everywhere, something blockchains and cryptocurrencies excel at, for better or worse.

reply

I'm not sure either, it's mostly a guess I guess, more than a prediction. But if companies/governments can get more tracking, usually that's the way they move.So if the companies that are complaining in the article implements your simple measures, does that mean the fraud problem they're talking about have been solved already? That begs the question, why aren't they just doing that then?

Traditional banking already does this very well in most countries, through centralized systems with multiple redundant tracking and audit methods. Furthermore, crypto transaction fees are ludicrously high by comparision, and rarely offer the combination of ""fast transactions"" and ""undo button"" that traditional banking can provide.

reply

So how does traditional banking solve the very problem the submission article is about? Companies seem to say this is an issue today, some seeing 15% fraudulent receipts, if traditional banking did these things well, why are these companies still seeing these issue?Again, I'm not arguing that things will be better with cryptocurrencies, just that if we suddenly see companies and governments urging people to adopt cryptocurrencies, I'd totally understand why, although I'd push against it as much as I could.

Maybe the companies in the article complaining about the fraud isn't aware you can do something like that? Or is there something else stopping them from doing that? Why isn't everyone doing that if it solves the very problem outlined in the article?

In Estonia, the government offers public key infrastructure, so any party needing to prove legitimacy of documents from a 3rd party can get it digitally signed by the originator. For example, when you need a bank statement, you can just download a signed PDF (technically it's a zip, but whatever) that proves the legal entity (or person) that ensures it's legitimate.

reply

Agreed! But if I've learned anything in my years on earth so far, is that anything that can be misused, will be misused, and if companies and government can do something that adds more abilities for tracking people, they'll go that way. If it can work cross-border, give people the impression it's ""the future"" and let companies/governments get more power, then they'll continuously push for that future.

Once it happens in the future, probably because the already rich politicians have loaded up on some specific cryptocurrency they then try to pitch as the official currency for their country. Already happened once, and I'm sure we'll see more of it in the future as the overton window moves when the population gets older.I don't think it's a good idea, I'm not eager to reach that future, but it's hard not to have the most negative view of the future considering what's happening in the moment around the world. I guess I'm too pessimistic not to see that as the eventual outcome.

Parking lots are horrible.  They're butt ugly heat islands that take up way too much space.  While adding solar on them doesn't solve the last issue, it does help mitigate the heat island effect and solar panels are no less ugly than asphalt.  Plus it is power creation right next to where it is being consumed for minimal transfer losses.  It's also much nicer for the vehicles parked there to be in the shade.

BTW, here's a ""discussion paper"" by Paulson and Leslie Lamport about typing in specification laguages from 1999: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Reports/lamport-paulso.... Paulson represents the ""pro-type"" view, but note that since that paper was written, there have been developments in mechanised theorem proving of untyped formalisms, including in Lamport's own (TLA+).

reply

The Curry-Howard correspondence, using dependent type system to have ""proofs"" be equivalent to ""types"", is powerful, but it can be really confusing. From a human point of view, there is a huge difference between ""Your proof is wrong"" and ""You wrote a statement that fails typechecking"".Intuitively, when you make an error with types, it should be something fairly trivial that you just read the error and fix it up. When you make an error in a proof, it's understandable if it's very complicated and requires thought to fix. The natural UI is different.So I agree with the author that the greatest benefit of Lean is not its typesystem per se, but its community. Specifically the fact that Lean's library of mathematics, mathlib, is organized like an open source community with pull requests. Whereas Isabelle's library of mathematics, the AFP, is organized like a scientific journal with referees.I'm working on a dependent type system at the moment for a new theorem prover - Acorn, at https://acornprover.org - and my hope is to combine the good points of both Lean and Isabelle. It's nice that Lean has the power to cleanly express the simple dependent types that mathematicians often use, like vector spaces or quotients. But if you use dependent types too much then it does get complicated to debug what's happening.

Whereas Isabelle's library of mathematics, the AFP, is organized like a scientific journal with referees.I'm working on a dependent type system at the moment for a new theorem prover - Acorn, at https://acornprover.org - and my hope is to combine the good points of both Lean and Isabelle. It's nice that Lean has the power to cleanly express the simple dependent types that mathematicians often use, like vector spaces or quotients. But if you use dependent types too much then it does get complicated to debug what's happening.

To clarify, as long as 5 and 10 are constants, this is entirely possible in C++ and Rust^1, neither of which are dependently typed (or at most are dependently typed in a very weak sense). In general, neither can ensure at compile time that an index only known at runtime is in bounds, even if the bounds themselves are statically known. A proper dependently-typed language can prevent runtime out-of-bound errors even if neither the indices nor the bounds are known at type check time.^1 And weakly in many other languages whose builtin array types have compile-time bounds. But C++ and Rust let user-defined generic types abstract over constant values.

looks like this:    def batch_outer_product(x:   TensorType[""batch"", ""x_channels""],
                            y:   TensorType[""batch"", ""y_channels""]
                            ) -> TensorType[""batch"", ""x_channels"", ""y_channels""]:

    return x.unsqueeze(-1) * y.unsqueeze(-2)

There's also https://github.com/thomasahle/tensorgrad which uses sympy for ""axis"" dimension variables:    b, x, y = sp.symbols(""b x y"")
    X = tg.Variable(""X"", b, x)
    Y = tg.Variable(""Y"", b, y)
    W = tg.Variable(""W"", x, y)
    XWmY = X @ W - Y

> A proper dependently-typed language can prevent runtime out-of-bound errors even if neither the indices nor the bounds are known at type check time.Yes, but the way this is done is by threading a proof ""this index is within bounds"" throughout the code.  At runtime (e.g. within 'extracted' code, if you're using common dependently-typed systems), this simply amounts to relying on a kind of capability or ghost 'token' that attests to the validity of that code.  You ""manufacture"" the capability as part of an explicit runtime check when needed (e.g. if the ""index"" or ""bounds"" come from user input) and simply rely on it as part of the code.

Often in dependently-types languages one also tries to prove at compile-time that the dynamic index is inside the dynamic bound at run-time, but this depends.

Or do you see it at somewhat a higher order, since values are proof for a type, and types can perhaps be proof at a higher level if they are first class citizen in the language?(Which makes me think that dependent types is really a stairway between two type systems?)Just wondering, since I had never personally seen it described in that fashion.Other question: What is the function and runtime treatment of dependent types?
Can they be instantiated on the spot by runtime values?
A bit like defining/declaring functions that return arrays of runtime-known length?
Does it involve two aspects of type checking? compile and runtime?
Implementation-wise, doesn't it require too many indirections?

I would have liked to read more about Lean's alleged performance issues, and the issues around intentional equality. For the latter, I understand one can run into the need for heterogeneous equality (https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/Basic-Proposition...) when types are propositionally equal, but not definitionally equal. It has been some time I worked seriously in a dependently-typed language, but I recall coming to the conclusion that dependent types are best used as little as possible, for exactly this reason. If something may be stated as a theorem after the fact instead of putting it in the type, that was my preference.Certainly there is something strongly aesthetically appealing about dependent type theory. The unification of programs and proofs and the natural emergence of independent proof objects. I am open to the idea that overly-dogmatic insistence on a type-theoretic basis to a theorem prover could lead to pragmatic issues, but I'd need to see more examples to be convinced there is a better foundation.Anyway, I agree with Dr. Paulson's point that dependent types aren't necessary to verify interesting systems. He talked more of pure mathematics, but I am more interested in software verification. I work heavily in ACL2 which, not only does it not have dependent types, it doesn't have static typing at all! It is, however, also a first order logic and the both of these facts can sometimes be frustrating. Various libraries have been introduced to simulate typing and higher-ordered reasoning.

The most unique/useful applications of it in production are based on combining dependent types with database/graph queries as a means. This enables you to take something like RDF which is neat in a lot of ways but has a lot of limitations, add typing and logic to the queries, in order to generally reimagine how you think about querying databases.For those interested in exploring this space from a ""I'd like to build something real with this"", I'd strongly recommend checking out TypeDB (typedb.com). It's been in development for about a decade, is faster than MongoDB for vast swaths of things, and is one of the most ergonomic frameworks we've found to designing complex data applications (Phosphor's core is similar in many ways to Palantir's ontology concept). We went into it assuming that we were exploring a brand new technology, and have found it to work pretty comprehensively for all kinds of production settings.

When you drive past a solar project on the side of the road, you see the solar technology producing energy. But in order for a bank to fund $100M to construct the project, it has to be ""developed"" as if it were a long-term financial product across 15 or so major agreements (power offtake, lease agreement, property tax negotiations, etc). The fragmentation of tools and context among all the various counterparties involved to pull this sort of thing together into a creditworthy package for funding is enormously inefficient and as a result, processes which should be parallelize-able can't be parallelized, creating large amounts of risk into the project development process.While all kinds of asset class-specific tools exist for solar or real estate or whatever, most of them are extremely limited in function because almost of those things abstract down into a narrative that you're communicating to a given party at any given time (including your own investment committee), and a vast swath of factual information represented by deterministic financial calculations and hundreds if not thousands of pages of legal documentation.We build technology to centralize/coordinate/version control these workflows in order to unlock an order of magnitude more efficiency across that entire process in its totality. But instead of selling software, we sell those development + financing outcomes (which is where _all_ of the value is in this space), because we're actually able to scale that work far more effectively than anyone else right now.

If you need finely indexed invariants, sure, reach for DT. For the other 95%, HOL plus type classes and locales, backed by a small kernel and big libraries, will get you to production faster and with fewer regrets. Milner's LCF insight still pays the bills. And yes, croissants are delicious, but optional axioms are a risky breakfast.

At Gizmodo, we love a good story about aliens—especially if it gives us a headache. Personally, I reward extra points for bonus dad jokes.

Daniel Whiteson and Andy Warner's upcoming book, Do Aliens Speak Physics? And Other Questions about Science and the Nature of Reality presents the best combination of all these things. The book imagines what it would be like to discuss physics with aliens, drawing from a diverse array of experts in the history and philosophy of science—accompanied by Warner's delightful illustrations plus physics puns and hypothetical donuts.

Co-author Daniel Whiteson is a particle physicist at CERN and the University of California, Irvine, as well as a science communicator and host of the podcast Daniel and Kelly's Extraordinary Universe. Gizmodo spoke to Whiteson about the philosophical nature of the search for aliens and what it reveals about our own humanity. The following conversation has been lightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Gayoung Lee, Gizmodo: Okay, so, do aliens speak physics? What is this question even asking?

Daniel Whiteson: I don't know if aliens speak physics! That's why I wrote this book, to argue both sides of this question. I feel like a lot of physicists assume that the physics we are doing is universal… that the way we're doing things and our way of life is the only way.

I wanted to push back on that a little bit and explore and make the opposite argument and suggest that there might be a lot of humanity in the physics that we're doing—the way we think about it, the questions we're asking, the answers we accept, and our path into physics.

Gizmodo: At the very start of your book, you introduce an extended version of something called the Drake equation. What is it, and how have you reimagined it?

Whiteson: The Drake equation is a fun way to organize your thoughts about whether there are other intelligent civilizations in the galaxy. There have to be stars or planets for them, life that evolved to develop sentience and technology, and they have to do it all roughly within a time window that we can communicate with them.

It breaks these features apart because they are separate issues. It emphasizes something really crucial: you've got to have all the pieces to work. If any of those numbers go to zero, you're out of luck.

But in the book, we're not just interested in intelligent aliens. We want to find intelligent aliens that do science the way that we do so we can learn from them. Otherwise, it's just too big a space to explore, and all those things must come together for this intergalactic science conference that is my personal fantasy.

Gizmodo: Okay, so let's unpack some of these additions. The first one is about whether aliens do science at all.

Whiteson: Sure. This was tricky to tackle. I think a lot of people assume that if aliens arrive, they're technological—because they've gotten here. They have some way to cross the vast distances between the stars, so they must have a scientific understanding of how they did that.

But historians of science and philosophers of science understand that technology doesn't require science. We've been using stone tools for millions of years. We had technology in terms of writing, fermentation, metallurgy, and agriculture. These are technological improvements that have improved our lives without us understanding how they worked.

Having a scientific mindset is going to accelerate your technology, but it's not essential. So that's what we dig into in that question. Is science actually essential? What is science anyway?

Gizmodo: So assuming aliens are scientific, another element is whether they ask the same questions.

Whiteson: One motivating piece of philosophy for me was this question of emergence—why is the universe understandable at all? We can use fairly simple mathematical tools to understand the world around us. Instead of the universe just being filled with chaos, somehow this simplicity emerges.

We don't know what the fundamental layer of reality is—if it even has one. So, all of our science studies emergent phenomena. It might be that it's sort of a way we filter the universe. The universe is crazy and filled with all sorts of buzzing noise, but we see certain stories that are of interest to us.

On the other hand, if emergence is something that's part of the universe—like there's just some way things average out—then we'll have that in common with aliens. They'll study planets the way that we do. They'll study particles the way that we do. They'll see the same simple stories. But it's not something we know the answer to until they show up.

Gizmodo: Do you think there's any point in trying to communicate with animals on Earth to prepare for aliens? It can be argued that interspecies communication among animals on Earth has practically zero bearing on how an extraterrestrial, intelligent being might message us.

Whiteson: I think I would disagree. I mean, I agree that it's unlikely that learning dolphin is going to help us communicate with the aliens. But the fact that we've failed to communicate with those species tells us that we have a lot to learn about talking to other species and that more practice and more success could set us up for more success in the future.

There are definitely some assumptions we're making and some barriers we haven't pushed through. So, we can't understand why or how whales are singing to each other and how bats are clicking to each other, but there's definitely something going on there.

Gizmodo: The extended Drake equation isn't a yes-or-no question on whether aliens exist. It's an ideal scenario in which we could have a meaningful, intellectual exchange with them.

Whiteson: Yeah.

Gizmodo: I'm sensing that makes it even harder for us to encounter the “ideal” alien civilization. In your view, what is the worst-case scenario that doesn't end with everyone on Earth dying?

Whiteson: (Laughs) Yeah, well, one amazing outcome is that we have everything aligned with them. They just tell us the answers, and we're catapulted into the future of science—incredible!

More frustrating, what you might call a worst-case scenario, is that there is nobody else out there doing science the way that we are. They're not interested in our questions. They're looking for different answers. They see a different slice of the universe—we're alone at the table at the Intergalactic Science Conference. That would be unfortunate.

From a philosophical point of view, it might be more fun if the aliens don't satisfy any of our requirements, because that's when we learn about our own peculiarities. Like, “Oh, wow, that is interesting that we do this science this one way, and everybody else is doing it that way. What does that mean about being human?”

So I think the philosophers would be more excited if we were the only ones in the galaxy doing science this particular way. But the physicists would be frustrated for sure.

Gizmodo: On that note, is the search for intelligent alien life really humanity's own ego search?

Whiteson: Oh, for sure. Definitely. On one hand, we want to find aliens similar to us, because it validates us. On the other hand, that discovery, finding lots of human-like aliens, would make us less special.

My favorite thing about searching for aliens is that any answer is mind-blowing and wonderful in its own way. So, I'm definitely pro-aliens, no matter what. Even if the aliens show up and do send us to the hydrogen mines, I still think that would be interesting. I'm that much pro-alien visitation—I'll take the risk!

Gizmodo: The book presents an impressive union of philosophy and science, but you're a physicist at heart. So, having written this book, doing the research for it… How has the process changed the way that you approach your own work as a scientist?

Whiteson: Good question. You know, I've always been interested in philosophy at an amateur level. But I realized that particle physics is filled with people who have strong philosophical opinions but think philosophy is a waste of time. They have this [Richard] Feynman attitude that physicists need philosophers the way birds need ornithologists.

If you ask them, is the top quark real? Was it there before we discovered it? They'll say, “Of course, what are you, an idiot? Of course it is. It's physical; it's there. We found it; we didn't create it.”

… I found those two things in conflict. Yeah, we didn't create these particles, but we never see them, we don't hold them in our hands, and we don't interact with them. We're telling stories about the way the universe works. But in the end, those are stories, and they're stories that satisfy us. We don't know if the same stories would satisfy other people, so it definitely shines a light on my own work and makes me wonder what it means.

But even if physics isn't universal, it doesn't make me less interested in doing physics. I still think it's a super fun puzzle to try to unravel the universe. We're in this intimate relationship with the universe, and it matters what matters to us. It's part of being human.

When technology is at its best and focused on improving our lives, like a great-sounding pair of wireless headphones or a really good computer mouse, it can be indispensable. But when the companies making our gadgets drift away from the user experience and start checking off boxes and publishing bigger numbers, the basics can get lost in the mix.

That's exactly what's happening with the Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller, a premium robot vacuum with perhaps too many ideas. Which is not to say the ideas are bad. In fact, the Aqua10 Ultra Roller is gadget-y in ways that I always hoped robots would be when I was a kid in the ‘90s, all whirring motors and parts that pop out of its body to do things. Its mop roller juts out of its side for better edge mopping, the periscope-like sensor array sinks into the body to let it go under things, and little legs let it climb over obstacles and onto slightly higher surfaces. I love that stuff, and it all seems to work just fine.

Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller

The Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller is an expensive disappointment.

Pros

Cons

But things haven't come together for the Aqua10 elsewhere. And unfortunately, it was the robot vacuum basics—navigating my home, sucking up debris, and managing its own charge—where the Aqua10 failed the hardest while I was testing it. I think Dreame could fix these problems with a few software updates, but as things stand, I'd be sorely disappointed if I'd paid $1,600 for a product that has so much trouble with these standard tasks.

The Dreame Aqua10 Ultra Roller is a big white circle that stands tall, at 3.84 inches, or 4.72 inches with its sensor array extended. Where it differs from a lot of robot vacuums is all those robotic parts serving different purposes. It's fun watching the sensor array lower until it's flush with the body to get under my couch, and it's satisfying to see the mop roller slide out to follow the contours of furniture. Same goes for the side brush, when it pops out to slap dust out of corners its big disc shape would otherwise make difficult to reach.

Tucked into the Aqua10's side wheel wells is a pair of stubby legs, with wheels on the ends, that unfold and jut downward to shove the robot up at an angle. (In this mode, it sort of resembles the Wheelers from Return to Oz, except not terrifying.) I don't have any transitions that actually require the Aqua10 to use this feature—though it did decide, twice, that a dining room rug in my home called for it—so I stacked up some shelving wood I had lying around. I couldn't get to exactly the 1.65 inches that Dreame says it can handle at once, but the robot climbed onto a 1.5-inch-tall stack just fine. It's no stair climber, but I have no worries about this robot vacuum balking at thicker carpets.

You can adjust how each of the robotic parts behaves if you're willing to explore the labyrinthine depths of the Dreamehome app. Here, you'll find pages and pages of menus, toggles, and sliders that seemingly let you tweak everything about the robot. Want to set the mop roller never to extend, or to do so only once a week? You can do that. Want to set the robot to clean every night, but to avoid mopping one specific room on Tuesdays and Thursdays? Also possible. You can set suction power; or decide if you want the robot to vacuum and mop room-by-room or vacuum every room, then mop every room; or set it only to mop in the direction of a hardwood floor's planks to avoid roughing up the long edges.

Neat stuff, and it's nice to have options, but wow is it a lot, and not to mention arranged in a way that I think will turn many folks into the Homer Simpson backing into shrubbery meme. That could be mitigated were more power user-oriented features tucked one layer deeper than the more straightforward ones like scheduling and cleaning history, which ought to be right on the Aqua10 landing page and aren't.

Also, some options just feel like padding. For instance, on one page, you can tell the robot not to mop the carpet. That should just be standard behavior—I shouldn't need to forbid rug-mopping! Others don't appear to do anything at all, including many parts of a suite of “Pet Care” features. With Pet Care turned on, the Aqua10 is supposed to do more intense cleaning around things like pet dishes and litter boxes. It was hard to evaluate this around my dogs' dishes—mainly because they just aren't messy eaters—but the Aqua10 seemed to do the opposite of intense cleaning around our cat's litter box, leaving a lot of debris behind. “Pet Moments” identifies your pets and takes pictures of them, although it only captured two images—one still and one GIF—of mine during my time with it. Dreame told Gizmodo it's possible my pets were just “camera-shy,” which they weren't; they're very used to robot vacuum hijinks and seem to almost relish being in the way. Perhaps the Aqua10 looked upon them and found them wanting (in which case, sorry to Dreame's algorithms, but we are in disagreement).

Other features just aren't labeled clearly, a common feature of apps made by non-English-speaking developers. Take the toggle for Collision-Avoidance Mode. I would assume that turning this off would have the device barreling into walls and furniture, but that's not really what it does. It's more like switching it from a vacuum that's very cautious not to touch walls to one that isn't quite as careful.

Finally, there's not a whiff of support for the universal smart home platform Matter, despite the fact that it's promised on the Aqua10's product page. Dreame told Gizmodo that Matter support is coming by the end of November with a software update. That's all good, but why advertise it as being Matter-compliant if it's not yet? Until that update, Aqua10 owners will have to make do with Amazon Alexa or Google Home integration, basic automations using the Apple Shortcuts app, or the robot's built-in voice assistant, which is clunky at best and requires a lot of rote memorization of pre-programmed commands.

It's possible that Dreame bit off more than it could chew in time for launch. But if these features weren't ready yet, the least the company could've done was mark them “coming soon” or “beta.” Otherwise, it just feels like all these toggles are just there to make the robot seem more featureful than it actually is.

I was deeply annoyed once I actually started using the Aqua10. Before we get to why, let's start with what this robot does well. Thing number one is all of the robotic stuff. Apart from the robotic legs doing their thing when I tried testing it, the extending mop roller is really good at following the contours of things like furniture while mopping, slipping in and out of the Aqua10's side as it drives alongside them. And it was cool watching it sink its sensor cluster down into its body to go under furniture, then raise it again as it exited. Its object recognition is very solid—it definitely still tried to vacuum up things like screws and marbles, but the Aqua10 would not be fooled into sucking up socks or towels I placed in its way, nor a pile of coffee grounds I plopped down as a makeshift pet poop simulation.

Mopping performance was solid, although not as good as Dreame's marketing materials would have you believe (imagine that!). Despite all of its features—a robotic mop roller, which self-rinses during cleans and gets a heated bath of sorts when docked; a software slider in the Dreamhome app to set how wet you want the roller during cleans; options to set higher or lower downward mopping pressure; and the ability to tweak how tightly it overlaps its cleaning passes—the Aqua10 is good for regular maintenance mopping and not much more. It left behind streaks of ketchup when I squirted a patch of my floor with the stuff. It didn't make a dent in a dried mystery stain in my dining room. In both cases, the roughly $500-cheaper Matic robot I recently reviewed did a better job, totally clearing the ketchup as well as the exact stain the Aqua10 failed to clean. On the plus side, the Aqua10 never mopped any of my rugs—its ability to discern between carpets and hard floors was spot-on, at least in my house.

Before and after mopping runs, the Aqua10 Ultra Roller's dock—a complicated, mini-fridge-sized piece of machinery—goes to work. Behind a panel in the front are the floor cleaning solutions and dustbag, and beneath the lid on top, two large tubs for clean and dirty water. You'll hear humming, gurgling, and spitting from the dock as it pumps water to and from the robot in preparation for a clean. During this, the Aqua10 sprays heated water over its mop roller, which turns, scrubbing itself on a recessed, textured plate in the dock. This whole process lasts for several minutes as the Aqua10's built-in speaker announces, each step of the way, what it's doing. (If you find that as annoying as I do, you can turn the voice down; all the way to zero, if you want.) All of this isn't too loud, per se, it's just an aggressive amount of activity for something that just does an okay job at mopping.

While we're on the subject of noise: When the Aqua10's dock auto-empties the robot's dustbin, it's about as blaring as the Eufy L35+ Hybrid I own. Which is to say, it's startling if you're in the same room and didn't expect it, and I would definitely restrict when it can do that, using the app's Do Not Disturb schedule.

As for vacuuming, or what is really job number one of these devices, the Aqua 10 wasn't a lot better than my almost-three-year-old and poorly maintained Roomba J7. It missed a lot more than I would've expected during nightly cleans, leaving behind little scraps of paper or small rocks that had been tracked into my house. The same goes for spot cleans; the Aqua10 would spread bits of dirt with its side brush, flinging them out of range before missing them later.

When I ran the Aqua10 on my basement rugs, which don't get vacuumed as often as the rest of my home, it did this weird thing where it pooped out balled-up hair and string after they were caught in its anti-tangle brush roller, then left them behind when it finished cleaning. Sure, just about every robot vacuum misses things, and picking balls of hair up by hand is definitely better than having to painstakingly cut them off of a roller like with the Roomba J7, but if I'm paying $1,600 for a robot, I don't want to do nearly this much cleaning up after it. When I flipped the robot over and looked under its dual rollers after a week of testing, I saw a clog forming where built-up hair and string was partially blocking the area around the suction hole, which I thought could be why the Aqua10 was leaving so much behind on its cleans, but it didn't do better when I ran it again after clearing the blockage.

The worst part of the whole experience was that I couldn't count on the Aqua10 Ultra Roller to finish a clean without babysitting it. It needed to recharge itself after cleaning between 190 sq. ft. and 300 sq. ft. of my house every night—battery life is definitely an issue—and so would stop working and go look for the dock. More than half the time it didn't make it there. Most of those times, it found the dock but just didn't manage to park in it—why it didn't was unclear, and it would dock just fine when I found it in the morning and pressed the Aqua10's physical home button. Once, it drove around to the hallway behind where the dock is and sat there until it ran out of battery. Every robot vacuum I've ever owned or tried has similar problems, but usually only occasionally; this was almost every night, even after remapping the floor and taking care to move the chairs in my dining room, where the dock lived, so it had plenty of runway.

On one of the final nights of testing, I sat and watched the Aqua10 clean, then timed it as it spun around and around in front of its dock at the end, pausing to move a bit here and there before spinning in more circles. It took more than six minutes for it to settle on an approach vector and park to recharge. It was like watching a bugged-out Skyrim NPC. This was after it not only drove over several bits of dirt and paper throughout my home without collecting them, but also spit out new pieces of garbage in my dining room that it got from who-knows-where.

Robot vacuums have an unusually personal kind of access to us that other products do not. If their manufacturers want, they can gather details about the layout of your home, your habits throughout the day, how your space changes as time goes on, how many people live in or visit your home, and even how much dirt and dust you generate. Their cameras are pointed at you and your home from all kinds of angles, and some, like the Aqua10, even have microphones to power voice assistants. I'm not saying Dreame is abusing this access, but I am saying that when products like this require an internet connection to work, they also require a massive level of trust. Robot vacuum companies probably can't glean as detailed a picture of your life as a smartphone manufacturer can, but the data points could still be valuable as marketers (or government agencies) seek to build a more comprehensive picture of who you are and what you like to do. It's not something we all want to think too deeply about, and many of us are resigned to it at this point. But it's still worth looking at what your robot vacuum and its associated software might be doing behind the scenes.

And just so you know, there is a lot of extra chatter coming from the Dreamhome app, especially the first few days after I set up the Aqua10. My iOS App Privacy Report indicated that Dreamehome had, at one point, contacted 185 different domains in the seven days prior. Many were Dreame's own domains, but others belonged to companies like Facebook, Baidu, and Google, and some—one of which the app had contacted more than 500 times in just a few days—are completely unnamed. (When I looked up the one in question, it appeared to be Alibaba's cloud compute service.) The next most-active platform, YouTube, had pinged 173 mostly Google-owned domains, one of which it reached nearly 400 times. For a more direct comparison, the iRobot app had reached out to 37 domains, including a handful of what looked like trackers, and the Matic app had contacted exactly one web address: the local IP address of the Matic robot.

Like a lot of people, I've come to accept that there is a data privacy trade-off when it comes to using certain devices. I don't like it, but it's nearly impossible to use modern technology without accepting it. And as a gadget reviewer, I give my data to a lot of different apps in the course of my work. But I am highly suspicious of any app that's contacting that many domains. Dreame's spokesperson told me some of the app's features are “the result of collaboration with external partners,” who provide it with “a ready-made system that includes a variety of embedded third-party tools,” like statistical code and video players. These tools, they said, “make calls to their own respective servers, which accounts for the high volume of network connections that you have observed.”

That's all well and good, and the app seemed to settle down after the first few days of testing to just contacting 53 domains in the previous 7 days as of this writing. And yet, even if that's mostly just to support the app's features, it's still a lot of opaque outgoing communication from a single smart home appliance's app.

In the movie The Fifth Element, Gary Oldman's character (“Jean-Baptiste. Emmanuel. Zorg.”) pushes a drinking glass off his desk to illustrate his villainous view that by destroying things, he gives life the opportunity to flourish. As the glass shatters, several robots parade out from a hidden wall compartment to clean up the mess. His idea is that these robots were created by hundreds of people who are able to keep feeding their families and prosper through this sort of continuous destruction.

It's a scene I kept thinking about while testing this product, and it's not Zorg's bullshit ethical posturing that's been on my mind. It's something else he says: “Look at all these little things. So busy, now! Notice how each one is useful.” As he's saying this, two robots with flashing lights cordon off the area, one sweeps up the mess, another sprays liquid onto the ground, and a final one spins about, mopping.

I don't just bring this up in hopes that someone will validate my taste in movies. It also helps me make a point: for whatever reason, the filmmakers assumed that the best approach to floor-cleaning robots is to make them narrow-purpose devices. I don't think you have to go as far as to have an individual robot for spraying floor cleaner, but as I wrote this review, I kept thinking about how my favorite gadgets are often the ones focused on being really good at a small number of things. Maybe it's because if something is made to accomplish one or two tasks, it's unforgivable if it sucks at those. If it's made to do a whole bunch of things, it can get away with doing some of them poorly. It feels like Dreame is almost counting on that possibility.

If there's a bright side, it's that most of the Aqua10 Ultra Roller's problems seem like the sort that can, and hopefully will, be fixed with software updates the way a few good patches can turn an unfinished, bad video game good. But it's one thing to spend between $60 and $70 (or, sigh, $80) on a glitchy, unfinished game. It's another entirely to drop several hundreds or more on a robot vacuum that can't appreciably out-vacuum my dusty old Roomba J7, is missing advertised features like Matter support, and has so much trouble finishing a clean. At the end of the day, the only thing the Aqua10 does reasonably well right now is mopping. And, uh, who wants to pay $1,600 for that? Until and unless its issues are fixed, it doesn't seem worth it. Just buy a mop.

‘I don't have warm shells to plug into'

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during an interview alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman that the problem in the AI industry is not an excess supply of compute, but rather a lack of power to accommodate all those GPUs. In fact, Nadella said that the company currently has a problem of not having enough power to plug in some of the AI GPUs the firm has in inventory. He said this on YouTube in response to Brad Gerstner, the host of Bg2 Pod, when asked whether Nadella and Altman agreed with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who said there is no chance of a compute glut in the next two to three years.

“I think the cycles of demand and supply in this particular case, you can't really predict, right? The point is: what's the secular trend? The secular trend is what Sam (OpenAI CEO) said, which is, at the end of the day, because quite frankly, the biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it's power — it's sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power,” Satya said in the podcast. “So, if you can't do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can't plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It's not a supply issue of chips; it's actually the fact that I don't have warm shells to plug into.” [Emphasis added]

Nadella's mention of 'shells' refers to a data center shell, which is effectively an empty building with all of the necessary ingredients, such as power and water, needed to immediately begin production.

AI's power consumption has been a topic many experts have discussed since last year. This came to the forefront as soon as Nvidia fixed the GPU shortage, and many tech companies are now investing in research in small modular nuclear reactors to help scale their power sources as they build increasingly large data centers.

This has already caused consumer energy bills to skyrocket, showing how the AI infrastructure being built out is negatively affecting the average American. OpenAI has even called on the federal government to build 100 gigawatts of power generation annually, saying that it's a strategic asset in the U.S.'s push for supremacy in its AI race with China. This comes after some experts said Beijing is miles ahead in electricity supply due to its massive investments in hydropower and nuclear power.

Aside from the lack of power, they also discussed the possibility of more advanced consumer hardware hitting the market. “Someday, we will make a[n] incredible consumer device that can run a GPT-5 or GPT-6-capable model completely locally at a low power draw — and this is like so hard to wrap my head around,” Altman said. Gerstner then commented, “That will be incredible, and that's the type of thing that scares some of the people who are building, obviously, these large, centralized compute stacks.”

This highlights another risk that companies must bear as they bet billions of dollars on massive AI data centers. While you would still need the infrastructure to train new models, the data center demand that many estimate will come from the widespread use of AI might not materialize if semiconductor advancements enable us to run them locally.

This could hasten the popping of the AI bubble, which some experts like Pat Gelsinger say is still several years away. But if and when that happens, we will be in for a shock as even non-tech companies would be hit by this collapse, exposing nearly $20 trillion in market cap.

Researchers find that hyper-doped epitaxial Ge films become superconductors at cryogenic temperatures.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Researchers at NYU and the University of Queensland have demonstrated superconductivity in gallium-doped epitaxial germanium, fabricated using industry-standard semiconductor tools. The new material switches to a superconducting state below 3.5 Kelvin and supports dense, wafer-scale Josephson junction arrays, an important building block for quantum and cryogenic RF circuits.

The team's prototype demonstrates millions of superconducting junctions integrated on a single 2-inch wafer. Junctions were lithographically defined and electrically characterized at low temperatures, confirming both superconducting behavior and practical current densities for device integration.

The process relies on molecular beam epitaxy to grow ultra-clean germanium films with gallium dopants inserted directly into substitutional lattice sites. At sufficiently high doping concentrations, the films undergo a bulk superconducting transition. Crucially, the interface remains epitaxial and free of disordered interlayers, which are known to degrade junction performance in hybrid stacks.

The work marks a significant shift from small-batch, layered superconductors toward scalable wafer-level integration on semiconductor-grade substrates. Because the doped Ge films are grown using the same epitaxial techniques used in compound semiconductor and cryo-CMOS production, the platform should be theoretically compatible with existing foundry workflows.

Superconducting qubit arrays and cryogenic microwave front-ends today depend on complex packaging steps to integrate semiconducting control logic with superconducting interconnects. Embedding both domains into a monolithic stack removes key bottlenecks in parasitic capacitance, thermal anchoring, and interconnect reliability, which currently limit performance in high-density quantum systems.

The researchers also emphasize the uniformity of their junction fabrication, showing highly consistent critical current densities across large areas. While the transition temperature remains firmly cryogenic, the manufacturability shift opens the door to wider deployment in quantum computing, low-noise detection, and space-based cryo-RF applications.

For now, the focus turns to larger wafers, reproducibility across fabrication nodes, and coupling between superconducting Ge films and conventional on-wafer logic. If follow-up work confirms these properties, superconducting Ge may offer a pragmatic route to scalable quantum interconnects.

Sim immersion turned up to 11 with crazy DIY World of Tanks controller version 5.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Some folks will go to great lengths, sparing no expense, to raise their gaming sim experience to thrilling new heights. Perhaps the crown prince of such extreme sim build-outs is Chinese enthusiast Blyat, best known among Tom's Hardware readers for his immersive World of Tanks gaming contraptions and, most recently, a (frankly dangerous) fighter jet rig. Today, Blyat released a video showcasing his wild Tank Simulator 5, which comes with a full-size replica machine gun and cannons, on the Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili.



You can watch the full video on Bilibili, but, as we can't embed this Chinese social media format, we have also made a couple of GIF clips for your convenience.



Bylat's new video is a showcase of sim hardware-enhanced fun inside the free-to-play hit, World of Tanks. The Wargaming-published vehicular combat MMO features an incredible array of tanks, adept at various battlefield tasks. The PC version is closely tied to the mouse and keyboard control that the platform is renowned for. However, this video is all about fun, and doesn't go into the technical aspects of getting these crazy sim setups working.

The frantic video begins with Bylat driving what might be dubbed a ‘Tactical vehicle' out of a garage, cannon blazing. It switches to the corresponding on-screen WoT action, where the anti-armor cannon can be seen peppering an enemy tank until it violently explodes.

Next, the scene switches back to inside the garage, and Bylat demos both the armor-piercing canon of his vehicle firing, backed up with our hero standing on the hood with a heavy machine gun. We guess Bylat is annihilating some other tank-foes, seen on the headset he is wearing.

 




There's lots of overt humor in the WoT sim video, too. For example, at one stage we see Bylat's pants fall down due to the incessant recoil of the machine gun. Perhaps funnier is the slapstick moment when, stood in the back of the truck with the machine gun blazing, the large armor piercing cannon swings around to smack our hero in the head – leaving him poleaxed in the back of the truck.

If you enjoy this kind of immersive sillyness, Bylat's Bilibili channel also recently showcased his Airplane simulator, a Mech simulator with VTOL, and an erm… donkey riding simulator.

The Outer Worlds sequel does not play particularly well with ray tracing turned off, either.

It's a new day, and another badly-optimized AAA Unreal Engine 5 game has hit store shelves. A couple of YouTubers, including Daniel Owen, have discovered serious performance problems in The Outer Worlds 2 that almost mirror Borderlands 4's atrocious launch day performance. One of the most problematic graphics settings is the game's ray tracing mode, which prevents even AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming champ from achieving 60 FPS at resolutions well under 1080p.

The aforementioned YouTuber ran the game across three hardware configurations: one with a Ryzen 5 5600X and a GTX 1070, another with the same chip and an RTX 3080 12GB, and the third with a Ryzen 7 9800X3D paired with an RTX 5090. The two former configurations represent the game's minimum and recommended system requirements on the game's Steam page.

The game struggled to hit 60 FPS on both 5600X-powered configurations. With the GTX 1070, the game was unable to run at even 30 FPS consistently in one of the game's city areas at low settings with FSR set to performance mode at 1080p (540p internal resolution).

Switching to the RTX 3080 12GB technically fared much better, with that GPU achieving almost 60 FPS with the same settings. But regardless, it couldn't maintain a solid 60 FPS at the game's lowest quality settings.

The only configuration of the three that could provide solid performance in the game (at any graphics setting) was the Ryzen 7 9800X3D rig powered by Nvidia's flagship RTX 5090. With these top-of-the-line components, the game ran above 60 FPS at 4k resolution with DLSS set to performance mode (1080p internal resolution) at the game's maximum settings (except for hardware ray tracing).

That said, native 4K resolution and hardware ray tracing proved extremely challenging for the 9800X3D and 5090 to handle. Running the game at native 4k resolution with DLAA at maximum settings (with ray tracing still disabled) was only good enough for 45-50 FPS.

Enabling ray tracing significantly degraded performance. At 1080p with DLSS performance mode (540p internal resolution), the RTX 5090 and 9800X3D could not achieve a solid 60 FPS.

The Outer Worlds 2's performance on modern-day hardware is comically bad, even by Unreal Engine 5 standards. The game struggles to play on the lowest settings on the game's own recommended hardware configuration, and ray tracing is basically unplayable (unless you like 540p gaming on an RTX 5090). The developers seem to have taken a step from Borderlands 4's playbook, a game that also struggles to maintain 60FPS at its lowest graphical settings on modern mainstream PC hardware.

Another reason to game on Linux?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD confused the gaming community greatly after it announced it would put RDNA 1 and RDNA 2 driver support in ""maintenance mode"", but later corrected that the two architectures would still be receiving game optimizations regardless. Apparently, this confusion also led some people to believe game optimizations would also stop on AMD's Linux drivers as well. Luckily, Phoronix has published an article reaffirming that Linux support has not changed with this announcement, primarily because Linux AMD drivers are developed separately from their Windows counterparts.

Linux driver support is maintained very differently on AMD GPU drivers compared to AMD's GPU drivers for Windows. Linux driver support for AMD GPUs typically dwarfs what AMD supports officially in Windows. Kernel driver support reportedly dates back all the way to AMD's GCN 1.2 architecture, which includes GPUs such as the R9 390X and R9 Fury X.

Helping matters is that AMD GPU driver support in Linux is heavily reliant on open-source drivers. Up until September this year, the AMDVLK driver was the official open-source Linux driver from AMD and was maintained by AMD directly. Community contributions are also implemented to help improve the driver's functionality.

There is also the exclusively community-driven RADV driver that was started before AMD got into the Linux game with its own AMDVLK driver. Being exclusively community-driven, RADV is maintained completely independently of AMD and is currently the de facto GPU driver for all Radeon GPUs for Linux. RADV is a very robust and well-built driver solution that is supported by many of the industry's tech giants, including Valve, Google, and Red Hat.

This is why, starting on September 15th, 2025, AMD has opted to discontinue the AMDVLK driver altogether. Support for RADV has grown so much in strength that there is no need to have both AMDVLK and RADV co-existing. Performance on RADV also outshines AMDVLK in many situations. Instead, AMD is backing RADV fully and shifting all of its GPU driver development and maintenance to the RADV driver.

All of this is to say that Linux gamers can rest assured that any nasty driver support changes AMD makes on the Windows side won't immediately be copied on the Linux side. Even if AMD wanted to start cutting support on the Linux side, it can't anymore because it has discontinued its own official AMDVLK driver. Pulling the same stunt on RADV would be impossible because too many other companies and individuals are maintaining the driver.

Tyler Adams may not be known for his goalscoring, but the U.S. men's national team midfielder netted a big goal for AFC Bournemouth on Sunday, scoring an equalizer at Manchester City. 

It marked the 26-year-old's first goal in the English Premier League after 64 games between Bournemouth and Leeds United, and also his first club goal in any professional competition since scoring for RB Leipzig against Mainz in a 3–2 win in the 2020–21 season. 

In 283 professional appearances, Adams now has seven goals. The Premier League also becomes the fifth competition he has scored in, after finding the back of the net in the USL Championship, Major League Soccer, Concacaf Champions Cup and UEFA Champions League. 

With the USMNT, Adams has two goals in 52 caps, having scored in two matches against Mexico, including a 1–0 friendly win in 2018 and a 2–0 win in the 2024 Concacaf Nations League final.

Manchester City opened the scoring in Sunday's match through a 17th-minute goal from Erling Haaland, before Adams barreled in the corner kick in the 25th minute to bring his team back level. The tied match didn't last long, though, as Haaland rebounded with a 33rd-minute strike to put his side up 2–1 at halftime.

While Adams won't become a key attacking contributor for USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino, he is likely to play a vital role at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and the level of his performances could play a significant role in determining how far the U.S. can advance as co-hosts alongside Canada and Mexico. 

Before then, though, Adams is likely to join the USMNT for international friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay in November, as well as the pre-World Cup friendlies in the March and June international windows.

The USMNT kick off the 2026 World Cup at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on June 12.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Trent Alexander-Arnold: Liverpool return with Real Madrid 'won't change feelings' about Reds","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyg1rplzy0o","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:54:46 GMT","

Trent Alexander-Arnold scored 23 goals and contributed 92 assists in his 354 appearances for Liverpool

Trent Alexander-Arnold says his feelings for former club Liverpool will not change, no matter what reception he receives on his Anfield return with Real Madrid. 

The Spanish giants face the Reds in the league phase of the Champions League on Tuesday, 4 November. 

Alexander-Arnold was criticised by some Liverpool fans for the way he allowed his contract to expire, before eventually leaving in June for a reported cut-price £8.4m so he could join Real Madrid at the Fifa Club World Cup.

""No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool,"" the 27-year-old full-back told Amazon Prime, when asked if getting a good reception back at Anfield would give him closure.

""I have got memories there that will last me a lifetime and no matter how I am received, that won't change.""

He made 354 appearances for his boyhood club, turning out for the final time in May against Crystal Palace, after which they were presented with the Premier League trophy.

Alexander-Arnold was one of three senior Liverpool players - alongside captain Virgil van Dijk and talisman Mohamed Salah - to enter the final year of their contracts last season.

Van Dijk and Salah ended up signing new two-year deals in April, after which the spotlight turned solely on the England defender. 

Posters were put up outside the ground by disgruntled supporters, questioning his loyalty to the club where he had won two league titles, as well as the Champions League, Fifa Club World Cup, FA Cup and Carabao Cup.

""I think whichever way I am received is the decision of the fans,"" added Alexander-Arnold. ""I will always love the club. I will always be a fan of the club. I will always be thankful for the opportunities [Liverpool gave me] and everything that we achieved together will live with me forever.""

He also said he would not celebrate if he scored against Liverpool and revealed many of his former team-mates got in touch when the Champions League draw was confirmed.

""I spoke to Robbo [Andy Robertson], Mo [Salah], Ibu [Ibrahima Konate],"" added Alexander-Arnold. ""They were just laughing. I think everybody knew it was going to happen. We will put our emotions to one side and play the best football we can.""

Alexander-Arnold has only recently returned to the Real Madrid squad after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in a Champions League tie against Marseille on 16 September.

But he has yet to make an appearance in the side and likely to start on the bench against Liverpool as 15-time European champions Real - managed by another former Reds player in Xabi Alonso - bid for a fourth successive win in this season's competition.

Alexander-Arnold has endured a difficult time since his Madrid move, struggling to establish himself in the first team, being left out of the England squad and sidelined by injury.

But he praised Real's England midfielder Jude Bellingham for helping him to adapt. 

""He is a great lad and a great friend,"" said Alexander-Arnold. ""It's good to have someone else that is English here. We both understand each other very well and know each other very well. He made settling in a lot easier for me.""

Trent Alexander-Arnold insists he won't celebrate if he scores for Real Madrid on his return to Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The England international is set to face Liverpool for the first time since leaving his boyhood club for the Bernabeu in the summer.

“If I was to score, then no I wouldn't celebrate to be honest,” he told Prime Video Sport. “It will be a big difference for me going into the away dressing room, warming up on the other side.

“When I made the decision to move on, it was probably destined that at some point being here I'd play against Liverpool.”

Alexander-Arnold, 27, who has been an unused substitute in Madrid's past two matches after recovering from a hamstring injury, says whatever reception he gets from the home supporters won't change his affection for Liverpool.

He was booed by a significant section of fans after announcing his plan to leave in May, but was ultimately given a warm send-off amid the Premier League title celebrations.

“Whatever way I'm received, is the decision of the fans,” he said.

“I'll always love the club, I'll always be a fan of the club. I'll always be thankful for the opportunities and the things that we achieved together… they'll live with me forever.

“No matter what, my feeling won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime.”

Alexander-Arnold revealed that he spoke to former team-mates Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah and Ibrahima Konate after the draw for the league phase paired the two European heavyweights together.

“We were just laughing,” he added. “I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen. We need to put emotions aside and play the best game we can.

“They are a top team so I knew at some point I'd end up facing them. It's happened so soon. Mixed emotions. It will be a very difficult game, but one I am excited for. Huge game, huge stage.

“Although they haven't had the results of late, they're still a top footballing team, and nobody here thinks it's going to be an easy game.”

Alexander-Arnold also spoke about the influence of fellow England international, club team-mate and close friend Jude Bellingham in convincing him to make the move last summer.

He said: “There was a lot of speculation… the ‘agent Jude' stuff. It was more so in his first season (at Real Madrid).

“We would meet up at England camps and everyone would want to know what it was like behind the scenes. He said it was incredible, and he had never felt anything like it.

“The drive from the whole club, to win and the expectation to win.

“He talked so highly of the club, and I'd made my mind up at the end of the day, I decided I needed a change for me, on and off the pitch. I wanted a new challenge so it was time to go and do that. It's good to have someone else who is English here. It made settling a lot easier for me.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Spurs & Chelsea go head-to-head again! London rivals poised to battle for Porto striker Samu Aghehowa with former boss Andre Villas-Boas willing to sanction €80m exit","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/spurs-chelsea-head-to-head-london-rivals-battle-for-porto-striker-samu-aghehowa-andre-villas-boas-sanction-exit/bltb15bd8b57a543c72","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:03:11 GMT","

Premier League rivals Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are all set to go head-to-head in the transfer market to secure a move for FC Porto's star striker Samu Aghehowa. The young Spaniard has enjoyed tremendous success since moving to the Liga Portugal in the summer of 2024. The 21-year-old is a key figure in the Porto squad, but the club are reportedly ready to sanction a move for him.

The Blues were linked with a move for the young Spanish striker in the summer of 2024 and had even agreed to pay £35 million ($44m) to secure his transfer but the move collapsed at the last moment after Aghehowa failed his medical test, following sustaining an ankle injury. The youngster returned to Atletico Madrid before being shipped off to FC Porto.

Aghehowa enjoyed a stellar debut campaign in Portugal as he scored 27 goals across all competitions and provided three assists. In the 2025-26 season, the 21-year-old has scored nine goals in 11 appearances. As Aghehowa continues with stunning form, he has attracted interest from Chelsea, alongside Tottenham Hotspur, according to Correio da Manha. 

The report further adds that former Blues manager and current Porto president Andre Villas-Boas is ready to sanction a move for Aghehowa. The striker's current deal at the Liga Portugal side runs until 2029 and has a €100million (£88m/$115.9m) release clause; however, Villas-Boas could let him leave for €80m as he considers it to be an ""irresistible deal"".

Correio da Manha also claims that Porto are ready to sell the striker in the upcoming January transfer window due to financial pressure, and the club believes that they are well covered in the striker position and feels that the management will be able to find a suitable replacement for Aghehowa within the roster. 

While the two London clubs are being strongly linked with a move for the Spain international, there is no guarantee that either of the clubs would consider making a bid for the Porto star in the next transfer window, as both teams spent heavily during the summer. 

The other clubs from the English top-flight had shown interest in Aghehowa in the last summer transfer window as Newcastle United and Aston Villa reportedly considered signing him, but both offers were turned down. 

Portuguese outlet Record reported in August that the Magpies had enquired about the striker as they were desperately looking for Alexander Isak's replacement at that time. But despite their strong interest, the Spaniard turned the offer down as he was fully committed to Porto's campaign and was looking forward to winning more trophies. In the case of the Villans, the club made an enquiry with Porto but did not make an advance due to his massive release clause, which the Premier League were not in a position to match. 

After a shock defeat at the hands of Sunderland last weekend, Chelsea returned to winning ways on Saturday as they edged out Spurs 1-0 courtesy of Joao Pedro's first-half strike. The Blues climbed back into the Premier League's top four with a deserved win away at Spurs on Saturday. Enzo Maresca's side were head and shoulders above their London rivals as the disparity between the two teams was clear for all to see throughout the 90 minutes, with Thomas Frank's side registering just three shots in total and one on target.

The Blues next face Qarabag in the Champions League away from home on Wednesday, before hosting Wolves for a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on November 8.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Nashville managed to withstand the power of Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, earning a 2-1 victory on Saturday night to force a decisive third game in their MLS playoff first-round series. They took advantage of their home crowd and a strong start to contain Las Garzas, who came close to equalizing late in the match through their Argentine captain.

Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano voiced his frustration after his team's 2-1 loss to Nashville SC, criticizing the officiating and the decision not to consult VAR on a penalty conceded by goalkeeper Rocco Ríos Novo.

“I'd rather not comment on the refereeing,” Mascherano said. “I know how the system works, and I don't want to give anyone an excuse to come after me. But I'm surprised they didn't go to VAR - the tool is there, and I don't understand why they didn't use it.”

Looking ahead to next week's decisive third match for a spot, Mascherano called on his players to channel their frustration.

“We have to swallow the anger and carry it with us all week so we can release it next Saturday,” he said.

The Argentine manager also said his side lacked sharpness in attack, particularly when trying to connect with star forward Lionel Messi, who once again found the net against Nashville but couldn't prevent the loss.

“We couldn't find Leo in good positions in the first half - we weren't precise in the final-third, and credit to the opponent for that,” he said. “In the second half, even though they sat back, we managed to create a few more chances.”

Despite the setback, Mascherano emphasized that the team must regroup quickly and focus on what he called the most important match of the season.

“In tough moments like this, that's when I want to be closest to my players,” he said. “It's about standing together after a painful defeat.”

The decisive third leg will be played on Nov. 8, at Chase Stadium, where the Herons will look to reach the MLS Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in club history.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Nashville started strong and held on to an early lead to beat Inter Miami in game two of their first round MLS playoff series, 2-1, on Saturday night. Lionel Messi scored the only goal for Miami, who threatened late but were unable to find a stoppage time equalizer, and could now face a second straight opening round elimination after taking a 1-0 lead.

Miami got off to a signature slow start, with some sloppy defensive play costing them the lead. Rocco Rios Novo reacted late to Hany Mukhtar's lofted ball, Sam Surridge galloped onto it and was clipped while trying to round the stranded goalkeeper. The referee had no choice but to point to the spot, and Surridge converted. 

The Herons created in patches, though. Luis Suarez hit the post. Messi poked wide. Allende should have scored after 30 minutes, but Tadeo Allende missed from close range with the goal gaping. Still, another Miami lapse was costly. They fell asleep on a corner, and center back Josh Bauer simply reacted first to a loose ball. He comfortably hooked home with the goal gaping. 

The second half was all Miami, but not enough. Messi provided a moment. Nashville made the error of allowing him to cut left, and smash into the top corner. It seemed like the inevitable equalizer was coming. But Nashville defended well, cut off angles, and after clearing a last-minute free kick, were good value for the home win. And now, it would seem, anything can happen in the last game of the series.

GOAL rates Inter Miami's players from Geodis Park.

Rocco Rios Novo (4/10):

Made a fairly woeful mistake, misjudging a long ball, and gave away a penalty as a result. Nowhere on the second goal.

Ian Fray (6/10):

Got into the scrappy stuff early, and certainly could have been sent off. Will need to keep his cool a bit more in the series final. 

Maxi Falcon (6/10):

Didn't step quickly enough on the Mukhtar through ball before the penalty, allowing Surridge to win the penalty.

Noah Allen (7/10):

Sacrificed for a more attacking setup at the break - which was unfair given that he turned in a solid first half.

Jordi Alba (6/10):

Scampered up and down the left. Played some nice passes, connected with Messi, but could never find the killer ball.

Baltasar Rodriguez (5/10):

Hardly involved in 50 minutes of action, and was dutifully hooked.

Rodrigo De Paul (8/10):

A really composed midfield performance without much support. Smooth on the ball, found all of the right passes. 

Sergio Busquets (5/10):

Dropped into a load of deep positions and left De Paul isolated at times. Undone when the game opened up. Leggy by the end. 

Tadeo Allende (5/10):

Missed a golden opportunity in the first half, and never fully recovered. 

Lionel Messi (8/10):

Basically marked out of the game for 89 minutes, then scored an absolute worldie to give Miami life. 

Luis Suarez (6/10):

Hit the post, and was otherwise pretty quiet. 

Telasco Segovia (7/10):

Added a bit more creativity in the midfield when introduced at half-time.

Mateo Silvetti (6/10):

Hardly involved in an underwhelming second-half showing

Thomas Frank attempted to assuage concerns over Tottenham defenders Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence by saying their decision to snub him after the dire derby defeat against Chelsea was only a “small issue”. Both players headed straight down the tunnel following their side's poor performance on Saturday evening, bypassing their manager in the process.

After an insipid display which produced just one shot on target, the home supporters made their feelings clear as boos rang around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following the conclusion of the match. As is custom, Spurs boss Frank went onto the pitch as he and the rest of players planned to show their appreciation for their fans' support during the game, despite the disappointing loss.

However, in a video which has been widely shared across social media, Tottenham duo Van de Ven and Spence opted to leave the pitch instead of greeting supporters, to the anger of head coach Frank. The Dane was rooted to the spot as he glared towards his departing charges, who quickly made their way to the tunnel.

But when asked about the incident after the game, Frank refused to criticise Van de Ven and Spence, saying: “All the players are, of course, frustrated. They would like to do well, they would like to win, they would like to perform. I understand that. 

“I think it's difficult to be consistent in good times and bad times, that's why I went around to the fans as I did, it's more fun when we win, I can tell you that.”

And when pressed on whether it was “acceptable” for both players to give him the cold shoulder, Frank added: “I understand why you ask the question. But I think that's one of, how you can say, small issues. 

“We have Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence doing everything they can. They've performed very well so far this season. Everyone is frustrated. We do things in a different way, I don't think it's a big problem.”

While Frank has steered Tottenham to fourth in the Premier League following his appointment in the summer, their home form has been disappointing so far. Spurs have won just one home game in the league under Frank, against Burnley on the opening weekend of the season, having suffered defeats against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and now Chelsea. The north Londoners also drew against winless Wolves on home soil on 27 September.

Tottenham's performances have also been met with criticism, recording their lowest-ever expected goals figure (0.05xG) in the league against Chelsea. One man who was signed with a view to helping Spurs excel in the final third this season was Xavi Simons, but the Netherlands international has struggled since his summer switch from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig.

The 22-year-old, who has registered one assist in seven league appearances in 2025-26, was double-substituted against Chelsea, having been brought on in the first half before being withdrawn after 73 minutes.

However, when asked by GOAL if he was worried over Simons' confidence and whether double-substituting him would make matters worse, Frank said: ""No, it's part of the reason we didn't start him because he's played two starts in a short turnaround. It's that energy and freshness I talked about. He played 90 minutes on Wednesday night [against Newcastle], so that's why we decided that [to bench him]. He played 70 minutes here. So I think it was nothing, it's just it looks different that he comes on after a few minutes then gets subbed off.""

When pressed on whether Simons' inability to muster up enough chances has frustrated him, Frank added: “I think when players make mistakes on the pitch, if they lose a ball or miss a pass, of course I can get irritated in general in a specific situation. But that's part of football. How many times have you seen a player miss a pass or do something that happens, that can be flow or confidence or everything. Whatever it is, mistakes are part of football.”

Tottenham will look to produce a morale-boosting performance when they entertain Copenhagen in the Champions League on Tuesday. Frank's men are currently unbeaten in Europe's premier club competition, having beaten Villarreal in their opener before earning draws against Bodo/Glimt and Monaco. Spurs will then lock horns with in-form Manchester United in the league on Saturday, 8 November.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'No matter what'","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/trent-alexander-arnold-true-feelings-liverpool-return-real-madrid/blt8a53cb84064f0fda","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 16:26:43 GMT","

Trent Alexander-Arnold has opened up on what it means to him to return to boyhood team Liverpool ahead of Real Madrid's trip to Anfield this week. The full-back swapped the Reds for the Spanish giants this summer after spending the entirety of his career at the Merseyside outfit. Now, the England international is preparing for an emotional return to his former employers - something he had been preparing for.

When the Champions League draw was made in late August, one of the headlines was the Liverpool versus Madrid fixture - just months after Alexander-Arnold swapped the Reds for Los Blancos. When news broke of the 27-year-old's impending move to the Spanish giants, many Liverpool fans were up in arms against the defender, with some booing him in his final outings for the Premier League side. That animosity may have subsided a bit after his send-off, where he helped them win the league title last season, but it will be interesting to see what reception he gets at Anfield for Tuesday's enticing Champions League clash. Whatever happens, Alexander-Arnold himself says he will ""always love"" Liverpool but admits this fixture may have come too soon for him.

Alexander-Arnold says Madrid were ""destined"" to lock horns with Liverpool in the league phase of this season's Champions League, particularly as they have faced off against each other so often in this competition in recent years. 

He told Amazon Prime Sport: ""When the draw was announced, I think everyone kind of knew it was going to happen, it was destined for that fixture to come. Obviously, they're a top team, so I knew at some point I'd end up going back there or playing against Liverpool. It's happening so soon. Mixed emotions. I think it'll be a very, very difficult game but one that I'm excited for.""

The Liverpool academy product added that he will not celebrate if he scores against his old team. He will certainly hope to be involved after recovering from a hamstring injury.

He said: ""Whatever way I'm received is the decision of the fans. I'll always love the club, I'll always be a fan of the club. I'll always be thankful for the opportunities and the things we achieved together - they'll live with me forever. No matter what, my feelings won't change towards Liverpool. I've got memories there that will last me a lifetime and, no matter how I'm received, that won't change.""

Alexander-Arnold spent the best part of 20 years at Liverpool but the 34-cap England international was ready for a change of scene this year. He got his move to Madrid in the summer, seemingly with the encouragement of England team-mate Jude Bellingham. And by his own admission, it appears that the former Borussia Dortmund star played a big role in Alexander-Arnold following him to the Santiago Bernabeu. 

He added: ""There was a lot of speculation, the 'agent Jude' stuff. It was more so in his first season [at Real], we'd meet up at England camps and everyone would want to know what it was like behind the scenes. He said it was incredible, and he'd never seen anything like it. The drive from the whole club, to win and the expectation to win. He talked so highly of the club, and I'd made my mind up at the end of the day, I needed a change for me. I wanted a new challenge on and off the pitch.""

Alexander-Arnold has long been criticised for his defensive actions not being up to scratch in many people's eyes. But it seems some may have overlooked how important he was to Liverpool in an attacking sense. Not only have they not been as effective down the right this season, but Mohamed Salah, who so often relied on Alexander-Arnold's contributions, has looked well off it this term. Summer signing Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley have failed to fire so far, and this week, the England man could show Arne Slot's team what they are missing.

Midfielder Declan Rice has revealed he pointed to the sky as he celebrated his goal in Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Burnley in honour of his late auntie. The England international paid a beautiful tribute after scoring in a Premier League win over Scott Parker's Clarets which saw Mikel Arteta's in-form side move seven points clear at the top of the Premier League table.

Arsenal kept up their pursuit of a first league title since the 2003-04 season with a victory over Burnley on Saturday afternoon. The Gunners took the lead through striker Viktor Gyokeres' fourth league goal of the campaign, before Rice doubled his side's advantage after 35 minutes. The 26-year-old met winger Leandro Trossard's cross with a brilliant header as Arsenal went on to earn a precious three points on the road.

And Rice has since opened up about why he pointed to sky following his goal, revealing his aunt had sadly passed away before Arsenal's 1-0 league win over Fulham on Saturday, 18 October.

""My auntie passed away before the Fulham game,"" Rice said after the Burnley game. ""I loved her to death. [She] travelled everywhere to watch me with my mum. I know she's watching down so that was for her today.”

The win over Burnley was Arsenal's ninth successive victory in all competitions, with Arteta's side having also downed Newcastle, West Ham, Fulham and Crystal Palace in the league. During the same run, the north Londoners have also defeated Olympiacos and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, as well as Port Vale and Brighton in the Carabao Cup.

Highlighting the impressive home form which was the catalyst behind Burnley's promotion from the Championship last season, Rice was pleased Arsenal were able to emerge from a “tough” Turf Moor with yet another win.

""They've maybe lost once in like 18 months,"" said Rice. ""We knew it was going to be tough, so we had to stick to our principles. Our quality shone through and we could have scored four or five in the first half.

""It's important we keep scoring goals. Two goals are perfect for us. If you look at the goal as a whole, we're defending a long throw from our own half. Big Gabby [Magalhaes] wins the ball and I keep running with the ball. I was like a traditional number nine!”

Rice also received praise from his manager after the game, with Arteta saying he ""stepped up"" when his side really needed him.

Arteta said: ”He [Rice] won I don't know how many balls and tackles. It's the evolution of a player.”

And when discussing Arsenal's performance as a whole, the Spaniard added: ""The first half was exceptional, we scored two goals and gave nothing away. That was the platform.

""We had to make a few changes and didn't have that much control in the second half. Defending was exceptional again, we didn't give anything. There is a reason they have lost one game in 18 months here, against Liverpool in the last second of the game.”

Arsenal are next in action when they travel to Czech outfit Slavia Praha in the Champions League on Tuesday. Arteta's men are currently unbeaten in Europe's elite club competition, having won their opening three fixtures against Athletic Club, Olympiacos and Atletico Madrid.

The 13-time league champions then travel to high-flying Sunderland on Saturday, 8 November, before an international break which will likely see Rice called up to the England squad.

The Three Lions face Serbia and Albania on Thursday, 13 November and Sunday, 16 November respectively, in their final two World Cup qualifiers. Thomas Tuchel's men have already booked their place at next summer's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States, having won all six of their previous qualifiers in Group K.

Once Rice returns from England duty, he will then be looking to help his side earn derby-day bragging rights when they entertain fierce rivals Tottenham in the league on Sunday, 23 November.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario has slammed his team-mates and demanded the entire squad raises their levels after a woeful performance against Chelsea. Spurs were second-best throughout their defeat by the Blues and were flattered by the 1-0 scoreline. Speaking after the game, the Italian bemoaned the display which suggested there is little harmony in the squad.

Spurs were dominated by Chelsea at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and deserved to lose by more than just the one goal. The Blues took the lead in the first-half through Joao Pedro and never looked like surrendering their advantage over their London rivals. It marked yet another defeat for Spurs, and another in front of their faithful home support, as they notched up their 42nd loss in the Premier League at their new ground since its opening in 2019 – only six fewer than north London rivals Arsenal have lost at the Emirates, a stadium opened in 2006.

With just four home victories in the Premier League in all of 2025, Thomas Frank has a lot of work to do to turn around Spurs' misfortunes. While the Lilywhites tasted their first piece of silverware in decades in the summer when they lifted the Europa League, the club have remained disappointing domestically. After a club record-low 17th-place finish in the Premier League last season, the club have become used to disappointment and it may more than just a new managerial appointment to heal the rot at its heart.

After a series of consistently poor displays, Vicario is growing frustrated. The Italian has been one of the club's better players in the last two disappointing seasons and issued a passionate assessment of how the side have been performing.


Speaking after the defeat to Chelsea, via Football London, Vicario said: ""It's tough to accept but this is the reality of today's game. We need to look inside us and we need to do more because when you play for this club, we have to do things at 100 per cent. I know it's tough but we have to do that every single day.


""When you go inside it's tough to accept because you expect yourself to perform at your best, with a lot of energy but something today didn't go in the right direction.


""Everyone knows that personally, we have to do a little bit more if we want to achieve good results, make everyone happy and make ourselves happy. Today is a bad day for us, we didn't perform at our best level.""


Frank's task in north London is looking increasingly difficult as the weeks go by. The former Brentford coach had made a decent start to life at Spurs, but a number of flat performances and defeats has turned up the heat under the Dane. The fractious atmosphere at Spurs was made clear after the defeat to the Blues, with a video of Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence snubbing Frank's approach on their way to the dressing room circulating on social media soon after the full-time whistle.

The defenders appeared unhappy with their boss and did not hide their feelings towards Frank when they stormed off the pitch. Shocked by their response, Frank was left rooted to the spot as he watched in disbelief as the duo shunned him. The incident played out under a cacophony of boos raining down from the terraces.

Speaking after the game, Frank was keen to play down the incident. He said: “All the players are, of course, frustrated. They would like to do well, they would like to win, they would like to perform. I understand that.

“I think it's difficult to be consistent in good times and bad times, that's why I went around to the fans as I did, it's more fun when we win, I can tell you that.”

When pressed for his opinion on Van de Ven and Spence, the Dane remained diplomatic and defended his players. “We have Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence doing everything they can,” he said. “They've performed very well so far this season. Everyone is frustrated. We do things in a different way, I don't think it's a big problem.”

Spurs are in action again on Wednesday as they host FC Copenhagen in the Champions League. Frank will know the opposition well from his time as coach at Brondby in his native Denmark.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

David Beckham sent a heartfelt message to Paul Scholes' daughter Alicia following a tribute she posted after her father revealed he stopped doing commentary work in order to fit his schedule around his autistic son Aiden. The former England midfielder opened up to his ex-Manchester United team-mates Gary Neville and Roy Keane in an emotional interview earlier in the week.

Tributes have continued to pour in for Scholes after he revealed he stepped back from working as a pundit and commentator in order to care for Aiden, 20, who he co-parents with his ex-wife, Claire Froggatt.

Speaking candidly alongside former team-mates Neville and Keane - with whom he helped United win the treble in 1999 - Scholes said on The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast: “I made a decision this year because of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about.

“All the work I do now is just around his routines cos he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I'm going to do it is around Aiden.

""Everything I'm going to do now just works around him. I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.

""Last season on Thursday nights I'd do the Europa League for Manchester United. That's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching. He knows the pattern's not there straight away.”

Scholes also revealed he was once dropped by former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson as he attempted to deal with Aiden's diagnosis privately, having initially kept it a secret.

""I never got a break from it, even when playing - it was very hard in those days,"" said the 50-year-old.

""I don't think they diagnosed it until he was two-and-a-half years old. But you knew early something was wrong, but then you get the diagnosis, and I'd never heard of it.

""I remember the first time after it, we were playing Derby away and I just didn't want to be there.

""I remember the manager dropped me the week after, and I hadn't told anyone. I ended up telling them a few weeks later, as it was quite hard.

""Even now, I don't want sympathy or anything. I just thought, even if I did speak to someone about it, it's not going to help Aiden.

""The big concern now is, because you're getting a bit older, what happens when you're not here? That's the thing that's now on my mind all the time.”

Following the interview, Scholes' daughter Alicia paid tribute to her father on Instagram, writing: “@paulscholesaaa god knows how hard that episode must've been !!!!! we love you so much.”

She added: ""I've never known anyone hate talking about themselves more than you! I can only imagine how hard it was to speak about Aidie and the reality of a very very hard situation.

""My whole life your priority has always been being my dad, and growing up and realising how hard you had to work everyday alongside that is something I can't even comprehend. To achieve all you did takes so much sacrifice and hard work and somehow I still had you to take me to school every morning and be there at the end of each day, so present in every aspect of my life!

""If anyone met you they wouldn't have a clue the life you've lived, they'd just see a genuinely kind, polite, caring person. You don't care about people who don't matter, and out of everything that is the most valuable thing i have learnt from you. The thing I am proudest of is being your daughter, you are the best role model and father figure I could ever have, and you do it so effortlessly.

""Anyway well done on this episode dad it was amazing and if Aidie could tell you himself he would say you really are the best dad in the world, we love you millions.""

And commenting on Alicia's post, an emotional Beckham wrote: “Perfect words for your amazing dad @alicia.scholesx.”

Beckham played alongside Scholes during an 11-year spell with United. Emerging through the Red Devils' youth academy at the same time, both men were part of the club's famous ‘Class of 92' - alongside Neville brothers, Gary and Phil, and midfielders Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs.

All six players helped United dominate English football during Ferguson's 26-year stint in charge, with the club winning 13 league titles under his stewardship. The Old Trafford club also won five FA Cups and two Champions League titles with Ferguson at the helm.

Scholes took to Instagram earlier in the week to thank his followers for their messages of support, writing: ""Would just like to thank everyone for all your kind messages since the Overlap interview regarding Aiden, there's been loads and tried to read as many as possible. The response from families (especially Dads) shows much speaking about it helps so many. There was one quote from a parent in a similar position that's just got me: 'My job is to stay alive for one day longer than my son/daughter'. Anyway it's weekend let's have a few drinks and watch the football..Come on Salford.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Jannik Sinner scored a victory of double significance on Sunday at the Rolex Paris Masters, where he clinched his fifth ATP Masters 1000 crown and marked his return to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Displaying trademark composure and precision, the 24-year-old Italian withstood a spirited Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-6(4) in the final to secure his maiden title at the French ATP Masters 1000 event. With his flawless run in Paris, Sinner became the first player to win a title at this level without dropping a set since Carlos Alcaraz in Indian Wells in 2023, while also extending his indoor winning streak to 26 matches.

Sinner Conquers Paris! 👏@janniksin defeats Auger-Aliassime to clinch a fifth career ATP Masters 1000 title and reclaim the World No.1 ranking@RolexPMasters | #RolexParisMasters pic.twitter.com/Slery9Myll

“It's huge, honestly, it was such an intense final, and we both knew what was on the line,” Sinner said after his one-hour, 52-minute win. “I'm extremely happy, the past couple of months have been amazing. We try to work on things and seeing this result makes me incredibly happy. Another title this year… It's been an amazing year regardless of what comes in Turin.”

As well as ensuring his return to World No. 1 on Monday, Sinner tightened the race for ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours. He now trails Alcaraz by just 1,050 points in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, ensuring their battle will be decided at the Nitto ATP Finals, where Sinner is defending champion.

Jannik Sinner will return to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday. 

Auger-Aliassime's impressive run to his second ATP Masters 1000 final has notably boosted his chances of qualifying for the Nitto ATP Finals. The Canadian has climbed up to eighth in the Live Race, holding a 160-point lead over Lorenzo Musetti, and will look to secure his spot when competing at the ATP 250 in Metz next week.

Though Auger-Aliassime fought hard in a closely contested second set, Sinner ultimately surged through an ultra-clean tie-break to capture his fourth tour-level title of the season. Adding to his wins against the Canadian in Cincinnati and the US Open this year, Sinner now leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 3-2.

“It was a very difficult match, he was serving incredibly well, especially from the first break on,” Sinner said of Auger-Aliassime “I didn't have many chances… You have to use the small chances you have, and in the breaker it was just a small mini break, so I'm very happy with how I played there.”

After hitting three consecutive unforced errors to drop serve in a nervy opening game, Auger-Aliassime steadied himself and began matching Sinner from the baseline. Yet that brief lapse in concentration proved decisive as the Italian produced his trademark consistency — striking 43 of 46 forehands in play and posting a Shot Quality of 9.6, according to TDI Insights.

In the second set, Auger-Aliassime showed resilience and fight, fending off all five break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. But, just as in the opener, one loose forehand in the tie-break handed Sinner the advantage, and he made no mistake in closing out his 23rd tour-level title.

Jannik Sinner clawed closer to Carlos Alcaraz in their Big Titles battle on Sunday when he won the Rolex Paris Masters title.

The Italian defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime for the trophy to claim his first ATP Masters 1000 crown of the season. He now owns 10 Big Titles — a combination of Grand Slam championships, trophies at the Nitto ATP Finals and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, and Olympic singles gold medals.

Sinner now trails Alcaraz by just four Big titles. The Spaniard has earned five such trophies in 2025 — three Masters 1000 titles and two major triumphs — to three for the Italian. The 24-year-old has emerged victorious at two majors and one Masters 1000 event.

Big Titles Won: Alcaraz & Sinner




NATPF

The San Candido native has claimed Masters 1000 glory at least once in three consecutive seasons. It is also the second straight year he has earned at least three Big Titles, after winning six in 2024.

The new No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings now owns the fifth-most Masters 1000 titles among active players with five. Only Novak Djokovic (40), Alcaraz (8), Alexander Zverev (7) and Daniil Medvedev (6) own more of the prestigious trophies.

Sinner has won a Big Title for every 6.3 tournaments he has played in his career. Only Djokovic (3.3), Rafael Nadal (3.5), Alcaraz (3.9), Roger Federer (4.4), Pete Sampras (4.9) and Andre Agassi (6.1) have won the events at a higher rate.

There is one more Big Title up for grabs this season, with Sinner and Alcaraz set to headline the field at the Nitto ATP Finals from 9-16 November. Sinner is the defending champion at the year-end championships, which Alcaraz has not yet won.

Anna Blinkova's victory at the Jiangxi Open on Sunday wasn't just a warning sign for her fellow competitors on the Hologic WTA Tour, but to the tennis circuit's translators as well.

Blinkova has been addressing the Chinese crowd in their native language all week -- and after defeating 17-year-old wild card Lilli Tagger 6-3, 6-3 in the final, she adeptly handled her own translation duties in both the trophy ceremony and her post-match press conference. Switching between English and Mandarin with ease, she required only a few pointers from the tournament's translator.

Jiujiang: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The Jiujiang title -- the second of Blinkova's career, following Cluj-Napoca 2022 -- marks the fulfilment of both a tennis goal and a language goal for the 27-year-old. As the Asian swing began in September, she told Bounces that she hoped to get the opportunity to give a interview in Mandarin, a language she has been learning since 2018 and which she felt was now up to the task of her media duties.

Blinkova's results didn't initially pan out, though. She fell in the Beijing first round, then in Wuhan and Guangzhou qualifying. In Jiujiang, however, the World No. 95 came through the draw without losing a set.

""I left home on September 8,"" she said. ""I played so many tournaments and I lost in the first or second round, but I kept working hard every day, practising every day and believing I could still make a good result, even in the last tournament of the season. And I did it!""

Blinkova needed all of her self-belief to hold off Tagger, the teenage sensation who has made a spectacular WTA main-draw debut this week. The Austrian has wowed fans with her tennis in Jiujiang, not least a single-handed backhand reminiscent of the great Justine Henin. That shot was on full display early on, as Tagger unleashed a series of gorgeous down-the-line winners from that wing.

After an opening stretch of four consecutive breaks, Tagger seemed to gain the upper hand after battling through eight deuces, saving four break points, to seal the first hold of the match for a 3-2 lead. But instead, it was Blinkova who elevated her level after that marathon tussle, responding with a run of five straight games to lead 1-0 in the second set. Her own backhand was also proving efficient -- and she was increasingly able to steer traffic away from the Tagger signature shot.

""Her backhand was rock solid, but at some points I felt she started missing with her forehand,"" Blinkova explained. ""So I played a bit more to her forehand in the important moments. I also put a lot of pressure with my return -- I was just a bit more aggressive and solid at the same time.

""I think she's a really great player for her age. She really pushed my limits today, and I had to play my best tennis to beat her.""

No. 3 seeds Quinn Gleason and Elena Pridankina lifted the doubles trophy after edging Ekaterina Ovcharenko and Emily Webley-Smith 6-4, 2-6, [10-6] in the final. It was a second career WTA doubles title for Gleason (following Merida 2024 alongside Ingrid Martins), and a first for Pridankina.

Ovcharenko and Webley-Smith were both contesting a WTA final for the first time -- a particularly remarkable breakthrough for 41-year-old Webley-Smith. The Briton played her first professional match in 1999 and has won 27 ITF doubles titles. She reached her singles career high of No. 240 of No. 240 in 2011, and her doubles career high of No. 113 in 2015. This week, Webley-Smith delivered a career-best tournament that's been 26 years in the making.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Six days ago, Sinner and Zverev met in the Vienna final, with Sinner surviving, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, after two hours and 28 minutes.But their Paris clash couldn't have been any different, as Zverev only managed to win one game, holding in the first game of the second set—and Sinner had a break point in that game, too.At the end of the day the Italian was just too sharp, finishing the match with almost twice as many winners as unforced errors, 23 to 12, which includes more than three times as many winners as unforced errors off of his forehand side, 13 to 4.Zverev, meanwhile, had 6 winners and 20 unforced errors.""Obviously I'm happy to be in the final but it's not how you want to arrive,"" Sinner said in his on-court interview. ""Playing against Sascha is always a very special occasion, playing in a packed stadium, but today he was clearly not 100%. We saw that he was struggling physically. He had a tight schedule the past months.""Yesterday an incredible match he won, two match points down, and it's difficult mentally—also physically, because he made the final in Vienna, then here making semis again. It's an incredible run for him, and we all hope that he gets better for Turin now.""

Maximum coiling of his shoulders is the secret ingredient to his incredible shot.ByJon LeveyPublished Nov 02, 2025 copy_link

Watch almost any top-level tennis player hit a forehand, and you'll notice something subtle but consistent—their off-hand isn't just hanging around. It's active, engaged and perfectly synchronized with the hitting arm. During the takeback, it helps position the racquet and rotate the upper body. This creates structure and stored energy to release into the shot.

For most players, the hands separate during the takeback and the off-arm stays parallel to the net© 2025 Robert Prange

Then there's Carlos Alcaraz. The current men's No. 1 has his own distinctive spin on the technique. Where most players let go of the racquet's throat when the off-arm is just about parallel to the net, Alcaraz hangs on until his left hand is even with his hitting shoulder. This benefits his forehand in a few significant ways:

Creates even greater upper body tension. Mimic Alcaraz's turn and you can feel the stretch in the lats. The added shoulder rotation builds greater stored energy to release into the shot.Faster swing speed without extra motion. Alcaraz's shoulders turn more, but he keeps a nice bend in the hitting elbow and the racquet head even with his chest, just like players with more modest rotation. He uncoils with a loose arm to generate immense racquet head speed without an overly exaggerated swing path.Yes, Alcaraz is something of a unicorn—not everyone can duplicate his range of motion, upper body flexibility or otherworldly timing. But even coming close to his shoulder turn will add extra mph to your forehand.Give it a try the next time you play.

Indycar winner and F1 TV analyst takes a close look at Oliver Bearman's impressive rookie season – and wonders what might be next for the talented Ferrari academy driver.

This season an impressive crop of rookies joined the Formula 1 the grid. At various times in the year a case could've been made for several of them to be the top performer among their freshman counterparts.

Right from the out it was Kimi Antonelli's form in tough conditions in Australia.

Then, you can't forget Isack Hadjar's impressive bounce back from the crushing warm-up lap crash in Melbourne to score in five of the next eight races – with two 11th places mixed in for good measure.

F1 drivers guess the circuit, but they can only see the steering wheel!

Iconic Lewis Hamilton Onboards

From Lando Norris' disco ball to Alex Albon's Miami orange, special edition helmets have been everywhere this season. We take a look back at where it all began.

Special edition helmets are a relatively recent addition to Formula 1's long history – what was once purely a piece of safety equipment has become a canvas for drivers and sponsors to showcase their personality, pay tribute or have some fun.

The journey from mostly plain lids to glittering, custom-designed works of art has been full of experimentation over the years – including design restrictions and concerns about the weight of paint. Here's a look back at how special edition helmets became a beloved part of F1's identity.

In a sport where faces are hidden behind visors, a helmet has always been a driver's signature. For decades, drivers such as James Hunt, John Surtees, and Sir Jackie Stewart kept the same design throughout their entire careers.

Back then, helmets weren't nearly as protective, and their main purpose besides safety was for the fans and marshals to tell the drivers apart. Even so, individuality did shine through at time. Hunt's name stretched boldly along the side of his helmet, while Stewart paid homage to his Scottish roots with a tartan band around the crown.

Few designs, however, are as instantly recognisable as Ayrton Senna's yellow, green and blue helmet – an enduring Brazilian icon that once fetched nearly $1million at auction.

For much of F1's history, a helmet represented the driver but not the team. That began to change when Michael Schumacher moved to Ferrari and decided to replace the German flag on his helmet with a bright red design to match his new team's colours. This marked the start of a new, more flexible era, one where creativity and collaboration between driver and team became the norm.

Helmet designs don't come out of thin air, and every special edition helmet begins with an artist – both a designer and engineer. Two of the best-known names in this profession are Jens Munser and Mad 56.

Munser, the mastermind behind Schumacher's Ferrari-era lids, Lando Norris's squiggles, and Sebastian Vettel's 2024 Imola Senna tribute explained to Motorsport Tech Magazine: “The process hasn't changed much – we still start with sketches – but we now use printed stickers for logos instead of hand-painting every detail. We've improved the pigments to make paint lighter and more resistant to stones. Michael always wanted to save weight, even if it meant a less glossy finish.”

Mad 56, real name Massimo Dante, works primarily with Red Bull and has also collaborated with Williams driver Alex Albon for more than a decade. Though artists have creative freedom, they must balance aesthetics with FIA regulations and sponsor requirements, which is a tricky art in itself.

In 2015, the FIA announced that drivers must stick to a single helmet design during the entire season, as some of the constantly changing special edition helmets were starting to cause issues. The reasoning was simple: fans, commentators, and race officials were struggling to recognise who was behind the wheel!

The move came after a series of increasingly elaborate designs – most famously Sebastian Vettel's 2012 LED-lit helmet in Singapore. The glowing design, while undoubtedly eye-catching, raised safety concerns and was quickly banned, prompting the FIA to rethink just how far helmet customisation should go.

The single-design regulation remained in place until 2020, but even under those tighter rules, creativity didn't disappear. Designers found clever ways to work within the limits – for example, Lewis Hamilton's special edition Mexico City Grand Prix helmets, or Sebastian Vettel subtly changing the colour of his usual helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix in 2017.

When the ban was lifted at the beginning of 2020, a wave of colour and creativity returned to the grid – and it hasn't slowed down since.

Today, F1's grid is awash with one-off designs, each a reflection of personality, heritage, and at times – humour. Amongst his many iconic special edition helmets, Lewis Hamilton collaborated with Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama for a chrome-inspired Japanese Grand Prix special in 2023, Valtteri Bottas once ran a pre-season helmet modelled on his own head, and Albon's designs often pay tribute to his pets and his home nation of Thailand.

The 2025 season has also seen plenty of eye-catching limited-edition designs – from bold artistic statements to heartfelt tributes. One standout came from the youngest designer yet, Thea, the young fan behind Carlos Sainz's unofficial mascot “Sparkles” the unicorn. The Spaniard wore Thea's design as a sticker on his helmet for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix and, while it was meant as a one-off, after his P3 finish in Baku, there's no wonder he'd want his new mascot to stick around!

While some special edition helmet designs are lighthearted, others carry deep personal significance. One of the best examples of this was Romain Grosjean during his return to the Haas garage for Pirelli tyre testing, where he was finally able to wear the helmet that his children had designed for his planned 2020 farewell race – one he never got to use after his terrifying Bahrain crash.

It was a very sentimental helmet and reaffirmed that special edition helmets can be much more than just a marketing tool when they hold such meaning for the drivers.

F1.com takes a look back at some of the most iconic images in the sport's history, ranging from the early days of the championship through to the modern era.

Over the course of its 75 championship years so far, Formula 1 has witnessed countless iconic moments both on and off the track. From thrilling battles to fierce rivalries, emotional outbursts to dramatic crashes, the sport has continued to deliver unforgettable scenes.

Many of these have been captured on camera, with these photos going on to become legendary in their own right.

As F1 enters into the latter stages of its 75th year, we've been taking a look back at some of these particularly special images from the archive, ranging from the early days right through to the modern era…

On May 13, 1950, Silverstone hosted the first race of the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship. Over 70 laps, 24 drivers went racing in front of a crowd estimated to number up to 120,000 spectators, while prestigious guests included His Royal Highness King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret.

Giuseppe ‘Nino' Farina took victory; while the Italian's fellow Alfa Romeo driver Juan Manuel Fangio had led, a broken oil pipe forced the future five-time World Champion to retire. It was the first of three wins for Farina that season, who went on to become the sport's maiden championship victor.

Graham Hill was leading the 1968 championship standings ahead of Round 6 of the campaign at France's Rouen-Les-Essarts Circuit. In a race marred by the tragic death of Jo Schlesser following a crash on Lap 2, Hill retired his Lotus on Lap 14 owing to an issue with his car.

Despite his retirement, the Briton seemed keen to help team mate Jo Siffert, who was still running amid damp conditions. Siffert stopped by the side of the track as Hill gave him his rain visor to help with driving against the spray, a moment that has since become a famed image depicting this particular era in the sport.

The story of James Hunt and Niki Lauda's battle for the title in 1976 is well known, with the ups and downs of that season – which featured Lauda's remarkable comeback from a horrifying crash at the Nurburgring – leading to the tale being retold in the 2013 film Rush.

But despite their on-track rivalry, the two drivers also shared a friendship away from racing. Lauda went on to describe Hunt as an “open, honest to God pal” – something that this photo, captured at the Belgian Grand Prix in 1977, seems to capture.

The 1980s saw the emergence of some big icons of the sport – and, ahead of the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix, four of these star names posed for a famous photograph, with all still in contention for the title prior to the race.

Lotus' Ayrton Senna, McLaren's Alain Prost and the Williams pair of Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet all smiled for the cameras amid a close championship fight amongst them. It was ultimately Prost who took the crown on this occasion – and these four drivers would be responsible for every title victory that followed until 1994.

After that aforementioned 1986 triumph, Prost had to wait until 1989 for his third World Championship – which arrived in dramatic style following a controversial collision with Senna, now his McLaren team mate, at Suzuka.

Contact at the Casio Triangle chicane put Prost out of the race, with the Frenchman subsequently captured by photographers as he walked away from his MP4/5. While Senna had continued on, the Brazilian was later disqualified for cutting the chicane when he rejoined, meaning that the title went to Prost.

Another memorable picture from that era came at Silverstone in 1991. Senna had arrived into the weekend as championship leader, having bolstered his points with a run of four consecutive victories when the season got underway.

It was Mansell's time to shine at the British Grand Prix, however, with the home favourite taking the win. Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap, but was still classified in fourth – and famously hitched a ride on Mansell's triumphant Williams after the chequered flag.

Later on in the 1990s, an iconic rivalry developed between McLaren's Mika Hakkinen and Ferrari's Michael Schumacher, one that was respectful but also featured some incredible battles on the track.

Perhaps one of the most famous moments between the two occurred at the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, where Hakkinen overtook Schumacher for the lead as both lapped backmarker Ricardo Zonta. As this post-race photograph shows, the duo were seen deep in conversation after Hakkinen went on to take the win.

When the 2009 campaign began, Jenson Button and the Brawn GP team caused a shock by embarking on a stunning run of victories, winning six of the seven opening races.

While Button did not triumph again that season as the squad's rivals caught up, that early success was enough to secure him a maiden title at the penultimate race in Brazil, sparking memorable scenes as the wide-eyed new World Champion celebrated his achievement.

After Button's championship success, Sebastian Vettel was the next man to experience title glory for the first time in 2010, a feat he repeated three more times as he wrapped up an impressive four consecutive titles.

The final one of these arrived during a dominant 2013 season for Vettel, the German sealing his fourth crown with three races to spare at the Indian Grand Prix. Following his latest win, the four-time World Champion bowed down on his knees in front of his Red Bull RB9 machine.

While both titles had been decided prior to the 2018 season finale in Abu Dhabi – having been won by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes – the campaign came to a close in unforgettable style thanks to a special moment after the chequered flag.

With the event marking Fernando Alonso's final race at the time – before his later comeback in 2021 – the Spaniard lined up alongside fellow World Champions Hamilton and Vettel to perform some celebratory donuts on the grid.

Amid a shortened season owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes had continued their run of success, the Briton having already notched up nine victories before Round 14 in Turkey.

Another win that weekend brought Hamilton a historic seventh World Championship, equalling Michael Schumacher's tally. It was clearly an emotional moment for the driver, who knelt forwards on the halo of his W11 in parc ferme as he processed what he had done.

One of the sport's most shocking incidents of recent times took place in Bahrain during the latter stages of the 2020 season, when Haas' Romain Grosjean suffered a crash through the barriers on the opening lap of the race that saw his car burst into flames.

The Frenchman managed to extricate himself from the wreckage and, with help from the attending medical team, made his way to the ambulance where he was subsequently transferred to hospital. He was treated for burns to his hands and his ankle, while the race would prove to be Grosjean's last in Formula 1.

In 2021, a fierce battle for the Drivers' Championship played out between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen that went right down to the wire, with several contentious moments along the way.

So tight was the duel that every point counted more than ever – and the intensity shone through when a late-race tyre failure for Verstappen put him out of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, the Dutchman famously kicking the left rear that had suffered the blowout in frustration as he walked away from his stricken car.

Charles Leclerc had seemingly carried something of a home race curse across much of his F1 career when it came to the Monaco Grand Prix, the Ferrari driver having generally suffered bad luck at the event since his debut in 2018.

But all that changed at the 2024 race, in which the Monegasque converted pole position into an emotional win. The result sparked unforgettable scenes after the chequered flag had fallen as Leclerc celebrated the result with his team.

The Las Vegas Grand Prix has delivered the spectacle both on and off track since joining the calendar in 2023 – and it was an especially important race for Max Verstappen in 2024, with it being the scene of the Red Bull driver sealing his fourth consecutive World Championship.

While he had been in dominant form during his previous title win, this one proved more hard-fought for the Dutchman, and the joy at securing the crown was clear to see as he held four fingers aloft for the cameras.

News of Lewis Hamilton's switch to Ferrari for the 2025 season sent shockwaves through the F1 world when it was announced before the 2024 campaign had even begun, with the move bringing an end to the Briton's long and successful partnership with Mercedes.

Needless to say, there was much anticipation ahead of the seven-time World Champion's first days with the Scuderia – and the photos showing him on his maiden visit to Maranello as a Ferrari driver quickly gained iconic status.

Iconic Lewis Hamilton Onboards

With just four rounds left in the 2025 Formula 1 season, Lawrence Barretto assesses who could be strong at each of the remaining weekends as the battle for the championship nears its climax.

A couple of months ago, both the Drivers' and Teams' Championships looked like foregone conclusions. Oscar Piastri had just won the Dutch Grand Prix – and with McLaren team mate Lando Norris suffering a mechanical failure when running second, the Australian's advantage over Norris ballooned to 34 points. Max Verstappen, meanwhile, was a monstrous 104 adrift in P3...

But while McLaren converted that advantage by wrapping up the defence of the Team's Championship three races later in Singapore, a plot twist had been written in courtesy of Red Bull and Verstappen. With their rivals fully focused on development for the new-for-2026 regulations, Red Bull opted to divert a bit more cash to this year's car – and it was paying off.

Verstappen won three races in four weekends and was forcing his way into title contention while Piastri was going the other way. Having been on the podium in 14 of the first 16 races of 2025, Piastri is now on a run of four races outside the top three and has lost his grip on the title lead for the first time since Saudi Arabia.

This marks Carlile's fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John.

	Jessica Lynch



Brandi Carlile returned to Saturday Night Live on Nov. 2 with a commanding performance of “Church & State” and “Human,” both from her newly released solo album Returning to Myself.

	This marks Carlile's fourth time as musical guest on SNL and her second appearance this year, following an April duet with Elton John promoting their joint project Who Believes in Angels?. On Saturday's show, she took center stage solo, delivering two emotionally charged performances.

	Opening with “Church & State,” Carlile sang of a “failing empire” and sociopolitical unrest in a haunting arrangement co-written with producer Andrew Watt and longtime collaborators Phil and Tim Hanseroth. 

	











	She followed with “Human,” a soaring ballad that reflects on vulnerability and resilience — also the name of her upcoming Human Tour, which kicks off in February 2026.


	The two songs are from Carlile's eighth studio album, Returning to Myself, released Oct. 25. It marks her first solo LP since 2021's In These Silent Days, which peaked at No. 11 on the Billboard 200, topped the Rock and Americana/Folk charts, and won multiple Grammy awards, including Best Americana Album and awards for “Broken Horses.” It also received seven Grammy nominations overall.




	Since her last solo project, Carlile has remained a central figure in American roots and rock music — curating music festivals (Girls Just Wanna Weekend, Echoes Through the Canyon), forming the country supergroup The Highwomen, and collaborating with legends like Elton John, Joni Mitchell and Tanya Tucker.


	Her SNL appearance follows a busy October that included performing at Mitchell's Joni Jam at the Hollywood Bowl and announcing her return to Europe in fall 2026 after the North American leg of her tour.


	Carlile also appeared in the episode's promos, stealing the scene with a joke about noticing co-star Ashley Padilla's haircut before Top Gun: Maverick actor Miles Teller, who hosted this week's episode. “The second I saw you, I knew you had that new-haircut glow,” Carlile deadpanned — leading Padilla to declare her the new host.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	The federal government is still shut down, food stamps are being cut off for millions of Americans, the Los Angeles Dodgers are still grinding it out with the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series Game 7 and there are big elections in New York City, Virginia and New Jersey on coming this week. So, of course, tonight's Saturday Night Live opened with a fictional Big Apple Mayoral debate.


	As the Kenan Thompson-portrayed New York newsman Errol Louis (“the least famous person to be impersonated on SNL”) spoke truth to aspiring power:  “Why would you want the worst job in the word?”

	











	Returning host Miles Teller played ex-Empire State governor and alleged sexual harasser Andrew Cuomo (“I know this city like the back of a women's back”), and the SNL-fired and later host Shane Gillis put on the red beret to be low-polling Republican candidate and Guardian Angel CEO Curtis Sliwa. Upping the ante, Ramy Youssef showed up as front-runner Zohran Mamdani.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Pitching himself to New Yorkers, Youssef's much mispronounced Mamdani put in bluntly and smoothly in that TikTok kinda way that has characterized the long-shot race that the Assemblyman is almost certain to win: “Once you vote for me, you know you'll feel a little less bad about that chicken and rice shop getting turned into a Sweetgreen, so why don't you hit me up on the ballot box, girl?”


SNL being SNL, even in what was ultimately one of the most topical but forgettable cold opens in ages, cast member James Austin Johnson showed up as Donald Trump. 


	Swearing that his go-to bagel order is a “Big Mac with a hole in the middle,” the former New York resident cut to the chase and pronounced “this election is about housing and taxes, but we all know it's about me, right?”


	Which, almost everything in America is nowadays — sadly. Then, Johnson's Trump launched into a bit of Phantom of the Opera, with the mask — and then thankfully the seemingly shorter than usual cold open was over with the traditional “Live from New York, it's Saturday night!”

	











	The fourth episode of the Lorne Michaels-created NBC late-nighter's 51st season, SNL tonight sees Teller back as host for a second time. The Top Gun: Maverick and Eternity star is actually the SNL rookie this week compared to musical guest Brandi Carlile. Back for a third time as a solo performer, the 11-time Grammy winner also showed up on SNL in April for a stint with Elton John.


	Next week will see returning Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser make her SNL host debut. The November 15 show will have Chad Powers star Glen Powell playing frontman for the first time. As Deadline exclusively reported earlier this week, SNL will have a double punch of Thanksgiving and Christmas specials later this year too.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: There is a major cast departure on CBS‘ upcoming FBI offshoot CIA. Michael Michele, one of the series' leads, has left, sources tell Deadline. CIA, headlined by Tom Ellis and Nick Gehlfuss, started production in September for a midseason premiere. There are rumblings that Michele would be recast but that has not been confirmed and appears unclear at the moment. 


	This is a second major change on the crime drama, which was picked up in April with a straight-to-series order, following a showrunner switch over the summer. 


CIA centers on two unlikely partners – a fast-talking, rule-breaking loose cannon CIA case officer (Ellis), and a by-the-book, seasoned and smart FBI agent (Gehlfuss) who believes in the rule of law. When this odd couple are assigned to work out of CIA's New York Station, they must learn to work together to investigate cases and criminals posing threats on U.S. soil, finding that their differences may actually be their strength.

	Michele played the head of CIA's New York Station. The show also stars Natalee Linez as a CIA analyst. 


	Originally planned for a fall 2025 premiere, CIA in July was pushed to midseason while undergoing a showrunner change, with Warren Leight replacing FBI: Most Wanted showrunner David Hudgins.


	Dick Wolf and Leight executive produce CIA alongside Nicole Perlman, David Chasteen, and Peter Jankowski. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, produces in association with Wolf Entertainment and CBS Studios.

	











	Michele has a long history with Wolf; in her first acting gig, she recurred on the first season of his New York Undercover. She most recently recurred opposite Queen Latifah on another CBS/Universal TV crime drama, The Equalizer.

A CIA show? In the Trump era? The US is no longer the hero in world affairs, it is the villain. I don't want to watch Trump's CIA the TV series.

I hope this program works! Really miss FBI International ! Big mistake canceling of the program!

They should have kept FBI: International for another half season so that this one could get properly figured out. Two months and ticking.

Leading figures across film, television, music and art came together Nov. 1 at the 2025 LACMA Art + Film Gala, including Angela Bassett, Demi Moore, Quinta Brunson, Dustin Hoffman, Tessa Thompson, Elle Fanning, Finneas, Demi Lovato and more.

Other attendees included Emmy-winning Hacks star Hannah Einbinder, F1 actor Damson Idris, Dancing with the Stars competitor Alix Earle, Nobody Wants This star Justine Lupe and Overcompensating creator Benito Skinner.

This year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art honors Mary Corse — the artist whose work across six decades has explored light, perception and subjectivity — as well as Sinners and Fruitvale Station filmmaker Ryan Coogler, who was in attendance alongside producer and wife Zinzi Coogler. Last year's honorees were artist Simone Leigh and director Baz Luhrmann.

The Gucci-sponsored event featured LACMA trustee Eva Chow and Leonardo DiCaprio as co-chairs for its 14th consecutive year.

Proceeds from the annual Art+Film Gala go toward underwriting LACMA's initiative to make film more central to the museum's curatorial programming, while also providing funding for exhibitions, acquisitions and education, in addition to allowing for screenings that explore the intersection of art and film.

Past honorees of the Art+Film Gala include artists Helen Pashgian, Catherine Opie, Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Barbara Kruger and David Hockney, as well as filmmakers David Fincher, Park Chan-wook, Steven Spielberg, Alfonso Cuarón, Guillermo del Toro, George Lucas, Kathryn Bigelow, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and Clint Eastwood.

Weekend Editor


Ariana Grande has officially wrapped filming on Focker-in-Law, the new installment in the Meet the Parents franchise set to bow next year.


	The two-time Grammy-winning pop artist marked the occasion with an Instagram carousel, featuring a first look at her character name, Olivia Jones. Details about who she will be playing have remained under wraps.


	“these past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes… so, so very much ♡ i will miss this bunch terribly. see you next november ! ♡,” she wrote alongside behind-the-scenes images featuring co-stars Ben Stiller, Beanie Feldstein, Skyler Gisondo and Eduardo Franco.

A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)


	Back in September, Stiller told E! News of working alongside the actress-singer: “What's surprising, and maybe not really surprising, is how amazingly she blended in. She's such a pro, she's so funny, she's so talented, obviously as a singer, but also she was so funny and amazing in Wicked. What she's doing in this movie is very unique, it's a very unique character, and we're having a great time and just like to work with her.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Scheduled for release Nov. 25, 2026, John Hamburg serves as writer and director of the fourth film in the franchise, which began with 2000's Meet the Parents. It followed Greg Focker, a nurse who suffers a series of unfortunate events while visiting his soon-to-be in-laws, played by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner, who are set to reprise their roles. Teri Polo, who played Pam Byrnes, Greg's girlfriend-turned-wife, is also set to return. The jury is still out whether Barbra Streisand will reprise her role as Roz Focker, Greg's mom, and the EGOT winner has said she's “pissed” about having been paid less than her male co-stars in the franchise.


	Aside from appearing in Focker-in-Law, Grande has a busy slate ahead, with the forthcoming release of Wicked: For Good, her 2026 tour in support of her seventh studio album Eternal Sunshine and voice role in the new animated feature Oh, the Places You'll Go!, based on Dr. Seuss's classic children's book.

They went to first base. 

Meghan Markle celebrated the Los Angeles Dodgers' 2025 World Series victory by giving her husband, Prince Harry, a big smooch on the lips.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were seen reacting to the Dodgers' game 7 win against the Toronto Blue Jays in a video posted to Markle's Instagram Story Saturday night.

Harry was seen seated in a reclining chair in what appeared to be a private theater as the “With Love, Meghan” host was heard cheering off-screen.

Markle then materialized and pranced excitedly over to the “Spare” author, who, unenthusiastically, remained in his seat.

She excitedly planted a kiss on Harry's lips as he wrapped his arms around her before she threw her arms up in excitement, yelling, “Oh my god!”

Markle then proceeded to jump up and down with her friend before they embraced, prompting Harry to let out a chuckle. 

The As Ever founder, 44, looked cozy in a black lounge set while Harry, 41, looked laid back in a collared shirt and pants. He appeared to be snacking on a box of popcorn. 

The couple opted for a private screening of the nail-biter game after facing backlash for their date night during Game 4 of the World Series earlier this week.

As Page Six reported, Harry and Markle were dressed in matching blue hats as they sat front row at Dodger Stadium in LA Tuesday.

The duo was seen chatting and laughing throughout the MLB game and even stood up from their seats to clap.

While they appeared to be in high spirits throughout the duration of the face-off, they were criticised for having better seats than several sports legends in attendance. 

Internet users were up in arms when they noticed Harry and Markle sitting in front of former Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax and Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson, who holds a 2.3 percent stake in the LA franchise.

The former athletes seemed unbothered by the seating snub as the Sussexes were seen having a friendly chat with Koufax. Markle and Harry also posed for a photo with Magic and his wife, Cookie Johnson.

Harry and Markle didn't have the warmest welcome from some fans in the stadium and received a few boos when they were shown on the Jumbotron.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Streaming comedy service Dropout passes the 1 million subscriber mark","https://www.avclub.com/dropout-comedy-streamer-1-million-subscribers","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 01:38:00 GMT","

Dropout—the comedy company/streaming service that grew out of the collapse of CollegeHumor about five years back—has posted a pretty major milestone, per Variety. In a new interview with company CEO Sam Reich, the streamer revealed that it's now passed the 1 million paid subscribers mark.

That puts Dropout on roughly the same tier as niche streaming companies like Shudder or Acorn TV, and not far behind a sports streamer like FuboTV. Which isn't bad for a streamer that doesn't license any third-party content, and instead makes all of its own stuff—including format-breaking, improv-heavy game shows like Game Changer and Make Some Noise. (To say nothing of the company's other big flagship show, Dungeons & Dragons actual play series Dimension 20, which had live shows at both Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl in 2025.)

And, sure, those numbers start to look like slightly smaller potatoes compared to a Netflix—which has something like 300 million subscribers planetwide, a number that means its growth is starting to be curtailed by the total number of internet-connected humans on Earth as much as it is by more editorial concerns—or even the much smaller numbers posted by services like Apple TV+ (45 million) or Peacock (41 million).

Again, though: Those are arms of massive corporations, in comparison to a company that employs roughly 40 people, according to the Variety interview, and which makes and owns its own stuff, a rarity in the streaming world. It's also worth noting—at the risk of employing the dreaded “parasocial” word—that the company's subscribers tend to be a lot more committed than the average Netflix binger; it's not for nothing that the service recently unveiled a “Superfans” subscription tier, reportedly by audience request, which basically amounts to fans giving the company more than their normal $6.99 a month as a show of support, with only a few small perks thrown in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Famke Janssen gets asked about Jean Grey by everybody—except Disney","https://www.avclub.com/famke-janssen-jean-grey-disney-doomsday-never-asked","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 00:48:00 GMT","

Famke Janssen has a new Netflix show out this week, with her Dutch crime drama Amsterdam Empire getting a global debut back on October 30. But, deep down, Janssen knowns that people are frequently only interested in asking her about one thing, i.e., a project she was last part of fully 11 years ago (and even then, only as a cameo): Fox's original X-Men movies, where she played psychic powerhouse Jean Grey. In fact, there's only one group that apparently resists the urge to ask Janssen about her time riding the ol' Phoenix on the regular: The Walt Disney Corporation, which has apparently never talked to her, even once, about reprising the role, despite its general nostalgia mining of the old X-properties in recent years.

“Never. Never ever,” Janssen said when asked by Entertainment Weekly if she'd ever had conversations about bringing her version of Jean back for the MCU. (This, despite the fact that a large number of her former co-stars on the franchise will be back for next December's Avengers: Doomsday, including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, James Marsden, Kelsey Grammer, Rebecca Romjin, and Alan Cumming.) (We can't help but wonder if the absence is because the character's power level throws a bunch of MCU stuff out of whack—or if it's something simpler, like the fact that X-Men: Dark Phoenix, which focused so heavily on Sophie Turner's version of the character, was a disastrous flop for Disney in the immediate aftermath of its big Fox purchase.)

It all sounds pretty academic to Janssen, though, who appears to have gained some level of acceptance about how influential a role (that she herself apparently never cared all that much about) has become. “Every time I do an interview, it's mentioned,” she notes. “It's interesting. I didn't realize that was such a big part. Every interview I do, that will come up, and of everything I say, that is going to be the only thing that's gonna be printed. I should be flattered, I suppose, that this character has resonated with people. It's been so long, but it's nice that people are still talking about her. I'm sure every single time there's a new movie that they're doing… it'll come up again.”

Fans of films and television shows such as “The Bill Cosby Show,” “Hill Street Blues,” and “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” are mourning the loss of actor Lee Weaver, who passed away at the age of 95. 

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Weaver passed away on September 22 at home in Los Angeles. However, his family kept his death private until November 1. The family said of his legacy, “[He] wove joy, depth, and representation into every role he played and everything he did.”

Weaver was born on April 10, 1930, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Before becoming a beloved character actor, Weaver served four years in the US Army and later worked as a linotype engineer for The New York Times. He leaves behind a wife and a daughter. 

Weaver appeared in numerous films and television shows throughout his career, spanning several decades. As a result, fans are flocking to social media platforms to pay tribute to the legacy he leaves behind. 

The Hills Street Blues Fan Group on X said, “Lee Weaver, who starred as Buck Naked, passed away on the 22nd of September. Lee reprised the role in Steven Bochco-produced NYPD Blue and City of Angels. Lee also played a bartender, ‘The Shooter'. R.I.P”

Someone else wrote, “I'm sorry to learn of Mr. Lee Weaver's passing. Every now and then, this actor would come across my mind. I truly enjoyed the characters he played over the many years. My condolences are with his family at this time.”

Another fan wrote, “RIP actor Lee Weaver. Pals with Bill Cosby and Cannonball Adderley — the great saxophonist was his best man and named the 1964 song “The Weaver” for him — he was quite memorable on ‘Hill Street Blues' and as a blind man in ‘O Brother, Where Art Thou?'”

Finally, another person said, “95, what a life. Starred in he 80s series EASY STREET with Loni Anderson and Jack Elam.”

According to IMDb, Weaver appeared in over 140 roles throughout his career. One of his first came in 1955, when he was cast in the show “Sheena: Queen of the Jungle.” He appeared in six episodes of the series. 

From there, he made episodic appearances in shows like “Julia,” “The Wild Wild West,” and “I Spy.” His seven-episode arc on “The Bill Cosby Show” came in 1969. Some of his other notable roles include “G.I. Joe: Arise, Serpentor, Arise!,” “Easy Street,” and “NYPD Blue.” More recently, he appeared in two episodes of Netflix's “Grace & Frankie.”

He will be missed!

Rest In Peacetou lived a good long life

Lady Gaga just made her pick for who she wants to see win “Dancing With the Stars.” The pop icon revealed she's cheering for social media star Alix Earle and her pro partner Val Chmerkovskiy to take home the Mirrorball Trophy. On Friday, October 31, Earle shared a playful TikTok dressed as Gaga for Halloween, dancing and lip-syncing to the hit “Paparazzi.” “Gaga ween,” she captioned the post.

Gaga ween 🤸🏼👏🏻 pics up on my IG :)))

The video quickly caught Gaga's attention. In the comments, the singer left a sweet note of support for Earle, writing, “Girl, I love you and I'm rooting for you on DWTS! Thank you for this, it's so sweet,” along with two black heart emojis.

Fans went wild over the interaction, flooding the post with excitement. “The concept of Lady Gaga watching Dancing With the Stars,” one viewer wrote. Another added, “ALIX WAKE UP GAGA COMMENTED.”

Gaga may be cheering from the sidelines now, but she's no stranger to the “DWTS” ballroom. The singer performed during the Season 8 finale in 2009, and her songs have been featured in multiple routines over the years.

Earle and Chmerkovskiy have become standout performers this season. The duo topped the leaderboard on “Halloween Night,” earning a 39 out of 40 for their haunting tango to Billie Eilish's “Bury a Friend.” Cheryl Burke, who served as a guest judge, was the only panelist not to give a perfect 10.

After the episode aired, Earle's stepmom, Ashley, took a jab at Burke on social media, telling her to “go take more Ozempic.” She later apologized for the comment.

Earlier this week, Earle, 24, revealed that her spooky “Halloween Night” performance almost looked very different. In a behind-the-scenes TikTok posted October 30, she explained that the pair originally planned to start their tango buried under a pile of dirt.

We couldn't see and dragged dirt across the whole floor so we had to change the material in the box 😭. @Val 

“This is crazier than expected,” Earle said in the video as she stood in the mock graveyard set. “I mean, it looks pretty cool.”

However, after several rehearsals, the pair realized that the dirt was getting in their eyes and spreading across the ballroom floor. To keep the set clean and safe, producers decided to replace the dirt with rubber mulch.

“We couldn't see and dragged dirt across the whole floor, so we had to change the material in the box 😭,” she captioned the video.

A post shared by Alix Earle (@alix_earle)

Despite the last-minute change, Earle and Chmerkovskiy's performance earned high praise from both fans and judges. The pair scored an additional four points after finishing second in the “Dance-Monster-thon,” bringing their total score for the night to 43.

Earle later joked in the comments that she was still finding dirt and sand in her costume for days and gave a shout-out to the “DWTS” crew for their hard work cleaning up the mess.

“Dancing With the Stars” airs live Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC and Disney+, with next-day streaming on Hulu.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans Petition Hallmark After Paul Campbell Confirms Movie Franchise's Cancellation","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/paul-campbell-petition-cases-of-mystery-lane/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

One day after beloved Hallmark star Paul Campbell confirmed that his comedy-infused mystery franchise, “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” has been canceled, shocked fans had already mobilized, launching a petition urging Hallmark execs to reconsider. 

Wearing the red ballcap from one of his character Alden Case's many hilarious disguises, Campbell posted an Instagram photo on October 31, 2025, and wrote, “Show may be cancelled, but he's still on the Case… IYKYK”

A post shared by Paul Campbell (@paulcampbellofficial)

In 2023's “The Cases of Mystery Lane,” Campbell and co-star Aimee Garcia play married couple Alden Case, a chronically unemployed but adorable, quirky guy searching for his purpose, and Birdie Case, a gifted attorney. When Alden signs up for private investigator classes, he gets sucked into a murder mystery, only to find Birdie may hold the key to cracking the case. 

Viewers loved it so much that a petition was started to convince execs to make a sequel. Over 1,300 fans signed the petition and months later, Campbell and Garcia got to reunite for “The Cases of Mystery Lane: Death is Listening,” which premiered in September 2024. 

The cancellation of the franchise hasn't exactly been a secret, but many fans may have missed the news or hoped it wasn't true. In May, Hallmark actor Matt Hamilton — who played dim-witted Officer Newton in both movies — first announced the cancellation on Instagram, writing, “Yes, Paul Campbell and I are building up a nice collection of cancelled shows together. First Turner & Hooch and now this. Not to brag or anything.”

Then, in late September, “Hallmark Mysteries & More” podcast host Eric Rutin shared a screenshot on Instagram of a comment from Campbell on his post about the future of the franchise. Campbell wrote, “We've been cancelled. No more cases for the cases.” 

But Campbell's October 31 post was the final nail in the coffin that fans hoped wouldn't come, and has inspired some to try their best at saving the franchise. 

Fans flooded Campbell's post with comments expressing their disappointment and surprise, including one who wrote, “I can't believe they cancelled it! I was loving the Mystery Lane movies, and YOU as Alden! Huge mistake. I love you! ❤️”

On November 1, Campbell shared in his Stories multiple posts that people shared about a brand new petition started by fan Susan Fraser on Change.org to “urge the decision-makers at Hallmark Channel to reconsider their decision to shelve ‘The Cases of Mystery Lane.'”

“The clever scripts, complete with the show's signature nerdy puns, offered a unique twist on the classic mystery genre – something that is sorely missing right now,” she wrote. 

Garcia also shared a link to the petition in her Stories, writing, “Aww…a petition for more #CasesOfMysteryLane shenanigans 🕵🏽‍♀️🕵🏼”

Even Tyler Hynes, Campbell's buddy and “Three Wisest Men” co-star, shared one of the posts to rally his fans to support the petition. 

Though Campbell continues to be one of Hallmark's biggest stars, with two Christmas movies still to come in 2025 — “The Wisest Men” and “Christmas at the Catnip Cafe” — losing “The Cases of Mystery Lane” franchise likely stings because it was a role he loved so much. 

In 2023, before the first movie premiered, he told TV Insider that it was his “dream role,” explaining, “It's quirky and it's silly and it's clever, and the relationship between the two leads is wonderful. They're real characters. There's humanity. It was everything you could possibly want, plus disguises, fake mustaches. I mean, you can't go wrong.”

Before the sequel premiered in September 2024, he told AssignmentX, “The hope is always that it will continue. When you film it, there's always the idea that, if this were to go on for a hundred episodes, you would be thrilled.” 

Those who want to throw their support behind the new petition can find it here.

What do you see when you hear the word “Chicago”? In the popular imagination, it's probably the skyline, skyscrapers with antennas forking into the clouds. Zoom in and you might focus on heavy and wet food like salad-loaded hot dogs, oily Italian beef sandwiches, and deep dish pizza. Think back and you'll conjure Michael Jordan with his tongue out, Harry Caray's blocky bifocals, or maybe George Wendt saying “Da Bears.” But if you're from Chicago, you know these chestnuts are how tourists and transplants claim their Windy City bona fides. Most Chicagoans don't picture the Sears Tower and Wiener's Circle when they think of home. They see the lake.

Open the jewel case of Common's second album, Resurrection, and right there, printed in purple and blue onto the CD itself, is the sun rising over Lake Michigan. The image is an exceptional rendering of Resurrection's tone, which breathes Chicago with a mixture of defiance, exuberance, and reflection. Across its 55 minutes, you can hear 22-year-old Lonnie Rashid Lynn's whole world: puttering down Lake Shore Drive in a beat-up Toyota Celica, hanging out at the 31st Street beach, riding through parks on Schwinn bikes, making runs to the liquor store. It's a portrait of a specific slice of Chicago—a young black man's experiences on the South Side in the early 1990s—but it also conveys the perspective of any teenager who grew up in the city.

Resurrection brandishes its Chicagoness obliquely, through snapshots of everyday life, a cocky attitude, and richly expressive beats. But subtlety didn't come naturally to Common, who at the time was going by Common Sense. The cover of his 1992 debut, Can I Borrow a Dollar? , is a photograph of him crouched down, wearing a White Sox skullcap and clutching a touristy Chicago coffee mug, with a map of the city overlaid on his crew assembled behind him — the visual equivalent of someone from suburban Tinley Park claiming to be from the South Loop.

Common needed to lean on “No but you see I'm from Chicago” because he didn't really have anything else. Put on Can I Borrow a Dollar? and its concrete-stomping energy and gruff, soul-sampling beats are interchangeable with hardcore hip-hop albums from 1992, like Redman's Whut? Thee Album, Showbiz and AG's Runaway Slave, and Das EFX's Dead Serious. But “Common Sense” didn't have any of those artists' distinct personalities or approaches to rapping. It was a little Das EFX diggity here, a little Redman-style jokey simile there, smushing into a mishmash of non sequiturs and nonsense. “Breaker 1/9,” whose Isley Brothers sample was the basis of a hit song for Notorious B.I.G. three years later, opens with the lines, “A weeby weeby wobble gobble gobble do the turkey/Lord have mercy, mercy mercy me.”

Can I Borrow a Dollar? is the sound of someone performing what's expected of them rather than who they really are. Common's hometown friends Immenslope and Twilite Tone provided the beats, which are as strong as many other major-label releases from the same year, but the end product doesn't feel honest. Common admitted later that the recording sessions were rushed — his label, Relativity, was trying to quickly capitalize on the momentum from a feature in The Source's hallowed Unsigned Hype column — and said the album consisted largely of touch-ups to his demo tape.

Though it had three singles with music videos on steady rotation on MTV, Can I Borrow a Dollar? sold poorly, and Common wasn't asked to guest on other rap albums or singles. Aside from Tung Twista, a West Side rapper known for the rapid-fire speed of his flow, there weren't very many rappers in Chicago, and thus not much of an infrastructure for regional support. In early '90s hip-hop, Common Sense seemed like more of a bit player than an up-and-comer. When A Tribe Called Quest dropped Midnight Marauders the following year, he was burned that his headshot wasn't included among the rows of emcees featured on the front and back covers. He thought, “‘Man! I didn't get invited to the big game,'” as he told Complex in 2011. “I wanted to be included as part of the next movement of artists. I felt like I was overlooked.”

And during the short time between Can I Borrow a Dollar? and Resurrection, hip-hop evolved. Dr. Dre's The Chronic saturated the airwaves and the charts with the warped, P-Funk-pilfering sounds of West Coast gangsta rap. Looking to the East Coast, Common heard Nas freestyling on The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show and was shook. “I was like, ‘This dude is too good,'” he said later. “It just made me have to grow quick … It really gave me insight on using my writing skills and poetic skills more.”

Equally profound changes were happening in Common's musical world, particularly the growing influence of jazz. During the recording of Resurrection, he put a poster of John Coltrane's 1958 album Blue Train on the wall of his apartment. Inspired by the Last Poets, he started to think of lyrics that could be “pure, timeless music.” And Immenslope, who'd by now changed his stage persona to No I.D. (his name, “Dion,” spelled backwards), also experienced a creative breakthrough. Largely under the tutelage of the Beatnuts, he learned how and where to dig for records and identify licks or riffs that could be great samples. Instead of building the drumbeat first and piling samples on top of it, he made the sample the foundation and constructed the beat around it.

Initially, Resurrection was going to be produced by Twilite Tone exclusively, but largely on the strength of No I.D.'s new beats, the latter contributed 13 of the album's 15 tracks. They were the perfect complement to a new writing process that would become Common's permanent practice. On Can I Borrow a Dollar?, he wrote all his lyrics down on paper, but for Resurrection he decided to try composing in his head. He would drive up and down Lake Shore Drive freestyling, and any bars he liked he'd repeat until they were committed to memory, an improvisational approach instinctively linked to jazz.

From the first notes of the opening title track, you can hear Common's musical growth. There's his voice, which has dropped down into a fatherly baritone. But what's unusual is that you also hear his personal growth, literally, in the words. “Resurrection” is one of the all-time great songs about artistic maturation and emerging into adulthood, sparked by an effervescent snippet of the Ahmad Jamal Trio's 1970 recording of Herbie Hancock's “Dolphin Dance.” Common begins by showing off his linguistic dexterity (“I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a pattern that be scatterin'/Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen”), then proudly boasts of his intellectual curiosity (“Proceed to read and not believing everything I'm reading”), and recounts his newly salubrious lifestyle (“My diet I un-swine,” “Had to halt with the malt liquor/‘Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas”).

“Resurrection” announces and combines the two kinds of songs that make up the album: meditations on single subjects and rapping prowess exhibited through shit-talking, observational asides, and jokes. Songs like “Watermelon,” “Communism” (where most of the words have “Com” somewhere in them), “Orange Pineapple Juice,” “Maintaining,” and “Sum Shit I Wrote” don't really have an underlying message or a theme. What keeps them from feeling like throwaways is the tension between the lightheartedness of Common's rapping and the emotional weight of the beats beneath him.

Common Sense's name is on the cover, but No I.D. deserves a lot of the credit for Resurrection's emotional power. His ear stands out because he chooses samples as much for their texture as for their notes—whether it's Ahmad Jamal's twinkling upper keys, Freddie Hubbard's shimmering soul-jazz arrangements, or Gary Burton's plunking vibraphone hits. Yet all the tracks are tonally unified—a compilation of all of Resurrection's sample sources is an incredible mix of jazz and soul music. And instead of choruses, bridges, or outros, most of the songs on Resurrection feature the scratching of turntablist Mista Sinista of the X-Ecutioners, whose rhythm and split-second quickness demonstrate undeniable mastery. (Peter Kang, the A&R who's Resurrection's executive producer, argued to Complex, “I really challenge anyone to tell me where you can find better DJ work.”)

In his autobiography, One Day It'll All Make Sense, there's a passage where Common explains that to understand Chicago hip-hop, you have to study Chicago music. He lists blues musicians from Muddy Waters to Junior Wells, soul singers from Jackie Wilson to Minnie Ripperton, and waxes rhapsodic about house music and the legendary DJ Ron Hardy. Resurrection feels so Chicago because it was created with this continuum in mind. But I'd also argue that what makes Common so unique is that he approaches hip-hop as a soul musician—he's more like Curtis Mayfield than Talib Kweli.

This becomes apparent when you focus on Resurrection's highlights, in which Common deals most directly with an issue or theme. “Book of Life” eloquently takes personal routines and extrapolates them into implicit self-improvement. Common chastises himself for eating fast food, bemoans having to work mindless jobs, and struggles with his place in the world. The poignant “Thisisme” makes self-affirmation sound triumphant. The track is like secular gospel, with its protagonist positioning self-awareness and knowledge as salvation over a snippet of Alton McClain & Destiny's lustrous “The Power of Love.”

Yet it's a song about aimlessness and ennui, “Nuthin' to Do,” that's Resurrection's most powerful moment. With a loping drum break behind him, Common Sense does his own rendition of The Notorious B.I.G.'s “Juicy,” except instead of a rags-to-riches narrative, he homes in on the moments in between, the anecdotes and scenery of middle-class youth. Like Biggie, Common uses evocative details to establish setting: popping wheelies on his blue and gray stingray bike, penny loafers with nickels in the tongues, taking trips to the Loop in Nike Precision sneakers. He also invokes specific Chicago touchpoints: Polish sausages, girls at Whitney Young and Kenwood high schools, taping Farley “Jackmaster” Funk's radio show on WBMX. If you look at the words, it all seems romantic. But No I.D.'s beat, foregrounding a sax line on Living Jazz's rendition of “Walk On By,” provides a funereal tone. Common even alludes to this melancholy in the line, “As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down/But the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down.”

Between 1990 and 1994, there were three years when Chicago recorded the second-to-fourth highest annual number of homicides in history; all five years were the worst for homicide rates ever. The violence in the city reached a flash point in September of 1994, one month before the release of Resurrection, with the murder of Robert Sandifer. Sandifer had hoped to join a local gang called the Black Disciples and fatally shot 14-year-old Shavon Dean while aiming for rival gang members. When police were searching for him, two teenage brothers from the Black Disciples feigned protecting Sandifer and executed him under a railroad underpass. Sandifer was 11 years old.

Because of the horrific details of the crime, the national media turned Sandifer's story into a referendum on gang violence in Chicago. The September 19, 1994, issue of Time posted Sandifer's mugshot against a black background with the headline “So Young to Kill, So Young to Die.” (The words “poverty,” “segregation,” or “disinvestment” don't appear anywhere in Time's coverage.) It was one of the earliest installments in the long, false, and, sadly, ongoing narrative painting the South Side of the city as a dystopian crimescape.

“Nuthin' to Do” is striking because of how it tacitly challenges this framing. Though Common grew up in the predominantly middle-class Calumet Heights neighborhood, he acknowledges in his autobiography that he was close to impoverished blocks with high incidents of crime; he also recalls time spent in Hyde Park, the affluent home base of the University of Chicago. The point is that the South Side isn't one thing; it's a vast portion of the city with various communities of distinct ethnicities and class status. The sound of “Nuthin' to Do” conveys proximate and enshrouding areas of danger and disinvestment, but its lyrics celebrate adolescent behavior, implying that racist policies and gang life shouldn't preclude Black teenagers from moving freely and doing what any other teenager would do, nor should they be punished for it.

“Nuthin' to Do” proves Common's talent for depicting his environment, so it's funny that his breakthrough single was a parable. By now, the concept of “I Used to Love H.E.R.” is well known: Common details the deterioration of a romantic relationship, only to reveal in the very last bar that he's actually been talking about hip-hop the whole time. The story is a recollection of a woman he falls in love with, who gets into Afrocentricity, moves to the West Coast, and, due to business pressure, adopts a “gangsta” persona to make money as an artist. Superficially, the narrative scans as criticizing West Coast gangsta rap for reversing the progress made by Native Tongues hip-hop. But it's a reading that Common disputes, claiming he was referring to East Coast rappers mimicking West Coast artists whose experiences they didn't share.

“I Used to Love H.E.R.” was revelatory in 1994, but over time, its conceptual ingenuity has weakened. No I.D.'s beat, a flip of George Benson's “The Changing World,” gorgeously draws out the billowing texture of the jazz guitarist's playing. Yet where the other tracks on Resurrection thrive on nuance and subtext, “I Used to Love H.E.R.” is more of a sly gimmick. It's also the catalyst of a tiresome period in which music fans were arguing over what constituted “real” hip-hop, a false dichotomy pitting underground “backpacker” rap against major-label artists. “I Used to Love H.E.R.” is the kind of song people post with mind-blown emojis next to it and you wonder, “Really?”

One person who definitely didn't have his mind blown was Ice Cube. The buzz around “I Used to Love H.E.R.” brought newfound attention to Common Sense and No I.D., who says that purely off the strength of that single, he started getting calls from big-name artists requesting beats. The track made its way to Cube, who took it as a shot fired at West Coast rap. On Westside Connection's “Westside Slaughterhouse,” Cube harshly and plainly calls Common out: “Used to Love H.E.R./mad 'cause we fucked a/Pussy-whipped bitch with no Common Sense/Hip-hop started in the west!”

Though it might seem crazy now—considering their personalities, and five years after Cube virtually ended N.W.A. on “No Vaseline”—Common annihilated Cube with his response. The Pete Rock-produced “The Bitch In Yoo,” issued as the A-side of a split single with No I.D. in 1996, is one of rap's most brutal diss tracks. The first verse alone is a thorough dismantling of Cube's career, with Common claiming his West Coast cred is ridiculous (hiring the Long Island-based Bomb Squad for his debut), calling out his blatant careerism (“Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX”), and insinuating he's a bad actor (with sly references to Higher Learning and Friday).

It took the deaths of 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G., and the intervention of Louis Farrakhan, to squash the beef. At the Hip-Hop Summit in Chicago in April of 1997, Farrakhan addressed the assembled rappers, including Cube, Common, Snoop Dogg, and the Dogg Pound: “All this turf you fighting for—East Coast, West Coast—who owns it? Not you.” Farrakhan is acknowledged for ending the feud, but the deeper truth is that both men had changed. For Cube, he'd successfully made a transition to acting and was gradually assuming a role as a family man. Common had also recently become a father, and he was transformed by the Million Man March, which he attended. As he writes in One Day It'll All Make Sense, the event inspired him to be comfortable with expressing love and solidarity.

To date, Resurrection has sold fewer than 250,000 copies, but it earned Common Sense respect. It also attracted more national attention, including from a California-based reggae band with the same name that sued the rapper over the rights. Common dropped the “Sense” before the 1997 follow-up LP, One Day It'll All Make Sense, which simultaneously refined and expanded on the approach he and No I.D. took on Resurrection.

Shortly afterwards, he will leave Chicago and move to New York City. He will go and join the Soulquarians collective, garnering him larger audiences and further accolades; then he will drop an ambitious, experimental, psych-informed album that will bomb. He will date singers and athletes and movie stars; then he will think he can act. He will become an actor, questionably; then he will fight Keanu Reeves, believably. He will constantly cycle through success and embarrassment. He will come remarkably close to an EGOT. And all along, the sun will still rise every day over Lake Michigan.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump reminded everyone that New York's mayoral election on Tuesday is about him—to some extent—while making fun of each candidate.


	First, in response to the debate moderator (Kenan Thompson) asking the three main candidates why they would want “the worst job in the world,” former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (SNL host Miles Teller) explained: “As you all know, as soon as you are elected mayor, everyone in this city immediately hates you. And in that way, I am already one step ahead of the game.” 


	Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa (Shane Gillis) then answered succinctly: “I need a job.” And Zohran Mamdani (Ramy Youssef) acknowledged with a smile that what he wants to see in the city—affordable housing, free healthcare, free wifi—would probably not be happening.


	Trump (James Austin Johnson) entered the debate stage after each candidate was asked what they felt was the “biggest problem” they would have to deal with if elected.


	“It's me!” Trump declared. “We can pretend this election is going to be about housing or taxes, but it's about me, because I'm going to be very involved, very hands-on. This guy knows about ‘hands-on,' right Cuomo?”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Something must be done about Sliwa's “Emily in Paris-looking hat,” Trump continued, while Mamdani “looks like the subway takes guy went to work at McKinsey.”


	Trump then an answered a question that had been put to the candidates earlier: their preferred type of bagel.

Boo.

Darkstone Digital, the developer behind the viral hit The Mortuary Assistant, has unveiled its next game: Paranormal Activity: Threshold.

With warnings for language, violence, murder, suicide, and ""references to the occult"", the horror game lets you play across multiple timelines, hunt and communicate with entities, ""perform demonic rituals to alter your fate"", and offers multiple endings that ""expand the story"".

No release date has been revealed as yet, but Steam lists it as ""coming soon"". You can check out its announcement teaser below:

""Daniel and Jessica Stewart have decided to remodel their first home,"" the description teases. ""Old and dilapidated, they begin to record the adventures of their renovation, but the couple soon discovers their new home hides much more than asbestos and faulty wiring.

""As they dig deeper into the mysterious house, their excitement turns to concern when they uncover strange markings and items hidden within the walls. The more time they spend there, the clearer it becomes that they are not the home's only occupant. Sinking deeper into the influences of a dark presence, Daniel and Jessica are unprepared for the horrifying events that follow.""

The Mortuary Assistant is, of course, one of the biggest horror games of the last few years, weaving an unusual story around an unusual job in which a mortuary assistant has to grapple with both the dead and the living dead. It was so successful, in fact, that earlier this year, we learned that production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role.

Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant. Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire actor Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film.

SALT LAKE CITY — On Halloween night, while many were out trick-or-treating or attending costume parties, a brave group of locals chose a different kind of adventure — one that explores the haunted corners of Salt Lake City's historic downtown.

Their final stop? The iconic Salt Lake County Building, a stunning architectural landmark with a chilling reputation.

“There are definitely things happening here,” said Cody Owen, a guide with U.S. Ghost Adventures. “Something is here.”

Owen led a group of ghost-hunting enthusiasts through six of the city's most haunted locations, starting with the historic Capitol Theatre.

“On the second floor, things get moved around. Doors that are locked will be unlocked,” Owen explained. “We refer to one spirit as ‘George.'”

Armed with lanterns and EMF detectors — devices used to detect electromagnetic fields often associated with paranormal activity — the group wandered through the city's eerie landmarks. At one point, the EMF reader lit up green, startling even the most seasoned ghost hunters.

“My big takeaway for why this spirit, why his energy is here… is to warn us,” Owen said. “Whether the spirits are trying to prevent history from repeating itself or simply stay connected, they're here.”

For ghost-hunting enthusiast Gage Ramos, his appreciation for the past is more than just a thrill; it's something he likes to share with others.

“It's something I love doing with friends,” Ramos said.

As the night deepened and shadows grew longer, the Salt Lake County Building stood tall, a silent witness to the city's past, converging with the present – for a few lingering spirits.

Georgia Republican lawmaker also claims she didn't know Rothschild family, of her ‘space laser' theory, was Jewish

Republican US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene has said she believes in demons, surmising that they might be aliens who fell from heaven, and claims to have been unaware that key figures in the antisemitic space lasers conspiracy she floated were Jewish.

She made those bizarre remarks as a guest on Friday on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher after winning some fans among Democrats who once loathed her – yet had come to appreciate how the far-right Georgia representative had recently broken with Republicans on various issues. Those include healthcare, Gaza, the federal government shutdown that began on 1 October and the handling of documents pertaining to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was friends with Donald Trump before the latter man won two presidencies.

Greene's appearance on Maher's show perhaps made evident the ideological distance between the congresswoman – who has conspicuously avoided directly criticizing Trump himself – and some of her newer, cross-aisle admirers.

Maher on Friday asked another of his on-air guests, film-maker Dan Farah, to discuss his new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, and how it explores the way some senior US military officials apparently theorize earnestly that “demons” may be responsible for what some colloquially refer to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs.

The Real Time host, who is generally considered to be left-leaning, subsequently asked those on the show: “Do you think demons and the devil are real?”

Greene, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, confidently answered: “Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. And I believe those could be fallen angels.”

As Maher replied: “Fallen angels? The aliens are fallen angels?” Greene continued: “That's possible – I think that's what they could be. That's what makes sense in my worldview.”

The Fifth Column podcast host Michael Moynihan was also participating in the discussion, and Maher called on him to say whether he agreed with Greene. “No,” Moynihan said. “I'm sorry.”

At another point in the show, Maher invited Greene to revisit her infamous 2018 social media screed positing that wildfires that had devastated California were ignited by a laser beam from space under the control of the Rothschild banking dynasty.

The progressive watchdog Media Matters uncovered that post weeks into Greene's first congressional term. And her colleagues at the time voted to remove her from her House committee assignments, with the Rothschild family having repeatedly been subjected to antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Greene on Friday declared to Maher that she initially “didn't even know the Rothschilds were Jewish”.

“Before politics … I [did] not know much of any of this stuff,” Greene said. “I never even said the word ‘Jewish' in the … post.”

Maher pointed out that “‘Rothschild', to a lot of people, is almost synonymous with the word ‘Jewish'”.

Greene replied: “I had no idea … Now I know it's Jewish.”

Amid laughter and applause, Maher retorted: “Right. Well, now we know … That's what I'm here for – to make sure that people in Congress know what the fuck you're talking about.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

“Close Encounters of the Third Kind” is considered a landmark science-fiction film that fueled greater curiosities about the wonders and mysteries of extraterrestrial life. 

Now more than 48 years since its release, the movie is sparking a question that doesn't have an answer. The latest mystery doesn't involve aliens, flashing lights or UFOs, but the fate of an old farmhouse where the movie's alien abduction scene of a 3-year-old boy took place.

“I think people are interested to know what is going on,” said Fairhope City Council President Jack Burrell, unaware of the reasons for the issue.

The developer has until November 21 to provide some information. The house, located in the middle of an evolving new 13-lot subdivision, was authorized to be moved by the council nearly a year ago. That has not occurred yet.

Hunter Simmons, the City of Fairhope's Planning Director, said the developers have one year since the council's approval to secure a building permit in order to commence the project. If not, the project's developer can request an extension from the council to have the house relocated at a future date.

“Other than those timelines, there are no other requirements to update the city,” Simmons said.

He said there has been communication between the development team and the city. The developers include Jade Consultants and the appropriately named Encounters Development. Neither returned a call for comment.

Tim Herrington, a Realtor who is also working on the project, emailed AL.com to say there is “no update at this time.”

Simmons said there have been communications between the development team and the city about moving the farmhouse. However, no permit applications have been submitted to the city to do so.

“I have not had anyone voice disappointment that it hasn't been done,” said Erik Cortinas, the city's building official. “Any calls I have received were mainly just curiosity, and people wanting to verify the developer's intention is still to preserve and relocate the structure.”

Simmons said he is hopeful that the development team is performing “due diligence to ensure the preservation and move is successful.”

He added, “We do not want to rush such an endeavor.”

Projects are ongoing at and near the farmhouse. A new Sherwin Williams paint shop is under construction to the immediate south of the farmhouse. That project was approved by the council last October.

In addition, a new office building with an orthodontics practice is under construction near Route 118 and 104. The plans for that project were approved on April 14.

The farmhouse's fate drew attention on social media, where fans of the movie gathered to discuss the need to preserve it. Fairhope city officials got in on the act as well during its Nov. 21, 2024, meeting by posting an alien face marker on a map to show where the house was eventually relocating.

The developers had plans to utilize the house for office space, with access to Route 104. 

However, city officials including Mayor Sherry Sullivan said they were hopeful the development team would create a historic marker or additional wayfinding information connecting the house to a movie considered among the best directed by iconic Hollywood director Stephen Spielberg.

'Close Encounters' house

“There is a history of the arts that people don't necessarily associate with Alabama,” said Max Romanowski, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of South Alabama. “But to have something like this here is something that is very special. The preservation of stuff like this is culturally and historically valuable.”

The potential also exists for an unexpected tourism boom connected to the public's fascination with aliens. In nearby Pascagoula, for instance, the city celebrates a wild story about a local alien abduction during the annual Goula Palooza, held downtown in early October.

Roswell, New Mexico, has been transformed from a small rural town to a tourism mecca for alien enthusiasts and curiosity seekers.

The Fairhope farmhouse does not have an actual connection to alien activity, only the Hollywood kind. 

In the movie, the farmhouse is portrayed as being in Muncie, Ind., and involved the alien abduction of a 3-year-old boy portrayed by child actor Cary Guffey. 

The movie was also filmed in other Alabama cities in 1976, including Bay Minette and Mobile. The movie starred actor Richard Dreyfuss in the lead role of Roy Neary as well as the late actresses Melinda Dillon and Teri Garr.

At the time of the movie's filming, Baldwin County had a population of around 106,000 residents. Since then, the county has more than doubled in size to a population of over 231,000 people.

The farmhouse itself was surrounded by nothing but rural landscape. In recent years, Route 181 has seen extra traffic lanes added. A new Publix grocery store was built almost directly across the interstate from the farmhouse. A Wawa convenience store is a short walk from the house.

Simmons said last year that he was uncertain how the house would be relocated. At the time, he said the city had become inundated with calls and emails from the movie's dedicated fanbase.

The lack of activity has caught some city officials by surprise and uncertainty on the next steps.

“Everything is in the same place,” said Fairhope City Councilman Jimmy Conyers. “I know it's expensive (to move it) but I don't know what happens.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","From 'Lost' to 'Supernatural,' 8 Fantasy TV Shows With the Most Divisive Finales, Ranked","https://collider.com/fantasy-shows-divisive-finales-ranked/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:05:00 GMT","

When it comes to writing any piece of fiction, one of the hardest aspects to nail is the ending. That kind of sucks because it's also one of the most important aspects to get right. Wrapping everything up in a nice little bow whilst simultaneously saying what you intended to say from the start is actually not such an easy feat, as it turns out. This is especially true, considering that you can't please everyone, and that any ending will inevitably disappoint or anger some of the fans.

Perhaps no one knows this better than TV screenwriters, especially in the realm of fantasy, as there have been numerous TV shows that have dropped the ball for their final episodes. While not everyone loathed these finales with a passion, it's important to know that some were fine with them, and some even loved them. There's a lot of debate surrounding these final episodes, but there's no denying that they were extremely controversial, no matter where you stand.

With how long Supernatural lasted, creating a satisfying ending was going to be a difficult, if not insurmountable task. The longer a show gets, the more plot points spring up, and the more loose ends there are to wrap up when it comes time to say goodbye. Granted, many die-hard fans of Supernatural didn't really have anything bad to say about the finale, and it wasn't widely criticized for bad writing or bad character moments like other shows are.

The main reason Supernatural's finale was so divisive was that some felt it was way too long and drawn out, feeling like a gigantic epilogue rather than a proper conclusion. But again, with how long the show ran, perhaps this approach was for the best. Sure, it felt anticlimactic to some, but at least it didn't leave many unanswered questions. All in all, it's not really the most controversial ending to a TV show ever created, but it was still met with its fair share of disappointment. 

Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a staple of the 90s and early 2000s, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar in the titular role. This series was both a romance, a dark fantasy, and a coming-of-age teen drama all at once, which meant it resonated with a lot of viewers and appealed to a very broad audience. Perhaps it deserved a better finale than it got. It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't inspire the same level of near-unanimous approval as its earlier episodes did.

Those who weren't too pleased with Buffy's conclusion criticized it for its out-of-character moments and its abrupt change in direction, which disgruntled fans claimed were against the reasons they fell in love with the show in the first place. The buzz surrounding this finale, perhaps, wasn't quite as loud as it was for many other TV shows, but it was noticeable enough. Of course, some fans didn't mind the ending so much, but this didn't stop the louder, angrier group from complaining.

Once Upon a Time is a show that fell victim to the classic fault of running longer than it really should've. Many fans felt that it could have been easily wrapped up in six seasons, yet it inexplicably ran for one extra season. This only served to disappoint people, especially the fans who felt that they had already gotten proper closure. Instead, Season 7 tried to change things for the worse, including an absurd number of retcons that left things convoluted and messy.

Fans didn't really like how this unwarranted extension lessened any emotional impact that the finale deserved, and also disliked how much it felt like a cheap cash grab with how it tried desperately to milk the show for what it was worth. On the other hand, some fans were more than happy to receive another season and see some of their favorite characters again, so they didn't really mind if the quality wasn't up to par. It's not the single most divisive finale on TV, but it definitely made a lot of people upset. 

Merlin is a show that lasted five seasons, which is exactly the amount it planned to receive, as the showrunners didn't want to overstay their welcome or have the show grow stale. Unfortunately, some felt it did just that anyway in the final episode. The show was generally pretty light-hearted and contained a fair bit of comedy, despite being for more mature audiences, which is why many felt a bit insulted by its bitter ending.

Instead of getting the satisfying conclusion that fans expected, many were faced with a bleak, depressing ending that nobody could have seen coming in a million years. Some fans also felt that the ending was a bit rushed, but others still enjoyed the final episodes for what they were. Yes, the ending is indeed extremely different from the overall tone of the rest of the series, but for the fans who are quite alright with bleaker endings, it wasn't so bad.

The Vampire Diaries initially seemed like a product of its time, a shameless copycat during the Twilight craze. As it happened, though, the show evolved beyond the bounds of what was expected and outlasted the era from which it came. It lasted nearly an entire decade, but tragically suffered towards the end, which is where many felt it took a sharp turn in the wrong direction. It's no secret that the show is primarily a romantasy series, but the finale doesn't always reflect this.

Those who despised the finale felt that it should have done a better job focusing on the romantic aspects of the series rather than grappling with more philosophical aspects. Many characters also exited in ways that fans felt didn't befit them, and some relationships were never fully elaborated upon or given closure. Of course, not everybody hated the ending to this show, but enough did to be noticeable, which is why it is still commonly debated to this day. 

The True Blood finale unleashed a firestorm of controversy amongst the fanbase for numerous different reasons. The vampire romance show is certainly nothing new or groundbreaking, but many fans of the genre did end up liking it very much. Evidently, it lasted for six years. The conclusion, though, really reached a whole new level of divisiveness in the genre, which nobody could have predicted. Some fans felt satisfied and were able to just move on, but this doesn't mean everyone was able to.

One of the main reasons some hated it was due to character inconsistencies that seemed to come out of nowhere, as well as a perceived decline in the quality of the writing. On top of that, one of the major flaws that people pointed out was that the show lost its sense of excitement and passion, almost like the cast and crew were growing bored by it and no longer felt the love they once had. While this wasn't felt by everyone who watched it, the conclusion was a pretty major event in fan circles for how polarizing it was.

Lost was one of the most revolutionary TV shows of all time, as it served as a hybrid of sci-fi, fantasy, and mystery, and was so much more than it initially appeared to be. The show follows a group of survivors after their plane crashes on an uncharted island. Many of these characters are played by some pretty big names, and all get their own moments to shine as the episodes provide flashbacks that delve into their backstories.

Lost sort of fell off the handle towards the end, but its finale was by far the biggest point of contention amongst its dedicated fans. One of the main reasons that many people disliked it was that many of the mysteries at the core of the show were never answered in a concrete way. But not everybody minded this so much, as some felt it was more fun to work out the answers on your own and develop your own personal theories. However controversial this finale was, the complexity of its story still leaves this series highly rewatchable. 

There's no question that the most divisive series finale in all of fantasy has got to belong to Game of Thrones. It might be appalling to those who hate it, but there are actually people who enjoyed the finale for various reasons. One of the most legendary fantasy TV shows in history, Game of Thrones faced significant backlash in its final season from fans, many of whom felt the show's shortest season was rushed, messy, and sometimes nonsensical.

On the other hand, those who liked the finale were just glad the story got any sort of conclusion at all, because author George R. R. Martin certainly doesn't seem intent on finishing the source material any time soon. While those who liked the finale acknowledge that it does have its flaws and isn't as good as the previous seasons, many felt that it's still comparatively pretty good compared to some of the absolute garbage that can be found on TV. Wherever you stand, there is no denying that this show had a very polarizing finale, perhaps the most polarizing in the entire history of television.

Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.

Check out highlights from Jensen Ackles (Supernatural, The Boys) tearing up the stage during SPN Nashville's Saturday Night Special concert.

Between Prime Video's The Boys: Vought Rising quietly rolling along with production (which is a nice way of saying that not a lot of news is getting out), and Countdown being cancelled (even as fans continue fighting to save it), we thought Jensen Ackles fans might want a little something in their lives that would give them a chance to smile. That's where Creation Entertainment's ""The Road So Far… The Road Ahead"": Creation Nashville comes in, with Ackles taking the stage to join Louden Swain, Mark Sheppard, and Richard Speight Jr. for the Saturday Night Special – and we've got some highlights to pass along.

Here's a look at some great videos that Creation Entertainment and Fangasm posted from this weekend's Saturday Night Special in Nashville:

In September, Ackles was the subject of a profile interview with Variety, which covered a wide range of topics. Regarding Supernatural, Ackles shared how his 15-season run gave him ""the tools"" he needed to move on to roles in The Boys, Countdown, and Big Sky. As for his feelings about being most known for playing Dean Winchester, Ackles makes it clear that he wouldn't change it for anything, opening about about how much the Supernatural family still means to him to this day.

Jensen Ackles Credits ""Supernatural"" For Giving Him ""The Tools"" His Career Needed: ""'Locked-in' is a good word. A lot of it depends on the people involved in the project. 'Supernatural' gave me not just 15 years of a great story to tell and family that I've now come to know and love, but it gave me the tools to continue doing what I'm doing. It also gave me some notoriety so that people like showrunners like Derek or even Elwood Reid, who brought me onto 'Big Sky' and has also brought me onto 'Tracker,' and of course Eric Kripke — it gave me some proof in the pudding that I'm happy to take on whatever kind of challenges these guys throw at me. So I think it was less of, like, 'OK, I have to do this specifically,' and it was more the opportunity to work with people who I admire and trust and know I'm going to have a good time telling a story with, and I've been very fortunate so far.""

Jensen Ackles on Being So Identified with Dean Winchester: ""I've Always Loved It and Embraced It, Always"": ""I've always loved it and embraced it, always. And I've met actors that have had very popular characters on very popular shows or movies, and maybe try to shy away from that, like, 'Oh, I don't want to be known for that.' I mean, there's a reason I did it for 15 years! I love that story. I love that character. I love the people I did it with. I would never shy away from or reject anything that has brought me to this place, because I'm very proud of what we all did on that show, and obviously, I continue to talk about it. We go and do these fan conventions, and it's a gathering around a bunch of people who have a similar affection towards these characters and the show, and I will always be proud of what we did with that.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","'I'm a psychic for the Royal Family","https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/royals/im-psychic-royal-family-text-36176876","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 15:49:00 GMT","

A psychic can offer spiritual guidance, and it appears that members of the Royal Family have often sought the form of a medium, in more ways than one.

June Field, 65, from Dundee, Scotland, is claimed to be the Royal Family's psychic after she was unexpectedly contacted by a royal aide, interested in her work, before the Covid pandemic in 2020. She claims to have three regular royal clients, although she cannot reveal their names, and they even have her on WhatsApp.

When it comes to the service she provides her clients, June says she can connect with a person's essence through the lightest touch or simply by hearing their voice, and can relay messages from deceased loved ones. In addition, she claims she can heal ailments, even in those near death, by tapping into an individual's ""energy"" - a service she has allegedly provided to her royal clients, despite not advertising it.

June revealed to The Sun that she texts her royal clients ""back and forth"" over WhatsApp and visits them at royal residences, although she cannot reveal where. But it hasn't always been easy to stay tight-lipped, as June revealed the time she nearly got herself in trouble with The Firm.

She explained that there was one time she was planning to use a testimonial in regards to her royal clients as part of a video in a TV appearance. She told the publication: ""I asked the Royal Family and they said 'No, we can't do that, no', before an aide reiterated, 'June, don't', and I said, 'Okay'.""

The psychic was also asked when she last saw the royals for a reading, to which she replied: ""This year. For many years before Covid, and I'm still seeing them."" She added that she's ""still seeing"" her three royal clients.

Speaking about these hugely profiled clients, June said: ""They're people. I'm actually the same with them, like with you, or anyone I interact with."" She added that there's ""no ego"" and she does ""what I can to help people"".

It isn't a secret that the Royal Family have used spiritual guidance in the past. Prince Harry reveals in his memoir Spare that he's used a psychic to reach out to his late mother, Princess Diana, who tragically died in 1997 following a car accident, just weeks before his 13th birthday.

The Duke shared that he was fortunate to receive a message from the late Princess of Wales via the psychic, who informed him that he was ""living the life she couldn't"". The psychic allegedly told Harry: ""You're living the life she wanted for you.""

Princess Diana herself was said to have found comfort and guidance from psychic Sally Morgan, reportedly using the method every day for four years, even on Christmas Day. While Prince William and Princess Kate are also said to have received readings, and it was previously claimed that the couple ""endearingly"" follow in ""the spirit of Diana"" by consulting psychics.

""The Royal Family do consult psychics, but I can't say if they see me,"" Sally previously told Daily Mail. ""Absolutely, they see [mediums]. I know it. They see a psychic for the same reasons you and I would.""

The late Queen Elizabeth is thought to have believed in ghosts and followed some unusual superstitions. ""She does believe in ghosts and has several lucky charms in her handbag,"" royal author Phil Dampier revealed before her death.

Further in his memoir Spare, Harry also claims that the unnamed psychic told him his mother was with him ""right now,"" which caused his neck to grow warm and his eyes to water. She went on to say that Diana knew he was ""looking for clarity"" and ""feels your confusion"", adding that she understood he had ""so many questions"" and that answers would come in due course.

Elsewhere in the book, Harry recounts being told that his mother's spirit had observed his son, Prince Archie, breaking a Christmas tree decoration shaped like the late Queen Elizabeth. It was suggested that the psychic questioned Harry about the broken ornament, to which he confessed his son had been trying to mend it.

The medium then claimed that Diana had found amusement in the incident as she watched over her grandson, whom she never had the chance to meet.

She's made a name for herself as psychic to the stars having worked with the likes of George Michael, Michelle Keegan and Princess Diana. 

Yet Sally Morgan revealed she had the tricky task of telling one Hollywood star the upsetting news that her marriage was about to come to an end. 

Sally, 74, worked with Uma Thurman in the Noughties and told Daily Mail: 'As soon as she walked in I thought ""Oh my God, she's about to get rid of her husband. How am I going to tell her this?""

'I told her and she wasn't happy. She didn't like it and I knew I'd never see her again because she didn't like what I said. Then six months later they'd split up.'

Uma, 55, was married to fellow Hollywood heavyweight Ethan Hawke at the time.  

The pair wed in 1998 after meeting on set of the sci-film Gattaca in 1996 and went onto welcome two children together before their marriage fell apart in 2003.

At the time of their split, Ethan, 54, who shares children Maya, 27, and Levon, 23, with Uma was rumoured to have been unfaithful.  

He had been accused of cheating on Uma with their children's nanny Ryan Shawhughes.

The Training Day actor denied the affair but he did begin publicly dating Ryan after he and Uma finalized their divorce in 2005.

Ethan and Ryan went on to marry in 2008 and they are the parents of two daughters: Clementine, 17, and Indiana, 14.

Daily Mail has contacted Uma's representatives for comment.  

Elsewhere in the chat, Psychic Sally revealed her favourite celebrities she's worked with, naming 'sweet' Christine McGuinness, 'funny' Thomas Skinner and 'wonderful' influencer Char Bailey. 

She also explained that she feels a sense of responsibility when it comes to passing on what she sees. 

'When I was a teenager if I saw something around someone that I didn't like, I would ""self-edit"" so it wouldn't be accurate and they'd go, well that never came true,' she shared. 'So very quickly I learned that you can't self-edit'.

She added: 'But there have been occasions when I've been reading for somebody and I think this person is going to have an accident or be attacked and I'll say, ""you should avoid  this or that"".

'But that's all you can say. So not to spook them out, but it gives them a bit of a heads up.'

While Sally has millions of fans there are also many out there who have accused her of being a fraud.  

Yet she pays no attention to critics, as she explained: 'I don't say it's a belief system because I think whether you believe I happen to believe in a God or not, if you don't follow any religion, any denomination, you can still have spirit around you.

'You don't have to believe, it's about trusting.'

Sally also revealed what she believes happens after death, explaining that she considers there to be the earth we're on and then divinity - a divine energy. 

She mused: 'There can be really good, lovely people, but we don't all get to there [divinity]. Some people sort of float between.

'I think that when we die we go to another dimension which is heaven.'

Sally sadly lost her husband John in September 2021 following a short battle with coronavirus and she said it brings her comfort to imagine where his spirit is now. 

'I see it like he's gone to a room which has got everything in there he wanted - his garden, his football and all of that, but he can't get out and I can't get in. 

'But one day, when I die, the door's just going open and I'll get in there with him.

'So I think heaven is full of love and I think that this is hard for us to take on board because we grieve so much.

'We say, ""I know my John would want to be down here with his grandchildren,"" but he's OK where he is because we are all meant to go there. 

'This down here on earth is only not even half of our journey, our spiritual journey.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"

Georgia Republican lawmaker also claims she didn't know Rothschild family, of her ‘space laser' theory, was Jewish

Republican US House member Marjorie Taylor Greene has said she believes in demons, surmising that they might be aliens who fell from heaven, and claims to have been unaware that key figures in the antisemitic space lasers conspiracy she floated were Jewish.

She made those bizarre remarks as a guest on Friday on HBO's Real Time With Bill Maher after winning some fans among Democrats who once loathed her – yet had come to appreciate how the far-right Georgia representative had recently broken with Republicans on various issues. Those include healthcare, Gaza, the federal government shutdown that began on 1 October and the handling of documents pertaining to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was friends with Donald Trump before the latter man won two presidencies.

Greene's appearance on Maher's show perhaps made evident the ideological distance between the congresswoman – who has conspicuously avoided directly criticizing Trump himself – and some of her newer, cross-aisle admirers.

Maher on Friday asked another of his on-air guests, film-maker Dan Farah, to discuss his new documentary, The Age of Disclosure, and how it explores the way some senior US military officials apparently theorize earnestly that “demons” may be responsible for what some colloquially refer to as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs.

The Real Time host, who is generally considered to be left-leaning, subsequently asked those on the show: “Do you think demons and the devil are real?”

Greene, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, confidently answered: “Absolutely. I'm a Bible-believing Christian. And I believe those could be fallen angels.”

As Maher replied: “Fallen angels? The aliens are fallen angels?” Greene continued: “That's possible – I think that's what they could be. That's what makes sense in my worldview.”

The Fifth Column podcast host Michael Moynihan was also participating in the discussion, and Maher called on him to say whether he agreed with Greene. “No,” Moynihan said. “I'm sorry.”

At another point in the show, Maher invited Greene to revisit her infamous 2018 social media screed positing that wildfires that had devastated California were ignited by a laser beam from space under the control of the Rothschild banking dynasty.

The progressive watchdog Media Matters uncovered that post weeks into Greene's first congressional term. And her colleagues at the time voted to remove her from her House committee assignments, with the Rothschild family having repeatedly been subjected to antisemitic conspiracy theories.

Greene on Friday declared to Maher that she initially “didn't even know the Rothschilds were Jewish”.

“Before politics … I [did] not know much of any of this stuff,” Greene said. “I never even said the word ‘Jewish' in the … post.”

Maher pointed out that “‘Rothschild', to a lot of people, is almost synonymous with the word ‘Jewish'”.

Greene replied: “I had no idea … Now I know it's Jewish.”

Amid laughter and applause, Maher retorted: “Right. Well, now we know … That's what I'm here for – to make sure that people in Congress know what the fuck you're talking about.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

Archaeologist Ken Feder sheds light on how archaeology separates evidence from wishful thinking and entertaining storytelling. He explains what rock art, radiocarbon dating, and DNA can really tell us about the first peoples of the Americas, and talks about the different theories about ancient human migration and the impact of European contact on Native American populations. He also shares what we know about Atlantis, the Lost Tribes of Israel, and what to make of Graham Hancock's visions of an ancient apocalypse.

The bodies of two more German mountaineers have been discovered following the avalanche in South Tyrol. Meanwhile, Berlin police arrested a man suspected of planning an attack. DW has more.





Follow below for a roundup of the latest headlines from Germany this weekend, November 1 and November 2:

At least 200 Taylor Swift fans attended a special event at a German museum on Sunday to catch a glimpse of an Art Nouveau painting that possibly inspired ""The Fate of Ophelia"" — the opening track of the US popstar's latest album.

The Wiesbaden Museum has experienced a surge in Swift fans wanting to view the painting of ""Ophelia"" exhibited there, after the release of Swift's new album ""The Life of a Showgirl"" last month,

In the opening scene of the video for ""The Fate of Ophelia,"" Swift takes on the role of Ophelia and becomes a living painting. 

The visitors on Sunday were given a presentation on the history of the painting, dated to around 1900, with a museum employee explaining the links between Shakespeare's character Ophelia in ""Hamlet,"" the artwork and Swift's music video.

The painting depicts a young noblewoman who descends into madness and drowns after being driven to despair after being spurned by Hamlet.

Many of the fans were dressed up as Swift or Ophelia, with the museum having promised free admission to anyone in a costume.

Swifties and museum employees also implored Swift to check out the painting herself, chanting: ""Taylor, come to Wiesbaden!""

Police in Berlin on Saturday arrested a 22-year-old Syrian man suspected of having planned a serious attack that threatened the state, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutors' Office said Sunday.

The spokesperson said the case involved the planning of a jihadi-motivated attack.

Germany's mass-market Bild newspaper reported that material to create explosives was found during a police raid in the capital's Neukölln district.

The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), the German government agency responsible for monitoring animal pestilence, says it does not expect the current bird flu wave in Germany to decline quickly. Officials warn that it is likely that the infection will spread southward.

""We continue to see steadily rising numbers, and there is no sign of the situation calming down,"" FLI President Christa Kühn said. ""On the map of Europe, looking at the cases among wild birds, you can pretty much track the autumn bird migration toward the southwest.""

According to the FLI, the outbreaks are being caused by the highly infectious H5N1 strain of the HPAIV influenza virus — commonly known as bird flu.

More than 500,000 hens, ducks, geese, and turkeys have been preemptively culled and disposed of to contain the spread of the disease in Germany.

German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has spoken of ""nervous optimism"" in the Middle East following talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo.

Steinmeier said people in the region were optimistic that the peace process in Gaza would continue after October's ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

The president said people were also aware of ""the difficulties that still lie ahead, especially in this region.""

Steinmeier began his nearly weeklong trip to Africa with his arrival in Egypt on Saturday. Steinmeier held bilateral talks with Salam on Saturday and with el-Sissi on Sunday.

Ahead of his meeting with the Egyptian President, Steinmeier expressed hopes that the world ""will help to turn the fragile ceasefire into lasting stability.""

He also reaffirmed Germany's commitment to help with the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.

After Egypt, Steinmeier will travel to Ghana and Angola — the first visit by a German head of state to both countries.

The number of asylum applications in Germany continues to decline, a spokesperson for the Interior Ministry told the Evangelical Press Service (epd) on Sunday. 

There were 55% fewer initial asylum applications in October than in the same month of 2024. Moreover, a total of 97,277 initial asylum applications were submitted between January and October 2025. During the same period last year, there were 199,947 initial asylum applications.

""Our migration policy shift is working,"" Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told Bild am Sonntag.

""We are consistently continuing on this path of
migration policy change and are also increasing deportations.""

Since Germany significantly tightened controls at its borders in May, around 18,600 people have been turned away or sent back at the country's borders.

The German government said it had received positive signals from China in the row over semiconductor supplies, which are crucial for Germany's struggling automotive industry.

""The latest reports from China are positive first signs of easing tensions,"" the Economy Ministry in Berlin said on Sunday.

The ministry added that ""the German government is monitoring the situation very closely"" and is in talks with companies, as well as the Netherlands and other EU partners.

Nexperia manufactures its chips in Europe, sends them to China to be finished and re-exports them to European customers.

The Netherlands-based chip manufacturer is facing supply troubles after the Dutch government assumed control of the firm. Previously, the firm was controled by Wingtech, its parent firm in China.

In response to the Dutch takeover, Beijing halted the export of Nexperia products out of China.

Nexperia suspended supplies of wafers to its Chinese assembly plant on Friday, further escalating the dispute.

On Saturday, China's Commerce Ministry said it would review cases and permit exports for firms meeting the relevant requirements, without specifying further details.

Since Ukraine eased travel restrictions to allow men aged 18 to 22 to go abroad, more and more young Ukrainians are applying for temporary protection in Germany.

At the start of October, the central register of foreign nationals recorded nearly 1.3 million individuals who had been granted temporary protection since Russia's war in Ukraine began.

What are their reasons for coming to Germany?

Following the avalanche in South Tyrol, the bodies of two more German mountaineers have been found, bringing the total number of German climbers who lost their lives to five.

Three bodies had already been recovered on Saturday. The last two to be discovered were a father and his 17-year-old daughter, according to the Italian mountain rescue service.

The exact sequence of events is still unclear. However, it is believed that the mountaineers were caught in a snow avalanche on Saturday while ascending 3,500-meter-high (11,482-foot) Vertainspitze, a popular mountaineering destination in the Ortler Alps, shortly before 4:00 p.m.

Two men survived the incident.

According to the mountain rescue service, German climbers were traveling independently in three groups — one group of three and two groups of two.

The survivors were taken to a hospital in Bolzano by helicopter.

President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is traveling to Egypt, Ghana and Angola, accompanied by German business leaders.

The goal is to boost economic partnerships through investment in infrastructure and renewable energy.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said he is is optimistic about the future of the Middle East peace plan following a meeting with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar on Saturday.

Wadephul is in Israel at the end of a Middle East tour which also saw him stop in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrain.

The German foreign minister expressed growing confidence in the peace process ""to such an extent"" that he believed Berlin could revise its travel advice to Israel, which currently advises against all non-essential travel to the country.

Easing the restriction of travel to Israel would help dialogue flow between Israel and Germany once again, Wadephul said.

""This is particularly important to me for the younger generation,"" he said, expressing disappointment that schoolchildren and students in particular were currently not able to travel to Israel.

On the shaky ceasefire in Gaza under a US-sponsored deal, Wadephul shared his ""impression that both sides have the firm will to turn this ceasefire into a lasting process and ultimately conclude peace.""

Earlier on Saturday, during an appearance at the IISS Manama Dialogue security conference in the Bahraini capital, Wadephul called on Israelis, Palestinians, Arabs and Europeans to work towards implementing the peace plan for the region.

""The task now is to give the people here in the Middle East hope by ensuring that political action follows the extensive agreements and declarations of intent,"" the minister said, adding that the region's challenges can only be solved with Europe's cooperation and collaboration.

Some 60 prominent women signed a public letter to Chancellor Friedrich Merz this week, urging him to follow up on his statements expressing concern over the safety of women in German cities.

The signatories call for action and concrete measures to improve the safety of women in Germany.

This comes two weeks after the chancellor said that irregular immigration to Germany had fallen since he took office, adding ""we still have this problem in the cityscape,"" which was understood as a reference to visible diversity in Germany's population. 

This has been called out by critics as racist for implying that immigrant men are more likely to commit sexual harassment or other crimes, a claim not borne out by data.

Five German mountaineers have died in an avalanche in the Italian Alpine region of South Tyrol, the Italian mountain rescue service said on Saturday.

A mountain rescue spokesperson told the German dpa news agency that two people first reported missing had not survived the accident.

The bodies of three victims — two men and one woman — have been recovered.

Mountain rescue officials said the three victims, who were all mountain guides, were aged between 30 and 50 years old. 

The avalanche hit near the Vertainspitze in the Ortler Alps, the rescue service said.

The more than 3,500-meter-high (11,482-foot) Vertainspitze is a popular mountaineering destination.  ","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

The Pentagon is preparing for a war with Nigeria after Donald Trump threatened to send in the military “guns-a-blazing” if the country does not stem the killing of Christians.

The US president said on Saturday that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack just days after warning that Christianity was “facing an existential threat in Nigeria” by Islamic extremists.

“If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Mr Trump said on Truth Social.

“I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians.”

The Nigerian government vehemently rejects the claims, and analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria's Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

On Friday, Mr Trump announced that he would designate Nigeria “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some US lawmakers.

The designation could lead to sanctions and include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid.

Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, shared Mr Trump's post and wrote on social media: “Yes, sir.”

“The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Mr Hegseth said.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and a largely Christian south.

The country is consumed by security issues. Its northeastern region is at the epicentre of a Boko Haram jihadist insurgency, which has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced more than two million since 2009, according to the United Nations.

In central Nigeria, majority-Muslim herders have repeatedly clashed with majority-Christian farmers. The conflict is frequently portrayed as inter-religious but generally stems from competition over land access.

Christianity has played a central role in Mr Trump's campaign to return to office and was fundamental in securing a large and reliable voting bloc among white evangelical and conservative Christians.

Conservative politicians in the US have fuelled the accusations and called for intervention.

Last month, Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, and Riley Moore, congressman for West Virginia, accused the Nigerian government of turning a blind eye to the “mass murder” of Christians.

Claims of Christian persecution have also been pushed by some in Nigeria, where ethnic, religious and regional divisions have flared with deadly consequences in the past and still shape the country's modern politics.

“The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,” Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria's president, said on social media on Saturday.

“Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so,” Mr Tinubu added.

On Sunday, Nigeria said it would welcome the US help in fighting Islamist insurgents as long as its territorial integrity is respected.

“We welcome US assistance as long as it recognises our territorial integrity,” said Daniel Bwala, an adviser to the Nigerian president.

The increased focus on the African nation is part of a wider shift in America's foreign policy, which seeks to redraw the Western sphere of influence. The overall plan has been dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, and its aim, in part, is to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence.

Beijing had deep trade and resource-extraction ties across Africa and Nigeria is part of that ecosystem. Nigeria holds vast reserves of rare earth elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are vital to consumer electronics and the American tech industry.

The doctrine also extends to Latin America. In Venezuela, military strikes on drug-smuggling vessels have been framed as a national security threat and the need to revive American dominance in the region.  

Dozens of alleged cartel members have been killed in targeting strikes on small boats in the Caribbean since early September in a renewed war on drugs. Whether for show, or as part of a wider doctrine closing in on Latin America, the attacks remain controversial among legal scholars and some of the countries in America's “backyard”.

The Justice Department told Congress this week that Mr Trump could lawfully continue his lethal strikes and that the 60-day limit on congressionally unauthorised deployments into “hostilities” does not apply in this operation.

Voters set to accept new maps to help Democrats counter Republican gerrymandering – and check president's power

California's Proposition 50 began as a warning from the nation's largest blue state to its largest red one: don't poke the bear. But when Texas moved ahead with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat.

Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, who have cast it as a chance to check Trump's power.

“California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country's democracy before our very eyes,” Newsom said at a rally, formally announcing the initiative, known as the Election Rigging Response Act.

Proposition 50 asks voters to temporarily scrap the state's independently-drawn congressional district lines in favor of new maps carved up to help Democrats win five additional safe seats – a tit-for-tat response to Texas, where Republicans secured five new, friendlier districts earlier this year.

Voting has been underway for weeks in the Golden State. As of Saturday, nearly 6m ballots had been returned, about one in four of the total mailed out, according to Political Data Inc, a firm that tracks voter data. Voting ends on Tuesday, 4 November.

Early returns and polling suggest the ballot measure is on track for a comfortable victory. Though it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election, several recent surveys showed it passing by more than 20 points.

The focus on Trump has galavanized Democrats in the deep-blue state, averting what some initially feared: an esoteric debate about the political minutiae of redistricting, a process that until just a few months ago typically took place at the start of each decade.

National Democrats lined up behind California's retaliatory plan. Their closing ad features Barack Obama, Newsom, and prominent congressional Democrats – including New York House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – telling voters they have the power to “stand up to Donald Trump”.

“Democrats have won the messaging war in California because they've successfully framed it as an anti-Trump campaign,” said Dave Wasserman, the senior elections analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “Republicans just did not cobble together the resources or the momentum to stop it.”

Opponents of the effort initially promised a formidable fight, but their campaigns were vastly outraised and support from national Republicans never materialized. In the final weeks, Republicans had largely retreated from the airwaves.

California Republicans focused part of their attack on Newsom, denouncing the plan as a “Gavinmander” designed to help the term-limited governor build a national profile and donor base ahead of a likely 2028 presidential run. Millions of conservative voters in the state will be disenfranchised, they've warned, appealing to the fairness of the independent redistricting commission's current work.

California representative Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose district would be redrawn under the new maps, has called for a nationwide ban on mid-decade redistricting. The proposal has not gained traction.

“What Newsom is trying to do here is to entrench even more power in the hands of a corrupt political class that has caused California to go from being the most beautiful state in the country to being the most popular state to leave,” Kiley said in an interview this week on Fox Business Network.

Republicans hold just nine of the state's 52 House seats. If successful, the gerrymander could slash the number of Republicans California sends to Washington by more than half.

Former California Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Trump critic who championed the commission's creation, harshly criticized Proposition 50. And Charles Munger, the wealthy Republican donor and longtime supporter of independent redistricting, poured more than $30m into the effort to stop California from “returning to the evils of partisan gerrymandering”.

Amid the immigration raids and the federal takeover of US cities, California voters were more concerned with the stopping the Trump administration than saving their fair maps, said Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist advising Munger's opposition group, the Protect Voters First committee. Madrid suspected that most people who voted for Proposition 50 hadn't even bothered to study the new districts.

“It has nothing to do with redistricting,” he said. “This is about sending a message to Donald Trump.”

National good governance groups such as Common Cause, which has historically fought partisan redistricting, opted to stay neutral on California's gerrymander.

“The question was, are we going to unilaterally disarm one side?” said Virginia Kase Solomón, the CEO and president of Common Cause. Instead, the group developed a six-point “fairness” criteria, an effort to put “guardrails” on the process, which she said were reflected in the California measure.

The view that politicians should not draw their own districts remains popular in California. Trump, however, is not. Nearly two in three voters agree that the president treats California “worse” than other states, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey. Among those voting for the measure, 75% said opposition to Trump was a factor in their decision.

“It brings me no joy to see the maps that the commission drew being pushed aside,” said Sara Sadhwani, a professor of politics at Pomona College who served as one of the mapmaking panel's Democratic members in 2020. “However, I do believe that in this moment, there is a greater fight that we have to wage in order to ensure a level playing field across the nation for the 2026 election.”

Sadhwani appeared in one of the yes campaign's first ads, in which she warned: “Donald Trump's scheme to rig the next election is an emergency for our democracy”.

Though Trump is at the center of the yes campaign, he was unusually muted on the ballot measure itself. Last month, he weighed in on Truth Social to preemptively discredit, without evidence, the “totally dishonest” results of Tuesday's election.

The Trump administration announced that it was deploying federal election monitors to New Jersey and California to watch the vote. In response, Newsom accused Trump of attempting to “suppress the vote” while the Democratic attorney general, Rob Bonta, said the state would dispatch its own observers to watch the federal monitors.

Heading into election day, Democrats' confidence has given the campaign an air of inevitability – so much so that Newsom, to the surprise and delight of supporters, took the unconventional step of telling them last week: “You can stop donating now.”

But the yes campaign say it is taking nothing for granted. Newsom spent the final weekend before Tuesday's special election traveling “up and down” the state, his team said, as tens of thousands of volunteers knocked doors and sent text messages reminding voters to return their ballots. “This election is not over,” the governor cautioned.

Meanwhile, in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Newsom made it a point to say he was “deeply confident” that California voters would approve Proposition 50 – and said Trump was “changing the rules” and Democrats had to adapt.

“We want to go back to some semblance of normalcy, but you have to deal with the crisis at hand,” he said.

In the national redistricting arms race, California remains the farthest along of any Democrat-led state to retaliate. Wasserman estimates that passage of the California ballot initiative would probably improve Democrats' chances of winning the House majority next year by between 10% and 15%. But, with Trump having pushed Republican-led states such as Missouri and North Carolina to approve new maps and others poised to follow suit, he noted: “The problem for Democrats nationally is that they don't have enough Californias.”

As the gerrymander war escalates, supporters outside the Golden State are pleading with Californians to, in the words of their governor, “fight fire with fire”.

“We're depending on California to help a friend out, to help us out as a country,” said Texas state representative Nicole Collier, who fled the state with roughly two dozen of her Democratic colleagues to prevent a vote on the Republican gerrymander there. “The future direction of this country hangs in the balance.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Trey Yesavage celebrate after a double play in Game 7. Toronto lost to Los Angeles, but Mark Kingwell writes that some moments from the game represent the Blue Jays at their best.Kevin Sousa/Reuters

Mark Kingwell is a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto and the author of Fail Better: Why Baseball Matters.

Baseball is not a religion but it sure feels like one sometimes. The rituals, the costumes, the incantations. The narratives of sacrifice and redemption. The slow deaths and joyful resurrections. Above all, the return of days, the year-guiding calendar of spring training, regular season, and post-season.

Game 7 of the 2025 World Series was peak baseball on the Feast of All Saints. The day after – All Souls' Day by the traditional Christian calendar – is when we honour the departed, especially those in Purgatory. Together these two festivals make up Dia de los Muertos, the Day of the Dead. Let's agree, in an ecumenical spirit, that this combined observance of joy and mourning now embraces all Blue Jays fans, regardless of what other belief systems they may honour.

Nobody has to tell us anything more about the agony of defeat, the dashed hopes of a solo shot that breaks an extra-inning tie, the stranded runners, the broken-bat double-play that will live in jagged memory. We all saw the post-game tears and disappointed thousand-yard-stares of this so very likeable team, this cheerful band of brothers. A solitary Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the dugout will join, for some of us, Pafko at the wall as an enduring image of baseball's infinite capacity for pain.

Dodgers clinch World Series after 5-4 win over Blue Jays

Blue Jays mourn the World Series win that slipped away

The game, and the series, were objectively epic for all the reasons historians will record. Record-setting post-season hits, complete games, marathon extra innings, multiple future Hall of Famers on both benches, the two-decade range between two of our starting pitchers, a bench-clearing almost something – the list of superlatives goes on. We can tell ourselves the simple truth: we have witnessed one of the best baseball series in the entire span of the game.

Blue Jays reflect on the team's loss to Los Angeles in Game 7 of the World Series. It's the closest the team has come to winning the championship in more than 30 years.

The Canadian Press

But baseball is made of more than records and stats, much as they feature prominently in the narrative of the sport. Like most fans, for me it is singular images that will stay in the mind, forever cementing this magic season and series, the last one before robo-camera challenges and other threats to the crooked timber of the game's humanity.

So: Just from Game 7 I will cherish a few freeze-frames of my favourite players at their winning best, even if ultimately they lost. Bo Bichette's grim hit-man satisfaction after hitting a three-run homer, dropping his bat contemptuously like a discarded McMillan TAC-50 rifle. Guerrero's open-mouthed glee as he bolted for the dugout after turning that perfect 3-6-3 double play. Ernie Clement's joyful, surely unnecessary playground slide into home after throwing off his batting helmet in a pure dash around third, looking around like a happy 12-year-old to see who's watching.

That would be everybody. Because this was, above all else, an eminently watchable team, fun to follow, brimming with love of the game. I'm biased, I know, but they were so much more charming than the po-faced Dodgers, those dour, greedy seekers after a repeat title. The Jays had rizz, as the kids say; or, to use a more old-fashioned word, style. They were resilient, courageous, buzzy, and creative. They made things happen, sometimes by conjuring something out of nothing, as great players can.

Baseball is not an art form any more than it's religion, but these Jays played it like they were artists, every one of them, with an expansive play of imagination and collective exercise of their talents. Those different body types, my lord. (Like it or not, the super-slo-mo replay of Alejandro Kirk's awesome swing will take up semi-permanent residence in my mental theatre.) Our injury-battered heroes grimacing and limping their way to still more hits and runs. The diving catches and jaw-dropping splitters over the plate. The ups and the downs.

Cathal Kelly: Congrats on the loss, Toronto. It was a masterpiece

Now we deal with the loss of all that, the harsh, unforgiving logic of what might have been. It's a game of inches, they say, of missed chances and almost-there sallies. Consider that toe-tap at home plate, or the almost collision of Dodgers in centre field, the hanging curveball tagged for a homer – these are all the little things that make the big difference. Of course they are.

Now November continues its bleak course into winter. But we have a duty to take the joy as and where we can. We must fold this series into all the other memories of this team, this improbable season, this sport that is made of memory.

Jays fans say thank you to the Blue Jays players and they expect the team to be back in the World Series in 2026.

I attended my first Blue Jays game in 1978, driving in from Mississauga with my uncle in his old Chevy Monte Carlo, parking in somebody's yard for five dollars, and walking over to Exhibition Stadium – the Mistake by the Lake – to buy actual paper tickets from a human being at a kiosk. From that day to this, like so many other fans, baseball has sustained me.

This is a hard moment, fellow believers, but we are blessed to be here for it. And we all know that there's always next year – because that's how years work.

Mud Australia opened its first Canadian outpost inside Toronto's high-end homeware store Hopson Grace in mid-October.Mud Australia

Shelley Simpson has always believed that beauty belongs in the small moments of daily life. “I make objects that I would want to live with, and use, every day,” says the founder of Mud Australia, a 31-year-old company that has quietly redefined what handmade porcelain can be.

Now, Canadians can bring that same sense of everyday elegance into their own homes.

In mid-October, Mud opened its first Canadian outpost: a 200-square-foot “shop-in-shop” inside Toronto's high-end homeware store Hopson Grace. The installation showcases a collection that has captivated design lovers and collectors around the world, from everyday aesthetes to A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, chef David Chang and French designer Philippe Starck.

All are drawn to Mud's organic, sensual pieces – handmade from Limoges porcelain imported from France – which are designed to move gracefully from oven to table.

Mud Australia

For Hopson Grace co-founders Martha Grace McKimm and Andrea Hopson, the expansion felt inevitable. “There's a real love for Mud here in Canada,” says McKimm, who began carrying a small selection of the brand's collection in 2018. “People adore how the pieces mix and match. They like the smooth, glazed interiors, the soft matte exteriors that change over time, and the colours that interact so beautifully.”

After visiting Mud's Islington store in London, McKimm knew she wanted to bring the full experience to Toronto. “It was a visual and sensual feast,” she says. “We wanted to recreate that, to give Canadians the chance to see most of the collection and choose from the full range of colours.”

Mud's palette includes 19 signature hues with names such as Dust, Mist, Milk and Blossom (a favourite of Paltrow's). The soft neutrals, combined with more robust shades such as plum, citrus and slate, have helped the brand stand apart in a crowded tableware marketplace.

“The versatility allows people to put their own stamp on their Mud collection,” says McKimm.

Mud Australia

Today, Mud has grown into one of Australia's most successful craft-based businesses, with 14 stores throughout Australia, London, New York, Los Angeles and now, Toronto.

The brand's Canadian debut marks the latest step in a three-decade-long journey that began when Simpson decided to try tossing clay on a potter's wheel in a friend's backyard in Sydney. She had no idea what she was doing, but she loved working with her hands. “I fell in love with the process and the way it makes me feel,” says Simpson.

Mud Australia

“When you're making things, you release endorphins, whether you're cooking or designing a beautiful piece. Designing and making beautiful objects makes me happy. I have the resting heart rate of an elite athlete, and I'm not that at all.”

Simpson launched Mud in 1994, and started small, making minimalist bowls, plates and cups. She slowly added more pieces, each inspired by her own life. 

Simpson loves to bake, so she designed pie plates and flan dishes. She's a tea drinker, so Mud crafted teapots and cups. And when she and her husband needed lighting during a renovation, she designed a pendant light to hang over the kitchen table. Mud now offers ceiling fixtures in various shapes and sizes, as well as table lamps.

That personal touch – designing around real-life needs – defines Mud's appeal. “I'm always inspired by how people live with things,” Simpson says. “Pieces should be used, loved and reached for without thinking.”

Mud Australia

Mud's success, she adds, also comes from restraint. “We try not to over-complicate things. A new colour, a small tweak and new product profile – that's often all it takes.” 

It's that careful curation that keeps fans loyal. And Simpson loves to meet her customers, such as a man in New York who came in after each paycheque to buy one piece. “It was always a different colour. We found out he had an arranged marriage, and his wife was coming. He told us he wanted to fill the cupboard with colour.”

Simpson says when someone tells her that Mud makes a difference in their day, it fills her up.

“What I do isn't important – doctors and nurses do important things. But if setting a table with Mud, or serving a roast in one of our dishes makes someone happy, then I know I've done something worthwhile.”

Protesters arrived in Serbia's second city to mark the first anniversary of the roof collapse that killed 16. The government hastily declared a day of mourning while President Vucic issued a rare apology.

People from across Serbia gathered in Novi Sad on Saturday to observe the first year anniversary of the tragic collapse of a railway station roof that killed 16 people.

Tens of thousands of Serbians gathered in silence in downtown Novi Sad at 11:52 a.m. (1052 GMT), at the exact moment the roof collapsed last year. They held 16 minutes of silence for the collapse's 16 victims.

The incident has sparked the largest protest movement in Serbia's modern history, as the student-led protests blame the collapse on state corruption.

Protesters have called for those responsible to be held accountable and early elections that they hope would see President Aleksandar Vucic gone.

While several officials have been indicted on charges of endangering public safety and the prime minister has resigned amid the protest, no court has confirmed the indictment, with Vucic defiantly still in power.

Serbians have been congregating from different corners of the country ahead of the anniversary, some in marches that have symbolically lasted for 16 days. Protesters were met with cheers by the residents of Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, on Friday evening.

On Friday, authorities canceled train services to Novi Sad, saying there was a bomb threat. Protesters defied authorities, making their way in cars, on bicycles and some even on foot.

""This is a major tragedy for the Serbian people. We cannot bring those people back but we can feel the pain with their families and say that this is enough,"" Sladjana Burmaz, a 51-year-old economist from the central town of Valjevo told the Reuters news agency.

Protesters held carved out hearts with the names of the victims.

Dijana Hrka, the mother of one of the victims, laid flowers under her son's name on a fence outside the station. She announced her intention to launch a hunger strike in Belgrade on Sunday.

The mother stressed she ""must know who killed my child. Someone must be held accountable for this,"" according to the Associated Press news agency.

The yearlong protests have been met with force from the authorities, often breaking up protests using batons and tear gas and rounding up protesters. Vucic has accused the protesters of being foreign agents trying to topple the ruling authorities.

However, on Friday, he issued a rare apology in a televised address.

 ""I have said some things that I am now sorry for saying,"" Vucic said, calling for dialogue. ""All that hatred boiling in our society cannot bring any good. It can only lead to further destruction.""

Authorities hastily declared Saturday a day of mourning, and Vucic attended a commemoration ceremony in the capital, Belgrade.

Some protesters have rejected the president's apology, stressing that their calls for early elections still stand.

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos posted on X that the ""tragedy is changing Serbia"".

""It moved masses to stand for accountability, free expression and inclusive democracy,"" she wrote. ""They are the same values to lead Serbia into the EU.""

Serbia has been on a long and unfruitful journey to join the 27-member bloc, with Vucic's close ties to Russia and China and his authoritarian tactics among the most glaring roadblocks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Democrats are winning the shutdown politics. Can they stop now?","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/politics/democrats-shutdown-politics","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:00:01 GMT","


            After the 2013 government shutdown ended, Republican leaders made clear they had only been humoring Sen. Ted Cruz and his plot to defund Obamacare.
    


            “It was not a smart play. It had no chance of success,” then-Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said.
    


            Then-House Speaker John Boehner initially said the GOP had “fought the good fight.” But he would later say the plan “never had a chance” and even called the Texas senator “Lucifer in the flesh.”
    


            This is how shutdowns generally go. The side seeking a concession fights what they view as “the good fight,” and then they give up when it becomes clear that it's also a losing fight. Because, as McConnell has often said, shutdowns don't work.
    


            And maybe that's how Democrats thought this one would go down. House Speaker Mike Johnson basically predicted as much Saturday, wagering Democrats might back down after Tuesday's elections.
    


            But a full month into the shutdown, it's hard to see how Democrats can give up now. The politics of this have gone surprisingly well for them. And Republicans seem to be the ones struggling for a path forward.
    


            Much can change as some of the biggest impacts of the shutdown start to hit this weekend and in the coming weeks. But we're in a very different kind of shutdown this time — one where it's much tougher to see the politics forming an obvious off-ramp.
    


            The polling on blame has been remarkably constant since before the shutdown began. People continue to blame President Donald Trump and the Republicans more than Democrats by double-digit margins in most surveys. That margin was 45%-33% in a Washington Post-ABC News poll released Thursday.
    


            A Yahoo News-YouGov poll, meanwhile, showed 46% said they blamed “conservative Republicans” a lot for the shutdown — more than the 38% who blamed “progressive Democrats” that much.
    


            Surveys also continue to show that Democrats' policy demand, an extension of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies, remains popular with more than 7 in 10 Americans.
    


            That Yahoo survey also suggested a problem for Republicans that we haven't seen tested in previous polling.
    


            It showed Americans said by a nearly 3-to-1 margin — 63%-21% — that they disapproved of the firings of thousands of federal workers during the shutdown.
    


            This was, of course, Trump's big threat to Democrats. He made a big show of casting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as the grim reaper ready to target Democratic employees and programs for cuts — even as some Republicans cautioned the White House that such cuts could squander the GOP's political advantages. Then the administration followed through.
    


            But it  doesn't seem to have dissuaded Democrats from pressing forward. And there's now reason to believe those Republicans had a point about these cuts backfiring on the administration.
    


            Indeed, much of the GOP's handling of this seems rather haphazard. And Friday was a case in point.
    


            The day started with Republicans dealing with a curveball from Trump, who decided late Thursday to suddenly urge them to nuke the filibuster to end the shutdown. This completely impractical idea also legitimized a key Democratic talking point — that Republicans could end the shutdown any time they want.
    


            Then Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made a few seemingly unhelpful comments about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, also known as food stamps.
    


            She at one point said that if people really needed them that badly, then “we have failed you.” House Speaker Mike Johnson soon stepped in to clarify that the “we” somehow meant, “we, the Democrats.” (Neither Rollins nor Johnson is, in fact, a Democrat.)
    


            Separately, Rollins was noncommittal when asked whether the administration would abide by a judge's order for it to release emergency SNAP funds, saying, “We're looking at all the options.”
    


            It was a stunning response — not just because ignoring court orders could trigger a constitutional crisis, but also because it would mean the administration would be taking such a drastic step to prevent poor people from getting food.
    


            A pair of federal judges soon ordered the administration to release the emergency funds to at least partially cover food stamp benefits. But ahead of the rulings, Republicans did a great job making themselves out to be opposed to this — and even ready to fight against it. (Trump on Friday night ultimately indicated he would do what he could to fund SNAP.)
    


            Another major factor here is what the shutdown could do for Democrats. It's early, but there is evidence this has led to something of a badly needed rallying effect on the left.
    


            The reason the Democratic Party has seen some of its worst poll numbers in history this year is largely because Democrats themselves have lost faith in their party. But a Quinnipiac University poll last week showed 58% of Democratic voters suddenly approved of their party's congressional contingent.
    


            That's still not great. But it is up nearly 20 points from where it was between February and July, when that number hovered around 40%.
    


            Democrats would seem to have relatively little reason to back down — and plenty of reason to stick with their demands that Republicans come to the table on extending the enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Imagine a situation in which they have these seeming political advantages and they throw in the towel anyways. It's not difficult to see that reigniting a backlash on the left.
    


            And in case that danger wasn't clear, witness a newly released Pew Research Center poll. It asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who expressed frustration with the party what the main reason for that was. Far and away, the most-cited reason was not fighting hard enough against the Trump administration, which 41% cited.
    


            If you're a Democrat, it's hard to look at all of that and not want to at least let things play out. You might think the premium increases that people are seeing on their Obamacare plans after open enrollment began Saturday could shift the politics even more in your favor. And maybe you've got a little more confidence in how the SNAP issue is going to play.
    


            You might even start to think that, at the end of this long journey, there could be something more valuable than a moral victory.

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.

“I feel like I'm living in scary times. It's not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn't too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74.

Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.

With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.

The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

“The impact, even if it's temporary, on many of the nation's poor families is going to be profound if we don't solve this problem,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.

“These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can't point to a similar time in recent history where we've had this.” 

LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.

States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data. 

While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet. 

Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown. 

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.

Minnesota's energy assistance program is processing applications but the state's Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients' heating bills until the shutdown ends.

“As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.

Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves. 

“The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government.

“Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration's earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program.

Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states' program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available.

“Once you've fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said.

Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.

Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.

“If you're a heating oil dealer, we can't tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you'll get your money back,'” Wolfe said.

Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago.

“I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.”

He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.

Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year.

“I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said.

""I've known Bob since we started here and he had an extraordinary career as both a player and a broadcaster,"" Bengals team president Mike Brown said in a statement. ""He was an exceptional and rare tight end who could get downfield and split zone coverages. Speed was his hallmark. He was as fast as any wide receiver and was a deep threat. That was rare for a tight end then and it's rare now.

""As a broadcaster, he made his mark both locally and nationally, and excelled at sports other than football in a career that was as successful as what he accomplished on the field. He did it all very well and I regret his passing.""

Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) said Democrats need to “own” the government shutdown as the impasse has now stretched over a month.

Fetterman, one of the few in his party who has broken with Democrats and voted to reopen the government, was asked about the shutdown during a Sunday morning appearance on CNN's State of the Union. He said it is “deeply distressing” that 42 million people are losing food stamp benefits.

“And now that's one of the big reasons why I refuse to shutting our government down,” he said. “And again, I feel like the Democrats really need to own the shutdown. I mean, we're shutting it down.”

JEFFRIES DISMISSES NYC MAYORAL FRONT-RUNNER MAMDANI AS ‘FUTURE' OF DEMOCRATIC PARTY

The Senate needs a 60-vote majority of lawmakers to reopen the government, and Democrats have dug their heels in and are demanding the reinstatement of expiring Obamacare subsidies. They are hoping to use the opportunity as leverage to get concessions from the GOP.

Fetterman pointed out that he understood Democrats want to address the expiring tax credits, something he supports, but said he refuses to put 42 million people into “food insecurity.”

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits were put in jeopardy due to the shutdown. The Nov. 1 deadline passed, meaning those benefits didn't go out, although two judges have ruled that the Trump administration will have to tap into a $5 billion emergency fund to make up for that pause. Still, that $5 billion isn't enough to cover a full month of SNAP benefits.

SNAP FUNDS PAUSE COULD BE PAINFUL HIT TO GROCERS

Fetterman said that the government should be reopened in order to help federal workers, many of whom have gone without pay for over a month, as well as SNAP beneficiaries.

“These are the kinds of people — why I'm a Democrat, fighting for people just like that,” Fetterman said. “Now it seems like we're moving against our core values to keep our government shut down at this point, as now we're approaching now 33 days.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Antifa agitators are posting a hit list around Portland targeting reporters documenting the violent uprisings against Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

A physical flyer appearing on telephone poles across the city shows wanted-style photographs of investigative journalists, right-wing media figures, and live streamers who have all recently reported on the anti-ICE violence in South Portland.

“Far-Right ‘Content Creators' [Be On The Lookout],” the flyer is titled, accompanied by the reporters' ages, screen names, and whether they attended this month's White House roundtable on antifa.

Separately, breakout visuals of individual targets show their “threat level,” such as one coded red, accusing the Post Millennial‘s Andy Ngo of being “transphobic, bigot[ed], racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, ultra-far right.”

The graphics were created by a transgender “nonbinary” activist and artist known as “Hexcastly” on social media. Antifa accounts are also circulating digital versions of the flyers via Bluesky, Facebook, and X.

Among those named are Turning Point USA's Frontlines correspondent Jonathan Choe and independent journalist Chelly Bouferrache, also known as “HoneyBadgerMom,” who have both been assaulted by antifa's forces while covering antifa activity.

“There is a pattern of targeting journalists by the far Left, and it is not isolated to myself,” Bouferrache told the Washington Examiner. “I hope that the [Trump] administration is aware of this. This is a First Amendment issue. Following and supporting local and independent journalists helps significantly.”

Since she started covering the occupation-style protests against ICE this summer, Bouferrache has been the victim of vile insults, harassment, menacing, several assaults, and doxxing, the public posting of private information.

Although she lives 90 miles from Portland in a remote area, Bouferrache said someone left four caltrops, which are spiked weapons, in her driveway last week, a significant escalation.

“This, along with these ‘hitlists,' tells me I am doing something right and am directly over the target,” Bouferrache said.

My truck had a flat tire this afternoon. This is what was stuck in it. Another one of these is what flattened my SUV tire. Two of these were not randomly in my driveway. Anyone know anything about these? pic.twitter.com/NFrQy5zsQe

In the face of political violence, Bouferrache is undeterred.

“I will not stop; I will not be bullied or threatened into stopping my coverage,” she said.

Bouferrache pointed to two other hit lists she has appeared on this year alone.

In September, self-described provocateur Alex Randall posted a now-deleted YouTube video naming Bouferrache, Choe, and many of the same journalists targeted by the Portland flyers as threats that antifa activists should “BEWARE” of, accompanied by images of them. In mid-October, the Seattle Anarchist Book Fair hung printed pictures on a wall of riot reporters, including Bouferrache and Choe, along with their locations.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner, Choe said this, too, is not the first time he has found himself on a hit list.

“When I first saw that floating around,” Choe, a freelance reporter bouncing between riot-torn cities, said of the main Portland flyer. “I actually kind of laughed, because this is now like the seventh hit list I've been on in the past three months. Whether it's Seattle or Portland, it seems like my face is everywhere now, and it's due to the coverage that I've been doing now for the past five years of far-left activism, especially antifa violence.”

Choe said the posters are meant to send a message, both as a threat to the identified targets and a call to action among antifa's followers, serving as an informative tool for so-called comrades.

TPUSA STUDENT LEADER ATTACKED AFTER ANTIFA PUT OUT HIT ON ‘NAZI ACTIVIST'

“I think the message is, ‘Hey, we're watching. We know who you are. You better watch your back. We have eyes on you at the same time.' It is also for informational purposes, because there's still people who don't know who I am,” Choe said.

Choe is primarily known in Seattle, where he conducts the majority of his reporting. Though not a regular reporter in the Portland market, Choe will “parachute in” when antifa announces plans for riotous violence.

However, antifa's latest alert tactic may already be working. A few months ago, Portland antifa, for the most part, had no idea who he was. But in an incident over the weekend, one antifa operative immediately recognized him and called out his name.

“They know who I am now, and I think that flyer had something to do with it,” Choe said.

On Oct. 8, the Trump White House hosted an antifa roundtable with a dozen or so journalists, half of whom had ties to the Pacific Northwest, a hotbed for antifa organizing.

Choe, who was one of the White House panelists invited to brief President Donald Trump on antifa, said when antifa saw that televised intelligence-gathering event, many members of the far-left movement grew concerned.

“Wow, these are the guys who actually are on the front lines exposing us. They're now at the White House, and they have the ear of the president,” Choe said.

Sources told the Washington Examiner that FBI agents reached out over the phone and in person to several participants who were seated at the White House roundtable.

The federal investigators asked about antifa's organizational structure, specifically known ringleaders, funding sources, and specific cells operating in the United States, sources said.

“We put a huge light on the anarchy Rose City Antifa was getting away with to the point President Trump had the Portland roundtable,” said Conservative Caucus national field director Chad Caton, another face on the Portland flyer. “Afterwards, they did the poster as a BOLO, but let's call it what it was. It's a hit list.”

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) started November quietly, holding steady near $110,350 after a flat 24 hours. The Bitcoin price chart still points to a possible reversal as the pattern remains intact — a structure that usually signals a major upward shift.

But despite that, BTC has failed to break out. On-chain data explains what's keeping the move stuck and what could finally change it.

Bitcoin's cost basis distribution heatmap — a chart showing where investors last bought their coins — highlights why BTC keeps struggling near current levels.

Between $110,000 and $112,500, there's a heavy supply zone where about 434,000 BTC were last accumulated. These dense clusters often act as resistance, as many traders who bought at these levels look to sell when prices revisit their cost basis.

The heatmap helps identify where big pockets of holder activity are concentrated, showing which price levels act as support or resistance.

This particular supply wall between $110,000 and $112,500 has been capping BTC's rally attempts for a week. In the price chart — which we'll come to later — the same level also aligns with an important technical marker, reinforcing the validity of this range.

Until Bitcoin closes firmly above $112,500, the reversal pattern remains valid but paused, waiting for a clear catalyst.

Whales may be the ones bringing that catalyst. On-chain data indicates that large wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC are resuming accumulation.

The 30-day whale address count change has turned positive (+6) for the first time since August 31, suggesting accumulation has resumed after months of dormancy.

Meanwhile, the total number of whale addresses dipped to a three-month low on October 27 but has been climbing since, now sitting around the same level last seen on October 3.

This increase shows renewed confidence from big players, a trend that often appears before price breakouts. The dashboard tracking these wallets also includes exchange, ETF, and custodian addresses, giving a broad view of institutional activity.

If this steady rise continues, it could help BTC absorb the selling pressure around $112,500, setting the stage for a potential breakout.

Technically, Bitcoin still trades inside a clear inverse head and shoulders formation. A daily close above $116,400 would confirm the breakout, paving the way for targets at $122,000, $125,900, and $130,800.

Adding to this bullish setup, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) — a tool that measures buying and selling strength — shows a bullish divergence.

Between October 22 and October 30, Bitcoin's price made lower lows while RSI made higher lows. This move often signals a trend reversal and the start of upward momentum.

Please note that on the BTC price chart, $112,590 is the key resistance level. This level validates the breakout-stalling theory pushed forth by the cost basis heatmap. For BTC, this $112,500-$112,590 zone might be the most crucial one in the near-term.

However, if Bitcoin breaks below $106,200, the breakout structure that remains intact may begin to lose shape. A further drop under $103,500 would invalidate the entire bullish pattern, confirming that sellers have regained full control.

Oops, something went wrong

Robert Kiyosaki has once again advocated for Bitcoin and Ethereum as potential safeguards against an impending significant financial crash.

Kiyosaki foresees a worldwide economic downturn in November. He shared these thoughts on his X account on Sunday.

Kiyosaki cautioned that the crash could obliterate millions of investors, especially those with investments in traditional assets such as stocks or bank savings. He proposed that silver, gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum could act as defensive investments during the crash.

MASSIVE CRASH BEGININING: Millions will be wiped out. Protect yourself. Silver, gold, Bitcoin, Ethereum investors will protect you. Take care

Kiyosaki has shown support for digital assets in the past. Last October, he questioned the traditional 60/40 investment rule that favors stocks and bonds, advocating for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) as better long-term alternatives.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum were trading higher by 0.24% and 1.14%, respectively. Bitcoin was priced at $110,081.79, while Ethereum stands at $3,876.06.

Kiyosaki's endorsement of Bitcoin and Ethereum as potential safe havens during a financial crash underscores the growing recognition of digital assets as viable investment alternatives.

His critique of the traditional 60/40 investment rule further emphasizes the shifting investment landscape, with digital assets increasingly being viewed as superior long-term alternatives.

This shift in perspective could potentially influence a broader acceptance and adoption of digital currencies, even as traditional markets face uncertainty.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Can blockchain tame AI's IP problem?","https://cryptoslate.com/can-blockchain-tame-ais-ip-problem/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

Camp Network aims to solidify on-chain provenance and ensure creators receive royalties for AI's use of their registered content.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

The following is a guest post and opinion from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist.

It is no secret that large language models (LLMs) crossed the capability threshold by harvesting vast amounts of public and private data. Combined with breakthroughs in transformer architectures and compute power, this data scraping led to concerns about intellectual property (IP) rights.

Intellectual property frameworks exist to incentivize innovation and creative spark, protecting creators and businesses. In turn, the entire society benefits from that incentive structure. Eventually, IP protections typically expire, at which point IP becomes integrated into the public domain.

The global harmonizing IP framework is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) umbrella, together with the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO).

However, with AI rapidly blurring the line between human and machine creativity, the foundational assumptions of the IP system are under strain. Without explicit consent and compensation, LLMs are routinely trained on copyrighted works, eroding the important incentive structure.

Over time, it is not difficult to see digital oligopolies entrenching their power with the largest compute power and data access, while barring smaller players from large-scale data scraping.

Yet, once again when it comes to data flows, a potential solution can arise from the blockchain ecosystem. Specifically, with layer-1 Camp Network (CAMP) blockchain.

Just as Bitcoin mainnet immutably registers the transfer of value, Camp Network aims to immutably register the transfer and attribution of people's work. With a permanent and verifiable record of ownership, creators can automatically enforce licensing terms – through smart contracts – whenever AI models use this registered content.

To accomplish this, Camp Network uses the proof-of-provenance (PoP) protocol, which handles IP origin and licensing terms. On top of this core protocol, Camp Network uses BaseCAMP as a global IP registry and SideCAMPs tailored for dApps pertaining to IP enforcement in various sectors such as music, books, or gaming.

Specifically, creators and organizations could register IP as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have already pioneered a form of on-chain royalties system, despite the market deflation since late 2021. Although this was an important proof of concept, royalties enforcement relies more on marketplace cooperation, not the blockchain itself.

Case in point, there was a period of ‘royalty wars' between OpenSea and other marketplaces like Blur, in which marketplaces introduced a royalties-optional model opting for token incentivization instead. Eventually, this led to a fragmented and voluntary NFT royalty ecosystem, exacerbated by faulty metadata.

Building on these lessons, Camp Network is embedding royalty logic at the protocol layer, instead of relying on marketplaces. This means that royalties would not just apply to content, but to data usage – ideal for scenarios when LLMs train on registered datasets.

With its purpose-built layer-1 blockchain, Camp Network is foremost aimed at individual creators across all digital content categories. Whether it is a music track or a digital image, the process is as follows:

To put it differently, Camp Network is better understood as add-on infrastructure rather than another protocol. On its portal, users can even transfer native ETH from Ethereum, which holds the highest number of dApps and developers.

At present, Camp Network's ecosystem spans 141 dApps. This is unsurprising given that the protocol is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), making for easy dApp migration.

To support Ethereum-Camp interoperability in a secure manner, Camp Network uses Decentralized Verifier Network (DVN), powered by the native token CAMP for the purpose of staking within the CAMP Vault.

Moreover, each dApp runs its own SideCAMP in order to avoid traffic congestion. And because SideCAMPs support different runtime environments, different ecosystems can onboard the Camp ecosystem. This blockchain network interoperability is extremely important for Camp Network to gain traction, ensuring that content maintains its traceable origins across chains.

Having launched relatively recently in late August 2025, there are 10 billion CAMP tokens available to secure and monetize the network, of which 2.1 billion are in circulation. Early backers hold the most tokens, at 29%.

For ecosystem and foundation, 3% of CAMP tokens are unlocked at token generation events (TGE) each. The remaining tokens are vested monthly over 60 months for the purpose of supporting airdrops, grants, staking rewards, and community engagement. In many ways, these yield-style incentives mirror the recurring payouts investors receive from dividend stocks, but in a decentralized, blockchain-native form.

Protocol developers gain CAMP tokens gradually over 4 years after a 1-year initial waiting period. Likewise, after waiting for one year, early backers gain a 2-year period of linear vesting to three years total.

Following early October's crypto crash, now is a good time to consider investing in assets that are likely to gain merit-based traction. Alongside Ethereum, Camp Network belongs in this consideration category, at least to watch for CAMP's future airdrop campaigns.

At the end of the line, Camp Network addresses a fast-growing problem of AI devouring data without giving anything in return. One could even see Google's AI Overview eroding website traffic, as it summarizes different websites for user queries.

By embedding royalty and usage logic at the protocol layer, Camp Network ensures digital content is transformed into verifiable, monetizable assets. And the longer we are in the AI era, the longer the demand for transparent, on-chain provenance and automated compensation will grow.

Since 2015, Shane fervently backs decentralized finance, penning countless articles on digital securities and the fusion of traditional finance with DLT. He's intrigued by technology's influence on economics and life.

Long overshadowed by regulatory constraints and the rise of centralized platforms, Zcash makes an unexpected comeback to the forefront of the crypto scene. Driven by a spectacular rise in its price and growing adoption of its privacy features, the project regains momentum. At a time when demand for private transactions is exploding, Electric Coin Company unveils an ambitious roadmap to assert Zcash's central role in the ecosystem.

Electric Coin Company (ECC), the historic developer of Zcash, has revealed its roadmap for the fourth quarter of this year. The announcement comes in a context of an explosion in the price of its token and renewed interest in privacy-centered cryptocurrencies.

The team aims to strengthen the infrastructure of its Zashi wallet and improve the project's operational security. “This quarter, ECC focuses on reducing technical debt, improving privacy and ease of use for Zashi users, and effective management of the development fund,” the official statement specifies.

The goal is to consolidate the protocol's foundations and ensure a smoother experience for users.

In detail, ECC has identified four major technical priorities for this quarter :

These technical adjustments mark a desire to modernize the ecosystem while respecting Zcash's fundamental principles. They also fit into a logic of operational sovereignty with respect to centralized services, already initiated with previous Zashi developments.

Beyond technical developments, Zcash news is marked by an impressive surge in its economic indicators. The price of the ZEC token now approaches 420 dollars, versus about 50 dollars in mid-September.

This rapid growth is accompanied by a symbolic event: Zcash's market capitalization has surpassed that of Monero, its main historic competitor in the privacy crypto field. However, the most significant evolution remains the explosion in the share of tokens used with active privacy protections. According to ZecHub, more than 4.1 million ZEC are now protected via Orchard, the latest version of the Zcash protocol, compatible with the old Sapling and Sprout standards.

This rise of “shielded tokens” occurs in a particular context. At the end of August, ECC launched a decentralized off-ramp for confidential ZEC, followed in early October by an on-ramp called “Swaps.”

These additions led the team to temporarily disable Coinbase integration, due to a new session-token system deemed “not very privacy-respecting”. These decisions, although technical, reflect a stated will to promote independence from centralized platforms and prioritize consistency with the project's privacy values.

Zcash signs a strategic comeback driven by innovation and growing demand for privacy. With a clear roadmap and a market in full bloom, ECC is preparing the ground for a new phase. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will be sustained in the face of regulatory challenges.

It's not exactly news to frustrated bitcoin BTC$110,210.77 bulls that risk assets across the planet for months have been recording what seem like daily record highs while the price action in BTC remains rather muted.

""What if everyone is looking at this wrong,"" asks longtime traditional finance asset manager Jordi Visser in a heavily shared (1.5M views on X and counting) weekend essay titled ""Bitcoin's Silent IPO: Why This Consolidation Isn't What You Think.""

While bitcoin never had a traditional IPO, the factors liming price gains are nearly exactly the same as those which cause poor price performance in stock IPOs, argues Visser.

Tradfi IPOs and the months that follow, reminds Visser — particularly in tech — are major liquidity events for early investors.

""Early-stage investors take enormous risks,"" wrote Visser. ""If the investment succeeds, they deserve enormous rewards. But eventually, and this is crucial, they need to realize those gains. They need liquidity. They need an exit. They need to diversify.""

The examples, particularly in tech, are legion, but consider the Facebook (now Meta) IPO of 2012. The offering at $38 per share raised $16 billion at a valuation of $104 billion — quaint numbers today, but staggering amounts at the time. One year later, the stock was 30% lower, with pundits questions Mark Zuckerberg's leadership.

More likely than missteps by Zuck, it was early investors — be they his Harvard buddies, or Silicon Valley types, or the carpenters who framed out Facebook's first offices (who took pay in shares rather than cash) using public markets to realize life-changing profits.

Importantly, says Visser, the early investors don't hit the bid all at once. ""They're methodically distributing their positions. They're being careful. They don't want to crater the price. They're patient. They've waited years for this moment. They can wait a few more months to do it right.""

The result, he says: ""A sideways grind that drives everyone crazy."" Sound familiar?

""The on-chain data tells a clear story if you know how to read it,"" says Visser, turning to bitcoin. ""Old coins, coins that haven't moved in years, some dormant since the single-digit price days, are suddenly active.""

The ETFs, the institutional adoption, the friendly regulatory environment ... this created IPO-like conditions for bitcoin's early believers.

""For years, the liquidity simply didn't exist,"" he wrote. ""Try selling $100 million of bitcoin in 2015. You'd crater the price. Try selling $1 billion in 2019. Same problem. The market couldn't absorb it.""

""But now,"" he continued. ""ETFs are providing institutional bid. Major companies hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Sovereign wealth funds are getting involved. The market has finally matured to the point where early holders can exit significant positions without causing chaos.""

Again, reminds Visser, it's not being done all at once — no one is interested in crashing the price. But instead, steadily and methodically: hence the sideways grind and the rallies that reverse so quickly.

What's occurring now is hardly anything that can be called a bear market, says Visser, but instead a distribution of ownership.

Over the long run, this is a bullish event, but the process — at least in traditional markets — can take 6-18 months. Even though cycles often get sped up in crypto, Visser suspects there could be many more months of this frustrating price action in bitcoin.

""Sentiment will only improve after the distribution is substantially complete,"" he wrote. ""People are demoralized because they don't understand what phase we're in. They're waiting for bitcoin to 'catch up' to stocks. They are worried about the four year cycle. Be patient. Once the heavy selling pressure lifts, once the patient accumulation by institutions has absorbed the OG supply, the path becomes clearer.""

The cooler had separated from the vapor chamber.

Here's a bent-out-of-shape GPU repair that quickly turned from a curiosity into a horror story: A dead Aorus-branded Nvidia RTX 4090 card landed on the desk of Northwest Repair, originally reported to have a melted connector and ""some knocked off components,"" but one by one, slowly, the tech finds so much wrong with this card that it's deemed irreparable by the end. That's rare for a GPU in those skillful hands. Let's dive into the rocky journey of attempting to fix a Scoliosis-ridden graphics card that's literally bent out of shape.

The bad signs began immediately: not only was the card obviously and unnaturally curved, but the backplate was screwed on with aftermarket plastic screws and looked severely worn, as if someone had thrown it around.

Once disassembled, the PCB itself was basically straight, but the cooler was so twisted that our host, Tony, just gave up trying to bend it back into shape. The heatpipes were fine, but the fin stack was separating from the vapor chamber, and the thermal pads weren't even making contact with the VRAM and most of the MOSFETs.

 




“Screw this,” exclaimed the seasoned GPU tech, as he moved on to testing the GPU itself, pulling out the multimeter. There was a dead short on the 12V rail, 1.8V rail, and the memory, but the 5V and PEX were seemingly okay. After injecting current into the 12V rail, he formed the initial hypothesis. Under a thermal camera, he saw heat building up around the VRAM area, indicating that 12V was shorted to the memory and likely propagated further, frying other components. Checking the core's resistance, however, confirmed that it wasn't shorted, so there was hope.

When put underneath a microscope, he discovered the card had previously been RMA'd, as it was in poor condition with a bunch of missing components, but nothing too egregious jumped out right away — except for grinding marks near a screw post, hinting that a Dremel was used there for some reason.

 




Next, a suspect VRAM module was removed, but the short still persisted, confirming the hypothesis that 12V reached the entire memory rail, likely taking out all the VRAM chips in the process. Tony grounded the memory rail to stabilize it before pushing a higher current to see what else was causing issues. Pushing 5 amps made the SIC653A power stage glow, indicating it failed and allowed the 12V to reach the memory. Removing the MOSFET made the short go away, and after replacing it with a new one from a donor board, he tested again.

The short on all the rails was gone, except for the memory. Tony once again injected a few amps into the VRAM, and sure enough, the core started getting hot, confirming a dreadful conclusion. He just performed an autopsy, not a repair, as the 12V had travelled through the memory chips and eventually reached the core, frying it in the process.

You might be wondering why it looked “okay” before, and that's because the resistance test only shows obvious shorts; it's only when actual current is injected that the electrically wounded GPU core collapsed and confirmed it was dead.

 




Tony admits he didn't need to do all that, and that reviving this card based on its condition would be nothing short of a miracle. Discovering the dead core wouldn't have been possible without first replacing the MOSFET, which removed the short on the 12V rail and confirmed that the rest of the card was not salvageable. It's a routine part of electronics repair and par for the course when attempting to fix sensitive hardware like graphics cards.

Additionally, it includes various options to customize the OS further, such as removing AI features and unwanted apps. However, there is a suspected bogus build of this tool downloadable via an official-looking domain, which is causing concern.

The developer of Flyoobe recently issued a warning about a potentially malicious copy of the tool being distributed through a website that is not directly affiliated with the project. According to a notice marked ""SECURITY ALERT"" on the official Github page, an unofficial mirror is being hosted at https://flyoobe.net/ (do not visit), which may contain malware or a tampered build of Flyoobe. The developer also urges users to download only from the official GitHub releases, emphasizing that the mentioned website has no connection with the developer or the project's official pages.

Originally known as Flyby11, Flyoobe describes itself as “a better way to set up Windows,” and aims to make Windows 11 more accessible and customizable, especially on older or less powerful hardware. The tool lets you upgrade directly from Windows 10 to Windows 11, bypassing compatibility checks that normally block unsupported systems. So it will bypass TPM module checks, etc. With that, Flyoobe also gives users the flexibility to remove AI-based components and trim unnecessary features to create a lighter installation. It can even enhance the overall Windows experience with additional customization options and the ability to install some of the most commonly used applications.

Downloading tools with system-level access, like Flyoobe, from an unverified source comes with huge risks. Malicious versions of software potentially include hidden keyloggers, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, or scripts that compromise sensitive data during the Windows installation process. Even if the installer may appear to work as intended, tampered builds can introduce backdoors or stability issues that are difficult to trace and fix. That the reputable sounding imposter website URL exists is worrying, so please avoid it. Hopefully, the fake Flyoobe hosting will be shut down shortly.

Anthony Gordon has become the centre of social media scrutiny after the England international failed to find the back of the net in yet another Premier League game. The winger has had a grip on the left of the Magpies and Three Lions' attacks in recent months, but both Eddie Howe and Thomas Tuchel may be growing concerned at Gordon's lack of output.

Gordon was disappointing once again for Newcastle in the Premier League as the Magpies slumped to a shock 3-1 defeat to West Ham at the London Stadium. The Hammers recorded just their second win of the season, and their first under Nuno Espirito Santo, to leave Newcastle a disappointing 12th after 10 games.

The afternoon started brightly for the away side when Jacob Murphy put the visitors in front after just four minutes. The right-winger weaved in and out of the Hammers defence before striking hard into the bottom-left corner.

Yet, the Magpies could only hold onto their lead for half-an-hour when Lucas Paqueta, looking to lead West Ham to safety, curled an effort from distance past the diving Nick Pope. Ten minutes later, a Aaron Wan-Bissaka cutback was turned into his own net by Sven Botman to give the hosts the lead. Newcastle pushed, but were unable to find a way back into the game and Tomas Soucek bundled home in injury time to seal the three points.

It marks another poor result and performance from Newcastle, whose dreams of qualifying for the Champions League for another season already look under threat, with much of the blame for their inconsistent and wasteful attack being levelled at Gordon, who was substituted at half-time.

The Newcastle United fans are growing tired of the winger, who has now gone 19 games in the Premier League without scoring or providing an assist for one of his team-mates. On X, @Regista10_ declared the stat as, ""one of the worst stats"" they had ever heard.

Gordon was also fortunate that his lackadaisical performance escaped punishment. @KHeneage said that ""Anthony Gordon [is] far too casual on the ball in the wrong areas,"" in reference to the winger being robbed of possession leading to a West Ham attack. Looking to pounce on Gordon's error, the hosts poured forward and, when Jarrod Bowen went over in the box, looked as if they would take advantage of the winger's complacency in midfield. Luckily for Gordon, the awarded penalty was overturned by VAR.

On the same incident, @Will44s added: ""Anthony Gordon is very light weight and also gives the ball away far too much for somebody that's meant to be this good a player.""

Taking things further, @swamoil wanted the club to not only drop the wide attacker from the starting line-up, but to expel him from the entire club. They posted: ""Anthony Gordon needs to be released. Spent £500m and Jacob Murphy from nearly a decade ago is still our best winger.""

Also looking for the Magpies to move Gordon on, @GetAHurrCutMan_ said: ""Anthony Gordon is nowhere near as good as he thinks he is. Would snap your hand off if a bid of any significance arrived.""

Interest in Gordon from other clubs has been well-documented. Liverpool have long-been-linked with the winger who has reportedly been open to a move back to Merseyside.

Champions League nights return to the Northeast this week as Athletic Club visit St. James' Park. Fortunately for Gordon, he has been excelling in European football and even drew praise from Benfica manager Jose Mourinho after the Englishman put the side from Lisbon to the sword. He will want to add to the four goals in three games he has scored in the competition already.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

	Following Oscar-nominated cinematographer Adam Greenberg‘s death at age 88, James Cameron paid tribute to his collaborator on the first two Terminator films.


	In a statement shared with Deadline, the 3x Oscar-winning director said Greenberg had been “a guiding light” to him ever since they worked together on Cameron's breakout The Terminator (1984) and Greenberg “graciously” returned for the 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day. 


	“I learned so much from Adam, not just about cinematography, but about the spirit of independent production,” he said. “He refused to let budget limitations inhibit his artistic expression. Adam had done scores of films when I worked with him on my first, and his scrappy, can-do spirit has been a guiding light for me ever since, even on the biggest of productions.”

	Cameron continued, “I saw him last a few years ago, when he graciously came in to help color time Terminator 2: Judgment Day for its stereo 3D re-release. I had just been in the middle of arguing with the colorist that the blues in a night scene were too purple, and needed a little cyan. Adam took one look at the scene, took me aside and said ‘Jim, don't you think it needs a point of cyan?' He remembered a point of color over two decades later. That's precision. I now see color with his eyes.


	“I could not have done my Terminator films without Adam. He taught me the narrative power of color and lighting. Nobody did night photography like Adam. I pride myself on my hand-held camera operating, but I learned that at Adam's knee. He was the master. I know there is a whole generation of filmmakers that he influenced, and there were a handful of us that were privileged to have him shoot for us. We got to learn the lessons directly at his side. His talent and spirit will be missed.”

	











	After establishing a cinematography career in Israel and making the jump the US film industry, Greenberg served as DP on the first two Terminator films, with Judgment Day earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.


	Fellow cinematographer Avraham Karpick, who worked for Greenberg on the 1984 J. Lee Thompson film The Ambassador, was one of several industry peers to mourn the director of photography's death, announcing that he died on Thursday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","My favorite cookware — and everything Our Place is on major sale right now","https://pagesix.com/lifestyle/our-place-black-friday-sale-35-off-cookware/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

This sale is chef's kiss.

Quality cookware comes with a hefty price tag for two major reasons: It lasts longer than the cheap stuff, and it supposedly makes you a better chef. So, when I ponied up hard-earned cash for my first Our Place Always Pan, there were big expectations.

Let's just say that it impressed me so that since then, my kitchen has been nearly taken over by the brand's cookware and small appliances. 

Advertisement

Even better, right now, most everything is a whopping 35% off during Our Place's early Black Friday sale — offering the biggest deals of the year.

The non-toxic, non-stick Always Pan has a smart design, with sides high enough to sauté and stir-fry, but low enough for pancake flipping. It's also oven-safe.

It comes with a wood spatula that smartly nests on the handle and an aluminum strainer that makes draining pasta or steaming veggies a cinch. (It's so pretty, I always leave it on my stovetop as well.)

I'm not alone in loving the Always Pan; Oprah called it a “kitchen magician,” and it's among our best luxury gifts inspired by celebrities. There's also an incredible Molly Baz X Crocs collab right now in the prettiest pale lemon colorway, and the sexy Titanium Pro style.

OK, I was in love with my original little pink Wonder Oven, another kitchen multitasker. It air-fries, toasts, bakes and reheats — and fast. It's perfect for small kitchens and has a petite counter footprint.

I may retire it, though, since trying the new Wonder Oven Pro, which is larger and impressively offers even more functionality. (This is the first time that it's been on sale!) I may never turn my regular oven on again.

Besides the myriad options of the original, it also proofs dough for homemade bread and pastries, and has a dehydrating function, to make sulfur-free homemade dried fruit snacks (or whatever dehydrated snacks you fancy).

What to shop next is a difficult choice; I have my eye on so many pieces, from saucepans to tableware. 

If a foodie is on your holiday list, there are giftable sets and suggestions starting under $50.

I love my mom's 1970s Le Creuset, but it has seen better days. This cast-iron stove-to-oven Perfect Pot might just be the one to replace it.

It gets rave reviews for everything from baking bread to family meals, not to mention the hot grips for easy handling are included.

I have some limited-edition mini bowls from the brand, which I've had for years, and they have not so much as chipped since then, despite getting used on a near-daily basis.

I'm so taken with the designs, I might add some dinner bowls for pasta and big salad bowls to my collection now, thanks to this sale.

The stackable set is made from chip-resistant ceramic stoneware and is available in three sizes and three colors (I'm just hooked on the spice hue).

Advertisement

I've since also added a Dream Cooker, which is a slow cooker and pressure cooker in one. 

Using it is the first time I've successfully cooked dried beans, and incredibly, they come out to buttery perfection in 20 minutes. Since the season is turning, I'll be making big pots of my apple pie filling, with maple syrup instead of sugar, that I put on everything all fall long.

The sale is through December 2, but the best things have a way of selling out early, so grab some kitchen heroes while you can.

So, these are not on sale, but I'm so infatuated with the hot grips with charms from the Crocs collab, the joy they will bring to everyday cooking might be worth the little splurge. They fit on the handles of all Our Place cookware, so you don't have to find your giant oven mitts.

However, the other hot grips (sans charms) are indeed marked down to $26 — if you're not a sucker for adorable kitchen accessories like me!

A great gift or a kitchen essential for any baker or chef, this Oeko-Tex certified, 100% cotton twill apron is included in the deals and comes in three colors. 

One shopper wrote, “Got this as a gift for my momma. She loves all the pockets and how sturdy it is!”

Sydney Sweeney and her ex-fiancé, Jonathan Davino, allegedly had a tense reunion late Saturday night amid the actress' romance with Scooter Braun.

Sweeney was spotted getting into the passenger seat of a car being driven by Davino in Los Angeles Saturday night, according to photos obtained by Page Six.

The “Euphoria” actress, 28, was seen putting her hand in front of her face as the movie producer hit the gas and drove to her house.

A source who was near Sweeney's home told TMZ that they heard the “Anyone But You” star scream at him when she got out of the car. 

Advertisement

 “I don't believe you. Please leave, leave me alone,” she allegedly yelled. 

Earlier in the evening, Sweeney had attended a private dinner with a group of friends at Santa Monica hotspot, Giorgio Baldi, to watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the 2025 World Series.

After the Dodgers came out ahead in a 5-4 victory just before midnight local time, Sweeney was seen getting into an Uber that drove a few blocks away until pulling up next to Davino's car.

Sweeney — wearing a brown leather jacket, denim shorts and brown suede boots — and Davino swiftly made their getaway. 

Advertisement

The “Anyone But You” star's reunion with Davino comes after Page Six reported that Sweeney is enjoying spending time with Braun.

“She enjoys having someone to ask advice from about her career,” a source told us last month.

While the source said that she likes hanging with the music manager, the insider said, “Don't expect any wedding bells… Her number one priority is her career.”

A source previously told us that Braun and Sweeney were very serious as a couple.

“They are full on. It's not a casual relationship,” the source said in October. “It's game on, it's full throttle. They are together.”

Another insider close to the pair informed us that Braun “really, really likes her.”

Sweeney and Braun, who were spotted looking cozy on several public outings, have been romantically linked since September.

At the time, Braun was back on the market after he and his ex-wife Yael broke up in 2021. The former couple, who finalized their divorce in 2022, share three children. 

Meanwhile, Sweeney ended her engagement to Davino earlier this year after seven years together. 

This isn't the first time Sweeney and Davino have joined together since deciding not to go through with their wedding. They also grabbed a low-key lunch in April.

Page Six has reached out to Sweeney's rep for comment.

Eric Dane was seen on a rare family outing with wife Rebecca Gayheart and daughter Georgia as he continues to battle ALS. 

The “Countdown” actor was pictured in a wheelchair alongside the model and their youngest daughter, 13, as all three headed out to West Hollywood hotspot Sushi Park on Thursday. 

He appeared to be in good spirits, wearing a casual black T shirt and beige pants, while Gayheart rocked what appeared to be black leather pants and a white tunic. At one point, he wore a black puffer coat.

Daughter Georgia matched her dad's vibe in a black T shirt, as well.

The sighting comes almost a month after the “Grey's Anatomy” alum, 52, revealed that he missed out on the show's epic reunion at the Emmy Awards because he was hospitalized after a bad fall. 

“ALS is a nasty disease,” he told the Washington Post in October, referencing his diagnosis of  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

“So I was in the hospital during the Emmys getting stitches put in my head,” he divulged, adding that he was “really upset” about missing the milestone moment. 

The actor explained that “there was nothing I could do about it.”

The father of two publicly shared his diagnosis in April. “I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter,” he told People at the time.

Gayheart — who married the actor in 2004 and also shares daughter Billie, 15, with him — shared how his debilitating condition is affecting their teen daughters in a recent interview. 

“I mean, it's heartbreaking,” the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum told People at an event in September. “My girls are really suffering, and we're just trying to get through it. It's a tough time.” 

Billie and Georgia are “taking it day by day” as their father faces the progressive neurodegenerative disease, she added. 

“We have some professional therapists who are helping us, and we're just trying to have some hope and do it with dignity, grace and love,” Gayheart continued. 

Though the “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum hasn't yet found a “positive nugget” in the family's plight, she said they'd become closer as a family. 

“I mean, we're definitely dealing with something that has brought us all together, and Eric will always be my family, whether we're married or not, or living in the same house or not,” she explained, adding that ALS is a “horrible disease.”

The “Urban Legend” actress clarified her relationship with Eric — who had previously been spotted stepping out with Janelle Shirtcliff in the months following his diagnosis — in April. 

Advertisement

“We are best of friends. We are really close. We are great co-parents,” she told E! News at the time.

Gayheart and Eric called off their divorce after seven years in March, just prior to him announcing his diagnosis. 

“The Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood” actress initially filed for divorce from the “Euphoria” star in February 2018, citing irreconcilable differences.

D'Angelo has been laid to rest after his death at 51 from pancreatic cancer. The soul legend was honored at a private funeral held Saturday, November 1, in Henrico, Virginia, according to a program shared by HuffPost deputy editor Philip Lewis.

The service, organized by D'Angelo's longtime friend Bill McGee, was described as a “celebration of life.” Bishop Ralland V. Robinson led the ceremony and delivered the eulogy for the “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” singer, while Pastor Jamal Bryant shared a special video message.

A post shared by 804 Hood News (@804hoodnews_)

Stevie Wonder, harpist Brandee Younger, and D'Angelo's former band, The Soultronics, performed during the memorial. The family's message in the program read, “We wish to express our profound gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of support. … Through music, love and light, Michael D'Angelo's spirit will shine forever.”

A post shared by Kareem Smith (@entertainmenttakeover_)

Questlove of The Roots helped organize the service and was personally thanked by the family for his support. On October 30, the musician paid tribute to his longtime friend in Rolling Stone, admitting he had long feared losing him.

A post shared by Eric Johnson (@upstairsaterics)

“Truthfully, I wasn't ready for that gut punch,” Questlove wrote. “I'd been bracing for it for some 25 years — since the deluge of [album] Voodoo in 2000. I always had a looming feeling concerning D like a ‘any moment now I will get ‘the call' feeling. Most of our mavericks who fly that close to the sun never get to see that journey through.”

A post shared by 449 Tea (@449.tea)

He reflected on the loss, adding, “And now here we are at 5:30 a.m. I had seconds to decide: How do I process this new reality? My preference was not to start my Tuesday morning … mourning.”

D'Angelo's family first confirmed his passing (as per Variety) on October 14 after a long battle with cancer. “The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,” they wrote in a statement. 

“After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D'Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D'Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, October 14th, 2025.”

They continued, “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all to join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.”

The four-time Grammy winner is survived by three children: son Michael Archer, whom he shared with late soul singer Angie Stone, and two younger children, daughter Imani Archer and son Morocco Archer. All three were listed as speakers at the memorial.

A post shared by Shauna Jones (@shauna_blacklens)

In October, Michael, 27, reflected on the pain of losing both of his parents in the same year. “I am grateful for your thoughts and prayers during these very difficult times, as it has been a very rough and sad year for me,” he told People. “I ask that you please continue to keep me in your thoughts as it will not be easy, but one thing that both my parents taught me was to be strong, and I intend to do just that.”

Imani also shared her heartbreak online, calling her father's death an “immeasurable loss.” “You were my biggest hype man, my protector, my biggest musical inspiration, the kindest and most selfless man, and the best father anyone could've ever had,” she wrote on Instagram. 

A post shared by Imani Archer (@imaniarcher)

“Till the very end, you made sure to protect me from anything that would scare or hurt me. I love you so much Daddy. I wish I had more time to spend with you.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Katy Perry Proud & Loud About Justin Trudeau Romance During Concert","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/katy-perry-confirms-justin-trudeau-romance-concert/","Sun, 02 Nov 2025 14:29:59 GMT","

Katy Perry is no longer keeping her romance with Justin Trudeau a secret.

During her latest concert in Prague on Thursday, the “Firework” hitmaker made it clear that she's no longer single. In a fan video shared on TikTok, Perry told the crowd that she saw a fan holding a sign asking to marry her.

“This guy is trying to get me to marry him, and he has a ring in his hand,” Perry told the audience. “No! I am dating someone else for crying out f*g loud!”

i can‘t with this woman 😂😂😂 @Katy Perry #katyperry #lifetimestour #prague #concert #katycats 

The “American Idol” judge and former prime minister were first romantically linked in July. At the time, Perry and Trudeau were spotted on a dinner date in Montreal and a stroll in Mount Royal Park.

In October, the two were pictured kissing on a yacht off the California coast.

Just last week, the two went public with their relationship when they packed on the PDA during a date night in Paris.

In a video obtained by TMZ, the couple can be seen walking out of the theater holding hands. They then walked to a waiting vehicle, looking quite happy.

Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Perry is very happy with her and Trudeau's blossoming relationship.

“Katy is really into it. She's very happy,” the source told the outlet. “[Katy] is trying to keep it low-key, and they've spent a lot of private time together. She's not looking to publicize this relationship.”

Trudeau, on the other hand, is said to be enjoying the new chapter in his life. A source told PEOPLE that Perry has become a bright spot for the politician after a tough couple of years.

“He is a much happier person now,” the outlet noted. “Stresses are greatly diminished. And he is intrigued with Katy. They have fun together, laugh a lot, talk about everything. His life is much improved, and his relationship with Katy has had a lot to do with it.”

The singer was surprised to find a fan holding a sign asking to marry her yet again — an offer she previously also turned down at her London show — and explained she's no longer available.

A source also told PEOPLE that Perry and Trudeau are “very much a couple” and always find time for each other despite their busy schedules.

“[They] have been seeing each other as often as possible,” the source told the outlet. “Obviously, she's busy, but so is he. Yet he goes the extra mile to be with her when possible. Especially when it's important.”

	Even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers are furloughed, thousands are laid off, and SNAP runs out of funding amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has continued to spend big (upwards of $10 million) on ICE recruitment and Department of Homeland Security ads encouraging self-deportation.


	In just the first three weeks of the government shutdown, ICE spent $4.5 million of taxpayer dollars to run recruitment ads, while DHS spent more than $5.3 million on ads encouraging self-deportation and praising President Donald Trump, according to new advertisement tracking information from Equis and Priorities USA.


	“We're seeing that some of these campaigns have actively started during October, clearly after the shutdown started, which is key to this story,” Natalia Campos Vargas, the deputy research director for messaging at Equis, tells Rolling Stone. “During the government shutdown where employees are being furloughed, these government entities are still spending millions of dollars on advertising on TV and digital platforms.”

	











	According to the new memo, which looks into ad spending on Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram, Google, Snapchat, X, cable TV, and broadcast TV, the government even increased ad spending during the shutdown. Specifically, DHS increased spending on YouTube ads, going up from $292,000 alone in September to $332,000 in just the first three weeks of October.

	The ICE ads specifically target recruitment in sanctuary cities like Seattle, Boston, and Chicago, pushing a $50,000 signing bonus to police officers as part of funding authorized in Trump's so-called Big Beautiful Bill to focus on immigration enforcement. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says in some advertisements targeting local police officers. “But in sanctuary cities, you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

	











	In a statement to Rolling Stone, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the funding came from this bill, and that “hiring law enforcement officers is mission critical in order to fix the crisis the Biden administration manufactured by letting millions of criminal illegal aliens come into the country… Nothing will slow us down from recruiting more officers.”

	McLaughlin also said in her statement that Trump and DHS Sec. Kristi Noem “will always stand by law enforcement” and are making sure they are paid during the shutdown.


	DHS ads seem to target those with interests associated with the Latino community, according to the Equis research. What's most striking is that on Meta platforms, Instagram, and Facebook, DHS has used “interest targeting” to focus on audiences interested in topics such as Latin music, Mexican cuisine, Mexican soccer teams, and Mexican pop music. It's also unclear how much the government is spending on advertising outside of. the country.


	“We are not able to track money spent outside of the United States, but we do know that the DHS is also running ads in Mexico,” says Campos Vargas. “We don't know how much money is spent or where it is being spent.”


	Last week, Rolling Stone reported that numerous streaming services and platforms — from Max and Pandora to Univision and Spotify — were running ICE recruitment ads and pro-self-deportation ads on their services. Earlier this week, the Indivisible Project launched a campaign to encourage folks to cancel Spotify Premium subscriptions and protest the platform over its running of ICE ads. It promoted said boycott on Instagram and YouTube, which has also run similar advertising.


	“Spotify is exploiting the work of artists to line their pockets while recruiting for ICE – a secret police force that is terrorizing American communities,” Ezra Levin, the organization's co-founder, said in a press release. “Spotify is actively amplifying the Trump regime's drive to authoritarianism.”

	A spokesperson for the music platform iterated to Rolling Stone that the ad is “part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms.” It's true: similar ads have been seen on Spanish-language television, digital radio stations, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other services, and follows the Trump administration's investment of $30 billion to hire at least 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year, according to The Associated Press.

	When reached for comment earlier this month, McLaughlin told Rolling Stone that there was “nothing offensive or partisan” with removing what it called criminals from the United States. “The ICE recruitment campaign is a resounding success with more than 150,000 applications rolling in from patriotic Americans answering the call to defend the Homeland by helping arrest and remove the worst of the worst from our country,” McLaughlin said at the time.


	The Trump administration has been spending big on its immigration agenda since Trump retook office — despite the administration's hand-wringing over wasteful government spending. Rolling Stone reported in February that the administration had budgeted $200 million to spend on anti-immigrant ads thanking Trump for “securing the border.” Noem said the ad campaign was Trump's idea. ICE later spent half a million dollars on tricked-out truck's for a hype video posted to social media. The department's recruitment blitz doesn't seem to be letting up any time soon, even as much the rest of the federal government's operations grind to a halt amid the shutdown.

Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska was always an album that people loved to argue about. So it makes sense that we're arguing about it now. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere underwhelmed at the box office, pulling in $16.1 million in its opening weekend. That might seem like a colossal success to you or me, except the budget was somehow $55 million, for a movie about an album made on a $400 tape deck. The reviews have been wildly mixed. Electric Nebraska has given fans a whole new perspective on this classic 1982 acoustic album, and how it could have been different if he'd gotten the E Street Band involved. That's why the Springsteen arguments are blowing up like the Chicken Man.


	Just like Radiohead's Kid A, an extremely similar move that dropped 18 Octobers later, Nebraska gave great entertainment value whether you loved it or hated it, because it was so intensely fun to debate. In the movie's funniest scene, we hear Jimmy Iovine over the phone, screaming at manager Jon Landau over how idiotic it is to release this folk record. (Iovine plays himself, which is brilliant.) There's also a moment where Landau says he's going to play it for Iovine and Stevie Nicks; tragically, the movie does not depict Stevie's reaction.

	











	The movie has Oscar-bait performances from Jeremy Allen White as the Boss and Jeremy Strong as Landau. But it's a divisive movie, as befits a divisive album, and even those of us who loved Deliver Me From Nowhere can find plenty to bitch about. It's a whole movie of men talking about Bruce Springsteen's problems, one of whom is Bruce. There's also a couple of women for empathetic nodding. The mastering guy gets more lines than the entire E Street Band. The message is that men will literally make acoustic concept albums about psycho killers instead of going to therapy.

	











	There's an old-school show-biz melodrama at the heart of the Nebraska story — the evil corporate suits screaming, “It'll never sell,” while the renegade rocker replies, “An artist's gotta do what an artist's gotta do.” But that's why it makes such a great legend. That's why there's a movie about Nebraska and not the Grammy winner for Album of the Year, which was Toto IV. (I, for one, would watch the hell out of the “You know what this song needs? Wild dogs crying out in the night” scene.)

	But the movie only gives tiny little tastes of 1982 rock culture, and why Nebraska was so comically unsuitable for airplay. In the movie, Springsteen drives listening to Foreigner's “Urgent” and Santana's “Winning,” two ubiquitous radio hits in 1981. The whole album is full of sweaty men driving around alone at night, praying for some rock & roll salvation on the radio. But Nebraska is definitely what they were NOT hearing.


	The biggest new star of 1982, as far as rock radio was concerned, was John Cougar, with American Fool, giving the kind of basic crowd-pleasing Springsteen moves that Springsteen himself was refusing to deliver. “Hurts So Good” and “Jack and Diane” were obvious (but effective) Boss-esque hits from the Coug, with more from Bryan Adams and John Cafferty soon on the way. (He was still a year away from reclaiming his name “Mellencamp.”) American Fool was six months old when Nebraska came out — but still in the middle of a nine-week run at Number One. For guys like Mellencamp and Adams, hearing Nebraska must have been one of the happiest moments of their lives.


	But it was Billy Joel, more than anyone, who reaped the benefits of Nebraska. He'd just made his own uncommercial art album with The Nylon Curtain, which dropped a week earlier, with the same radio-unfriendly premise, on the same label, and probably inspired the same screaming fits from the label suits. But ironically, The Nylon Curtain became a hit anyway, because Billy ended up filling the Springsteen void — the main reason “Pressure” and “Allentown” became such big hits was they were the next best thing to the AOR-friendly Springsteen songs that the Boss wasn't serving.

	A full-page magazine ad from Rolling Stone in late 1982: just Billy Joel's name, a fist clutching a wrench, and the complete lyrics of “Allentown.” No way would he have gotten away with that ad if Springsteen had thrown his base a bone or two on Nebraska. “Pressure” was pretty damn uncommercial by Billy's standards — an ode to the struggles of rock stars to get their dealers on the phone, with the singer gnashing his teeth like he's trapped in the final half-hour of Goodfellas. (The excellent five-hour Billy Joel doc And So It Goes doesn't mention cocaine once, so he probably did his research by asking the big shots at Elaine's.) But compared to Nebraska, this song was “Just the Way You Are.” 

	











	Rock radio wouldn't touch Nebraska at all, which was genuinely shocking at the time, considering that it was (after all) the new Bruce album. “I think it's gonna do one of two things,” a radio tip-sheet expert predicted in Rolling Stone. “Either it's gonna continue a trend toward softer, more personal music being accepted by radio, or it's gonna be a complete bomb.” 


	My local rock station WBCN, in the Springsteen stronghold of Boston, played “Open All Night” for about a week and then gave up. The song had an electric guitar and a Chuck Berry riff, plus an anomalously upbeat mood (it's the twin of “State Trooper,” like an alternate-universe version of the guy's life), but no chorus, sounding dim on the radio. It fizzled at #22 on the Billboard rock “Top Tracks” chart, a certified dud, with even lower placements for “Atlantic City” and “Johnny 99.” That week, the top albums at rock radio were Rush (their controversial synth move Signals), Billy Squier, the Who (their awful farewell It's Hard), Don Henley (his first solo album), Bad Company, Kenny Loggins, Steve Winwood, and Men at Work. 


	When a star blows up into a superstar, as Springsteen did with The River, the cliched joke is that they could get a hit by breaking wind into the microphone — but Nebraska is the all-time test where that theory fails. He couldn't get this played on the radio even though people were buying it. After debuting at #29, it zoomed right to #4 the next week, a fast seller by 1982 standards. (It was the year's second-fastest rising album, behind Paul McCartney's Tug of War.) It peaked at #3, behind Cougar, Fleetwood Mac, and Steve Miller, just ahead of Michael McDonald. But radio wasn't biting.


	The movie has a brief mocking glimpse of MTV, just for a cheap laugh, when Springsteen is flipping channels between Badlands reruns. But it turned out to be MTV that embraced Nebraska after rock radio completely rejected it. The fledgling network picked up on “Atlantic City,” which had a gritty video that Springsteen (wisely) didn't appear in. At MTV they played “Atlantic City” like it was a monster hit, just because they were so grateful to have any Bruce product at all, but it fit in surprisingly well with all the weirdo Brit synth-pop acts of 1982/1983 — rock radio wasn't touching those artists either. Hearing it between Soft Cell and the Human League made so much more sense than hearing it between Rush and Journey. What made Nebraska all wrong for rock radio made it perfect for MTV, and it's fitting the New Wave kids were the ones who took “Atlantic City” to heart, especially considering how Springsteen was inspired by the avant-garde electro of Suicide and “Frankie Teardrop.”

	











	But the key reason Nebraska was a hit with staying power is that people heard themselves in these songs. Ronald Reagan is bizarrely never mentioned in the movie, not even a news clip in the background between reruns of Badlands. Virtually everything said or written about Nebraska in the Eighties, including by Springsteen himself, framed it as the dark side of Reagan's America. By the end of 1982, unemployment was 10.8 per cent, the highest since the Depression. Springsteen had already written a hit protest song about it, “Out of Work,” for Sixties rocker Gary U.S. Bonds, which (incredibly) went Top 40 that summer, with a third verse aimed right at “Hey Mr. President,” taunting, “Maybe you got a job for me just driving you around?”


	Then as now, the president did not care. As Reagan asked in March 1982, “Is it news that some fellow out in South Succotash someplace has just been laid off, that he should be interviewed nationwide?” But Nebraska portrays those losers in South Succotash as real people. As he told Rolling Stone, “Nebraska was about that American isolation: what happens to people when they're alienated from their friends and their community and their government and their job. Because those are the things that keep you sane, that give meaning to life in some fashion. And if they slip away, and you start to exist in some void where the basic constraints of society are a joke, then life becomes kind of a joke. And anything can happen.”


	Nobody now wants to admit they scoffed at Nebraska at the time, just as nobody admits booing Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival, as in the year's other big rock biopic, A Complete Unknown. But people sure did. As a reader complained on the Rolling Stone letters page, “I liked him a whole lot better as a Fifties remake.” This wasn't the Broooce people wanted, the guy who was already an affectionate caricature all through pop culture, as in Robin Williams doing his “Elmer Fudd Sings Springsteen” routine, or the great Dr. Demento Show parody where Bruce Springstone sings the Flintstones theme.

	That's why this album opened the door for all the Eighties bar-band faux-Bruce clones. Hell, Hollywood was in the middle of making Eddie and the Cruisers, an E Street fan-fic movie that got wildly popular on cable TV in the long wait between Nebraska and Born in the U.S.A. (The flick even has its own Nebraska-esque subplot where Eddie sticks it to the Man with his uncommercial art album, A Season in Hell.) 

	











	But then as now, people cherished the underdog aspect of the album — the artist taking a stand, defying the odds, staying hungry. As people were so fond of saying in 1982, Bruce got back to the eye of the tiger. That's why the album has gone down in history, the ultimate case of a superstar ripping it up to start again, in the mode of Kid A or Achtung Baby, Bowie in Berlin or Neil Young heading for the ditch. In 2007, when it was time for Kelly Clarkson to follow up “Since U Been Gone,” she pissed off her label with the deeply personal My December and called it her Nebraska — definitely a sign that this cultural myth had entered new territory. But that's what makes Nebraska one of the all-time great rock & roll arguments.

The AI boom is far more robust than the dot-com bubble, but there's still a risk it disappoints investors and sends shockwaves through markets and the economy, Liz Ann Sonders says.

Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist told Business Insider that ""extreme enthusiasm"" about innovation and circular deals between tech companies reminded her of the internet bubble 25 years ago.

But she said a key difference is that many dot-com companies were small and loss-making, whereas today's AI leaders are massive companies with strong balance sheets and fast-growing revenues and profits, she said.

For example, Nvidia became the first company to notch a $5 trillion market capitalization this week, but that valuation has some support in the form of the microchip giant's $47 billion revenue and $26 billion net income for the quarter ended July 27.

Sonders said the immense concentration of investor wealth in Big Tech companies means there's ""more exposure to the equity market than ever before."" She said that if a bear market takes hold, it ""could have feeders into the economy"" as consumers might balk at their portfolio losses and cut back on spending, curbing economic growth.

The Wall Street veteran said there's a danger that AI companies fail to deliver on their bullish growth forecasts, which have driven the stock market to record highs.

""That's the ultimate risk — that you've set the expectations bar too high,"" she said. In that situation, even a slight miss could trigger market behavior that's a ""little more egregious,"" she added.

Sonders said that speculation in more niche areas, such as meme stocks, drones, and quantum computing, made her a ""little less uncomfortable"" about investor exuberance, as ""you could have cracks in that armor show up"" without tanking the wider stock market.

She added that gold's surge to record highs of over $4,000 this month was an ""area where the enthusiasm pendulum swung maybe a bit too far,"" and the moves were ""more about FOMO than fundamentally driven.""

Sonders said it's tricky to gauge the health of the US economy right now as the government shutdown has disrupted some data releases: ""We're all flying this plane a little blind right now.""

But she said that economic gauges in recent months have shown rising pressure on lower-income consumers and a softening labor market, which could erode growth.

""It's not screaming 'recession is imminent,'"" Sonders said, but investors should ""be mindful"" of a weakening jobs backdrop.

Something went wrong

Stablecoins and payment use cases are exploding in popularity in crypto, drawing major institutional adoption while gaining a regulatory stamp of approval with the passing of the GENIUS Act in July 2025. 

The total stablecoin market cap has grown to more than $300 billion on-chain according to data from DeFi Llama, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has previously said that a $2 trillion market cap is reasonable for the asset class. 

Now, payments giant Stripe is collaborating with crypto venture firm Paradigm to build a blockchain specifically focused on stablecoins and their use in payments. 

Here's what you need to know. 

Tempo is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, layer-1 blockchain developed by Paradigm and Stripe. 

Unlike other layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana that are built for a wide variety of crypto activity, Tempo is purposefully designed for stablecoins and payments, banking on the experience Stripe has garnered from its 15 years in the field. 

In addition to promised low fees, the blockchain will operate at around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) and come with specific features designed to best facilitate real-world payment use cases and help bring more capital on-chain. 

The firm raised a $500 million Series A, valuing it around $5 billion, according to an October report from Fortune.

Tempo is being incubated by crypto venture firm Paradigm and global payments giant Stripe, with early design input from some of the world's largest companies—like OpenAI, Shopify, Visa, and more. 

The blockchain is initially using a set of independent validators, some run by early design partners, prior to transitioning to an open and permissionless network that enables validation by any interested party.

Additionally, in the early stages of Tempo's development, it is working with its design partners to test use cases on a private testnet related to real-world payments and stablecoin use, including cross-border payments, remittances, and more.

In September, Tempo unveiled a list of infrastructure partners that will help offer the building blocks of its network, including crypto wallets Phantom and MetaMask for wallet services, as well as protocols like Across and LayerZero for blockchain interoperability.

Stripe-acquired stablecoin platform Bridge and wallet infrastructure firm Privy are also included in the list of infrastructure partners. 

In October, the firm poached prominent Ethereum developer Dankrad Feist to help build out its network. 

Tempo's payments-focused design ensures that it maintains a feature set that's different from other networks. 

For example, the network allows for batch transfers and its transactions can make use of memo fields. Plus, its reported speeds of more than 100,000 TPS make it much faster than other popular layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana, which currently maintain true TPS numbers around 21.8 and 1,344 according to their respective block explorers.

Stripe's Tempo Blockchain Raises $500 Million, Poaches Prominent Ethereum Dev

Because Tempo is designed specifically for stablecoin use, it also comes equipped with an automated-market maker (AMM) that allows users to pay for gas or transaction fees with any stablecoin on the network. In other words, a user could pay for their transactions on Tempo with Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT stablecoin. 

Additionally, while blockchains are lauded for their transparency, Tempo boasts an opt-in privacy feature that allows users to keep select transaction data private while still adhering to typical financial compliance standards. 

Tempo is currently in private testnet, working with global design partners to build out existing payments use cases in a period of priority access. Some of its early design partners are also acting as the network's validators at present time. 

In the future, though, Tempo aims to be an open, permissionless blockchain, allowing any individuals to use, build, and participate in network validation.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

You'd be forgiven for forgetting -- it's been six years -- but Timea Babos still holds three titles, and with Luisa Stefani by her side, she's not done collecting hardware.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- They are gathered here, the best and the brightest tennis players of 2025. Who, we ask you would-be tennis aficionados, is the only one with multiple WTA Finals trophies in the case at home?

This week the question was posed to a number of people in and around the game -- and many came up empty.

The most popular answer was Katerina Siniakova, the 29-year-old from the Czech Republic with a total of 11 Grand Slam doubles to her credit. But, after losing in the WTA Finals twice in the past three years, she has only a single title, with Barbora Krejcikova three years ago in Guadalajara.

Other prominent vote-getters: Iga Swiatek (2023) and last year's singles winner, Coco Gauff, are proud owners of one title at the year-end championships. This is Elise Mertens' seventh trip to the WTA Finals (with her fifth doubles partner), but she, too, has only one title, captured three years ago in Fort Worth with Veronika Kudermetova.

“OK,” said Kudermetova, squeezing her eyes shut, racking her brain. “Maybe, maybe … it's Babos! Yes, yes!”

Indeed, Hungary's Timea Babos won three straight titles from 2017-19, twice with Kristina Mladenovic and once with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova. Going back to 2015, she qualified five consecutive times.

“Of course I knew that,” Babos said. “It's a unique achievement.”

After an absence of six years, at the age of 32, she's back at the year-end championships.

“Doubles is about partnerships,” Babos said, “and I needed a very good partner. I mean, yeah, obviously I am very proud of that. But I needed Luisa to be here again.”

“Vice versa,” said her partner Luisa Stefani, who is playing in her first WTA Final.

On Sunday night, the No. 7-seeded team has a challenging opening match scheduled against No. 2 seeds Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend.

The origin story for Babos and Stefani, like so many others in doubles, has a distinctly random vibe.

Babos finished in the doubles Top 10 for seven consecutive years, from 2015-21, but her ranking drifted into the 50s the past two. She began the season with Nicole Melichar-Martinez, and the pair went 5-3 in their first three tournaments. 

Stefani picks up the story:

“I had a tough end of the 2024 season [knee surgery], so I was looking to get more matches and get my rhythm back. I went to play Linz [Austria] with Ingrid [Martins], a good friend of mine, also from Brazil, but the cut was so high, we didn't get in. 

“I saw Timmy was on the list as well, playing with a singles player [Lulu Sun], so I called her. We had never talked before, but I had her number. I was like, `Hey, Timmy, this is Luisa. Like I'm here, the cut is really strong. Do you want to play together so we can both get in?' ”

Babos was at home in Hungary, about a two-hour drive from Linz.

“I was like, 'It's close. Get some matches. Why not?' ” Babos said.

When they entered the WTA 500 tournament, Babos was ranked No. 84. And then she and Stefani blew through the draw, defeating doubles star Siniakova and Zhang Shuai in the semifinals and Lyudmyla and Nadiia Kichenok in the final. Babos moved up 36 spots in the rankings, and a partnership was born.

They went on to win three more titles, at the WTA 500 Strasbourg and Tokyo as well as Sao Paulo, where Stefani was born. They reached the final in Ningbo, locking down their berths in Riyadh, and the Tokyo win punctuated their regular season.

The pressure of trying to qualify late in the season created some positive chemistry between the two.

“We not only held the pressure good, but we outstepped our own limits,” Babos explained. “It was very tough but fun and good at the same time.”

Added Stefani, “I like her competitive spirit, her passion -- the way she brings it on the court and backs herself up. Like …

“… Basically,” Babos interjected, “I'm nuts a bit.”

The three championship trophies sit in a straight row of the case by the large-screen television in Babos' living room back in Hungary. The last one was handed to her by Martina Navratilova, whose name -- thanks to a record 13 WTA Finals doubles titles -- is on the trophy.

Honesty, both players insisted, was the key to their burgeoning relationship.

“In the beginning, when we didn't know each other you're trying to be too nice, go around certain things,” Babos said. “Maybe don't be direct about what I think she should do better or could do better. This we improved a lot. After honesty, we solved the problems. 

“Obviously, we complement each other good. She stays on the forehand side, which obviously I need. Her skills on the net are very unique. She's one of the best there. I'm glad we found each other.”
