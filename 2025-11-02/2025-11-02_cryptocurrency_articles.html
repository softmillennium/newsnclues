                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The total stablecoin market cap has grown to more than $300 billion on-chain according to data from DeFi Llama, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has previously said that a $2 trillion market cap is reasonable for the asset class. Tempo is a new Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, layer-1 blockchain developed by Paradigm and Stripe. Unlike other layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana that are built for a wide variety of crypto activity, Tempo is purposefully designed for stablecoins and payments, banking on the experience Stripe has garnered from its 15 years in the field. In addition to promised low fees, the blockchain will operate at around 100,000 transactions per second (TPS) and come with specific features designed to best facilitate real-world payment use cases and help bring more capital on-chain. Tempo is being incubated by crypto venture firm Paradigm and global payments giant Stripe, with early design input from some of the world's largest companies—like OpenAI, Shopify, Visa, and more. The blockchain is initially using a set of independent validators, some run by early design partners, prior to transitioning to an open and permissionless network that enables validation by any interested party. Additionally, in the early stages of Tempo's development, it is working with its design partners to test use cases on a private testnet related to real-world payments and stablecoin use, including cross-border payments, remittances, and more. In September, Tempo unveiled a list of infrastructure partners that will help offer the building blocks of its network, including crypto wallets Phantom and MetaMask for wallet services, as well as protocols like Across and LayerZero for blockchain interoperability. In October, the firm poached prominent Ethereum developer Dankrad Feist to help build out its network. Plus, its reported speeds of more than 100,000 TPS make it much faster than other popular layer-1 networks like Ethereum and Solana, which currently maintain true TPS numbers around 21.8 and 1,344 according to their respective block explorers. Because Tempo is designed specifically for stablecoin use, it also comes equipped with an automated-market maker (AMM) that allows users to pay for gas or transaction fees with any stablecoin on the network. In other words, a user could pay for their transactions on Tempo with Circle's USDC or Tether's USDT stablecoin. Additionally, while blockchains are lauded for their transparency, Tempo boasts an opt-in privacy feature that allows users to keep select transaction data private while still adhering to typical financial compliance standards. Some of its early design partners are also acting as the network's validators at present time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the month started in typical fashion—on a bullish tear, the intense downturn didn't begin until October 10, when US President Donald Trump threatened new trade tariffs on China. Now, although the United States and China seem to have found a temporary truce, the cryptocurrency market has been unable to find similar relief. In fact, the latest on-chain data suggests that US investors are still less optimistic about the digital asset market, specifically Bitcoin. Negative Coinbase Gap Premium Coincides With Massive ETF Outflows In a November 1st post on social media platform X, crypto analyst Maartunn revealed that the world's largest cryptocurrency has seen extremely low demand in the United States in recent days. When the Coinbase Premium Gap is positive, it implies that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively. According to data highlighted by Maartunn, this on-chain metric is back around -$80, reflecting significant selling pressure from the US institutional players. This reduced demand can be seen with the disappointing performance of the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent days. Data from SoSoValue shows the Bitcoin ETFs registered a total net outflow of more than $191 million on Friday. This marked the third consecutive day of negative outflows, having seen withdrawals of nearly $500 million each on Wednesday and Thursday. From a historical perspective, a negative Coinbase Premium Gap is often correlated with periods of sluggish or downward movement for the BTC price. As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $110,200, reflecting a measly 0.9% jump in the past 24 hours. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quantum Threat to Bitcoin: How Panic Could Break Crypto Before Physics Does Bitcoin's quantum reckoning may still be years away, but the fear has already arrived. Breakthroughs from Google, Caltech, and IBM have reignited debate over a looming “Q-Day”—the moment when a quantum computer could shatter the cryptography securing Bitcoin and decentralized finance. Yet experts warn that the real danger may come first from people—not equations—with panic, premature market reactions, and slow developer preparation could shake confidence long before any code actually fails. Yoon Auh, founder of post-quantum cryptography company BOLTS Technologies, warned that even one mistaken claim about quantum computers breaking Bitcoin could set off a chain reaction, pointing to a recent flash crash in the market last month. “A $50 to $100 million sell-off—basically nothing in traditional markets—triggered massive losses across blockchain assets. Earlier this month, a single post from President Donald Trump threatening 100% tariffs on Chinese imports triggered the largest single-day crypto wipeout in history, erasing $19 billion in liquidations as Bitcoin briefly plunged below $102,000. Auh said the same dynamic could unfold after a quantum scare: “Imagine hearing someone say, ‘[Elliptic-curve cryptography] can be broken now, maybe not instantly, but soon.' The sell-off showed how quickly trust can collapse when information outruns verification. Quantum computers operate on principles that differ from anything in classical computing. Instead of bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states at once. When qubits become linked—a property called entanglement—they can process many possibilities simultaneously. That property makes certain kinds of math, like factoring and discrete logarithms, exponentially more efficient to solve. In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor proved that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer could, in theory, break the encryption securing everything from credit cards to Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin relies on elliptic-curve cryptography, or ECC, which turns private keys into public ones through equations that are easy to compute, but practically impossible to reverse. Bitcoin's specific system, known as secp256k1, uses these elliptic-curve equations to generate and verify signatures. Reaching that level will likely take another decade or more, though optimistic projections by IBM and Google place such machines in the early to mid-2030s. “Some people think quantum computers will never threaten encryption, and that might be true. But there's enough risk that we need to prepare well ahead of time.” Parker pointed to research in 2023 led by cryptographer Michele Mosca that put the median estimate for a cryptographically relevant quantum computer around 2037. Research scientist Ian MacCormack agreed that public fear has run ahead of what the technology can actually do. “Quantum computers are nowhere near powerful enough to break RSA-2048 or any encryption of meaningful size,” he said. MacCormack said the mystique of quantum computing, however, often amplifies fear. “People hear about quantum computing and it sounds god-like or incomprehensible,” he said. “But regardless of its potential, it's just an incredibly difficult engineering problem. Coin Metrics co-founder and Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter recently called quantum computing “the biggest risk to Bitcoin.” In his essay "Bitcoin and the Quantum Problem," he notes that nearly a quarter of all Bitcoin—about 4 million coins—already sits in addresses that have exposed public keys. Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of post-quantum cybersecurity company QuSecure, said the next step is clear: elliptic-curve cryptography has to go. “You'd need to replace that with one of the post-quantum standardized algorithms like ML-DSA,” she told Decrypt. ML-DSA, short for Module Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm, is a new post-quantum cryptography standard developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Cracking those grids would require solving what's known as the “Learning With Errors” problem—an equation so complex that even a powerful quantum computer can't untangle it efficiently. That makes ML-DSA far more resistant to decryption than the elliptic-curve systems used in Bitcoin today. IOTA relies on Winternitz one-time signatures in its “Tangle” network, protecting transactions from quantum key recovery. Nervos Network combines classical and lattice-based systems in a hybrid model that enables gradual migration to post-quantum security. Major chains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana remain in transition. Bitcoin's security model relies on network-wide consensus among miners, developers, and node operators. The hard part is making people care before it's urgent.” Most experts say the safest path is gradual: add post-quantum support now through new address types or hybrid signatures, get custodians and wallets to use them for new funds, and slowly migrate older wallets. Bitcoin contributors have already explored post-quantum signatures and hybrid schemes in developer forums. The challenge isn't finding algorithms; it's deciding when and how to deploy them. And something like $100 billion worth of early coins are still protected only by ECC.” Still, many Bitcoin developers argue that once a viable upgrade path exists, consensus will form around working code. Bitcoin's caution has protected it from bad ideas, but that same conservatism makes big changes hard to implement. A quantum computer powerful enough to break Bitcoin's encryption doesn't exist yet. Late last month, Google announced a new milestone in its quantum research: Its 105-qubit “Willow” processor completed a physics simulation in just over two hours that would take the Frontier supercomputer more than three years to reproduce. The experiment used 65 active qubits across 23 circuit layers, and achieved median two-qubit gate errors near 0.0015. The result marked a verifiable quantum speed-up but posed no threat to encryption—progress, not peril. Even researchers who view quantum computing as a long-term threat say the real danger is still years away. “However, it doesn't appear to be a real risk in the next few years. Quantum-computing technology and engineering still have too far to go before they can threaten modern cryptography.” The harder part, Peikert added, will be performance once post-quantum systems are deployed. As for near-term protection, Peikert said the best mitigation is behavioral, not technological. “In the short term, one should avoid revealing public keys on a public network until absolutely necessary, and give those keys short lifetimes,” he said. “Longer-term, core protocols should be carefully updated to incorporate post-quantum cryptography for the most important functionalities and assets.” Express agrees that quantum computing won't break Bitcoin anytime soon; what matters is whether the community can stay calm when it does.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet again, the digital economy was caught off guard when Amazon Web Services suffered its second major outage this year on Oct. 20, crippling exchange platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood and the analytics service Coinmarketcap. It was followed by a second, smaller outage just 10 days later. According to Amazon's initial report, the Oct. 20 outage was caused by a malfunction affecting one of its internal subsystems that manages its domain name service, leading to connectivity issues in multiple services. For two hours, numerous trading platforms, streaming services, payment providers and gaming networks were inaccessible to users globally. Going offline causes pain in just about every business, but for the crypto industry, where billions of dollars in value are traded by the hour, such events are unacceptable. And when it does, the impact is very often monumental, affecting millions if not billions of people globally. A case in point, just six months earlier, Amazon suffered a similar disruption, taking out two of the world's biggest crypto platforms — Binance and Kucoin — for several hours. Amazon isn't alone in this either, for rival clouds like Google and Microsoft Azure have suffered crippling outages of their own. In fact, Azure was down for several hours on Oct. 29, with reports suggesting it took offline numerous websites and online services. These vulnerabilities exist in every cloud, and no matter how diligent operators are they'll always present a risk. Coinbase was among the first services to report problems in the wake of Amazon's mishap, and it stepped up quickly to reassure its users that their funds are safe and secure. But this clarity doesn't fix the underlying issues of frozen transactions and delayed market orders —hat occur when systems go offline without any warning. By operating some key modules of the trading system on a distributed network of servers, exchanges will all but eliminate the potential for such calamities. For an industry that prides itself on decentralization and constantly lauds its benefits, to be so reliant on vulnerable centralized cloud platforms for their own infrastructure feels like hypocrisy. While blockchain networks are distributed across many hundreds of nodes, very few exchange platforms can say the same, instead choosing to host all of their infrastructure on one or another cloud provider. Fortunately, Monday's outage was not quite as serious as previous incidents have been, because Amazon had most services back up and running within a couple of hours, but nonetheless it should serve as a wakeup call for the crypto industry to get its act together. Decentralized cloud infrastructure still has teething problems around latency, network coordination and scalability, but it's maturing rapidly to support a hybrid cloud strategy at the very least. By distributing their data and systems across an expansive network, exchanges can become virtually immune to the total blackouts caused by an outage of this kind. Centralized clouds will always have their place due to their immense scale, high performance, enterprise-grade security and the specialized services they offer, which decentralized alternatives cannot match. With crypto exchanges commanding billions of dollars of customer funds in a market where every second counts, they need to step up and make sure this episode doesn't happen again.

Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market Musk, who has set crypto alarm bells ringing by moving some of the near-$1 billion worth of bitcoin he also controls via his rocket company SpaceX, helped U.S. president Donald Trump back into the White House last year with his dire warnings of imminent financial catastrophe. “It would be accurate to say that even unless you could go like super draconian … on cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country then …. U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $38 trillion U.S. debt pile. This is crazy,” Musk told Rogan during their marathon, three-hour conversation. Musk, who joined the Trump administration via his Doge department of government efficiency, dramatically fell out with president Donald Trump earlier this year over Trump's signature tax and spend bill that's expected to add trillions of dollars to the national debt over the next decade. Musk then confirmed speculation his new America Party would adopt bitcoin, calling the U.S. dollar and other so-called fiat currencies that aren't backed by assets, “hopeless.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “It is a horrible, no good situation,” Anthony Pompliano, a bitcoin and crypto influencer and the chief executive of Professional Capital Management, wrote in an emailed note. And it doesn't appear either of them will stop any time soon.” The bitcoin price topped $126,000 per bitcoin in early October but has failed to maintain the rally that's seen it more than double from its 2024 lows, dropping back as traders pile into gold and stocks while the U.S. Federal Reserve gears up to further cut interest rates and loosen its monetary policy. "In the short term, though, volatility still reigns supreme. Any trader considering high leverage in this market should think long and hard before committing.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum price prediction discussion has intensified after steady bids returned to large-cap cryptocurrencies. The focus now is whether momentum can carry ETH through year-end and what could benefit most if it does. If an Ethereum Price Prediction is bullish, a payments-first ETH project like Remittix can gain because demand is tied to use. Ethereum currently trades near $3,892 with a market cap of around $470 billion and a 24-hour volume near $24 billion, signalling active flows into the crypto market. A clear reclaim of $4,000 would add confidence to that view. Over the last week, news highlighted steady interest tied to exchange-traded product flows and key spot levels. Analysts noted that $3,800 support and $4,000 resistance are guiding intraday bias, with ETF flows adding follow-through when topside breaks hold. In brief, the base case Ethereum Price Prediction leans constructive if the price holds above support and volume stays firm. If an Ethereum Price Prediction calls for higher activity and fees, a payment rail that converts on-chain value into fiat can benefit from the same lift and gain. This makes Remittix a cleaner play on utility within the broader crypto market. Remittix is audited and the team is verified, and RTX holds the number one rank for Pre-Launch Tokens on Skynet with a Grade A score near 80. Listings are secured with a third listing in progress. Here Is What Stands Out About Remittix As Investors Look For The Best Crypto To Buy Now: Ethereum Price Prediction narratives work when there is a clear link to usage. ETH provides the base, and projects that help people move money across borders can magnify gains when activity rises. Remittix sits in that lane and ties value to payment outcomes. That is why Remittix stands out as attention shifts to utility.

The crypto market has faced one of its longest and toughest periods for altcoins. Many investors who held through this phase are sitting on steep losses, with prices struggling to recover despite strong macro signals. Analyst Michael van de Poppe believes this exhaustion phase could be nearing its end. This time, conditions again point to a transition. Inflation is no longer the Fed's main concern; employment and economic growth are taking priority. Weak labor and business data could force the Fed into more rate cuts. That would boost liquidity and create a favorable environment for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Van de Poppe said that gold, often a signal of risk-off sentiment, has recently peaked and fallen by nearly 10 percent. Historically, when gold cools off after a strong run, money begins flowing back into risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto. Bitcoin remains in a tight range around the $109,000 level, but its valuation compared to assets like gold and copper suggests it is undervalued. Van de Poppe expects this lag to close as liquidity shifts, potentially sending Bitcoin toward $150,000–$170,000 in the coming quarters. As Bitcoin regains momentum, altcoins are likely to follow. Many smaller cryptocurrencies are already showing signs of bullish divergence, a pattern that often marks the beginning of a recovery. The end of quantitative tightening, possible rate cuts, and a cooling gold market all point toward a return to risk-taking. This combination could mark the early stages of a new cycle. Altcoins, which have been in deep correction for months, may finally see relief once Bitcoin breaks key resistance around $112,000.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoins, the kind of crypto asset that aims to mirror real-world currencies rather than replace them, have been growing fast enough to raise fears they could eventually destabilize Canada's finances if the country doesn't change its approach. His former colleague Timothy Lane, who stepped down as deputy governor in 2022, was a little more blunt in an October report for the Global Risk Institute. "Stablecoins are becoming too important to be ignored," said Lane. "There is now an increasing sense of urgency about establishing a coherent framework for regulating stablecoins in Canada." One of Ruffolo's biggest worries is that some people and businesses could start to leave money in the stablecoin sphere, rather than in bank deposits. That's already how stablecoins first gained traction: as a stable place for crypto-traders to park money between bets, without having to exchange it back into conventional currencies. Given banks use deposits as an anchor for lending, he's warned that even if five per cent of Canadian bank deposits, or some $135 billion, went into U.S. stablecoins, it would have a knock-on effect of erasing as much as $675 billion in domestic lending capacity. The rising calls have increased expectations of some movement from the federal government, but given how slowly past promises like open banking have actually rolled out, some companies like Tetra aren't waiting around for change before pushing ahead with their own stablecoins. “Financial innovation in this country takes quite a long time,” said Lavallée. Because Tetra is already registered as a Canadian trust company, Lavallée sees an easier road than others to getting regulatory approval through the current system. Tetra's efforts have also had a boost from major backers like Wealthsimple, National Bank, ATB Financial and Shopify, which chipped in on a $10 million financing to help ready a stablecoin for release aimed at early next year. Elsewhere, Transactix Financial Inc. announced plans in May to move forward on its own token, and just last week Loon Technology Inc. announced it had raised $3 million to get its own Canadian-dollar stablecoin going. “I think it's working well,” said Grant Vingoe, head of the Ontario Securities Commission that's taken a lead role in stablecoin oversight. So far that approach has yielded a single issuer, Circle, getting the blessing of regulators for its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. But Vingoe is also still skeptical about how much uptake there will actually be for stablecoins. “I think it's still an open question whether stablecoins will be used extensively as a payment mechanism." Improvements to the existing payment system could end up being better or more efficient, he said. Some have pointed to central banks possibly issuing their own digital currencies, though the Bank of Canada has shelved work on such efforts. Swift, the private system that underpins global banking money flows, announced in late September that it was working “at pace” to add a blockchain-based digital ledger to allow real-time, round-the-clock cross-border payments. Vingoe also pointed to concerns about how widely stablecoins are used for illicit purposes, and said that overall Canada should find its own path, rather than imitating others. While it's not clear how much growth there may be in Canada, the global market is expected to balloon. Citigroup said in a September report that it sees the total pool of stablecoins growing from about US$200 billion at the start of 2025 to US$1.9 trillion by 2030 as its base case, or US$4 trillion in its bull case. As for the federal government, Finance Department spokesman Benoit Sabourin said in an statement that they're working on it.</p>

Why Do Many Believe It Will Replicate SHIB's & Dogecoin's Historic Runs? In such an environment, Solana-based projects and utility-driven tokens are gaining traction as investors look for platforms offering real-world use cases. Amongst the newer projects, Remittix (RTX) has positioned itself well, blending innovation with real-world practicality in DeFi space solution provisions for making payments. Shiba Inu trades at $0.00000992, up 4.2% in the last 24 hours, with a market capitalization of $5.83 billion and a trading volume of $171.77 million in the last 24 hours, up 27.25%. Interest in DOGE has been revived following news of a potential Dogecoin ETF, reflecting how signals from institutions can influence retail trading patterns. Among the low gas fee crypto initiatives is Remittix, choosing Solana's network for faster and cheaper transactions, hence making such platforms practical alternatives to Ethereum-based solutions. Remittix is a token that changes hands at $0.1166 each, while it has been able to raise over $27.7 m in private funding. Over 681.8 m RTX tokens have already been sold, indicating strong community engagement of interest. Moreover, the Remittix team has acquired full CertiK verification and is ranked #1 among pre-launch tokens, which attests to its commitment to security and transparency. That includes a 15% referral rewards program, crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries, and a $250,000 community give-away that sets up the token for utility and growth potential. Investor confidence, practical use cases, and community-driven features place Remittix among the most promising projects in DeFi during 2025. While all attention is turned to the latest events around Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Solana-based initiatives, RTX is quietly getting ready for mainstream with tangible real-world applications. With strong market momentum, robust security credentials, and an expanding user base, Remittix has shown just how a utility-first token can take center stage among meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE.
