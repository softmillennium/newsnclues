                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Behind bars I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. If there were, it would say so in his file.” We were in B-4, the mental health unit at Orange County Jail in Goshen, New York, known among incarcerated men and staff as the “bug-out” unit. I was 19 years old, newly incarcerated, and already diagnosed with several mental health disorders. However, on that day, I learned a harsh reality: in New York's jails and prisons, mental health services do not exist unless it is documented and part of your case file. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. When I was arrested in 2014, I came to jail with a psychiatrist's diagnosis already in hand: oppositional defiant disorder, depression, and severe anxiety. Before my incarceration, I was covered under my family's health insurance, which allowed me to see a psychiatrist and receive treatment that many others could not access. That single privilege, the ability to afford care and obtain a documented diagnosis, became the reason I qualified for mental health care in jail. Though the services were limited, I was at least provided monthly check-ins, medication, and placement in a housing unit that catered more to our individual needs than a general population unit would have. The unit I was housed in felt less like a place for healing, and more like a warehouse: somewhere to lock away people with visible symptoms until they could be filtered back into general population, which eventually is where I ended up. In 2017, I was sentenced and transferred to a state facility run by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS). What I found was worse: a system where treatment is reduced to a checklist, and if you are not already “on the books,” you do not qualify. I watched men beg for help and get turned away because they lacked a formal diagnosis before incarceration. I listened to stories from people who had been hearing voices since their teenage years, but whose requests for treatment were denied because they had never seen a doctor before prison. Correctional officers and even some mental health aides treat mental illness like a hustle, assuming people are exaggerating to get medication, avoid punishment, or score a free high. Depression, anxiety, and PTSD, conditions that disable so many, are dismissed as mood swings or bad behavior. That gap exposes the truth: people are coming to prison already suffering, but if they lacked access to doctors and diagnoses before incarceration, their pain remains invisible. In 2018, while at Clinton Correctional Facility, I stopped taking psychiatric medication. The side effects — weight gain, fatigue, emotional numbness — became unbearable. What I learned was that in prison, medication is often the only tool offered, and even that is reserved for those whose paperwork qualifies them. Real care such as counseling, trauma-informed therapy, and group support is almost nonexistent. The state treats medication as a substitute for healing rather than one part of it, reducing human suffering to a matter of dosage and compliance. A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm. A 2023 study from Harvard's Kennedy School found that even a single day in jail can cause lasting psychological harm, and prison only multiplies that harm. Constant surveillance, unpredictable violence, long-term separation from family, and the complete loss of control over your own life are not simply stressors; they are traumas that shape every waking moment. Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself. Instead of obtaining care, they are sent to solitary. The result is predictable: people leave prison more fragile than when they came in, carrying untreated wounds back into their communities. By tying care to prior diagnosis, DOCCS shifts responsibility away from itself. If a man spirals into psychosis but was never diagnosed before prison, the state can claim, “There was nothing in his file.” The suffering becomes invisible by design, hidden behind policy language and bureaucratic logic that prioritize liability over lives. This shield saves money, limits accountability, and allows lawmakers to say they are addressing mental health without making real investments. Screenings rarely account for the psychological toll of incarceration itself. Mental health care must be available to everyone, not just those with paperwork. Everyone should be screened at intake and again at regular intervals, ensuring that these screenings are conducted by independent clinicians rather than correctional staff. Prisons should offer talk therapy, group sessions, and trauma-informed care in every facility. Staff should be trained to recognize signs of distress and respond with care, not punishment. We know untreated mental illness drives higher recidivism rates, deepens cycles of poverty and violence, and fuels despair that can end in suicide. New York spends more than $3 billion annually on prisons yet continues to ration care as if acknowledging suffering were too expensive. People return home untreated, destabilized, and at higher risk of reoffending. Right now, DOCCS treats mental illness as a logistical problem. And many are leaving prison with scars that no file will ever record. We cannot medicate our way through this crisis. It requires care, presence, and a system that sees people rather than paperwork, because what is not written down still matters.

Photos of Palestine solidarity encampments have disappeared from the news, replaced by pictures of immigration agents kidnapping university students and community members, but the campus-based battle to force universities to divest from Israel and weapons manufacturing is still underway. “The campuses are definitely as active as they were a year ago from my purview,” says Akin Olla, communications director for the anti-militarist youth organization Dissenters. But, he adds, “The actions look different and are generally less media-friendly.” While this struggle continues, its shape has shifted, as students who were initially on the front lines of pro-Palestine activism experience additional vulnerability due to the Trump administration's attacks. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Since Donald Trump took office in January 2025, people on campuses have experienced a series of rollercoaster events around the status of international, immigrant, and undocumented students and staff. In March, there were a series of high-profile kidnappings of students on visas and green cards like Rümeysa Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil in retaliation for their activism on Palestine. Then on September 19, the Trump administration issued an executive order about H-1B visas that initially made it seem as if H-1B visa holders would no longer be able to come and go from the U.S. without their employers paying a $100,000 fee. There does not seem to be an end in sight to attacks on immigrant, undocumented, and international students, faculty, and staff, nor does there seem to be an obvious line that will not be crossed as the administration escalates its attacks. Contrary to Republican talking points, universities are not hotbeds of radical leftism. In reality, governing boards react swiftly and punitively to events that rock the boat. “Laura,” who chose not to give her real name because she is on the job market, found herself on the wrong side of her institution when she organized a series of speaking events about Palestine. The events featured high-profile speakers and highlighted the interconnectedness of Palestine to other issues, including campus repression of free speech, in an effort to build more solidarity with Palestine on campus. Many faculty, says Laura, have an “easy posture of learned helplessness” around difficult issues, insisting disingenuously that the university is not a political space. At the University of Central Florida, Talat Rahman, faculty union president and professor of physics, says that there is unfortunately not nearly as much support for organizing against the genocide as for resisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), although the two causes are interrelated. Rahman says there is a lot of fear on campus, but that “people can only be afraid for so long. At some point you have to live with your own conscience.” It's no coincidence that the attacks on students and immigrants on campus began with those speaking out against the genocide in Palestine, says Bill V. Mullen, professor emeritus of American Studies at Purdue and secretary-treasurer for American Association of University Professors local 6741. The overwhelming majority of university administrations are too risk-averse to offer real support to students facing an expanded immigration dragnet, so some faculty are responding to administrative compliance with ICE and the Department of Homeland Security by forming their own support networks. One national coordinating group is the new and growing Sanctuary Campus Network, which aims to pool ideas and resources so that faculty on any single campus don't need to reinvent the wheel. One early project of Sanctuary Campus Network was to develop an immigration-focused Know Your Rights training and slide deck that was adapted specifically for the campus environment. Similarly, the network has a large drive of materials for printing and use by faculty, like signs that can be placed on office or classroom doors indicating that these are private spaces (and therefore closed to immigration agents without a signed judicial warrant). Sanctuary Campus Network is broken up into five regions, and members meet regularly in smaller groups. Rachel Ida Buff, a writer and working historian currently teaching at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who is part of the Midwest region, says that these regional meetings have been “really, really useful,” and validating, allowing faculty to commiserate, share tactics, and build camaraderie with each other. These regional network meetings are especially important as a space to build a collective effort since the number of active faculty on an individual campus may be quite small. Laura says that a big part of her role in mentoring student activists is teaching that “activism is not always the flashiest thing.” Instead, it's often about “illuminating how power functions” and other less obvious goals, she says. Dana Morrison, member of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, explained that one of the group's goals is politicization. “How do you [participate in coordinated national events] if on your own campus, nobody has even uttered a political thing in the public space?” Morrison says that “you have to have the soil correct for anything to happen.” It's not just students on campus who are sometimes relatively apolitical. Sanctuary Campus Network co-founding member A. Naomi Paik pointed out that some faculty have little experience with activism and are just learning to organize. Mullen, who helped organize the second National Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17, 2025, as part of the Coalition for Action in Higher Ed (CAHE), says “overcoming hopelessness is a crucial organizing problem.” Campaigns like divestment struggles are long, much longer than the average tenure of a student activist. Several faculty members mentioned that student organizations that led earlier protests on their campus are in a process of reformation after all the leaders graduated at once. Faculty have much lower rates of turnover and can be present for a longer campaign, but activist faculty are careful about their role in relationship to students. Faculty would end up teaching students that their participation is not important. Instead, Morrison's Faculty and Staff Justice in Palestine chapter organized a successful divestment campaign focused on their labor union. Other faculty have engaged in pressure campaigns within their scholarly associations, like the Sociologists for Palestine campaign. Dyer says this joint community/campus structure also allows her and other involved faculty to show up to the group more as peer activists than specifically as faculty mentors. Similarly, Buff says campus sanctuary organizing on her campus in Milwaukee has benefited from collaborations with deeply rooted immigrant organizing in the city, and that Buff herself has benefited from looking to other activists as peers rather than often-fearful faculty colleagues. The struggle to protect international, immigrant, and undocumented students is deeply entwined with the longer-term struggle for a free Palestine and to build a more liberatory version of higher education itself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President claims government in Abuja is allowing Christians to be killed The US president said on Saturday that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack just days after warning that Christianity was “facing an existential threat in Nigeria” by Islamic extremists. “If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, ‘guns-a-blazing,' to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities,” Mr Trump said on Truth Social. “I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. On Friday, Mr Trump announced that he would designate Nigeria “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that had been pushed by some US lawmakers. The designation could lead to sanctions and include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid. Pete Hegseth, the defence secretary, shared Mr Trump's post and wrote on social media: “Yes, sir.” Its northeastern region is at the epicentre of a Boko Haram jihadist insurgency, which has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced more than two million since 2009, according to the United Nations. In central Nigeria, majority-Muslim herders have repeatedly clashed with majority-Christian farmers. The conflict is frequently portrayed as inter-religious but generally stems from competition over land access. Last month, Ted Cruz, senator for Texas, and Riley Moore, congressman for West Virginia, accused the Nigerian government of turning a blind eye to the “mass murder” of Christians. Claims of Christian persecution have also been pushed by some in Nigeria, where ethnic, religious and regional divisions have flared with deadly consequences in the past and still shape the country's modern politics. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,” Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Nigeria's president, said on social media on Saturday. On Sunday, Nigeria said it would welcome the US help in fighting Islamist insurgents as long as its territorial integrity is respected. The overall plan has been dubbed the “Donroe Doctrine” by insiders, and its aim, in part, is to rid America's backyard of Chinese influence. Nigeria holds vast reserves of rare earth elements like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are vital to consumer electronics and the American tech industry. In Venezuela, military strikes on drug-smuggling vessels have been framed as a national security threat and the need to revive American dominance in the region. Whether for show, or as part of a wider doctrine closing in on Latin America, the attacks remain controversial among legal scholars and some of the countries in America's “backyard”. The Justice Department told Congress this week that Mr Trump could lawfully continue his lethal strikes and that the 60-day limit on congressionally unauthorised deployments into “hostilities” does not apply in this operation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patel reportedly became furious after revelation he flew to visit girlfriend and agency fired official who oversees fleet A top FBI official with 27 years standing has reportedly been fired by the bureau after its director, Kash Patel, became enraged by press stories revealing he had used a government jet to travel to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a wrestling match. Steven Palmer, who had worked at the bureau since 1998, was fired as head of the FBI's critical incident response group which is responsible for handling major security threats as well as overseeing the agency's fleet of jets. Bloomberg Law, which broke the story, said that three unnamed sources had expressed astonishment at the sacking given that Patel's flight schedules were fully public and trackable on websites. A day after her performance, Patel himself had reposted photos showing him together with his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins, on his X account. Soon after, Palmer had been told he could resign instantly or be fired. Flight logs publicly trackable on Flight Aware for Patel's plane, N708JH, show that the jet landed at an airport near Penn State on 25 October. That evening Wilkins performed at a Real American Freestyle wrestling event, and the flight logs show Patel's FBI plane later flying to Nashville. A search for the government jet generates a message saying that it is “not available for public tracking per request from the owner/operator”. Patel himself has not responded to Bloomberg's report on the dismissal of Palmer. But earlier his spokesman, Ben Williamson, did post a lengthy statement on X in which he called criticism of Patel's jet travel “disingenuous and dumb” and “bad faith whining”. Williamson pointed out that the director is required under government rules to pay some reimbursement for the travel and claimed Patel had “significantly limited” personal travel compared with his predecessors Chris Wray and James Comey. In 2023, Patel scathingly dubbed Wray “#GovernmentGangster” and accused him of “jetting off on out (sic) tax payer dollars while dodging accountability for the implosion of the FBI on his watch”. Driscoll is now suing the Trump administration for unfair dismissal claiming he was targeted for showing lack of loyalty to the president. The government shutdown to which Seraphin alluded had entered its 32nd day. In a separate unflattering development for him, Patel is facing heat from a defense lawyer in Michigan who is objecting to the FBI director's allegations Friday that five young men had been arrested as they planned a Halloween terror attack. Makled told Associated Press that the FBI director's claims were “hysteria and fearmongering”. “I don't believe that there's anything illegal about any of the activity they were doing,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Turkey's largest oil refineries are scaling back purchases of Russian oil and turning to alternative suppliers, as the latest Western sanctions tighten restrictions on Moscow's exports used to fund its war against Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 2. New U.S. restrictions announced on Oct. 22 target Russia's two largest oil firms, Rosneft and Lukoil, along with their subsidiaries. According to Reuters' industry sources, the shift marks a notable change for Turkey — one of the main buyers of Russian oil, alongside India and China. The SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), owned by Azerbaijan's state oil company, has recently secured four shipments of crude from Iraq, Kazakhstan, and other non-Russian producers for December delivery, Reuters reported. These purchases amount to between 77,000 and 129,000 barrels per day, significantly reducing the refinery's intake of Russian oil. Tupras has already begun diversifying its crude sources, receiving its first-ever shipment from Brazil earlier this year and expecting a second from Angola in November. Together, they account for nearly half of the country's crude oil exports, around 3.1 million barrels per day, according to Russian estimates. Among them is Lukoil-Western Siberia, which alone accounts for around 40% of the group's hydrocarbon production. Yuliia Taradiuk is a Ukrainian reporter at the Kyiv Independent. She has experience as a freelance culture reporter, and a background in urbanism and activism, working for multiple Ukrainian NGOs. "We have strengthened the 'Patriot' component of our Ukrainian air defense. I thank Germany and personally Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz for this joint step to protect human lives from Russian terror." Ukraine's military reportedly struck a loading pier of an oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar Krai late on Nov. 1, Russian Telegram media channels reported. According to Reuters' industry sources, the shift marks a notable change for Turkey — one of the main buyers of Russian oil, alongside India and China. "Hypothetically speaking, (a meeting) is possible, but at this point there is no need for it," Peskov told the Russian state news agency TASS.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>California's Proposition 50 began as a warning from the nation's largest blue state to its largest red one: don't poke the bear. But when Texas moved ahead with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat. Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, who have cast it as a chance to check Trump's power. “California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country's democracy before our very eyes,” Newsom said at a rally, formally announcing the initiative, known as the Election Rigging Response Act. Proposition 50 asks voters to temporarily scrap the state's independently-drawn congressional district lines in favor of new maps carved up to help Democrats win five additional safe seats – a tit-for-tat response to Texas, where Republicans secured five new, friendlier districts earlier this year. Voting has been underway for weeks in the Golden State. As of Saturday, nearly 6m ballots had been returned, about one in four of the total mailed out, according to Political Data Inc, a firm that tracks voter data. Early returns and polling suggest the ballot measure is on track for a comfortable victory. Though it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election, several recent surveys showed it passing by more than 20 points. Their closing ad features Barack Obama, Newsom, and prominent congressional Democrats – including New York House member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – telling voters they have the power to “stand up to Donald Trump”. Opponents of the effort initially promised a formidable fight, but their campaigns were vastly outraised and support from national Republicans never materialized. California representative Kevin Kiley, a Republican whose district would be redrawn under the new maps, has called for a nationwide ban on mid-decade redistricting. Former California Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Trump critic who championed the commission's creation, harshly criticized Proposition 50. Madrid suspected that most people who voted for Proposition 50 hadn't even bothered to study the new districts. “It has nothing to do with redistricting,” he said. “This is about sending a message to Donald Trump.” National good governance groups such as Common Cause, which has historically fought partisan redistricting, opted to stay neutral on California's gerrymander. The view that politicians should not draw their own districts remains popular in California. Nearly two in three voters agree that the president treats California “worse” than other states, according to a CBS News/YouGov survey. Among those voting for the measure, 75% said opposition to Trump was a factor in their decision. “It brings me no joy to see the maps that the commission drew being pushed aside,” said Sara Sadhwani, a professor of politics at Pomona College who served as one of the mapmaking panel's Democratic members in 2020. “However, I do believe that in this moment, there is a greater fight that we have to wage in order to ensure a level playing field across the nation for the 2026 election.” Sadhwani appeared in one of the yes campaign's first ads, in which she warned: “Donald Trump's scheme to rig the next election is an emergency for our democracy”. Last month, he weighed in on Truth Social to preemptively discredit, without evidence, the “totally dishonest” results of Tuesday's election. Heading into election day, Democrats' confidence has given the campaign an air of inevitability – so much so that Newsom, to the surprise and delight of supporters, took the unconventional step of telling them last week: “You can stop donating now.” But the yes campaign say it is taking nothing for granted. Newsom spent the final weekend before Tuesday's special election traveling “up and down” the state, his team said, as tens of thousands of volunteers knocked doors and sent text messages reminding voters to return their ballots. Meanwhile, in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Newsom made it a point to say he was “deeply confident” that California voters would approve Proposition 50 – and said Trump was “changing the rules” and Democrats had to adapt. Wasserman estimates that passage of the California ballot initiative would probably improve Democrats' chances of winning the House majority next year by between 10% and 15%. But, with Trump having pushed Republican-led states such as Missouri and North Carolina to approve new maps and others poised to follow suit, he noted: “The problem for Democrats nationally is that they don't have enough Californias.” “We're depending on California to help a friend out, to help us out as a country,” said Texas state representative Nicole Collier, who fled the state with roughly two dozen of her Democratic colleagues to prevent a vote on the Republican gerrymander there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Canadians have been putting money into the red-hot housing market for years, and could be headed for financial pain with a correction underway, Tim Shufelt writes.Isabella Falsetti/The Globe and Mail Every conversation about financial markets these days eventually veers toward the question of whether we are in a bubble – AI, gold, Big Tech. Home prices in Canada have been grinding lower for 3½ years and counting. And still, the long-awaited rebound has yet to materialize. “It's going to be at least five to 10 years from the peak before we get back to 2022 prices, just because of how frothy valuations got in housing,” said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist with Bank of Montreal. “Real estate as an asset class in Canada is pretty-much dead for now.” When you look back to major housing busts in recent history, this one is tracking fairly close to precedent. In parts of the Prairies and Atlantic Canada, sales growth is much stronger. Once you factor in inflation, that figure rises to 30 per cent. But in terms of depth and duration, it's very much on par, so far. In those two prior downturns, it took 10 years and 12 years, respectively, for home prices to recover to their previous highs. Canada's bear market in housing will drag on simply because it has to rebalance from a confluence of stimulants that is not likely to ever be repeated, Mr. Kavcic said. They include peak demand from millennial buyers, peak immigration to Canada, pandemic-era mobility, excess liquidity from government stimulus, rock-bottom interest rates, and rampant market speculation. From January, 2005, up to the housing market's peak, the average home price more than tripled in Canada, topping out at about $820,000. One side effect of a two-decade property boom is that it increasingly put Canadians' homes front and centre of their finances. Even after the correction, real estate accounts for more than 40 per cent of total household assets, according to Statistics Canada data. Even though Canadians have record high levels of stock-market exposure, equities make up just 26 per cent of the average Canadian's total assets. A recent survey found that half of unretired homeowners plan to rely on the sale of their home to set themselves up for retirement, according to a report released by Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan in June. A similar poll conducted last year found that one-third of Canadians are relying on their home as their only financial plan for retirement, according to a Re/Max report. If you're counting on the equity in your home to finance your retirement any time soon, then you're obviously vulnerable to declining property values. Perhaps the stock market is in a bubble that will end badly. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following. © Copyright 2025 The Globe and Mail Inc.

Toronto lost to Los Angeles, but Mark Kingwell writes that some moments from the game represent the Blue Jays at their best.Kevin Sousa/Reuters Baseball is not a religion but it sure feels like one sometimes. Above all, the return of days, the year-guiding calendar of spring training, regular season, and post-season. Los Angeles Dodgers fans watch Game 7 during a Dia de Los Muertos party at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.Mario Tama/Getty Images Let's agree, in an ecumenical spirit, that this combined observance of joy and mourning now embraces all Blue Jays fans, regardless of what other belief systems they may honour. We all saw the post-game tears and disappointed thousand-yard-stares of this so very likeable team, this cheerful band of brothers. A solitary Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the dugout will join, for some of us, Pafko at the wall as an enduring image of baseball's infinite capacity for pain. Dodgers clinch World Series after 5-4 win over Blue Jays Blue Jays mourn the World Series win that slipped away Record-setting post-season hits, complete games, marathon extra innings, multiple future Hall of Famers on both benches, the two-decade range between two of our starting pitchers, a bench-clearing almost something – the list of superlatives goes on. But baseball is made of more than records and stats, much as they feature prominently in the narrative of the sport. Like most fans, for me it is singular images that will stay in the mind, forever cementing this magic season and series, the last one before robo-camera challenges and other threats to the crooked timber of the game's humanity. So: Just from Game 7 I will cherish a few freeze-frames of my favourite players at their winning best, even if ultimately they lost. Bo Bichette's grim hit-man satisfaction after hitting a three-run homer, dropping his bat contemptuously like a discarded McMillan TAC-50 rifle. Guerrero's open-mouthed glee as he bolted for the dugout after turning that perfect 3-6-3 double play. Ernie Clement's joyful, surely unnecessary playground slide into home after throwing off his batting helmet in a pure dash around third, looking around like a happy 12-year-old to see who's watching. Ernie Clement slides into home plate to score during the sixth inning.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press Because this was, above all else, an eminently watchable team, fun to follow, brimming with love of the game. I'm biased, I know, but they were so much more charming than the po-faced Dodgers, those dour, greedy seekers after a repeat title. They were resilient, courageous, buzzy, and creative. They made things happen, sometimes by conjuring something out of nothing, as great players can. Baseball is not an art form any more than it's religion, but these Jays played it like they were artists, every one of them, with an expansive play of imagination and collective exercise of their talents. (Like it or not, the super-slo-mo replay of Alejandro Kirk's awesome swing will take up semi-permanent residence in my mental theatre.) Cathal Kelly: Congrats on the loss, Toronto. Now we deal with the loss of all that, the harsh, unforgiving logic of what might have been. Now November continues its bleak course into winter. I attended my first Blue Jays game in 1978, driving in from Mississauga with my uncle in his old Chevy Monte Carlo, parking in somebody's yard for five dollars, and walking over to Exhibition Stadium – the Mistake by the Lake – to buy actual paper tickets from a human being at a kiosk. From that day to this, like so many other fans, baseball has sustained me. This is a hard moment, fellow believers, but we are blessed to be here for it.

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. Russian troops repelled an attempt by Ukrainian forces to break through toward the settlement of Grishino in the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and eliminated all involved personnel, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

"An attempt by militants of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' 425th Assault Regiment Skala to break through in an armored combat vehicle toward the settlement of Grishino in the Donetsk People's Republic has been thwarted. All militants were eliminated," the ministry said.

Russian forces are also completing the clearing of enemy forces in Gnatovka and Rog near Krasnoarmeysk, the Ministry of Defense said.

The ministry also reported that Russian troops struck energy facilities that support the operation of Ukraine's military-industrial complex, as well as sites used to store and prepare Ukrainian long-range strike drones, over the past 24 hours.

"Operational-tactical aviation, strike UAVs, missile troops, and artillery of the Russian Armed Forces delivered strikes against energy facilities supporting enterprises of Ukraine's military-industrial complex, sites for storing and preparing long-range strike unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as temporary deployment points of Ukrainian armed formations and foreign mercenaries in 141 locations," the ministry stated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, entrenched in a long-standing brawl with Brussels and Kyiv, found an unexpected obstacle — U.S. President Donald Trump's U-turns. Trump's expected Budapest summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin — which was to be Orban's crowning achievement — has been canceled. Trump's sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia's leading energy companies, prompted rare criticism from Orban, who said on Oct. 27 that the step went too far. As Russian supplies cover most of Hungary's oil and gas demand, experts say that Orban is likely to stand his ground, especially with the election season heating up. When Trump won the U.S. election last year, Orban was jubilant. Hungary's leader hoped the U.S. president — who has endorsed him and shares his conservative, anti-immigration views — would disrupt Western unity on continued support for Ukraine. However, the latest Trump policy shift does not seem to align with Orban's expectations. Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow while urging European nations — including Hungary — to cease importing Russian oil and gas, a strategy designed to force Moscow into peace talks. This puts Orban into a tight spot, as his government has declared that swift decoupling from Russian imports without endangering its energy security is impossible, namely due to its geographical location. "We can't ensure a safe supply for our country without Russian oil or gas sources," Hungary's chief diplomat, Peter Szijjarto, said in September. Unlike much of the EU, Budapest made no steps to reduce its reliance on Russian imports. Hungary also signed a 15-year deal with Russia's Gazprom in 2021 to purchase natural gas mainly via the TurkStream pipeline, seeking increased volumes as the war rages on in Ukraine. "Orban desperately tries to maintain ties with Russia, repeatedly declaring he would be the first one to return to Moscow," said Pavel Havlicek, a research fellow at the Association for International Affairs in Prague, underscoring Budapest's political — rather than just economic — motivations. Though options exist, "it's also the question of political willingness and the financial cost of this choice," says Andrej Nosko, an energy policy expert and visiting researcher at Matej Bel University in Slovakia. A comparable example is Czechia, another landlocked country that used the Druzhba pipeline until declaring itself free of Russian oil this April. Orban, in turn, has shown no inclination toward abandoning Russian energy, which has driven massive profits for Hungary's MOL oil and gas company. Cheap utilities could also offer valuable political leverage ahead of the upcoming elections. However, as Nosko notes, MOL's profits have not translated into lower fuel prices for Hungarian consumers. While Trump could use the threat of secondary sanctions to pressure Orban, it seems Hungary is instead seeking "waivers from new U.S. sanctions and leveraging its strong ties with Trump to avoid having to diversify away from Russian supplies," Nosko told the Kyiv Independent. According to Demeny, Orban might also use a new plan from Hungary's Energy Ministry, which suggests reducing dependence on Russian energy, to show at least some progress toward diversification and thus appease Trump. But the hastily announced plan was scrapped mere days later, reportedly after Washington realized Moscow was not ready to concede on its maximalist demands on Ukraine. According to Pavlicek, the Hungarian prime minister also seeks to legitimize his foreign policy stance by having other world leaders, namely Trump, share and amplify these views. Orban's image as a leader who kept his country out of the war while ensuring energy security through "pragmatic" ties with Moscow has been a prominent feature of the Fidesz campaign.

MOSCOW, November 2. /TASS/. The plan proposed by US President Donald Trump for resolving the conflict in the Gaza Strip is currently functioning as intended, Palestinian Ambassador to Russia Abdel Hafiz Nofal told TASS.

"So far, Trump's plan is proceeding normally," the diplomat noted.

The ambassador stressed the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. "There have been violations by Israel, we are aware of that. But the worst outcome would be if the war resumes," he said, stressing that the first stage must proceed properly and that the second stage will be the most difficult due to the involvement of international organizations, as well as issues related to the disarmament of Hamas.

In the context of the settlement process, the diplomat also highlighted the importance of three key principles: "ending the war, releasing the hostages, and ensuring that the Israeli army withdraws from Gaza."

On October 9, Israel and Hamas, with the mediation of Egypt, Qatar, the United States, and Turkey, agreed to implement the first stage of the peace plan presented by US President Donald Trump. Under the plan, a ceasefire in Gaza came into effect on October 10.</p>

TORONTO, Nov 2 (Reuters) – Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was named Most Valuable Player of baseball's World Series early on Sunday after leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a repeat championship. The Japanese right-hander secured the win for the Dodgers when, with runners on first and third and one out, he got Alejandro Kirk to ground into a season-ending and championship-clinching double play. In his 17-2/3 innings over the World Series, Yamamoto had a 1.02 ERA and 15 strikeouts while allowing 10 hits, two runs and two walks. The Japanese right-hander, who the Dodgers signed for 12 years and $325 million in December 2023, is also the first pitcher with three wins in a World Series since Arizona's Randy Johnson in 2001.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A fire at a general store in northern Mexico has killed at least 23 people, the state governor said Saturday. The blaze happened at an outlet of the Waldo's chain in the city of Hermosillo, capital of Sonora state, Governor Alfonso Durazo said in an online video address. “So far, there are reports of 23 people dead and 11 injured who are being treated at different hospitals in the city. Unfortunately, among the victims are minors,” he said. The tragedy “has left a deep sadness among all the people of Sonora,” he added. Twelve women, five men, four boys, and two girls were among those killed, reported local radio station Uniradio Sonora, citing Carlos Freaner, president of the Mexican Red Cross. CNN has contacted both the city and state governments for comment. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum sent her “heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who died in the fire.” The Sonora Public Security Secretariat said on X that the fire was not caused by an arson attack or other intentional act of violence, without giving more details about the cause.
