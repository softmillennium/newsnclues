                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and prominent Republicans swiftly backpedaled from Donald Trump's assertion that the US will run Venezuela in transition after US forces snatched the president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to the US to face federal criminal charges. The secretary of state was challenged repeatedly in a number of appearances to confirm whether the US would run Venezuela. He added that the US would “set the conditions” so that Venezuela is no longer a “narco-trafficking paradise” aligned with US adversaries including Iran and militant proxies such as Hezbollah. ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked a follow-up question. The previous day Trump, speaking at a press conference in Florida just hours after the strikes and raid on Caracas and elsewhere in Venezuela, said the US would run Venezuela “with a group” and would be “designating various people” in charge, while pointing to Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Dan Caine, behind him. Trump also said that Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now considered the interim president by Venezuelan leadership, had spoken to Rubio and had told the US she would do whatever it needed, with Trump adding: “She really doesn't have a choice.” Rodríguez appeared on state television in Venezuela not long afterwards and, in contrast, was sharply critical of the US actions and insisted that the country “will never again be anyone's colony”. Do I know what decisions they're going to make? But I know that if they don't make the right decisions the United Sates will retain multiple levers of influence to ensure our interest are protected and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things … we're going to see what they do.” And Rubio told NBC that the US was not at war in Venezuela and did not currently have US forces on the ground there. In response to anchor Kristen Welker asking if he, Hegseth or any of the US leadership Trump indicated was going to be running Venezuela during its transition, Rubio said: “Well, it's running policy … we want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.” Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also rowed back on Trump's assertions, saying there were “still a lot of questions to be answered” about what happens next in Venezuela. Trump on Saturday was dismissive of the opposition, headed by recent Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, who is in exile, saying she did not have sufficient support and respect in Venezuela, without being more specific about whether he was referring to leadership, the military or voters. Meanwhile, on Sunday Trump threatened Rodríguez that “if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” In a telephone interview with the Atlantic magazine Trump also appeared to acknowledge US aspirations in the country as amounting to something congressional Democrats say they were explicitly told was not the plan – regime change. Cotton said the US did not recognize Rodríguez as legitimate. “Our demands are … that we want them to stop the drug trafficking. We want them to stop the weapons trafficking. Meanwhile, earlier on CBS, Rubio referred to the current Venezuelan regime and defended the US decision not to remove more of Maduro's inner circle. “You're gonna go in and suck up five people?” he said. “Okay, they're already complaining about this one operation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Technocrat must accommodate US demands while shoring up a regime that is hated by many Venezuelans In her first speech as Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez lambasted the US and pledged fealty to Nicolás Maduro. But the Trump administration has made a cold calculation: she will bow to Washington. The US president has not ruled out deploying ground troops but appears to want to “run” Venezuela through Rodríguez, who finds herself in charge of a regime shocked and demoralised by the abduction of Maduro yet still in power. The 56-year-old former labour lawyer struck a defiant tone in her televised speech on Saturday night. History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay,” she said. In a crisis that blends political theatre, military power and economic calculation, the defiance may have been to some extent performative – a sop to the Bolivarian revolution's humiliated loyalists, especially those in the armed forces, while Rodríguez consolidates her position. To stay in power – assuming that is her goal – she must accommodate US demands while shoring up an authoritarian regime that is despised by many Venezuelans. One wrong step could trigger an internal putsch, a street uprising or another blast of US firepower. Where Venezuelan opposition figures see an apparatchik of Maduro's dictatorship, the Trump administration sees a potential business partner. A senior official told the New York Times: “I'm not claiming that she's the permanent solution to the country's problems, but she's certainly someone we think we can work at a much more professional level than we were able to do with [Maduro].” Machado dedicated that prize to Trump as she courted the US leader and supported the Pentagon's military buildup in the Caribbean – but on Saturday Trump said she lacked support and that it would be “very tough” for her to lead Venezuela. Millions of Venezuelans revere Machado but she is unacceptable to the military hierarchy that props up the regime, said one informed source in Caracas. That US forces then kidnapped her boss is an irony doubtless not lost on Rodríguez. A student leader, she studied law in Caracas and Paris and joined Chávez's government in 2003, following the path of her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, a psychiatrist who served as vice-president and is currently head of the national assembly. Under Maduro she was promoted to senior posts, including foreign minister, and became vice-president in 2018. Unlike many of Maduro's inner circle, Rodríguez has not been indicted for drug trafficking or other charges in the US. Trump's team hope it has found a market-friendly technocrat who can steer the regime while taking direction from Washington. Venezuela's opposition leaders, despite being sidelined by Trump, sense opportunity. “Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and seize power,” said Machado. Having tasted military success, Trump seems hungry for more chances to use force. What is left of the Bolivarian revolution – a socialist experiment that morphed into quasi-capitalism – still needs rhetorical justification.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leaders try to focus on what comes next, as backing for ejection of Maduro mingles uncomfortably with voicing of support for international law European leaders emerged divided and torn as they tried to welcome the ejection of Venezuela's authoritarian president, but still uphold the principles of international law that did not appear to allow Donald Trump to seize Nicolás Maduro, let alone declare that the US will run Venezuela and control its oil industry. Europe tried to focus on the principle of a democratic transition, pointing out that the continent had not recognised Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela since what were widely regarded as fraudulent elections in June 2024. But Trump's rejection of the Nobel prize-winning Venezuelan opposition figurehead, María Corina Machado, was awkward. Trump said she did not have support or respect in Venezuela, but European leaders have embraced her as leading an opposition that deserves power. International lawyers say the US rejection of Maduro's legitimacy opens a path for Washington to argue that he does not enjoy sovereign immunity as a head of state in the US domestic courts, in the same way that George Bush was allowed to try Manuel Noriega in the US after his capture in 1989. The US action was a breach of international law unlike any before, she said. “Nicolás Maduro presided over a brutal and repressive dictatorship that brought about unimaginable suffering on the Venezuelan people. The EU foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The EU has repeatedly stated that Maduro lacks legitimacy, and has defended a peaceful transition. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also focused on what might happen next. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also dived for cover. In an act of solidarity he also spoke to Machado. “France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that sovereign peoples alone decide their future,” he said. Keir Starmer shed no tears over Maduro's departure and mentioned the importance of international law, but the UK prime minister did not discuss how it might apply in this instance. Those who advocate for international law may now find themselves appealing to a vanishing world order in which Venezuela is the latest burial in an already crowded graveyard. Trump's actions cement a new system in which the naked self-interest of two or three “great powers” dominates. In this world order, Washington and Beijing will decide on the basis that might is right. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, explicitly threatened on Saturday that Cuba was next. “Cuba is a disaster, run by incompetent and senile men,” he said. The advocates of multilateralism and international courts may also need to reflect on their own failures. Nizar El Fakih , a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: “Multilateralism did not deliver a single effective negotiation process leading to an orderly, peaceful and negotiated transition, despite years of appeals by millions of Venezuelans who voted, protested and exhausted every available civic mechanism at enormous personal cost. “The international criminal court, with an investigation open since 2021, has yet to issue a single indictment, despite extensive documentation of crimes against humanity by the United Nations fact-finding mission on Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and hundreds of victims”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many hundreds of people, some cradling flower bouquets, walked in the dense snaking procession in the bright sunlight past shuttered stores. Then they broke out into sustained applause – hands in gloves and mittens against the cold – as a stream of mourners and well-wishers deposited flower bouquets at a makeshift memorial piled with flowers, cuddly toys and other tributes. “Through this tragic event, I believe we must all remember that we are all brothers and sisters in humanity,” Véronique Barras, a local resident who knows grieving families, said. Swiss prosecutors investigate two bar operators after fire kills 40 on New Year's Eve “We need more safety in these places because it's not the only place like this. “There are no words strong enough to express the dismay, anguish, and anger of those who are affected in their lives today. And yet, we are here, gathered because silence alone is not enough,” he said. In the crowded pews, a grieving woman listened intently, her hands clasped tightly and sometimes clasping rosary beads, as speakers delivered readings in German, French and Italian. Forty people died and 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s. By Sunday morning, Swiss authorities identified 24 out of the 40 fatalities. One of the victims was 16-year old Arthur Brodard, whose mother had been frantically searching for him. “Our Arthur has now left to party in paradise,” a visibly shaken Laetitia Brodard said in a Facebook story posted on Saturday night, speaking to camera. Authorities investigating the New Year's blaze have identified 24 of the 40 people killed, including 11 minors and six foreign nationals, police said on Jan. 4.MAXIME SCHMID/AFP/Getty Images Brodard also had given her DNA sample to help in the identification process. In her Facebook post, she thanked those who “testified their compassion, their love” and to those who shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son. Other parents and siblings are still waiting in anguish. Le Constellation bar is still largely shielded from view by white screens as the investigation continues.Jean-Christophe Bott/The Associated Press Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation of the bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, the Valais region's chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, told reporters Saturday. Officials said they also would look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes. Swiss President Guy Parmelin announced a national day of mourning for the victims on Jan. 9. France's Health Minister Stéphanie Rist said 17 patients have received care in France, out of a total of 35 transferred from Switzerland to five European countries. Forty people died and 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian air defense systems shot down 132 Ukrainian drones overnight on Jan. 3-4, including 11 intercepted over Moscow Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed. Emergency crews are working to clear debris at the crash sites, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said. Moscow's Vnukovo and Zhukovsky airports introduced temporary flight restrictions during the attack, according to Russia's federal aviation agency. Ukrainian drones were also shot down over Bryansk, Oryol, Kursk, Rostov, Belgorod, Tula, Kaluga, Voronezh, Moscow and Lipetsk oblasts, the Russian Defense Ministry said. Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear to undermine Russia's ability to wage its all-out war. While drone attacks on Moscow have been recorded on several instances and often brought about temporary airport closures, the capital is also well-defended against aerial threats. Ukraine reportedly attacked the Syzran oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a number of Russian military facilities in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine on Dec. 28.

Deineko has been appointed as an adviser to Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko. A permanent replacement to lead the State Border Guard Service will be named shortly, Zelensky said. The enemy is suffering significant losses in manpower and equipment," Ukraine's Air Assault Forces said. NIS, one of the few remaining Russian energy assets operating in Europe, was sanctioned by Washington last January as part of broader efforts to restrict Russian energy exports. Russian air defense systems shot down 132 Ukrainian drones overnight on Jan. 3-4, including 11 intercepted over Moscow Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed. Thirteen drones struck nine different locations, according to the statement. "The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country," Donald Trump said on Truth Social. Zelensky told reporters that his government "reboot" applies to various institutions, including Ukraine's Armed Forces, but added that "replacing the commander-in-chief is not envisaged at this time." He's killing too many people," Trump told reporters on Jan. 3 during a news conference announcing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's capture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Israeli hostage Romi Gonen said she endured repeated sexual assault, harassment and intimidation during her 471 days of Hamas captivity, speaking publicly for the first time about her experience and her fear of becoming a “sex slave” in Gaza. Gonen, now 25, was kidnapped at age 23 from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, and released as part of the January 2025 hostage deal. In a two-part interview broadcast this week on Israel's Channel 12 program Uvda, she recounted several incidents of sexual harassment and assault by three different men. And fear – it sometimes paralyzes,” Gonen said, describing what she called the “worst” assault. “There was this one moment in the bathroom, I was crying like crazy,” she said, “and he was having the time of his life, ecstatic, as if he had received the gift of a lifetime.” Looking through a small window, she said, she was struck by “The dissonance between the beautiful, ordinary clean life outside – and the filth, beastliness, and disgust happening inside the bathroom.” In the aftermath of the assault, she recalled thinking: “Romi, everyone in Israel thinks you're dead, and you're going to be his sex slave for life… Then he comes up to me, puts a gun to my head, and tells me, ‘If you tell anyone, I am going to kill you. Gonen, who suffered a gunshot wound to her arm during the October 7 attack, said she spent the first 34 days of captivity alone, moving between houses and captors. But no, I'm not strong, and no, you can't heal from such a thing, you can't,” she said, in tears. I was wounded, powerless, and couldn't do anything. “And I had to continue living with him in that house afterward.” I start crying insanely, and he says, ‘Be careful. If you don't calm down, I'll get angry,” she said. I sit on the toilet pulling down my pants with one hand, so he won't see anything. Ibrahim keeps bothering me endlessly, touching my leg and thigh. At one point, Gonen said, senior Hamas commanders learned she was shaken by one of the assaults, they led her through tunnels to make a phone call. “I picked up the phone, and he said ‘Hello.' He asked me to tell him everything that happened,” she said, recalling his proposal for “some kind of deal. ‘I will put you at the top of the release list, and in return, you will promise me that you will keep quiet.” She identified the man's voice as belonging to Izz a Din al-Haddad, then head of the Hamas Gaza Brigade, and now the group's Gaza leader, whom she said she also met in person during her captivity. “They often silenced my story and told me not to tell it,” Gonen said. “Now I am here, sitting in front of the camera, and honestly, no one will silence me anymore. It happened to me, and it was terrible, and I deal with the consequences every day, but I am here. What we know about rape and sexual violence inflicted by Hamas during its terror attack on Israel Gonen is not the first Israeli hostage to report sexual abuse in captivity. A July 2025 report by a group of Israeli researchers known as the Dinah Project found that 13 women and two men who survived captivity by Hamas said they experienced or witnessed sexual violence while being held hostage in Gaza. Drawing on their testimonies, forensic reports, photographs and videos from the October 7 attacks, researchers concluded that Hamas used sexual violence in a widespread, systematic and “tactical” way as a “weapon of war.” In November 2025, Rom Braslavski, a security guard kidnapped from the Nova festival on October 7, became the first male hostage to speak publicly of sexual abuse in Gaza. A short while after he was released in the October 2025 ceasefire deal, Braslavski told Channel 13's “Hazinor” that he was subjected to “horrific” and humiliating sexual violence and abuse. “They stripped me of all my clothes, my underwear, everything,” he said, adding, “It is sexual violence, and its main purpose was to humiliate me. A 2024 report by the UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten found “reasonable grounds to believe” that conflict-related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred during Hamas' October 7 terror attacks, as well as “clear and convincing” information that hostages in Gaza were sexually abused.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has dismissed Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado as a potential national leader, despite the Nobel laureate's vocal support of the US military operation against her own country. Early on Saturday, US forces carried out airstrikes on the oil-rich country and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro, along with his wife. Both were transferred to the United States and charged with conspiracy to traffic narcotics, allegations Maduro has long denied. During a press conference, Trump was asked whether he was in contact with Machado or viewed her as a viable leader following Maduro's capture. Machado, a former congresswoman who maintained close contacts with the US government for decades, has previously led anti-government protests and accused Maduro of “illegally” seizing power during the 2024 elections. She was barred from holding public office after authorities accused her of backing foreign sanctions and calling for US military intervention. In December, Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for what the Nobel Committee described as “her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.” Asked if she backed US military action against her own country, Machado later said she believed “the escalation that's taking place is the only way to force Maduro to understand that it's time to go,” yet insisted this is “not regime change, this is enforcing the will of the Venezuelan people.” President Trump declared on Saturday that the US will now “run” Venezuela and control its oil production until a proper “transition of power,” while threatening to stage a “second and much larger attack” if Caracas refuses to cooperate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of Americans woke up with the same question on the first Saturday of a new year: Are we at war with Venezuela? President Donald Trump's ouster of President Nicolás Maduro has stunning implications for Venezuela, American global power, and the shattered remnants of constitutional curbs on US presidents and international law. But Trump's claims overplay Venezuela's role, and his transparent relish at wielding a big stick in his geopolitical backyard highlights more ambitious motives. But the swoop against Maduro was a stunner, and not just because the overthrow of a foreign leader is considered an act of war. Trump's entire political philosophy was rooted in avoiding any more US shock-and-awe operations to enforce overseas regime change after two decades of quagmires. Trump is still acting in the hard-eyed pursuit of what he perceives to be vital US national interests. It's just that his definition of the concept has expanded massively since 2016. So has his appetite for wielding unchecked power, which has burst US borders and is racing through the Americas and beyond. “America will never allow foreign powers to rob our people or drive us back into and out of our own hemisphere,” Trump warned at a remarkable news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.” Saturday proves that the United States has reverted to days when presidents and intelligence agencies sought to topple autocratic or inconvenient leaders in favor of puppet governments. It also conjures dark reminders of CIA political meddling, including in Latin America, which has often backfired. If upside projections of Trump's bet play out, his domestic political exposure could be limited. He might ease the torment of the Venezuelan people; create stability in the northern part of South America; allow a return home of Venezuelan refugees; and blunt efforts by US foes China and Russia to gain a foothold that could threaten US security and interests. An apparently well-executed military operation without US combat deaths to grab Maduro will only enhance Trump's reputation for orchestrating thunderclaps of military power after his strikes on Iran's nuclear installations last year. His recharged strongman's personality cult will please some Republican voters, as will his defiance of constitutional limits and liberal critics. But the president is taking a risk with many in his fraying political base already chafing at his strikes in Iran, Nigeria, Syria and now Venezuela and apparent obliviousness to grinding economic conditions at home. But if the initial shock ouster of Maduro degenerates into violence — as it did with earlier US regime change operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, he will slide into deep political trouble. Trump's triumphant morning news conference at Mar-a-Lago, as Maduro was transported into US custody in New York, dripped with hubris. It was hard not to recall President George W. Bush's “Mission Accomplished” victory lap on an aircraft carrier in 2003, shortly before a bloody insurgency rocked Iraq. “No other president has ever shown this kind of leadership, courage, and resolve, the most powerful combination the world has ever seen,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gushed, ignoring Abraham Lincoln's Civil War heroism, Franklin Roosevelt's daring oversight of the D-Day Normandy landings and John F. Kennedy's steely resolve preventing nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well Libya after the ouster of Moammer Gadhafi in 2011, cut deep into Americans' psyche because they were born from Washington's negligence after an initial triumph. Venezuela — with its 31 million people; brutal security forces; criminal and gang culture; and fractured governance and economy — looks a prime candidate for the societal implosion that often results when tyrants are suddenly deposed. “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said, seemingly playing into every regime change trope. “We're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have,” he said, apparently raising the possibility of sending American forces into a volatile semi-failed state where government thugs and militia run rampant. We're going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago,” Trump said. But he had no answers on how the United States would “run” Venezuela, although he suggested at one point that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine and Hegseth would be involved. Any attempt to revive the oil industry wrecked by Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez will take years and require a huge US security footprint. So this is no quick in-and-out operation by the US. Trump will own the aftermath, whether there's peace, civil disintegration or a new tyrant to replace Maduro. Still, no one can comfortably predict what will happen. And the Trump administration has not so far dismantled the state apparatus, as Bush's viceroys did in Baghdad to disastrous results. The vice president, however, seemed defiant in an address from Caracas, saying that the US was guilty of “kidnapping” Maduro and demanding his return. The president's actions have already ignited a political firestorm at home. While officials initially tried to portray Maduro's capture as a law enforcement operation to fulfill a narcotics indictment he faces, Trump's expansive new claims about running the Western Hemisphere and taking Venezuelan oil put the operation onto even shakier legal and constitutional grounds. “Last night, President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification, and without any explanation to the American people,” Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Whatever comes next, President Trump will own the consequences.” Reed added: “This has been a profound constitutional failure. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has long sought to narrow presidential discretion in taking the US to war following White House overreach in the post-9/11 years, said, “Congress must reassert our critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy, and trade.” But in the short term, at least, Trump appears immune from pressure on Capitol Hill. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of Trump's boat strikes against alleged drug traffickers off Venezuela, said he supported Maduro's removal, while noting that the founders limited the president's power to wage war. Before he acted, the prospect of US adventures in Venezuela was deeply unpopular. A CBS poll in November found 70% of Americans would oppose military action. The disaffected include members of his already-cracking MAGA coalition. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X that never-ending military aggression and costly foreign wars were “what many in MAGA thought they voted to end.” Abroad, Trump's strike against Maduro confirmed that his contentious US national security strategy — which calls for US dominance in its own sphere of influence and a narrowed focus elsewhere — is for real. When Russia and China get over the shock of losing an ally in Maduro, they'll work out how to use this new global organizing principle of the strong over the weak to their advantage. The big question about Trump is now more acute than ever.</p>
