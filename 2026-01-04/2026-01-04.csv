            Former Israeli hostage Romi Gonen said she endured repeated sexual assault, harassment and intimidation during her 471 days of Hamas captivity, speaking publicly for the first time about her experience and her fear of becoming a “sex slave” in Gaza.
    


            Gonen, now 25, was kidnapped at age 23 from the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, and released as part of the January 2025 hostage deal. In a two-part interview broadcast this week on Israel's Channel 12 program Uvda, she recounted several incidents of sexual harassment and assault by three different men.
    


            “Only when you're in this situation can you grasp what happens to the body. And fear – it sometimes paralyzes,” Gonen said, describing what she called the “worst” assault. According to her account, one captor ordered her into a bathroom, followed her inside and assaulted her. “There was this one moment in the bathroom, I was crying like crazy,” she said, “and he was having the time of his life, ecstatic, as if he had received the gift of a lifetime.”
    


            Looking through a small window, she said, she was struck by “The dissonance between the beautiful, ordinary clean life outside – and the filth, beastliness, and disgust happening inside the bathroom.” In the aftermath of the assault, she recalled thinking: “Romi, everyone in Israel thinks you're dead, and you're going to be his sex slave for life… Then he comes up to me, puts a gun to my head, and tells me, ‘If you tell anyone, I am going to kill you.'”
    


How a rave turned into a frenzied massacre



            Gonen, who suffered a gunshot wound to her arm during the October 7 attack, said she spent the first 34 days of captivity alone, moving between houses and captors. “I had to be alone with it, and it's not easy, I kept telling myself, ‘You're strong.' But no, I'm not strong, and no, you can't heal from such a thing, you can't,” she said, in tears.
    


            She described the first assault occurring within days of her abduction, when a supposed medic followed her into the shower under the pretext of treating her wound. “He was a ‘nurse' so he allowed himself to ‘help me.' I was wounded, powerless, and couldn't do anything. He took everything from me,” she said. “And I had to continue living with him in that house afterward.”
    


            Gonen referred to her “worst 16 days of captivity,” during which two captors, identified as Ibrahim and Muhammed, repeatedly harassed her.
    


            “I'm sitting on the bed. Ibrahim comes and sits next to me and harasses me. Everything is in complete silence. I start crying insanely, and he says, ‘Be careful. If you don't calm down, I'll get angry,” she said. “And that's how the days go by: I go to the bathroom and Mohammed follows me. I sit on the toilet pulling down my pants with one hand, so he won't see anything. Ibrahim keeps bothering me endlessly, touching my leg and thigh. I kick them off.”
    


            At one point, Gonen said, senior Hamas commanders learned she was shaken by one of the assaults, they led her through tunnels to make a phone call. “I picked up the phone, and he said ‘Hello.' He spoke Hebrew. He asked me to tell him everything that happened,” she said, recalling his proposal for “some kind of deal. ‘I will put you at the top of the release list, and in return, you will promise me that you will keep quiet.” She identified the man's voice as belonging to Izz a Din al-Haddad, then head of the Hamas Gaza Brigade, and now the group's Gaza leader, whom she said she also met in person during her captivity.
    


            “They often silenced my story and told me not to tell it,” Gonen said. “Now I am here, sitting in front of the camera, and honestly, no one will silence me anymore. It happened to me, and it was terrible, and I deal with the consequences every day, but I am here. I beat it. I am in the aftermath, and I am much stronger than it,” she concluded.
    


What we know about rape and sexual violence inflicted by Hamas during its terror attack on Israel



            Gonen is not the first Israeli hostage to report sexual abuse in captivity.
    


A July 2025 report by a group of Israeli researchers known as the Dinah Project found that 13 women and two men who survived captivity by Hamas said they experienced or witnessed sexual violence while being held hostage in Gaza. Drawing on their testimonies, forensic reports, photographs and videos from the October 7 attacks, researchers concluded that Hamas used sexual violence in a widespread, systematic and “tactical” way as a “weapon of war.”
    


            In November 2025, Rom Braslavski, a security guard kidnapped from the Nova festival on October 7, became the first male hostage to speak publicly of sexual abuse in Gaza. A short while after he was released in the October 2025 ceasefire deal, Braslavski told Channel 13's “Hazinor” that he was subjected to “horrific” and humiliating sexual violence and abuse. “They stripped me of all my clothes, my underwear, everything,” he said, adding, “It is sexual violence, and its main purpose was to humiliate me. The goal was to crush my dignity.
    


            A 2024 report by the UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict Pramila Patten found “reasonable grounds to believe” that conflict-related sexual violence, including rape and gang rape occurred during Hamas' October 7 terror attacks, as well as “clear and convincing” information that hostages in Gaza were sexually abused.
    


            Hamas has repeatedly denied the allegations.

            Millions of Americans woke up with the same question on the first Saturday of a new year: Are we at war with Venezuela?
    


            President Donald Trump's ouster of President Nicolás Maduro has stunning implications for Venezuela, American global power, and the shattered remnants of constitutional curbs on US presidents and international law.
    


            The ostensible justification is that Maduro was the pinnacle of a cartel state that threatens America's security and the well-being of its citizens with narcotics trafficking. But Trump's claims overplay Venezuela's role, and his transparent relish at wielding a big stick in his geopolitical backyard highlights more ambitious motives.
    


            Few of Venezuela's repressed citizens will lament the removal of a dictator who wrecked lives and ruined economic opportunity. 



            But the swoop against Maduro was a stunner, and not just because the overthrow of a foreign leader is considered an act of war.
    


            Trump's entire political philosophy was rooted in avoiding any more US shock-and-awe operations to enforce overseas regime change after two decades of quagmires.
    


            What happened to the plan to stop meddling in intractable foreign politics that the US doesn't understand? Is “America First” over?
    


            Probably not. Instead, it's on steroids.
    


            Trump is still acting in the hard-eyed pursuit of what he perceives to be vital US national interests. It's just that his definition of the concept has expanded massively since 2016. So has his appetite for wielding unchecked power, which has burst US borders and is racing through the Americas and beyond.
    


            “America will never allow foreign powers to rob our people or drive us back into and out of our own hemisphere,” Trump warned at a remarkable news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.”
    


            Saturday proves that the United States has reverted to days when presidents and intelligence agencies sought to topple autocratic or inconvenient leaders in favor of puppet governments. It also conjures dark reminders of CIA political meddling, including in Latin America, which has often backfired.
    


            If upside projections of Trump's bet play out, his domestic political exposure could be limited. He might ease the torment of the Venezuelan people; create stability in the northern part of South America; allow a return home of Venezuelan refugees; and blunt efforts by US foes China and Russia to gain a foothold that could threaten US security and interests.
    


            An apparently well-executed military operation without US combat deaths to grab Maduro will only enhance Trump's reputation for orchestrating thunderclaps of military power after his strikes on Iran's nuclear installations last year.
    


            His recharged strongman's personality cult will please some Republican voters, as will his defiance of constitutional limits and liberal critics. This may discourage rebellions from GOP dissidents who understand that the Constitution stipulates that Congress and not presidents declare war.
    


            But the president is taking a risk with many in his fraying political base already chafing at his strikes in Iran, Nigeria, Syria and now Venezuela and apparent obliviousness to grinding economic conditions at home. Democrats are already hammering the theme as a bedrock of their campaign ahead of November's midterm elections.
    


            It's critical to GOP political prospects that the US does not get sucked into Venezuela in vast ground troop deployments that mirror the chaos of the post-9/11 wars. But if the initial shock ouster of Maduro degenerates into violence — as it did with earlier US regime change operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, he will slide into deep political trouble.
    


            Trump's triumphant morning news conference at Mar-a-Lago, as Maduro was transported into US custody in New York, dripped with hubris. It was hard not to recall President George W. Bush's “Mission Accomplished” victory lap on an aircraft carrier in 2003, shortly before a bloody insurgency rocked Iraq.
    


            “No other president has ever shown this kind of leadership, courage, and resolve, the most powerful combination the world has ever seen,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gushed, ignoring Abraham Lincoln's Civil War heroism, Franklin Roosevelt's daring oversight of the D-Day Normandy landings and John F. Kennedy's steely resolve preventing nuclear war in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
    


            The administration's hagiography could be especially dangerous for the mindset of a president who already thinks he's infallible and omnipotent.
    


            Disasters in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well Libya after the ouster of Moammer Gadhafi in 2011, cut deep into Americans' psyche because they were born from Washington's negligence after an initial triumph. Venezuela — with its 31 million people; brutal security forces; criminal and gang culture; and fractured governance and economy — looks a prime candidate for the societal implosion that often results when tyrants are suddenly deposed.
    


            Trump was glib on what exactly comes next, but his candor was shocking. And his true motives appear to add up to a modern form of colonialism.
    


            “We are going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump said, seemingly playing into every regime change trope. “We're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have,” he said, apparently raising the possibility of sending American forces into a volatile semi-failed state where government thugs and militia run rampant.
    


            And remember the incessant complaint of anti-Iraq War campaigners that the war there was “really about the oil”? There's no confusion this time.
    


            “The oil companies are going to go in. They're going to spend money. We're going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago,” Trump said.
    


            But he had no answers on how the United States would “run” Venezuela, although he suggested at one point that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine and Hegseth would be involved.
    


            Any attempt to revive the oil industry wrecked by Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chávez will take years and require a huge US security footprint. So this is no quick in-and-out operation by the US. Trump will own the aftermath, whether there's peace, civil disintegration or a new tyrant to replace Maduro.
    


            Still, no one can comfortably predict what will happen.
    


            The first wave of criticism of regime change Trump-style carried the whiff of critics rhetorically fighting the last war. The Iraq template may not fit Venezuela. Although the latter is often seen as a vast criminal enterprise, the country lacks the religious and tribal schisms and the belligerent neighbors such as Iran that helped push Iraq into hell in 2003. And the Trump administration has not so far dismantled the state apparatus, as Bush's viceroys did in Baghdad to disastrous results.
    


            Trump seemed to imply that his administration was talking to Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez. He said she was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.”
    


            The vice president, however, seemed defiant in an address from Caracas, saying that the US was guilty of “kidnapping” Maduro and demanding his return. And while calling for a “judicious” transition, Trump didn't commit to a return to democracy, leaving open the implication that a pliant regime in Caracas is his preference.
    


            The president's actions have already ignited a political firestorm at home.
    


            While officials initially tried to portray Maduro's capture as a law enforcement operation to fulfill a narcotics indictment he faces, Trump's expansive new claims about running the Western Hemisphere and taking Venezuelan oil put the operation onto even shakier legal and constitutional grounds.
    


            Attacks on air and land in Venezuela seem to clearly meet the definition of US combat action that requires the prior authorization of Congress — as was sought and received by Bush before the war on terrorism and the invasion of Iraq.
    


            “Last night, President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification, and without any explanation to the American people,” Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Whatever comes next, President Trump will own the consequences.”
    


            Reed added: “This has been a profound constitutional failure. Congress – not the President – has the sole power to authorize war. Pursuing regime change without the consent of the American people is a reckless overreach and an abuse of power.”
    


            Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has long sought to narrow presidential discretion in taking the US to war following White House overreach in the post-9/11 years, said, “Congress must reassert our critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy, and trade.”
    


            But in the short term, at least, Trump appears immune from pressure on Capitol Hill. Leaders of the GOP Senate and House majorities expressed support and said they expected briefings in the coming week. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has questioned the legality of Trump's boat strikes against alleged drug traffickers off Venezuela, said he supported Maduro's removal, while noting that the founders limited the president's power to wage war.
    


            But Trump's political foundation is still thin. Before he acted, the prospect of US adventures in Venezuela was deeply unpopular. A CBS poll in November found 70% of Americans would oppose military action. The disaffected include members of his already-cracking MAGA coalition. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X that never-ending military aggression and costly foreign wars were “what many in MAGA thought they voted to end.”
    


            Abroad, Trump's strike against Maduro confirmed that his contentious US national security strategy — which calls for US dominance in its own sphere of influence and a narrowed focus elsewhere — is for real. When Russia and China get over the shock of losing an ally in Maduro, they'll work out how to use this new global organizing principle of the strong over the weak to their advantage.
    


            “The 47th president of the United States is not a game player,” Rubio said. “When he tells you he's going to address a problem, he means it. He actions it.”
    


            The big question about Trump is now more acute than ever.
    


            How far will he go? And who is going to stop him?

Brazil has condemned the United States' military attack on Venezuela, calling the raid that captured President Nicolas Maduro a dangerous breach of sovereignty and international law that threatens to destabilize Latin America.

President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva declared that the bombings and capture of Maduro “cross an unacceptable line.” In a statement on X, Lula said these acts represent a “grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty” and establish “another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community.”

“The action recalls the worst moments of interference in the politics of Latin America and the Caribbean and threatens the preservation of the region as a zone of peace,” Lula said, urging the UN to “respond vigorously.”

Responding to the crisis, the Brazilian government convened an emergency cabinet meeting focusing on two immediate priorities: the situation along the expansive Brazil-Venezuela border and the safety of Brazilian citizens.

Brazil's condemnation has been echoed by several fellow BRICS members. The Russian Foreign Ministry labeled the US operation an “act of armed aggression,” calling for restraint and warning against further escalation. China's Foreign Ministry expressed “deep shock” at the events, urging Washington to “stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security.”

US special forces conducted airstrikes on the oil-rich South American country and captured its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife in an early Saturday raid. Both have been brought back to the US and charged with drug trafficking conspiracy – allegations that Maduro has long denied, arguing that Washington was after regime change and Venezuelan resources.

President Donald Trump declared that the US will now “run” Venezuela and control its oil production until a proper “transition of power,” while threatening to stage a “second and much larger attack” if Caracas refuses to cooperate.

LONDON, January 4. /TASS/. The United Kingdom and France delivered a joint strike on an Islamic State (a terrorist organization outlawed in Russia) underground weapons depot in Syria, the UK Ministry of Defense said.

""Careful intelligence analysis identified an underground facility, in the mountains some miles north of the ancient site of Palmyra. This facility had been occupied by Daesh (Islamic State - TASS), most likely to store weapons and explosives. The area around the facility is devoid of any civilian habitation,"" it said. ""RAF Typhoon FGR4s, supported by a Voyager refuelling tanker, therefore joined French aircraft in a joint strike on the underground facility on the evening of Saturday 3 January.""

""Our aircraft used Paveway IV guided bombs to target a number of access tunnels down to the facility; whilst detailed assessment is now underway, initial indications are that the target was engaged successfully. There is no indication of any risk having been posed to civilians by the strike, and all our aircraft returned safely,"" it added.

""This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,"" Defense Secretary John Healey said after the strike.

Hundreds of people danced, sang and waved the flag of Venezuela in the suburban Miami city of Doral on Saturday

The first chants of “libertad” cut through the air well before dawn in Doral, the suburban Miami city where up to 40% of the population is Venezuelan. Hundreds of people, dancing, singing and waving Venezuela's yellow, blue and red flag filled the street outside the El Arepazo restaurant, the traditional community meeting place, as they celebrated the downfall of the despised president Nicolás Maduro.

The euphoria lasted well into the day on Saturday as residents learned how the strongman and his wife, first lady Cilia Flores, were snatched from their beds by US military members and bundled away towards an eventual court date in New York City.

Then came Donald Trump's head-scratching press conference, and a realization for many that the US president's vision for the next steps towards freedom in their homeland bore little relation to their own.

Instead of popular opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado, the Nobel peace prize winner, returning to guide Venezuela through the immediate post-Maduro period, Trump declared the US would temporarily seize control of the country, and American businesses would be taking over its rich oil infrastructure.

“We are ready to stage a second and much larger [military] attack if we need to do so,” the president warned in a thinly disguised threat to those who would stand in his way.

Trump's sidelining of Machado in particular sits uncomfortably with south Florida's diaspora of Venezuelans, the largest in the US, which was already reeling from his action, upheld by the supreme court in October, to strip immigration protections from hundreds of thousands of them.

If anything, some experts said, the capture of Maduro and imposition of a US-run government in Venezuela might even speed up deportations.

“They're celebrating the ouster of Maduro, and I'm in agreement with that. But he also said we're doing this for the Venezuelans who have been in the US because of Maduro, and now they will be able to go back to a free Venezuela, right?” said Eduardo Gamarra, professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University and a former director of its Latin American and Caribbean center.

“He didn't say anything of all the refugees, the people who lost their temporary protected status and people who have asylum. So on what basis are you going to say somebody in Venezuela is going to persecute me when it's the US government that's running Venezuela? What you might see is an accelerated path of deportations, but you might call them repatriations now.

“I'm not sure that Venezuelans in Doral, or anywhere in the US, really grasp this. They're all happy, but I really wonder how many of them are going to go back to Venezuela.”

Republican politicians in Florida, unsurprisingly, were quick to praise Trump's action. The representative Carlos Gimenez, a former mayor of Miami, likened Maduro's ouster to the “fall of the Berlin wall” in a post on X, and said the community was “overwhelmed with emotion and hope”.

“President Trump has changed the course of history in our hemisphere. Our country & the world are safer for it,” he wrote.

But the Democratic representative Maxwell Frost, who is Cuban-American, said the president's action was “illegal, dangerous, and outside the bounds of his constitutional authority”.

In a statement, Frost echoed Gamarra's fears of escalating deportations of Florida's Venezuelans: “President Trump thinks that Maduro is a big enough problem to take illegal actions in Venezuela, but not a big enough problem to provide Venezuelans with temporary protected status.”

“He's willing to risk American and Venezuelan lives for political gain, but refuses to extend a critical legal lifeline to families fleeing the very crisis he claims to oppose.

“Nicolás Maduro was a brutal dictator and an authoritarian. He has repressed, jailed, disappeared, and murdered his people for over a decade. I stand against authoritarianism, no matter the nation. I shed no tears for Maduro's loss of power.

“But I do shed tears for the destruction of our own democracy. Authoritarians like Donald Trump will always seek justification to break the law in order to start foreign wars for unclear reasons. Congress cannot give him an inch, or there will be much more reckless behavior that endangers lives and allows him to consolidate more power.”

Some Doral Venezuelans said they were hopeful for the “opportunity” they believed Maduro's removal might bring.

“Many of our entrepreneurs fled the Maduro regime, including myself,” said Leonardo Trechi, president of the Miami-based Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce. “I have an independent media company and my employees, journalists and cameramen were arrested and persecuted, even our equipment was confiscated.

“There was a car dealership in Venezuela threatened by Farc dissidents and closed its business there, but opened here in Florida and they are now one of the most successful businesses of its kind. That's why we believe the Venezuelan diaspora in the US plays an active and fundamental economic role in the growth of both countries.

“The detention of Maduro is not just a relief, it's an opportunity. We're willing to contribute the experience we have gained within the US and the capital of Venezuelan entrepreneurs in the US to the reconstruction of Venezuela, and we are also willing to work hand in hand with the Trump administration.”

Celestino De Caires, who was born in Caracas and has lived in California since 1980, said he was hopeful that conditions would begin to improve in his homeland.

“If you go to Venezuela, you will realize that it's the grandparents who are raising the kids, their grandchildren, because the parents had to migrate to all parts of Latin America and the US due to corruption. There was no jobs, there was nothing to eat,” he said.

“People in Venezuela are hungry and their wellbeing depends on this transition.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Leaders try to focus on what comes next, as backing for ejection of Maduro mingles uncomfortably with voicing of support for international law

Venezuela crisis: latest updates

European leaders emerged divided and torn as they tried to welcome the ejection of Venezuela's authoritarian president, but still uphold the principles of international law that did not appear to allow Donald Trump to seize Nicolás Maduro, let alone declare that the US will run Venezuela and control its oil industry.

Europe tried to focus on the principle of a democratic transition, pointing out that the continent had not recognised Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela since what were widely regarded as fraudulent elections in June 2024.

But Trump's rejection of the Nobel prize-winning Venezuelan opposition figurehead, María Corina Machado, was awkward. Trump said she did not have support or respect in Venezuela, but European leaders have embraced her as leading an opposition that deserves power.

International lawyers say the US rejection of Maduro's legitimacy opens a path for Washington to argue that he does not enjoy sovereign immunity as a head of state in the US domestic courts, in the same way that George Bush was allowed to try Manuel Noriega in the US after his capture in 1989.

US officials have claimed the operation against Venezuela was justified on the grounds of self-defence, arguing that the government was involved in drug-trafficking.

The Yale professor of international law Oona Hathaway, however, said she saw no plausible justification under the UN charter for the US use of force. “If drug trafficking is a reasonable justification for attacking another country then a whole range of possible arguments can be made that basically mean that self-defence is no longer a real exception. It's the new rule.”

“The idea that because drugs are coming from a country justifies an invasion and a change of administration in that country gets rid of any kind of limits on the use of force,” she said. The US action was a breach of international law unlike any before, she said.

In a sign of Europe's discomfort, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, one of the 10 non-permanent countries on the UN security council, tried to close down discussion of Trump's methods. “Nicolás Maduro presided over a brutal and repressive dictatorship that brought about unimaginable suffering on the Venezuelan people. The end of his regime offers new hope for the country,” he wrote on social media, adding that “this is not the time to comment on the legality of the recent actions”.

The closer ideological allies of Trump in Europe, such as the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, deemed the US operation legitimate, describing it as a “defensive intervention”.

Criticism from others was possibly muffled for fear of attracting Trump's displeasure when his support for Ukraine is still considered vital. The EU foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “The EU has repeatedly stated that Maduro lacks legitimacy, and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN charter must be respected. We call for restraint.”

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, also focused on what might happen next. “We stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan people and support a peaceful and democratic transition. Any solution must respect international law and the charter of the United Nations,” she said.

The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, also dived for cover. “The legal assessment of the US intervention is complex and requires careful consideration,” he said.

France too was circumspect. Without mentioning the US military operation, Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the end of the “Maduro dictatorship” was something the Venezuelan people could “only rejoice in”, and called for a “peaceful and democratic transition” led by Edmundo González Urrutia, the opposition candidate for the 2024 presidential election. In an act of solidarity he also spoke to Machado.

The clearest critic was the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, who said the operation to capture Maduro “violates the principle of non-use of force that underpins international law”.

“France reiterates that no lasting political solution can be imposed from the outside and that sovereign peoples alone decide their future,” he said.

“The repeated violations of this principle by nations entrusted with the primary responsibility as permanent members of the United Nations security council will have heavy consequences for world security, sparing no one.”

Keir Starmer shed no tears over Maduro's departure and mentioned the importance of international law, but the UK prime minister did not discuss how it might apply in this instance.

Those who advocate for international law may now find themselves appealing to a vanishing world order in which Venezuela is the latest burial in an already crowded graveyard.

Trump's actions cement a new system in which the naked self-interest of two or three “great powers” dominates. In this world order, Washington and Beijing will decide on the basis that might is right.

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, explicitly threatened on Saturday that Cuba was next. “Cuba is a disaster, run by incompetent and senile men,” he said. “If I were them, I would be a little worried.”

The advocates of multilateralism and international courts may also need to reflect on their own failures.

Nizar El Fakih , a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said: “Multilateralism did not deliver a single effective negotiation process leading to an orderly, peaceful and negotiated transition, despite years of appeals by millions of Venezuelans who voted, protested and exhausted every available civic mechanism at enormous personal cost.

“The international criminal court, with an investigation open since 2021, has yet to issue a single indictment, despite extensive documentation of crimes against humanity by the United Nations fact-finding mission on Venezuela, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and hundreds of victims”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Technocrat must accommodate US demands while shoring up a regime that is hated by many Venezuelans

US attacks Venezuela – live updates

In her first speech as Venezuela's interim leader, Delcy Rodríguez lambasted the US and pledged fealty to Nicolás Maduro. But the Trump administration has made a cold calculation: she will bow to Washington.

Rodríguez is a political veteran who served as Maduro's vice-president and oil minister and defended the regime against accusations of terrorism, drug-running and election-stealing, yet for now she is Donald Trump's favoured option to lead Venezuela. “She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump said.

The US president has not ruled out deploying ground troops but appears to want to “run” Venezuela through Rodríguez, who finds herself in charge of a regime shocked and demoralised by the abduction of Maduro yet still in power.

The 56-year-old former labour lawyer struck a defiant tone in her televised speech on Saturday night. She condemned the abduction of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and demanded their return.

“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law. History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay,” she said. “There is only one president in Venezuela and his name is Nicolás Maduro.”

In a crisis that blends political theatre, military power and economic calculation, the defiance may have been to some extent performative – a sop to the Bolivarian revolution's humiliated loyalists, especially those in the armed forces, while Rodríguez consolidates her position.

To stay in power – assuming that is her goal – she must accommodate US demands while shoring up an authoritarian regime that is despised by many Venezuelans. One wrong step could trigger an internal putsch, a street uprising or another blast of US firepower.

Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary, elaborated on Trump's declaration that the US would run the South American country. “It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms,” he said. “It means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.”

That implied a puppet ruler of a vassal state, but Rodríguez has some room to manoeuvre. Where Venezuelan opposition figures see an apparatchik of Maduro's dictatorship, the Trump administration sees a potential business partner.

A senior official told the New York Times: “I'm not claiming that she's the permanent solution to the country's problems, but she's certainly someone we think we can work at a much more professional level than we were able to do with [Maduro].”

The English-speaking technocrat impressed Trump's team with her management of Venezuela's oil industry and intermediaries convinced the administration that she would protect and champion future American energy investments in the country, the paper reported.

For Trump that was enough to ditch an alternative candidate to replace Maduro: María Corina Machado. The opposition leader mobilised Edmundo González's winning presidential campaign last year – Maduro ignored the result – and won the Nobel peace prize.

Machado dedicated that prize to Trump as she courted the US leader and supported the Pentagon's military buildup in the Caribbean – but on Saturday Trump said she lacked support and that it would be “very tough” for her to lead Venezuela. Millions of Venezuelans revere Machado but she is unacceptable to the military hierarchy that props up the regime, said one informed source in Caracas.

The result, for now, is that leadership of a revolution launched by Hugo Chávez in 1999 and taken up by Maduro in 2013 now falls to a softly spoken woman with a reputation as a flinty pragmatist. When she was a child, her father, a Marxist activist, died during interrogation by Venezuelan authorities over his role in the kidnap of a US citizen. That US forces then kidnapped her boss is an irony doubtless not lost on Rodríguez.

A student leader, she studied law in Caracas and Paris and joined Chávez's government in 2003, following the path of her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, a psychiatrist who served as vice-president and is currently head of the national assembly.

Under Maduro she was promoted to senior posts, including foreign minister, and became vice-president in 2018. Her bright outfits stood out on podiums filled with military uniforms but no one doubted her commitment and her portfolio expanded to include the economy and oil.

Unlike many of Maduro's inner circle, Rodríguez has not been indicted for drug trafficking or other charges in the US. Trump's team hope it has found a market-friendly technocrat who can steer the regime while taking direction from Washington. For Rodríguez, a vertiginous tightrope awaits.

Venezuela's opposition leaders, despite being sidelined by Trump, sense opportunity. “Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and seize power,” said Machado. Having tasted military success, Trump seems hungry for more chances to use force.

What is left of the Bolivarian revolution – a socialist experiment that morphed into quasi-capitalism – still needs rhetorical justification. Rodríguez said Venezuela “will never again be anyone's colony – neither of old empires, nor of new empires, nor of empires in decline”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

England's Luke Littler on Saturday thrashed Dutchman Gian van Veen to win the PDC World Darts title for the second successive year in front of a raucous Alexandra Palace crowd.

The 18-year-old dropped the first set in the best-of-13-set showdown, but hit back to stamp his authority on Van Veen who had no answer to Littler's relentless scoring.

World No. 1 Littler never looked troubled, apart from during the brief appearance of a wasp, banging in 180s and high checkouts as he wrapped up a 7-1 victory to claim the ￡1 million (US$1.35 million) first prize.

The first ever ￡1 million check in darts is a once-unthinkable windfall that owes itself not entirely, but largely to the Littler effect: an electrifying ripple of attention and interest that has drawn in the younger audiences other sports spend decades trying to chase down.

He is the first player to win back-to-back titles since Scotland's Gary Anderson in 2016.

Littler's victory charge was briefly interrupted during a dazzling spell of nine successive legs as the board needed to be replaced after Van Veen cut his hand and left a small blob of blood on the surface.

Van Veen stopped the rot to win a leg in the eighth set, but the laser-like focus of Littler was unbroken as he turned the final stages of the contest into a procession, sealing the title with a 147 checkout.

“The first set I wasn't happy, but I kicked on from there and said to myself: ‘Give it time and you'll find it,' and it all went to plan,” Littler said on stage.

“Credit to Gian, he's had a great tournament. He was there every set so I had to take my chances,” he added.

The 23-year-old Van Veen beat Anderson to reach his first world championship final and initially looked dangerous.

Having come from behind in the first set to take it after Littler missed a double, Van Veen then went 2-0 ahead in the second set with checkouts of 145 and 127.

Van Veen narrowly missed a 127 checkout that would have given him a two-set lead and that proved the turning point as his dream of emulating former Dutch champions Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld evaporated.

British and French warplanes carried out an airstrike in central Syria on an underground facility where members of the Islamic State (IS) group are suspected to have stored weapons and explosives, the British Ministry of Defence said yesterday.

The strikes occurred on Saturday evening on a structure in the mountains just north of the historic town of Palmyra in the country's Homs province, the ministry's statement said.

The UK and France are part of the US-led coalition that has been fighting IS militants for more than a decade.

The ministry said the British military used Typhoon FGR4 fighter jets supported by a Voyager refueling tanker and were joined by French aircraft in the joint strike. 

The British air force used Paveway IV guided bombs to target a number of access tunnels down to the facility, the statement said, adding that while a detailed assessment is now underway, initial indications are “that the target was engaged successfully.”

“This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence” of IS and its “violent ideologies” in the Middle East, British Secretary of State for Defence John Healey said.

There was no immediate comment from Syria's government on the strikes. Syria joined the anti-IS coalition late last year.

Despite its defeat in Syria in 2019, IS sleeper cells still carry out deadly attacks in Syria and Iraq where the extremists once declared their caliphate. UN experts say IS still commands between 5,000 and 7,000 members across its former stronghold in Syria and Iraq.

Last month, the administration of US President Donald Trump launched military strikes in Syria to “eliminate” IS fighters and weapons sites in retaliation for an ambush attack near Palmyra that killed two US troops and an American civilian interpreter days earlier.

Russian air defense systems shot down 132 Ukrainian drones overnight on Jan. 3-4, including 11 intercepted over Moscow Oblast, the Russian Defense Ministry has claimed.

Russian air defense assets shot down three drones bound for Moscow, according to the Russian ministry. 

Emergency crews are working to clear debris at the crash sites, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said.  No casualties or damage have been reported.

Moscow's Vnukovo and Zhukovsky airports introduced temporary flight restrictions during the attack, according to Russia's federal aviation agency.

Ukrainian drones were also shot down over Bryansk, Oryol, Kursk, Rostov, Belgorod, Tula, Kaluga, Voronezh, Moscow and Lipetsk oblasts, the Russian Defense Ministry said.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the reports at the time of publication.

Ukraine regularly launches drone attacks against Russian military and industrial facilities in the rear to undermine Russia's ability to wage its all-out war. 

While drone attacks on Moscow have been recorded on several instances and often brought about temporary airport closures, the capital is also well-defended against aerial threats.

Ukraine reportedly attacked the Syzran oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a number of Russian military facilities in temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine on Dec. 28.

""Do you understand that Russians have no mercy?""

Russia's war has forced young Ukrainians to grow up too fast, confronting loss, danger, and responsibility instead of a carefree youth. (Albina Kolesnichenko / The Kyiv Independent)

Soldiers featured in this story are identified by first names only due to security reasons.

In the fall of 2023, I remember sitting in a circle with Ukrainian soldiers whom I had come to call friends. It was getting chilly outside, but the leftover coals from the barbecue and the constant laughter kept us warm.

We were celebrating the birthday of the youngest guy in the unit. Vladyslav, small-framed and blonde with curious blue eyes, was turning 20. He sat in an armchair on the porch of the 93rd Mechanized Brigade's cottage-turned-military base in the eastern war-battered Donbas.

Surrounded by his brothers-in-arms who teased him that he was now ""a big boy,"" Vladyslav, or Vlad as we called him, looked content. But the smile on Vlad's face faded quickly when he accidentally mentioned using his phone at a position. Big mistake.

""Do you understand that Russians have no mercy?"" Oleksandr, 51, a major and the unit's commander, said in a reprimanding tone.

""You are a target, and they are not going to allow mistakes,"" Oleksandr told Vlad, scolding him for not realizing how easily Russian troops can locate Ukrainian soldiers through cell signals.

The rest of the evening was largely spent lecturing Vlad. With a black cat on his knee, Vlad looked down as though he was about to tear up.

In most places around the world, young people like Vlad make mistakes, never imagining they could cost them their lives. Our early 20s are considered a blissful time to embrace carelessness, navigate steep learning curves, and explore life without worrying about consequences.

But in Ukraine, where Russia's full-scale war has raged for over three years, those coming of age often don't have such a luxury. Innocent youth feels distant, and death is ever more present. For me, a now 25-year-old journalist living in Ukraine covering and witnessing the brutality of war firsthand and losing friends, the notion of a carefree youth feels far away.

I was a 21-year-old university student, barely into my journalism career, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. I was scared, and I didn't know what to do.

Despite having little knowledge about war reporting, something told me that I had to cover Russia's invasion. It felt important to send out breaking news in English to the Western world when so much was happening at once. For the first week of the invasion, I wrote quick news items from a thick-walled hallway of a colleague's apartment, understanding for the first time how comforting the company of people can be when everything is so uncertain.

I didn't even see myself as a full-fledged journalist before the invasion, but there was an energy driving me to keep covering the developments as quickly as possible. I could feel the reporter in me starting to reveal itself.

Eventually, I realized that I had to be closer to the war to understand what was happening on the ground. I remember being nervous about how I would react to the sound of shelling  — something I feared in childhood when watching war movies —  wondering if I would be able to keep it together without panicking. Surprisingly, I was very calm, as if I had heard it all my life.

With each trip, I got closer to the front line. With time, it became more difficult to work freely and quickly due to multiple new restrictions, which meant that I had to become more organized and plan trips thoroughly.

Truth be told, my planning was very poor in my first few trips to the Donbas in 2023. Not knowing how to access the front line, I went to a gas station in one of the front-line towns in Donetsk Oblast to ask around for an embed.

I was rejected over and over again. It was when I was about to return to the hotel after buying loads of chips that an older soldier agreed to take me in for a few days. That turned into a week, and I ended up writing my first article about soldiers and how they felt at that stage of the war. 

I honestly struggled with asking questions at first. I hardly knew any military terminology, even in English, which I grew up speaking, but the conversations were in Russian and Ukrainian – my third and fourth languages. I also had no idea how wars and different weapon systems work. Fortunately, the Ukrainian soldiers from the 24th Mechanized Brigade, then defending the city of Toretsk, were very kind and patient with me as I interviewed them at their bases not too far from the front line.

I was learning how to navigate through the war zone as I filed story after story from the Donbas. Obviously, it was still very dangerous, as a simple mistake can easily cost a life, like staying at a hotel. Russia has often targeted hotels in the front-line region, even the ones where soldiers don't reside. One hotel in Pokrovsk, where I spent a lot of time on reporting trips, was struck by a Russian missile in August 2023 while I was on my way back to Kyiv. War has no mercy, and it's sometimes scary how much depends on luck.

One of the things I struggled with the most was realizing that soldiers often only have a very limited view of the battlefield. They will feed you with horrifying testimonies, but it is often difficult to verify them. It's normal in any war for soldiers to raise issues about their units or their sector of the front line, but they don't always represent the general situation. This is difficult to keep in mind when the soldiers are telling you all kinds of stories in the most emotional way, occasionally with tears and hysteria.

Another thing I tried to learn was to accept that you can't tell the stories of every soldier. Your job is to pick the strongest quotes and testimonies from a few particular soldiers and not get into the story of everyone you interviewed. The goal is to make the reports as concise and compelling as possible. As my editor once said, ""You are doing the guys a favor by condensing your report and being picky with the quotes.""


The war has woken up the youth in Ukraine to the reality of the world too early. 
    

The most difficult part about the weeks-long trips to Donbas was the days after returning home to Kyiv. You go from soldiers, usually aged over 45, aghast at the horrifying losses that their unit suffered over a ridiculously short period of time, to seeing a bustling life carrying on in the capital, packed with young people. It can be extremely uncomfortable — and even alienating — to see new cafes and bars opening their doors and trendy venues being packed even on weekdays. I often complained about it passionately to friends, leaving them worried that I had become too emotionally invested.

It was in the summer of 2024, a year and a half after I started traveling to the front line, that I realized the importance of having a life outside of war reporting. I took a pause from going to the war-torn east, to which I had grown too attached, and tried having a new life in Kyiv. 

It wasn't easy. Although I grew up in Kyiv, after my trips to the east, I felt uncomfortable in the city. But going kayaking, climbing hills, and going out on the weekend helped. I began to enjoy making plans with friends. It was something I never really had the chance to do when I was going to Donbas every month. It made me understand that if I want to continue reporting on the war, I must prioritize taking care of myself. For that, I need to build a barrier between myself and the soldiers I interview — and not let myself get psychologically too close to the front. It is a difficult job because you constantly hear the most horrific stories of war from your soldier sources, but you must not let it get to you personally.

But then came the news of young Vlad's death. He was killed with two other guys at a position near Bakhmut after a direct Russian strike. His comrades told me that only parts of his body were retrieved for DNA testing to confirm the death. I felt extremely guilty for being in Kyiv and attending a music festival that day. I hated how unfair this was.

It is all very scary, especially when I realize that neither Vlad nor the guys who scolded him that day back in 2023 are alive.

The boy will forever remain 20. I will never receive any more Instagram posts with fun facts about Japan (where I am originally from) from Vlad, who was always fascinated by everything and had a passion for cooking.

Sometimes, you feel nothing but helplessness. The war has woken up the youth in Ukraine to the reality of the world too early. But I also think this will make this young generation prepared for the turbulence ahead. A new generation that is aware of the fragility of peace and the price of democracy.

A generation that is eager to cherish every moment, for there is no time to waste.

New York Islanders' Matthew Schaefer celebrates his overtime goal against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday.Heather Khalifa/The Associated Press

Matthew Schaefer scored twice, including at 4:11 of overtime, and the New York Islanders beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 on Saturday night.

Adam Pelech and Emil Heineman also scored, and Jonathan Drouin and Mathew Barzal each had two assists for the Islanders, who won for the second time in three games. David Rittich had 18 saves in his seventh straight start, with Ilya Sorokin dressing as the backup for the first time since Dec. 19.

Auston Matthews scored two goals for the Maple Leafs, setting his team's franchise career record with 421 goals. Nicholas Robertson also scored and Joseph Woll finished with 21 saves.

In the extra period, Barzal found Schaefer all alone in the high slot and the 18-year-old rookie defenceman wired a shot past Woll for the win.

Matthews scored twice in the second period to move past Hall-of-Famer Mats Sundin for the franchise mark. His first tied Sundin at 420 when he beat Rittich at 9:30. He broke the record with his 20th of the season with 2:41 left in the period on a one-timer to give Toronto a 2-1 lead.

After Schaefer tied the score with 8:50 left in the third, Nicholas Roy set up Robertson for a go-ahead goal 1:02 later after a turnover by Heineman in the Islanders' defensive zone.

The Swedish forward redeemed himself with the tying goal on a power play with 2:45 remaining in regulation, scoring on a one-timer off a feed from Barzal.

Pelech opened the scoring for the Islanders at 1:10 of the second period.

With the milestone, Matthews became the first United States-born player to lead a Canadian franchise in career goals and joined Mike Modano as one of the only U.S.-born players to hold a franchise goal-scoring record with a minimum of 50 goals.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","What's next for Venezuela oil after US ousts Maduro?","https://www.dw.com/en/whats-next-for-venezuela-oil-after-us-ousts-maduro/a-75383322","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:50:33 GMT","

US President Donald Trump says now that Nicolas Maduro is gone, more US oil companies will enter Venezuela and spend billions revitalizing its oil industry. Several key questions have to be answered.

The United States' strikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro have left the South American nation in a state of deep confusion and uncertainty.

US President Donald Trump pledged in the immediate aftermath that the US would ""run"" Venezuela, a move that appeared to hinge on how the US would approach the country's key commodity: oil.

""We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,"" he said. 

Venezuela's fragile economy is exceptionally dependent on oil. Maduro's government has been almost entirely dependent on the hydrocarbon for state income.

Crude oil and related products such as petrochemicals account for around 90% of Venezuela's export revenues. They helped keep the heavily sanctioned and isolated government in power despite a severe economic crisis.

Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves, with over 300 billion barrels available — even more than Saudi Arabia. However, it accounts for less than 1% of the global oil production, a figure that was more than 10% of global production in the 1960s. Crude production has collapsed by more than 70% since the late 1990s, and Venezuela is now 21st in the list of global producers.

The collapse can be traced back to the government of former President Hugo Chavez. His socialist revolution in the 1990s and 2000s led to massive corruption at the state oil company, PDVSA, and saw foreign investment flood out of the country due to government interference in the oil sector.

Several accidents at its pipelines and oil refineries led to further difficulties, while US sanctions — ratcheted up from 2017 — further limited Venezuela's oil production capacity.

PDVSA has stabilized oil output at around 1 million barrels per day, in part because of US licenses that allow a limited number of foreign partners to operate in Venezuela and export oil.

Throughout the 20th century, the US was a key partner for the Venezuelan oil sector, with its major oil companies investing heavily in the country.

All but one left the country in the aftermath of the Chavez revolution — Chevron.

Although sanctions affected its operations, Chevron was given special licences by the Biden administration in 2022 to resume Venezuelan oil exports under strict conditions. The idea was that softening Venezuelan sanctions would ease wider oil market pressures in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In October this year, the Trump administration gave Chevron fresh authorization to produce oil in Venezuela, arguing the US company was a vital partner for Caracas.

It stands as the most obvious and immediate beneficiary of any move by Trump to allow further US investment in the country. It employs around 3,000 people there already. In a statement, the company said it would operate in ""full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations."" It did not comment on any possible expansion plans.

Trump says large US oil companies will return to Venezuela under his plan. That could include the likes of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.

ExxonMobil, the largest US oil company, saw its assets expropriated by Chavez in 2007. ConocoPhillips' projects at Hamaca, Petrozuata and Corocoro were also expropriated. Both companies won multi-billion-dollar compensation awards in international arbitration, but Venezuela has not paid out. This is the basis of Trump's repeated claim of ""stolen oil.""

""We built Venezuela's oil industry with American talent, drive and skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us during those previous administrations, and they stole it through force,"" Trump said. ""This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country."" 

ConocoPhillips said it is ""monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability."" It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,"" a spokesman added.

The US is already comfortably the world's biggest producer of oil, so at first glance, it might not seem clear why Trump is so keen on Venezuela's oil.

However, the issue is the type of oil the US produces. Its main product is light crude, not the heavier, gloopier grade that many of its refineries, especially on the Gulf coast, are equipped to refine. Refineries turn crude oil into petrol, diesel and other products crucial for the economy.

Although the US is a major crude producer, it still imports heavy crude from countries such as Canada and Mexico to supply refineries optimized for those grades. That means a lot of the crude oil produced in the US actually ends up being exported. 

""Using the right types of crude oil keeps our refineries efficient, keeps costs down and maintains energy security,"" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association. ""Re-tooling refineries to process solely US crude oil would cost billions — a risky investment that would take decades to permit, construct and eventually pay off.""

Although Venezuela's production has fallen off a cliff, the massive reserves it sits on include the largest global reserves of heavy crude oil that the US refineries need. In fact, for many decades, heavy Venezuelan crude fed US refineries.

That makes renewed access to Venezuelan oil extremely attractive for US companies.

There are huge legal and logistical questions over whether or not oil will start flowing from Venezuela again.

Precisely what government will take shape in Venezuela in the absence of Maduro is unclear. It is also unknown to what extent the new government will facilitate US attempts to influence the country's oil sector.

Then there is the question of the state of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. Dan Brouillette, a former US Secretary of Energy from the first Trump administration, says that while early reports suggest the country's oil facilities remain intact, there is no guarantee that Venezuela's massive reserves can be tapped quickly.

""The constraint has never been geology. It has been governance, sanctions, capital access, and execution,"" he wrote on LinkedIn. ""If political change brings rapid stabilization and credible authority over PDVSA, the upside is incremental supply over time, not a sudden surge.""

Although some foreign oil companies have remained in Venezuela, sanctions have meant that the country's oil facilities have not received the necessary investment to remain up to date. The extent of the fresh investment required may become clearer over the coming months.

Another key question is the world's appetite for more oil. Prices have fallen over the past year and are expected to fall further in 2026 amid a production glut. If Trump's promise on Venezuela comes good, it would lead to even more oil on already saturated global markets.

China has been an important political and economic partner for Venezuela over the past two decades.

In the oil sector, China's CNPC has a joint venture with PDVSA. Most of the oil produced in Venezuela gets shipped to China. However, China has not hugely expanded its oil operations in Venezuela despite the US absence.

Beijing has sharply criticized the US toppling of Maduro as a violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.

Pyongyang's latest display of firepower comes ahead of South Korean President Lee's meeting with China's Xi Jinping. 

North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles from Pyongyang towards the sea off its east coast on Sunday, South Korea's military said.

The missile launch is North Korea's first in two months, and first of the new year.

The latest test came just hours before South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's visit to China for a summit.

Several ballistic missile launches were detected from North Korea's capital region at around 7.50 a.m., South Korean military officials said.

The missiles were fired towards the East Sea, which is also known as the Sea of Japan.

Seoul said the missiles flew about 900 kilometers (560 miles) and that South Korea and US authorities were closely watching the launches.

""The military is maintaining a full readiness posture, having strengthened surveillance and vigilance against possible additional launches,"" Seoul said.

Japan also said its military had detected ballistic missiles, with Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi saying that at least two missile launches by North Korea have been confirmed.

""They are a serious problem, threatening the peace and security of our nation, the region and the world,” Koizumi told reporters.

The last time Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles was in November, when US President Donald Trump approved South Korea's plan to build a nuclear-powered submarine.

The latest launch comes ahead of Lee Jae Myung's trip Sunday to China, where he will meet with Xi Jinping. Beijing is one of North Korea's key backers.

Sunday's launch also comes on the heels of the US capture of Venezuela, one of Pyongyang's few allies.

Some observers have said that the US strikes on Venezuela could be a reason for North Korea launching the missiles.

""They likely fear that if the United States so chooses, it could launch a precision strike at any moment, threatening the regime's survival,"" Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification, told the AFP news agency.

""The underlying message is likely that attacking North Korea would not be as easy as a strike on Venezuela,"" he added.

            Following the capture of President Nicolás Maduro during a US military operation in Venezuela, the command of the South American country has fallen into the hands of Executive Vice President Delcy Rodríguez.
    


            That is what Venezuela's constitution outlines in its different scenarios anticipating a president's absence. Under Articles 233 and 234, whether the absence is temporary or absolute, the vice president takes over the presidential duties.
    


            Rodríguez – also minister for both finance and oil – stepped into the role on Saturday afternoon. Hours after the capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, she chaired a National Defense Council session, surrounded by other ministers and senior officials, and demanded the couple's “immediate release” while condemning the US military operation.
    


            Standing before the Venezuelan flag, Rodríguez said the early-morning operation represents a blatant violation of international law and Venezuela's sovereignty. She added that the action must be rejected by Venezuelans and condemned by governments across Latin America.
    


            “We call on the peoples of the great homeland to remain united, because what was done to Venezuela can be done to anyone. That brutal use of force to bend the will of the people can be carried out against any country,” she told the council in an address broadcast by state television channel VTV.
    


            Rodríguez, 56, is from Caracas and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela.
    


            She has spent more than two decades as one of the leading figures of chavismo, the political movement founded by President Hugo Chávez and led by Maduro since Chávez's death in 2013.
    


            Alongside her brother Jorge Rodríguez, the current president of the National Assembly, she has held various positions of power since the Chávez era. She served as minister of communication and information from 2013 to 2014 and later became foreign minister from 2014 to 2017. In that role, she defended Maduro's government against international criticism, including allegations of democratic backsliding and human rights abuses in the country.
    


            As foreign minister, Rodríguez represented Venezuela at forums such as the United Nations, where she accused other governments of seeking to undermine her country.
    


            In 2017, Rodríguez became president of the Constituent National Assembly that expanded the government's powers after the opposition won the 2015 legislative elections. In 2018, Maduro appointed her vice president for his second term. She retained the post during his third presidential term, which began on January 10, 2025, following the controversial July 28, 2024, elections. Until the president's capture, she served as Venezuela's chief economic authority and minister of petroleum.
    


            Venezuela's opposition maintains that the 2024 elections were fraudulent and that Maduro is not a legitimately elected president. They insist that the true winner was former ambassador Edmundo González Urrutia, a position supported by some governments in the region.
    


            José Manuel Romano, a constitutional lawyer and political analyst, told CNN that the positions Rodríguez has held show she is a “very prominent” figure within the Venezuelan government and someone who enjoys the president's “full trust.”
    


            “The executive vice president of the republic is a highly effective operator, a woman with strong leadership skills for managing teams,” Romano said.
    


            “She is very results-oriented and has significant influence over the entire government apparatus, including the Ministry of Defense. That is very important to note in the current circumstances,” he added.
    


            Hours after Maduro's capture, and before Rodríguez addressed the National Defense Council, US President Donald Trump said at a press conference that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had spoken with the vice president. According to Trump, she appeared willing to work with Washington on a new phase for Venezuela.
    


            “She had a conversation with Marco. She said, ‘We're going to do whatever you need.' I think she was quite courteous. We're going to do this right,” Trump said.
    


            Trump's remarks, however, surprised some analysts, who believe Rodríguez is unlikely to make concessions to the United States.
    


            “She is not a moderate alternative to Maduro. She has been one of the most powerful and hard-line figures in the entire system,” Imdat Oner, a policy analyst at the Jack D. Gordon Institute and a former Turkish diplomat based in Venezuela, told CNN.
    


            “Her rise to power appears to be the result of some kind of understanding between the United States and key actors preparing for a post-Maduro scenario. In that context, she would essentially serve as a caretaker until a democratically elected leader takes office,” the analyst added.
    


            In her first messages following Maduro's capture, Rodríguez showed no signs of backing down and, without referencing Trump's statements, closed the door to any potential cooperation with the United States.
    


            Earlier in the morning, during a phone interview with VTV, Rodríguez said the whereabouts of Maduro and Flores were unknown and demanded proof that they were alive. Later in the afternoon, during the National Defense Council session, she escalated her rhetoric, condemned the US operation and, despite the circumstances, insisted that Maduro remains in charge of Venezuela.
    


            “There is only one president in this country, and his name is Nicolás Maduro Moros,” said Rodríguez — now, by force of events, the most visible face of the government.

            It was just like watching television.
    


            Huddled in a draped-off room at Mar-a-Lago around screens set up for his viewing pleasure — including, according to photos released by the White House, a live feed of social media messages on X — President Donald Trump watched and listened as highly trained American Delta Force soldiers rushed into Nicolás Maduro's home in Caracas, where the Venezuelan leader was sleeping alongside his wife.
    


            Maduro was quickly dragged into custody as he tried to flee to his steel-enforced safe room.
    


            It was the dramatic culmination of a monthslong campaign whose ultimate goal has long been clear to those involved in its planning: to oust Maduro from power. Trump, who at points along the way voiced misgivings about the potential for unintended consequences and the chances the US could be drawn into a prolonged war, put aside any reservations and gave a green light to the operation in the days before Christmas.
    


            It wasn't until more than a week later that the weather cleared and conditions were right for the heavily-guarded mission. At 10:46 p.m. ET, after making a shopping excursion for marble and onyx and enjoying dinner on the Mar-a-Lago patio, the president gave the final go-ahead.
    


            “Good luck,” Trump told the assemblage of national security officials who had convened at his gilded private club in South Florida, “and Godspeed.”
    


            American helicopters were soon gliding across the sea, 100 feet above the dark water, toward Caracas. A couple of hours later, Maduro was in US custody, handcuffed, dressed in gray sweatpants and wearing blackout goggles, according to a picture Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday morning.
    


            Trump emerged Saturday to declare the United States would now “run” the country for an indeterminate future, offering strikingly little detail and claiming he wasn't afraid of “boots on the ground.”
    


            For a president whose political movement was fueled, in part, by resentments over two decades of bloody American foreign intervention, it was a remarkable turnabout. The president mostly glossed over the work that may lie ahead, focusing instead on obtaining access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves and repeatedly declining to rule out a more robust US military presence if Maduro's allies refuse to cede power.
    


            In the hours after the strike, sources around Washington, including congressional staffers and allies of the president, privately voiced concerns about the long-term consequences of the action — both in terms of US national security and the potential political fallout for a president with low-approval ratings whose base has shown little appetite for American intervention abroad.
    


            At Trump's side this week in Florida have been the chief architects of the escalating pressure campaign on Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior adviser Stephen Miller, who were seen at dinner with the president hours before the operation began. They joined him again as he proclaimed victory on Saturday.
    


            Preparations for the raid began in mid-December, people familiar with the plans told CNN. But the vision had been planted months earlier. Even before the first US military strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat from Venezuela in early September, the plan to remove Maduro from power was already in motion.
    


            While the US was visibly building up its military assets in the Caribbean, moving warships and other materiel to the region, another buildup was happening in secret. In August, the CIA covertly installed a small team inside Venezuela to track Maduro's patterns, locations and movements, which helped bolster Saturday's operation as to his exact whereabouts, including where he would be sleeping, sources familiar with the plans told CNN.
    


            The team found out “how he moved, where he lived, where he traveled, what he ate, what he wore, what were his pets,” Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday.
    


            The assets included a CIA source operating within the Venezuelan government who assisted the United States with tracking Maduro's location and movements ahead of his capture, one source briefed on the operation told CNN.
    


            The detailed timeline and the revelation that a CIA team has been operating inside Venezuela for so long sheds new light on the administration's pressure campaign on Maduro for the past several months, even as senior officials publicly stated their goal was not regime change.
    


            Several Democratic members of Congress on Saturday accused Rubio and Hegseth of lying to lawmakers during a Senate briefing last month.
    


            Sen. Andy Kim of New Jersey wrote in a post on X that “Secretaries Rubio and Hegseth looked every Senator in the eye a few weeks ago and said this wasn't about regime change. I didn't trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress.”
    


            In October, Trump said he authorized the CIA to operate inside Venezuela to clamp down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs from the South American nation. The CIA declined to comment.
    


            Late last month, the CIA carried out a drone strike on a port facility on the coast of Venezuela, sources familiar with the matter previously told CNN, marking the first known US attack inside that country. The strike targeted a remote dock on the Venezuelan coast that the US government believed was being used by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to store drugs and move them onto boats for shipping, the sources said.
    


            No one was present at the facility at the time it was struck, so there were no casualties, according to the sources.
    


            Despite the plans being drafted to oust Maduro, many White House officials had continued to hold out hope in recent weeks that the Venezuelan president would voluntarily step down, two senior White House officials told CNN.
    


            During a phone call between Trump and Maduro in November, the American president repeatedly stressed to the Venezuelan leader that “it would be in his best interest” to step down and leave the country, one official said, calling the conversation “pretty much an ultimatum.”
    


            “I want to be clear about one thing: Nicolas Maduro had multiple opportunities to avoid this,” Rubio said Saturday. “He was provided multiple, very, very, very generous offers and chose instead to act like a wild man, chose instead to play around, and the result is what we saw tonight.”
    


            As recently as the beginning of December, the administration believed it was beginning to see cracks in Maduro's support system, one of the officials told CNN. As time went by, however, that belief began to dissipate, and planning for the operation began.
    


            Once Trump gave the go-ahead in late December, the operation was disrupted by several factors, including the weather in Venezuela and the president's decision to strike Nigeria on Christmas, one official said.
    


            Caine said Saturday that “Operation Absolute Resolve” was the culmination of “months” of planning and rehearsals involving 150 aircraft and personnel across military and intelligence agencies.
    


            The troops tapped to participate then had to wait for the ideal conditions, Caine said, and were on standby through the holidays as weather delayed the operation.
    


            “Last night, the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could maneuver through,” Caine said.
    


            Once Trump gave the go-ahead just before 11 p.m. ET, US military aircraft began taking off from 20 bases in the Western Hemisphere, Caine said. Those aircraft would deliver precision strikes on Venezuelan ground targets, such as air defense systems, and provide cover for the helicopters carrying the extraction team to Caracas. The US also deployed cyberwarfare tactics to help clear a path for its teams operating in the sky and on the ground, Caine said.
    


            The helicopters with the extraction team reached Maduro's compound at 2 a.m. local time in Caracas, the general said. Upon arrival, the helicopters came under fire and one was hit but remained flyable. The US returned fire in defense, Caine added.
    


            “As the operation unfolded at the compound, our air and ground intelligence teams provided real-time updates to the ground force, ensuring those forces could safely navigate the complex environment without unnecessary risk,” he said.
    


            Caine said Maduro and his wife “gave up” to the US military personnel before being flown out of the country. Maduro and Flores were placed aboard the USS Iwo Jima, which stopped at the US military base in Guantanamo Bay, two sources familiar with the plans told CNN.
    


            The base, sometimes referred to as “Gitmo,” is in southeastern Cuba and is home to the notorious detention camp. There, Maduro and his wife were transferred to a plane, which landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York on Saturday evening.
    


            In Venezuela, people were unsure how to react.
    


            Numerous streets in Caracas, where the smell of gunpowder lingered, appeared deserted in the early hours of Saturday. Some people who went out in search of basic necessities, such as diapers, found that most businesses were closed, including pharmacies, supermarkets and gas stations.
    


            Trump, vacationing for a long stretch in South Florida, offered little indication he was planning one of the most consequential actions of either of his presidencies. Instead, he went about his usual rhythms: days at the golf course, dinners on the Mar-a-Lago patio, and hosting a New Year's Eve gala that featured a performance by Vanilla Ice.
    


            In the hours before he gave the final go-ahead, the president met at his golf club with Vice President JD Vance to discuss the strikes, but Vance returned home to Cincinnati after the operation began. Vance joined several late-night meetings via secure video conference with top national security officials leading up to the operation.
    


            A Vance spokesperson said the Trump national security team “was concerned a late-night motorcade movement by the Vice President while the operation was getting underway may tip off the Venezuelans.”
    


            Trump, meanwhile, watched the complex capture play out in real time from a room in Mar-a-Lago alongside military generals.
    


            “If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally, like I was watching a television show,” he mused later, calling into Fox News.
    


            “If you would have seen the, the speed, the violence … it was an amazing thing, amazing job that these people did. There's nobody else could have done anything like it,” Trump added.
    


            He had much less to say about what it might look like for the US to “run” Venezuela, offering vague allusions to a “group” that would govern the 31 million people who live there. And while he seemed confident Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez would “do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Rodriguez came out two hours afterword to insist her country had been “savagely attacked” by the operation.
    


            It all made for a startlingly unclear picture of what might come next, despite the months of planning that got Trump to Saturday.
    


            Asked by CNN whether he'd taken into consideration the mixed track record of American efforts to oust dictators, the president set himself apart.
    


            “That's when we had different presidents. But with me that's not true,” he said. “With me, we've had a perfect track record of winning.”

• Maduro on US soil: Captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn and will face drugs and weapons charges.
    


            • Trump's plan for Venezuela: President Donald Trump said the US will “run the country” until a “judicious transition” can happen. He also said the US will seize Venezuela's massive oil reserves.
    


            • Uncertain future: Venezuela's Supreme Court has directed Vice President Delcy Rodriguez to assume the powers and duties of acting president. Meanwhile, opposition leader María Corina Machado has called for an opposition candidate to assume power. Venezuelans across the country and abroad have expressed joy and hope — but also apprehension and anxiety.
    


            • Flights to resume: Flights through Caribbean airspace were set to resume from midnight Eastern Time after a large part of it was closed after the strike. Some airlines said they plan to restart service by Sunday.
    


            Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez asserted that Nicolás Maduro is “the only president of Venezuela” after US forces captured Maduro early Saturday.
    


            In a defiant address broadcast from Caracas, Rodríguez said that Venezuelans “must not become slaves again.”
    


            “We will never be a colony again,” she said.
    


            She also condemned the “aggression” from the United States and declared that the “words of the president are the only ones we are guided by.”
    


            Rodríguez sat alongside high-level government figures, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez and several military leaders.
    


            President Donald Trump announced early today that the United States had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife after carrying out airstrikes in the South American country.

            At the entrance of a Venezuelan restaurant in the small South Florida city of Doral, powerful and emotional verses of Venezuela's national anthem rang out. Like those in the restaurant, many other Venezuelans all over the world took to the streets Saturday just hours after Donald Trump announced the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro by US forces.
    


            Something unites Venezuelans in Spain, the United States, Argentina and Colombia, according to testimonies obtained by CNN: the hope that this could be a chance to return home. But there is also concern about the country's future and fears that loved ones in Venezuela could be at risk.
    


            “What conflicting feelings: On one hand, it's hard to explain what we feel seeing our Venezuela under bombardment, and as our loved ones remain there. On the other, we believe this may be the only way out. May God bless our beloved Venezuela,” a 51-year-old Venezuelan living in Miami told CNN, asking not to be named for fear of reprisals.
    


            Venezuelans also celebrated in Madrid. “I know there's still a long way to go, but no one can take this news out of our hearts, and I am incredibly happy,” Carolina Aponte told CNN. “I needed to come out and at least feel the embrace of some of my compatriots,” added the Caracas-born Venezuelan.
    


            “At first we were crying because our country was being bombed, but when we were told they had Maduro, the reaction was … overwhelming,” said Macunayma Centeno, part of a nearly 700,000-strong Venezuelan diaspora in Spain, the largest in Europe.

            The Trump administration carried out a large-scale military operation in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas earlier today, striking various parts of the city and capturing the country's President Nicolás Maduro.
    


For those just joining us, here's what you need to know:



CNN's Isaac Yee, Thomas Bordeaux, Avery Schmitz, Allegra Goodwin, Kevin Liptak, Simone Pathe, Inés Capdevila, Jim Sciutto, Michael Rios, Adam Cancryn, Betsy Klein, Alejandra Jaramillo Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, Katie Bo Lillis, and David Goldman contributed to this reporting.



            Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez demanded the “immediate release” of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were captured in a US military operation early Saturday.
    


            “We demand the immediate release of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, the only president of Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro,” Rodríguez said during a session of the National Defense Council broadcast by state television channel VTV.
    


             Alongside other top officials, Rodríguez said that Venezuela's territorial integrity was “savagely attacked” by the operation that the US carried out in Caracas and other parts of the country.
    


            Captured along with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro early Saturday was his wife and top adviser, Cilia Flores, who was dragged from their bedroom along with her husband by US troops.
    


            “Cilita,” as Maduro calls her, served as first lady for more than a decade — although in the official jargon of the socialist movement known as Chavismo she is referred to as “first combatant.” She has been Maduro's partner for more than 30 years, during which time she built her own political capital and was considered one of the most powerful women in Venezuela.
    


            Cilia Flores, born in 1956 in the town of Tinaquillo in central Venezuela, grew up in working-class neighborhoods in western Caracas. She met Maduro, who frequently emphasizes his humble origins, during the early days of the Chavista movement. A lawyer specializing in labor and criminal law, she provided legal assistance to Hugo Chávez, the movement's namesake, and other military officers who were captured after attempting to overthrow then-President Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992. Maduro, for his part, also campaigned for Chávez's release and was on the then-lieutenant colonel's security team.
    


            “During that struggle for Chávez's release, we were involved in street activities. I always remember a meeting in Catia, and when a young man asked to speak, he spoke, and I just stared at him. I said, ‘How intelligent,'” Flores recalled in November 2023, on the first episode of Maduro's podcast.

            The House Armed Services Committee is in the process of arranging a committee briefing next week on the Trump administration's large-scale military operation in Venezuela, a committee aide told CNN.
    


            The panel's Republican chair, Rep. Mike Rogers, spoke with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth today, the aide added.
    


            Top Democrats demanded an immediate briefing this morning in the wake of the strike.
    


            Earlier today, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the Trump administration for not seeking congressional authorization before the attack.
    


                    “The Trump administration has not sought congressional authorization for use of military force and has failed to property notify Congress in advance of the operation in Venezuela,” Jeffries said in a statement. “The promotion of security and stability in a region requires more than just military force as we painfully discovered in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
                





            Jeffries added that “far too many questions remain unanswered and called for evidence to “explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force.”
    


            In a separate statement, Schumer said the administration “has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.
    


                    “Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” Schumer added.

            The Federal Aviation Administration has banned US civilian aircraft from operating in airspace over Puerto Rico and surrounding portions of the Caribbean, citing safety risks tied to ongoing military activity.
    


            The emergency restriction applies to all altitudes within the San Juan Flight Information Region, a large area of Caribbean airspace, and covers US air carriers, commercial operators and FAA-certificated pilots. US military and state aircraft are exempt, and flights may operate only with specific authorization from the US government or the FAA.
    


            The order took effect at 1 a.m. ET Saturday, January 3, the same day US forces announced the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and is set to remain in place until midnight ET Sunday, January 4, according to the notice to airmen issued by the FAA.
    


            Doral, Florida, just outside Miami, is nicknamed “Doralzuela,” because there are so many Venezuelans who have relocated there.
    


            Today they are dancing, waving flags and cheering, “Liberty!” after US President Donald Trump announced Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had been captured in a large-scale US military operation.
    


            CNN's David Culver spoke with people in the crowd, including one young woman who came to the US eleven years ago. She said the US is now her home but she believes her parents would like to go back to Venezuela now that Maduro is gone:
    


            US oil giant Chevron said Saturday it remains squarely focused on the safety of its employees and business interests in Venezuela following the sudden US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Houston-based Chevron is the leading American oil company in Venezuela, where it started operating more than a century ago.
    


            “Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,” Laura Hurst, a company spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Hurst said Chevron continues to “operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.”
    


            Chevron has operations in five onshore and offshore production projects in Venezuela and partners with PDVSA, a state-owned oil and natural gas company.
    


            Chevron did not comment on how the US strikes on Venezuela and dramatic arrest of Maduro will change the company's business interests in Venezuela and whether it will seek to expand operations in the country under a friendlier government.
    


            Venezuela has the most oil reserves of any nation on the planet, yet it accounts for roughly just 1% of world oil production.
    


            Republican lawmakers are largely applauding the Trump administration's military action in Venezuela this weekend, after the US carried out a strike in the country's capital, Caracas, and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
    


Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio this morning and expect briefings to Congress in the coming days.
    


            “President Trump's decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States,” Thune said in a news release.
    


            Johnson said in his own statement that he had also spoken with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “in the last several hours” and that “today's military action in Venezuela was a decisive and justified operation that will protect American lives.”
    


Sens. Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul said in respective statements they support Maduro's removal.
    


            “We will be more prosperous and safer for it. I am hoping and praying that the Venezuelan people will soon have a fresh start on democracy and freedom,” Graham wrote.
    


            In a long post mostly criticizing socialism, Paul wrote, “few Venezuelans, or Americans for that matter, will or should mourn the removal of Nicolas Maduro from power.”
    


Rep. Adam Smith told reporters on Capitol Hill on Saturday he was “glad” the US conducted the strike, adding that “Americans have died because of Nicolas Maduro.”
    


Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska in a statement called the strike “great for the future of Venezuelans and the region” but added that he worried “dictators will try to exploit this to rationalize their selfish objectives.”
    


Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a top ally-turned-critic of President Donald Trump who is resigning from Congress this week, was one of the rare Republican voices to criticize the strike outright.
    


            “If U.S. military action and regime change in Venezuela was really about saving American lives from deadly drugs then why hasn't the Trump admin taken action against Mexican cartels?” Greene wrote in a lengthy post on X. “And if prosecuting narco terrorists is a high priority then why did President Trump pardon the former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was convicted and sentenced for 45 years for trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into America? Ironically cocaine is the same drug that Venezuela primarily traffics into the U.S.”
    


            Caught between disbelief and fear of possible new attacks, Venezuelans woke up to news that until recently seemed impossible: the capture of President Nicolás Maduro and his removal from Venezuela, announced by US President Donald Trump.
    


            “That's a lie,” a doorman in Caracas said in the morning upon hearing the first reports of what had happened. Skepticism prevailed among those who had not heard the overnight explosions in the capital — sounds that some mistook for New Year's fireworks — until senior figures within the Venezuelan leadership confirmed the US operation themselves. A request for proof of life made by Vice President Delcy Rodríguez indicated that, at that moment, Maduro's whereabouts were unknown.
    


            Hours later, Trump said in an interview with Fox News that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were aboard the USS Iwo Jima en route to New York. “The helicopters took them out, and they went by helicopter in a nice flight.”
    


            Numerous streets in Caracas, where the smell of gunpowder lingered, appeared deserted in the early hours of Saturday. Some people who went out in search of basic necessities, such as diapers, found that most businesses were closed — even those that had opened on January 1, including pharmacies, supermarkets and gas stations.
    


            “I see a somewhat warlike atmosphere. Silence can say many things,” a driver from eastern Caracas told CNN, asking not to be identified for security reasons. According to him, he traveled through several neighborhoods of the city and saw a recurring scene: shops operating behind closed doors, allowing only two people in at a time. This has led to long lines outside establishments, with people seeking food and medicine.
    


            “Everything is relatively calm, but there could be shortages. No one expected this; we were caught off guard,” he said.
    


            The silence has not been absolute. Some opponents of Maduro's government celebrated from their balconies and played lively music. The political situation prevents many critics from taking to the streets for fear of repression.
    


            Those who did go out very early were some supporters of the Venezuelan socialist movement known as Chavismo. They were seen in the vicinity of the Miraflores presidential palace, showing their support for Maduro.
    


            Beyond political alignment, a broader sense of tension persists due to Trump's statements. In addition to saying that the United States will govern Venezuela for now, he did not rule out further military actions in the country.
    


            In his Saturday address to the nation, President Donald Trump touted the military attacks he ordered on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean near Venezuela — then repeated his false claim that “each boat kills 25 — on average, 25,000 people.”
    


            This figure is fiction.
    


            Aside from the fact that the Trump administration has not presented public proof for his repeated claims that the boats carried fentanyl – the Caribbean is not known to be a significant fentanyl-smuggling route – his “25,000” number does not make sense.
    


            The total number of US overdose deaths from all drugs in 2024 was about 82,000, according to provisional federal data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    


            The president's figure is “absurd,” Carl Latkin, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University school of public health with a joint appointment at its medical school, told CNN in October, when Trump also made such claims. “He's claiming that he's solved the overdose mortality crisis” with the boat strikes (just four known at the time), Latkin said, and “that does not have any semblance of reality.” You can read a longer fact check here.
    


            One Venezuela expert who spoke to CNN noticed a glaring omission in US President Donald Trump's press conference on the extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
    


                    Trump “didn't mention democracy even once in the whole press conference,” said David Smilde, a Venezuela expert and professor at Tulane University.
                





            During the press conference, Trump called Maduro a “dictator” and said the US would “run” Venezuela until it could ensure a “judicious transition.”
    


            However, a transcript of the president's remarks shows that he did not specifically reference the return of democracy in Venezuela.
    


            “It doesn't look like they have in mind a democratic transition,” Smilde said. “They have in mind a country that is friendly and open to the United States' interests, stable and economically productive.”
    


            “It doesn't sound like democracy or (opposition leader) Maria Corina Machado are even on the map, at this point,” Smilde added.
    


            Trump told reporters Saturday that Machado “doesn't have the support” to lead Venezuela.
    


            When asked about the possibility of new elections in the country, Trump said he'd “like to do it quickly,” but soon pivoted to an extended response about Venezuelan oil infrastructure.
    


            Smilde said Trump's stated plan harkens back to the age of US “gunboat diplomacy” in the region during the 19th and 20th centuries, when US presidents toppled Latin American leaders and replaced them with figures more amenable to US economic interests.
    


            “It's realpolitik, but I think it goes beyond that,” Smilde continued. “It's much more a sort of gunboat diplomacy, and gunboat economic development as well.”
    


            Trump administration officials are internally pointing to a 1989 legal opinion and the subsequent US invasion of Panama as precedent to justify the operation that was carried out in Venezuela without US congressional authorization, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            The opinion concluded that the president has the constitutional authority to deploy the FBI to investigate and arrest individuals for violating US law, “even if those actions contravene international law.”
    


The FBI was on the ground with US Delta Force soldiers during Friday night's operation to arrest Maduro and his wife, CNN has reported. Another source said placing the FBI on the ground was likely a “loophole” so the administration could lean on the 1989 opinion.
    


            The 1989 legal opinion paved the way for the US, under George H.W. Bush, to invade Panama later that year without congressional authorization and ultimately capture Panama's military dictator, Manuel Noriega, who was flown to stand trial in Miami for drug trafficking, money laundering and racketeering.
    


            Maduro was similarly captured by US forces on Friday night following a US military operation that was carried out without congressional authorization and is being sent to New York to face charges related to drug trafficking.
    


            The 1989 opinion also says the president has the authority to override a provision of the UN Charter that stipulates that member states “shall refrain … from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”
    


            Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser at the State Department who now serves as a senior adviser at the Crisis Group, said the use of the legal opinion to justify the Venezuela operation is “not persuasive as a matter of international law” and called Trump's actions a “flagrant violation of the UN Charter.”
    


            But, he said, “as a matter of domestic law, this may check all the boxes.”
    


            Sources noted a key difference, however, between the Panama and Venezuela operations: Panama had declared war on the US before the American intervention.
    


            “There were tens of thousands Americans in Panama allegedly in danger; Noriega had declared war on the US, and the neutrality and protection of the Panama Canal was at risk,” said Daniel Maurer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and judge advocate.
    


            New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani called the US operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro an “act of war” and a violation of international and federal law.
    


            Maduro and his wife, who were captured overnight in Caracas, are being transported back to the United States. The authoritarian leader is expected to be held in federal custody in New York City, where he is facing federal indictment.
    


            Mamdani, who is three days into his term as mayor, said he was briefed on the operation as well as Maduro's “planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City.”
    


                    “Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law. This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn't just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home,” Mamdani said. “My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance.”
                





Some background: New York City is home to a large Venezuelan community, which has grown significantly in the last three years as hundreds of thousands of people fled the country. Many of them settled in New York, helping to drive a massive migrant crisis in the city in 2022.
    


            Mamdani, a democratic socialist, faced some criticism during the mayoral campaign for hesitating to refer to Maduro as a dictator during an interview. He later clarified his position, saying he believed Maduro was a dictator.
    


            Vice President JD Vance was not in the room with President Donald Trump and other top-level officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth while the Venezuela operation was underway, and he was not at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.
    


            But he was “deeply integrated in the process and planning” of the strikes and President Nicolás Maduro's arrest, a Vance spokesman told CNN.
    


            The vice president joined several late-night meetings via secure video conference with top national security officials leading up to the operation.
    


            Vance had met briefly with Trump at his Florida golf course — which is a short distance from Mar-a-Lago — earlier Friday to discuss the strikes, but the Trump national security team “was concerned a late-night motorcade movement by the Vice President while the operation was getting underway may tip off the Venezuelans,” the Vance spokesman said.
    


            Vance returned to Cincinnati, Ohio, after the operation concluded.
    


            “Due to increased security concerns, the Administration has aimed to limit the frequency and duration of the Vice President and President being co-located away from the White House,” the spokesman told CNN.
    


            US President Donald Trump just spoke to journalists about his country's actions in Venezuela this morning, including large-scale strikes on Caracas and the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
    


Here are key takeaways from the news conference that wrapped up a short time ago:



CNN's Adam Cancryn, Betsy Klein, Kit Maher, Alejandra Jaramillo and Donald Judd contributed to this reporting.



            President Donald Trump on Saturday defended his pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug-trafficking charges, claiming that Hernández was “unfairly” persecuted.
    


            Trump's remarks came at a news conference after the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who the administration has said will face drugs and weapons charges.
    


            When asked by a reporter to explain how the situations that led to Hernández's pardon and Maduro's capture are different, Trump said, “The man that I pardoned was … treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump.”
    


            “This was a man who was persecuted very unfairly,” Trump said.
    


            Hernández, who was the president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022, was convicted and sentenced in 2024 to 45 years in prison and given an $8 million fine by a US judge for drug-trafficking offenses.
    


            Trump pardoned Hernández in early December, drawing criticism from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress, with some saying they didn't understand the decision given the administration's efforts to stop drug trafficking.
    


            In the hours after US forces removed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump repeated his frequent claim that Venezuela under Maduro emptied its prisons and mental health facilities to send the people in them to the US as migrants. Trump has never corroborated the claim, and experts have told CNN that they have seen no evidence for it.
    


            Trump revived the claim in a Fox News interview Saturday morning, then said it once more in his address to the nation: “As I've said many times, the Maduro regime emptied out their prisons; sent their worst and most violent monsters into the United States to steal American lives. And they came from mental institutions and insane asylums, they came from prisons and jails.” He added: “They sent from their mental institutions, they sent from their jails, prisons; they were drug dealers, they were drug kingpins. They sent everybody bad into the United States.”
    


            There has been large-scale emigration from Venezuela under Maduro. But despite multiple requests for comment from CNN and other outlets, Trump and his aides have not proven that Maduro emptied any facility to somehow send undesirable citizens into the US.
    


            Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence, said in an email to CNN in June 2024: “We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country.”
    


Helen Fair, an expert on global prisons at Birkbeck, University of London, told CNN in 2024 that she had “seen absolutely no evidence” that any country had emptied prisons to send prisoners to the US, let alone that numerous countries had done so as Trump has claimed.

Heavy rain and high tides believed to be the most severe in two decades caused flooding in parts of Northern California on Saturday, prompting road closures and rescues of people trapped in cars.
    


            Roadways through a 15-mile stretch from the Sausalito area to San Rafael were flooded after a downpour coincided with record-breaking “King Tides,” Marin County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Dobbins said.
    


            Authorities were called to assist when cars got stuck in water as high as 3 and 4 feet, Dobbins said.
    


            “There is a lot of water in the roadways,” Dobbins said, adding the tides were reportedly the highest in more than two decades. “Along with heavy rains, it just created the perfect storm for flooding on the streets.”
    


            Authorities in the affected communities, which are north of San Francisco, asked people to stay home until waters recede. Some people kayaked along swamped streets, while others waded through water above their knees.
    


            A flood advisory is in place for the San Francisco area until 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, and repeated rounds of rain were expected throughout the state on Sunday and Monday.
    


            To the south in Santa Barbara County, roads were closed due to flooding and a key highway was blocked near Goleta due to a series of mudslides. A man died after he was swept into a creek during the storm, the county sheriff's office said.
    


            King Tides occur when the sun, moon and Earth are in alignment and the moon is in its closest position to the Earth, creating a stronger gravitational pull.

DORAL, Fla. (AP) — Revelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida on Saturday to celebrate the U.S. military operation to capture Nicolás Maduro and remove him from the country — a stunning outcome they had longed for but left them wondering what comes next in their troubled homeland.

For some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.

People gathered for a rally in Doral — the Miami suburb where President Donald Trump has a golf resort and where roughly half the population is of Venezuelan descent — as word spread that Venezuela's now-deposed president had been captured and flown out of the country.

Outside El Arepazo restaurant, a hub of the Venezuelan culture of Doral, one man held a piece of cardboard with “Libertad” scrawled with a black marker. It was a sentiment expressed by other native Venezuelans hoping for a new beginning for their home country as they chanted “Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!”

“We're like everybody — it's a combination of feelings, of course,” said Alejandra Arrieta, who came to the U.S. in 1997. “There's fears. There's excitement. There's so many years that we've been waiting for this. Something had to happen in Venezuela. We all need the freedom.”




For David Nuñez, the regime change offered hope for a long-awaited reunion with loved ones.

Nuñez said he fled to the United States six years ago after being persecuted in Venezuela for his political activism and has not seen his daughters — ages 8 and 17 — since then.

“The most important thing is that we're going to be able to be with our families soon,” Nuñez said. “At least for me, I haven't seen my daughters in six years so I have a lot of mixed feelings. I've cried a lot. I'm really happy because I know that I'm going to be able to return to Venezuela very soon.”

Trump insisted Saturday that the U.S. government would run the country at least temporarily and was already doing so. The action marked the culmination of an escalating Trump administration pressure campaign on the oil-rich South American nation as well as weeks of planning that tracked Maduro's behavioral habits.

After Trump's press conference about U.S. actions in Venezuela, people still gathered outside of the Doral restaurant sang, danced and waved flags. A percussionist drummed along with the singing crowd.

People started gathering outside the restaurant once the news broke. Cooks were told to stay and prepare more food for anticipated high demand. Hundreds showed up, and the crowd kept growing as the day went on.

Alexa Perez said she has waited year for this moment. 

“Thanks, President Trump. This is our second liberty. This our independence day from today on,” Perez said.

She married a week ago and said the news was the “best wedding gift” possible.

Her husband, Aldo Amenta, said they were scared, excited and confused at first and felt better when they learned their family members were safe.

“We're really happy and excited that the doors are open for Venezuela, for all of our people who deserve a chance,” Amenta said.

Perez responded positively to apparent U.S. plans to run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations, saying her homeland has not received anything from Russia, Iran and China.

“We are very poor, we have no hospital, we have no rights for our people,” Perez said. “So I think this is going to be a great transition. Because once you know how the U.S. works, you know that everything can work better.”

About 8 million people have fled the country since 2014, settling first in neighboring countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. After the COVID-19 pandemic, they increasingly set their sights on the United States, walking through the jungle in Colombia and Panama or flying to the U.S. on humanitarian parole with a financial sponsor.

In South Florida, deep-seated concerns in the Venezuelan community about Trump's tough immigration policies gave way to celebrations after Maduro was deposed in the American military operation early Saturday.

In Doral, upper-middle-class professionals and entrepreneurs came to invest in property and businesses when socialist Hugo Chávez won the presidency in the late 1990s. They were followed by political opponents and entrepreneurs who set up small businesses. In recent years, more lower-income Venezuelans have come for work in service industries.

They are doctors, lawyers, beauticians, construction workers and house cleaners. Some are naturalized U.S. citizens or live in the country illegally with U.S.-born children. Others overstay tourist visas, seek asylum or have some form of temporary status.

Niurka Meléndez, who fled from Venezuela in 2015, said Saturday she's hopeful that Maduro's ouster will improve life in her homeland. Meléndez immigrated to New York City, where she co-founded the group Venezuelans and Immigrants Aid, which strives to empower the lives of immigrants. She became a steadfast advocate for change in her home country, where she said her countrymen faced a humanitarian crisis.

Now, she hopes those hardships will fade away.

“For us, it's just the start of the justice we need to see,” Meléndez said in a phone interview.

Her homeland had reached a “breaking point” due to forced displacements, repression, hunger and fear, she said. Now there's a need for international humanitarian support to help in Venezuela's recovery. 

“Removing an authoritarian system responsible for these crimes creates the possibility, not a guarantee, but a possibility, for recovery,” she said. “A future without criminal control over institutions is the minimum condition for rebuilding a country based on justice, rule of law, and democratic safeguards.”

TEL AVIV (AP) — Israel's decision to revoke the licenses of more than three dozen humanitarian organizations this week has aid groups scrambling to grapple with what this means for their operations in Gaza and their ability to help tens of thousands of struggling Palestinians. 

The 37 groups represent some of the most prominent of the more than 100 independent nongovernmental organizations working in Gaza, alongside United Nations agencies. Those banned include Doctors Without Borders, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam and Medical Aid for Palestinians.

The groups do everything from providing tents and water to supporting clinics and medical facilities. The overall impact, however, remains unclear.

The most immediate impact of the license revocation is that Israel will no longer allow the groups to bring supplies into the Gaza Strip or send international staffers into the territory. Israel says all suspended groups have to halt their operations by March 1.

Some groups have already been barred from bringing in aid. The Norwegian Refugee Council, for example, said it has not been allowed to bring in supplies in 10 months, leaving it distributing tents and aid brought in by other groups.

Israel says the banned groups make up only a small part of aid operations in Gaza. 

But aid officials say they fulfill crucial specific functions. In a joint statement Tuesday, the U.N. and leading NGOs said the organizations that are still licensed by Israel “are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs” in Gaza. 




The ban further strains aid operations even as Gaza's over 2 million Palestinians still face a humanitarian crisis more than 12 weeks into a ceasefire. The U.N. says that although famine has been staved off, more than a quarter of families still eat only one meal a day and food prices remain out of reach for many; more than 1 million people need better tents as winter storms lash the territory.

Earlier this year, Israel introduced strict new registration requirements for aid agencies working in Gaza. Most notably, it required groups to provide the names and personal details of local and international staff and said it would ban groups for a long list of criticisms of Israel.

The registration process is overseen by Israel's Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, led by a far-right member of the ruling Likud party.

Israel says the rules aim to prevent Hamas and other militants from infiltrating the groups, something it has said was happening throughout the 2-year-old war. The U.N., which leads the massive aid program in Gaza, and independent groups deny the allegations and Israeli claims of major diversion of aid supplies by Hamas.

Aid organizations say they did not comply, in part, because they feared that handing over staff information could endanger them. More than 500 aid workers have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the United Nations. 

Israel denies targeting aid workers. But the group say Israel has been vague about how it would use the data.

The groups also said Israel was vague about how it would use the data. 

“Demanding staff lists as a condition for access to territory is an outrageous overreach,” Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said Friday. It said Israeli officials had refused its attempts to find alternatives.

A December report on MSF issued by an Israeli government team recommended rejection of the group's license. It pointed primarily to statements by the group criticizing Israel, including referring to its campaign in Gaza as genocide and calling its monthslong ban on food entering the territory earlier this year as “a starvation tactic.” It said the statements violated neutrality and constituted “delegitimization of Israel.”

The report also repeated claims that an MSF employee killed in by an Israeli airstrike in 2024 was an operative with the Islamic Jihad militant group. That, it said, suggested MSF “maintains connections with a terrorist group.”

MSF on Friday denied the allegations, saying it would “never knowingly employ anyone involved in military activities.” It said that its statements cited by Israel simply described the destruction its teams witnessed in Gaza.

“The fault lies with those committing these atrocities, not with those who speak of them,” it said.

Aid groups have a week from Dec. 31 to appeal the process.

Independent NGOs play a major role in propping up Gaza's health sector, devastated by two years of Israeli bombardment and restrictions on supplies.

MSF said Israel's decision would have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza's five stabilization centers helping children with severe malnutrition.

Its teams treated 100,000 trauma cases, performed surgeries on 10,000 patients and handled a third of Gaza's births, the group says. It has 60 international staffers in the West Bank and Gaza and more than 1,200 local staff — most medical professionals.

Since the ceasefire began in early October, MSF has brought in about 7% of the 2,239 tons (2,032 metric tonnes) of medical supplies that Israel has allowed into Gaza, according to a U.N. tracking dashboard. That makes it the largest provider of medical supplies after U.N. agencies and the Red Cross, according to the dashboard.

Medecins du Monde, another group whose license is being halted, runs another four primary health clinics.

Aid groups say the most immediate impact will likely be the inability to send international staff into Gaza. 

Foreign staff provide key technical expertise and emotional support for their Palestinian colleagues.

“Having international presence in Gaza is a morale booster for our staff who are already feeling isolated,” said Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, which is one of the main NGOs providing shelter supplies and fresh water to displaced people.

NRC has roughly 30 international staff who rotate in and out of Gaza working alongside some 70 Palestinians. 

While any operations by the 37 groups in the West Bank will likely remain open, those with offices in east Jerusalem, which Israel considers its territory, might have to close.

Many of the 37 groups already had been blocked from bringing supplies into Gaza since March, said Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead for Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.

What changes with the formal license revocation is “that these practices are now formalized, giving Israel full impunity to restrict operations and shut out organizations it disagrees with,” she said.

Some of the groups have turned to buying supplies within Gaza rather than bringing them in, but that is slower and more expensive, she said. Other groups dug into reserve stocks, pared down distribution and had to work with broken or heavily repaired equipment because they couldn't bring in new ones.

Amed Khan, an American humanitarian philanthropist who has been privately donating medicine and emergency nutrition for children to Gaza, said the impact extends beyond the aid groups.

He relies on NGOs to receive and distribute the supplies, but the fewer groups that Israel approves, the harder it is to find one. 

“It's death by bureaucracy,” he said.

Hours after a dramatic military operation ousted Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.

U.S. operations on Saturday represented America's most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation's 2003 invasion of Iraq. The actions raise stark new questions about the legality of the U.S. moves under a broader campaign against the South American nation.

The middle-of-the-night seizure of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who were transported on a U.S. warship and arrived in New York Saturday evening to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges, is beyond even the most high-profile historical examples of aggressive American actions toward autocratic governments in Panama, Iraq and beyond, legal experts said. It came after a surprise U.S. incursion into the Venezuelan capital, rocked with overnight explosions early Saturday.

The Trump administration described the operation — and earlier deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea — as necessary to stem the flow of dangerous drugs.

Here's what we know:








Hundreds gathered in the rain in downtown Los Angeles to protest the U.S. military action in Venezuela. 

People donning raincoats and holding umbrellas carried signs saying “Stop bombing Venezuela now!” and “No blood for oil” as they listened to speakers. One person held a handwritten sign saying “No War! No Trump!”

A smaller group of about 50 people protested in Las Vegas.

The U.S. military operation that captured Maduro and flew him out of the country has also disrupted Caribbean travel at a busy holiday travel time for the region.

Elisia Cohen had planned to return from her family vacation in Puerto Rico on Friday but a mechanical issue grounded their Delta flight back to Minneapolis. Then, the University of Minnesota professor woke up before dawn Saturday to the news of the strikes on Venezuela and the delay, then cancellations of all flights.

“I hope this will not become a nightmare of airspace not opening up,” she said. 

She spent most of Saturday trying to rebook a flight back to anywhere in the continental United States, and even though she succeeded, she said she won't truly stop worrying until the airspace reopens and flights start taking off again.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a social media post that “the FAA restricted the airspace in the Caribbean and Venezuela to ensure the SAFETY of the flying public.”

“When appropriate, these airspace restrictions will be lifted,” he said. “Please work with your airlines directly if your flight has been impacted.”

President Donald Trump had long threatened that he could order military strikes on targets on Venezuelan territory after months of attacks on boats accused of carrying drugs from the South American country.



Uncertainty gripped Venezuela on Saturday as people scrambled to understand who was in charge of the South American country.

Trump delivered a shocking pick for who would take control: The United States, perhaps in coordination with one of Maduro's most trusted aides.

Delcy Rodríguez has served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela's oil-dependent economy as well as its feared intelligence service. But she is someone the Trump administration apparently is willing to work with, at least for now.

“She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” Trump told reporters of Rodríguez, who faced U.S. sanctions during Trump's first administration for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.

Trump indicated that Rodríguez had been sworn in already as president of Venezuela, per the transfer of power outlined in the constitution. However, state television has not broadcast any swearing-in ceremony.

In her televised address, Rodríguez did not declare herself acting president or mention a political transition. A ticker at the bottom of the screen identified her as the vice president. She gave no sign that she would be cooperating with the U.S.

“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” she said. “History and justice will make the extremists who promoted this armed aggression pay.”

Revelers chanted “liberty” and draped Venezuelan flags over their shoulders in South Florida to celebrate Maduro's capture and removal from the country. 

For some Venezuelan natives, the military action — culminating months of stepped-up U.S. pressure — brought their dreams of reuniting with loved ones closer to reality after years of heartbreaking separations.

After months of growing military pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, President Donald Trump ordered a brazen operation into the South American country to capture its leader and whisk him to the United States where his administration planned to put him on trial.








The Congressional Black Caucus is blasting Trump over U.S. actions against Maduro, calling the operation “a grave and illegal abuse of power.”

“While Nicolás Maduro is, in fact, an illegitimate leader, the deployment of U.S. military power to impose political change in a sovereign nation — without the consent of Congress or a clear and defined plan of action — threatens to draw the United States into an indefinite conflict in Venezuela,” the caucus said in statement.

“We cannot understate the severity of the consequences that could follow from such reckless actions, which threaten regional stability and weaken our standing on the world stage,” the lawmakers said.

Hours after an audacious military operation that plucked leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country, President Donald Trump said Saturday that the United States would run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations. A plane carrying the deposed leader landed late Saturday afternoon in New York.

At around 5:25 p.m., a person in custody was escorted out of the plane believed to be carrying Maduro. 

The person gingerly made his way down a stairway one step at a time, then was led across the tarmac surrounded by a crowd of at least three dozen federal agents. 

Several agents in the crowd appeared to film the person on their phones.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government welcomes the opportunity for freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Venezuelan people. 

Carney notes in a post on a social media that Canada has not recognized the “illegitimate regime of Maduro since it stole the 2018 election.” He says Canada has long supported a “Venezuelan-led transition process that respects the democratic will of the Venezuelan people.” 

Carney is calling on all parties to respect international law and says Canada stands by the “Venezuelan people's sovereign right to decide and build their own future.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on his “bold and historic leadership on behalf of freedom and justice.”

In a statement posted on his X account, the Israeli leader added “I salute your decisive resolve and the brilliant action of your brave soldiers.”





New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat, said he called Trump directly following the president's press conference Saturday “to register my opposition to this act.”

Mamdani declined to say whether he had spoken to Trump about Maduro's possible arrival in New York.

Mamdani said his stance was based on “being opposed to a pursuit of regime change to the violation of federal, international law.” 

Mamdani said his role as mayor was to ensure that the federal government's plans for Maduro had “minimal impact on the day to day lives of New Yorkers.”

The U.N. Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting on U.S. operations in Venezuela on Monday at 10 a.m.. That's according to a council diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a meeting that has not yet been made public.

The development comes after an emergency request by Colombia and support from China & Russia.

Colombia, which began its two-year term on the council on Friday, had also requested that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres join in briefing the council on the developments. The 15-member council has been surprisingly inactive on the issue of Venezuela for the last several months, even as U.S. posturing and boat strikes in the Caribbean increased.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said discussions about the “evolving situation” in Venezuela will take place with U.S. counterparts in the coming days and that his government will “shed no tears” about the end of Nicolas Maduro's regime.

“We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” Starmer said in a statement.Starmer, who reiterated his support for international law, said the U.K. will “seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people.”





Hours after an audacious military operation that plucked leader Nicolás Maduro from power and removed him from the country Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would run Venezuela at least temporarily and tap its vast oil reserves to sell to other nations.

The dramatic action capped an intensive Trump administration pressure campaign on the South American country and its autocratic leader and months of secret planning resulting in the most assertive American action to achieve regime change since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Speaking to reporters hours after Maduro's capture, Trump revealed his plans to exploit the leadership void to “fix” the country's oil infrastructure and sell “large amounts” of oil to other countries.

Venezuela's vice president demanded in a speech that the U.S. free Maduro and called him the country's rightful leader.

Trump described Maduro as being “highly guarded” in a presidential palace that was “a heavily fortified military fortress in the heart of Caracas.” Maduro had nearly made it to a safe room inside it, Trump told reporters, although “he was unable to close it.”

In an interview earlier Saturday morning on “Fox & Friends Weekend,” Trump said that American forces were armed with “massive blowtorches,” which they would have used to cut through steel walls had Maduro locked himself in the room.

“It had what they call a safety space, where it's solid steel all around,” Trump told Fox. “He didn't get that space closed. He was trying to get into it, but he got bum-rushed right so fast that he didn't get into that. We were prepared.”

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at Trump's news conference that U.S. forces had rehearsed their maneuvers for months, learning everything about Maduro — where he was and what he ate, as well as details of his pets and the clothes he wore.

“We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again, and again,” Caine said, saying his forces were “set” by early December. “Not to get it right, but to ensure we cannot get it wrong.”

Trump said on Fox that U.S. forces had practiced their extraction on a replica building.

“They actually built a house which was identical to the one they went into with all the same, all that steel all over the place,” Trump said.

Trump said the U.S. operation took place in darkness, although he did not detail how that had happened. “The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,” Trump said. “It was dark and it was deadly.”

In a televised address to the nation that lasted less than 15 minutes, Delcy Rodríguez left open the door for dialogue with the U.S. while also seeking to calm ruling party supporters.

“Here, we have a government with clarity, and I repeat and repeat again … we are willing to have respectful relations,” she said, referring to the Trump administration. “It is the only thing we will accept for a type of relationship after having attacked (Venezuela).” 

Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who was a national security official in the George W. Bush administration, said seizing control of Venezuela's resources opens up additional legal issues.

“For example, a big issue will be who really owns Venezuela's oil?” Waxman wrote in an email. “An occupying military power can't enrich itself by taking another state's resources, but the Trump administration will probably claim that the Venezuelan government never rightfully held them.”

But Waxman, who served in the State and Defense departments and on the National Security Council under Bush, noted that “we've seen the administration talk very dismissively about international law when it comes to Venezuela.”






Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in a statement Saturday that Nicolás Maduro led Venezuela to disaster and noted that Germany, like many other countries, didn't recognize his presidency after the South American nation's last election.

Merz said that a legal classification of the U.S. intervention is “complex” and “we will take time” on the matter.He said that political instability must not arise in Venezuela now and that it's important to ensure “an orderly transition to a government legitimized by elections.”

The vice president's office said Vance was in Florida on Friday, where he quietly met during the day with the president at his golf club in West Palm Beach to discuss the impending strikes.

But he did not join Trump and other top administration officials at Mar-a-Lago to watch the operation because the national security team was concerned about the vice president's motorcade potentially tipping off the Venezuelans to the impending action.

Vance instead watched the operation unfold via secure video conference and then flew to his home in Cincinnati after the operation concluded. His office said he was “deeply integrated in the process and planning.”

Vance's office said that due “to increased security concerns, the Administration has aimed to limit the frequency and duration of the Vice President and President being co-located away from the White House.”

Yanire Lucas, a Caracas resident whose house sits pressed up next to a Venezuelan military base that was struck overnight, said she began to hear explosions next to her house around 1:50 in the morning.

Lucas said the terrified family took shelter when the first explosion shook their home. She walked through shattered glass and other debris lining the floor of her apartment, and past broken doors and window frames on Saturday morning.

Lucas said that she hasn't seen anything like it, even after years of turmoil roiling Venezuela. Now, her family like many others in the South American nation are wracked with a feeling of uncertainty.

Lucas said she was scared to even leave the house. “What is happening is unprecedented,” Lucas said. “We're still on edge, and now we're uncertain about what to do. Stay safe at home, go out to look for food? I don't know.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is hinting that Cuba could be the next target of the Trump administration's push to restore American dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Rubio said he would be a bit concerned if he were a Cuban government official following the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

“If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I'd be concerned at least a little bit,” said Rubio, who has had a long preoccupation with both Venezuela and Cuba.

The U.S. has had a long history of military interventions in Latin America, including its tacit support for the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion led by Cuban exiles aimed at toppling Fidel Castro

Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the attack on Venezuela as criminal and warned that Latin America is not the “backyard” where the United States does as it pleases.

“Its attack on Venezuela shatters the stability that has characterized our region for years,” the president said during a rally that drew thousands of people in Havana. “The attack in the early morning hours against a peaceful and noble people can only be described as cowardly, criminal, and treacherous.” He also demanded proof of life for Maduro. 

According to the Cuban leader, the attack is not intended to end drug trafficking — for which no evidence implicating Maduro was presented — but rather to seize Venezuela's oil and natural resources through an act of “state terrorism,” which he likened to the Israeli attack on Gaza.

The rally in Havana took place at the so-called Anti-Imperialist Tribune, located across from the U.S. Embassy.

The vice president posted two messages on social media earlier Saturday congratulating the special operations forces involved in Venezuela and defending the operation against criticisms it was illegal.

But his absence with other officials in Florida on Saturday was notable because Vance has been one of the strongest voices in the administration for one of the president's doctrines, an “America First” outlook that is skeptical of foreign entanglements.

Vance, who served in the Marine Corps during the U.S. invasion of Iraq, has been critical of past U.S. democracy-building efforts in that country. Last year, he told a group of military academy graduates that the U.S. under Trump would avoid “open-ended conflicts” of the past.

Vance's office did not respond to repeated queries on Saturday about his location.

'The Senate Democratic leader said, “The idea that Trump plans to now run Venezuela should strike fear in the hearts of all Americans.”

Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the Trump administration had assured him multiple times it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela.

“Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,” he said.

The State Department did not immediately respond to questions about how the U.S, would run Venezuela, what authority it would use to administer it or whether it would involve any American personnel — either civilian or military — on the ground in Caracas or other areas of Venezuela.

Trump ended his news conference on Maduro's capture after about an hour of statements and an extended question-and-answer session.

The president vowed to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure and said the U.S. plans to sell it to other countries.

“We're in the oil business. We're going to sell it to them,” Trump said during the news conference. The oil companies will pay for the rebuilding of Venezuela's oil infrastructure, Trump said.

When asked what would happen if the U.S. ends up administering Venezuela for years, Trump suggested that the U.S. would use revenues from oil sales to pay for running the country, saying, “The money coming out of the ground is very substantial.”

“We're going to get reimbursed for everything that we spend,” he said.

Trump said that the U.S. will be running Venezuela with a “group” and did not rule out the possibility of U.S. troops.

“We're not afraid of boots on the ground,” Trump said at a news conference detailing the operation of Maduro's capture. He added: “We're going to make sure the country is run properly.”

He added the U.S. would fix the oil infrastructure in Venezuela, adding that “we're going to get the oil flowing.”

In a letter sent to the U.N. Security Council on Saturday, the Venezuelan ambassador to the U.N. warned that in light of the U.S. strikes, the country “reserves the inherent right to self defense.” 

The letter by Ambassador Samuel Reinaldo Moncada Acosta, obtained by AP, goes on to request an urgent meeting of the 15-member council and condemnation and cessation of U.S. actions.

“What began more than four months ago as a police fantasy is now showing its true face: This is a colonial war aimed at destroying our republican form of government, freely chosen by our people, and at imposing a puppet government that allows the plundering of our natural resources, including the world's largest oil reserves,” Acosta wrote.

Gen. Dan Caine, the president's top military advisor, said that more than 150 aircraft from 20 different bases were involved in the surprise, overnight attack on Venezuela that captured President Nicolas Maduro.

Caine said the aircraft included F-22, F-35, and F-18 fighter jets as well as B1 bombers and other support aircraft “as well as numerous remotely piloted drones.”

Caine said that the mission of the aircraft was to provide cover for the helicopters that acted as the “extraction force” with the goal of capturing Maduro and his wife.

“There were multiple self-defense engagements as the force began to withdraw out of Venezuela,” Caine said. He also said that the military chose “the right day to minimize the potential for civilian harm and maximize the element of surprise.”

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the helicopters took fire as they closed in on Maduro's compound.

One of the helicopters was struck by fire but remained flyable, John Caine said. He added that all of the aircraft came home.

Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, detailed a “meticulously planned” operation that he said had been months in the making, crafted to minimize harm both to Maduro and his wife, as well as civilians. Through the holiday weeks of Christmas and New Year's, Caine said service members watched and “sat ready” for the order, which the general said could come only once weather conditions improved Friday night.

“Last night the weather broke just enough, clearing a path that only the most skilled aviators in the world could move through,” Caine said, noting that helicopters flew low to the water to enter Venezuela, covered above by protective U.S. aircraft.

No airline flights were crossing over Venezuela Saturday, according to FlightRadar24.com. And major airlines canceled hundreds of flights across the eastern Caribbean after the FAA imposed restrictions and warned passengers that the disruptions could continue for days.

Flights to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Aruba and other destinations in the region near Venezuela were cancelled. The airlines are waiving change fees for passengers who have to reschedule their flights this weekend.

The defense secretary likened the attack on Venezuela to the U.S. strikes on Iran last summer over that country's nuclear program, saying that, “Maduro had his chance, just like Iran had their chance.”

He said adversaries of the U.S. should “remain on notice” that “America can project our will anywhere, anytime.”

“Welcome to 2026, and under President Trump, America is back,” he said.

Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that boats have been carrying drugs into the U.S. from Venezuela. But in fact Venezuela is not a major source of drugs to the U.S. 

There is no evidence to suggest fentanyl comes from Venezuela. Rather, the vast majority of fentanyl that flows into the U.S. is transported in through Mexico, and often produced from precursor chemicals coming from Asia.

While a number of illegal armed groups are present in Venezuela, much of the cocaine flowing out from Venezuela is produced in Colombia and other Andean nations. The Caribbean is often used as a jumping-off point for drug traffickers to smuggle their product to European markets.

The president brought up the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, formulated by President James Monroe, which was used to justify U.S. military interventions in Latin America.

Trump added his name to it, calling it “The Don-Roe Doctrine” and said, “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again.”

Across the Venezuelan capital, there were no signs that the U.S. had taken over control of Venezuela's government or military forces. The Miraflores Palace and military bases remained guarded by Venezuela's armed forces.

The president said the operation carried out by U.S. forces was an “assault like people have not seen since World War II” and that no other nation “could achieve what America achieved yesterday.”

“This was one of the most stunning, effective and powerful displays of American military might and competence in American history,” Trump said.

ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — Missi Dowd-Figueroa brought life back to the fire-ravaged plot where her home once stood -- one sunflower at a time.

The registered nurse and mother of three lost her 1898 farm-style house in the Eaton Fire, one of two deadly wildfires that tore through the Los Angeles area last January, obliterating entire neighborhoods and displacing tens of thousands of people. 

A year later, many are still grappling with grief and sorrow. Few have been able to rebuild so far, and the rest face no shortage of challenges. 

“The Altadena I know and love is gone,” Dowd-Figueroa said, referring to the suburb devastated by the fire. “Everything burned down — my dentist, my pharmacy — all of it's gone. But there's still something about Altadena that feels like Altadena now, even though there are no homes.”

She's among those who decided to stay. Her process of healing started with tiny seeds that gave her hope and eventually turned her barren property into a flourishing garden.

Dowd-Figueroa and her family had lived in the four-bedroom, three-bath house for 10 years. It was the longest she'd ever lived in one place, and the sense of loss left her stricken by waves of sadness. 

For months, she would drive to the empty lot and cry. Her grief and shock deepened when she realized that, in addition to her late grandmother's artwork that was in her home, her father's ashes were gone forever.




“I spent several days digging through the ashes just looking for his little urn, and I never found it,” said Dowd-Figueroa, 44.

Gone, too, were every family photo except those saved on her iPad. 

“That was like a second grief, too. I was like, ‘Well, great.' Now, if my dad knew, he'd be so disappointed because he was such a family lineage type of person,” she said. “I have nothing from my father. You know, I'll never touch anything that he touched ever again.”

Then one day, after cleanup crews had removed the last of the debris from the 2,000-square-foot lot, she brought along some flower seeds. They were mostly sunflowers, but also included zinnias and cosmos, among others, and planted them in the soil.

“I was already going there every day crying, so I was like, ‘Why am I just sitting here?' I might as well do something that keeps me busy, and I enjoy, because the house I'm in now, I can't have a garden,” she said.

Sunflowers can take up cadmium and other heavy metals that can be left behind in the soil, though experts debate their effectiveness after a wildfire. Dowd-Figueroa hoped they would help remove toxins on her property once she ripped them out by the roots and tossed them after they died, being careful not to leave behind seeds.

For several months, while Dowd-Figueroa and her husband took steps toward eventually building a new home, the garden flourished, blanketing a large swath of the lot with a colorful display of approximately 500 flowers — bright orange and red ones, as well as yellow ones with giant heads.

“It was really healing just to come back and tend the space where I lived for the longest time in my life,” she said. 

Butterflies began to appear, along with a variety of insects and small animals.

“I felt like I was helping nature come back a little bit,” she said.

Construction began on Dowd-Figueroa's new home in late September, thanks in part to around $100,000 in donations via a fundraising site. By then, the sunflowers, most of which bloom once and then die, were nearly all gone.

That's OK. With construction proceeding and estimated to be completed as soon as mid-June, the slowly emerging shape of her new home is now lifting Dowd-Figueroa's spirits. 

“Prior to this, I was just so depressed, like literally sobbed every day,” she said. “It just feels like now there's a place that exists. It will happen. We can do this.”

MILWAUKEE (AP) — Star speedskater Jordan Stolz shockingly stumbled to the ice right after the start of the men's 1,000 meters at the U.S. Olympic trials for long track speedskating on Saturday but still finished with the third-fastest time and will head to the Milan Cortina Winter Games.

Stolz caught the toe of one of his skates on the slick surface, lost his footing and tripped after fewer than five strides at the Pettit National Ice Center, about 40 miles south of his hometown of Kewaskum. It was the sort of thing that simply doesn't happen to the best in the world at what he does — someone expected to earn multiple medals and to be one of the faces of the Feb. 6-22 Olympics.

He quickly rose and continued to race, faring well enough to turn in the third-fastest time of 33 entrants.

“I just tried to get it all out, right? Go as hard as I could and see what would happen, where I would end up,” Stolz said.

He pointed to a recent cold that prevented him from his normal preparation.

“Just didn't have the right feeling,” the 21-year-old said. “Sitting around a lot. Been a little cramped up, dehydrated, so that was more so the issue today.”

He's not just considered a medal contender for at least three events, including the 1,000, in Milan — he might just be the favorite for gold.

In addition to owning the 1,000 world record, Stolz is a two-time world champion at each of the 500, 1,000 and 1,500.




Because of past results, Stolz was pre-qualified for those three Olympic races and only needed to take part Saturday to officially lock in a roster spot. Despite the misstep, he did end up with a time good enough to be among the trio of automatic qualifiers in the 1,000, joining Conor McDermott-Mostowy and Cooper McLeod. 

McDermott-Mostowy clocked 1 minute, 7.606 seconds, with McLeod 0.24 behind and Stolz 0.36 off the pace.

“He handled it very impressively,” McLeod said about Stolz's recovery. “He handled it like the many-time world champion that he is.”

Earlier Saturday, Erin Jackson qualified in the women's 1,000 by finishing faster than her good friend, world record-holder Brittany Bowe.

At the trials four years ago, Jackson slipped in the 500 and failed to earn a spot in that event. But Bowe, who did qualify in the 500, gave up her spot to Jackson, who then went to Beijing and became the first Black woman to win an individual gold medal at a Winter Olympics.

Bowe had the fastest time Saturday heading into the final two-woman heat, when Jackson completed the 1,000 in 1:14.63. That was 0.39 faster than Bowe. They both grew up in Ocala, Florida, and started in inline skating before switching to the ice.

Saturday's performance by Jackson was all the more impressive because she tore her left hamstring just before the start of a World Cup meet in December.

“Going into the beginning of this week, I wasn't really sure if I was going to be able to race or not,” Jackson said. “But over the last few days, it started feeling really nice. It got better at just the right time.”

Bowe gets the second U.S. berth in the women's 1,000. She turns 38 next month and will be heading to her fourth — and last — Olympics.

Bowe earned a bronze medal in the 1,000 at Beijing and a bronze in team pursuit at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.

“To be able to be 1 and 2 with (Jackson) is great,” Bowe said, “and to be able to go back to the Olympics with her, and for her to have another shot to do something incredible, is going to be fun.”

Influencer and Camp Social founder Liv Schreiber joins ‘America Reports' to discuss the growing trend of Gen Z embracing a return to older technologies.

What if your New Year's resolution could fit inside a tote bag? Social media users are trying the ""analog bag"" trend, replacing phones with offline activities.

The trend is widely credited to TikTok creator Sierra Campbell, who posted about her own analog bag — containing a crossword book, portable watercolor set, Polaroid camera, planner and knitting supplies — and encouraged followers to make their own. 

Her video prompted many others to share their own versions, with items like magazines, decks of cards, paints, needlepoint and puzzle books.

CREATIVE HOBBIES KEEP THE BRAIN YOUNG, STUDY FINDS — HERE ARE THE BEST ONES TO PURSUE

""I made a bag of non-digital activities to occupy my hands instead of the phone,"" said Campbell, adding that the practice has significantly cut her screen time and filled her life with ""creative and communal pursuits that don't include doom-scrolling.""

""I created the analog bag after learning the only way to change a habit is to replace it with another,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Research on habit formation supports the idea of the analog bag, according to Dr. Daniel Amen, a California-based psychiatrist and founder of Amen Clinics. 

""Your brain is a creature of habit,"" Amen said during an interview with Fox News Digital. ""Neurons that fire together wire together, meaning that every time you repeat a behavior, whether it's good or bad, you strengthen the neural pathways that make it easier to do it again.""

Studies show that habits are automatic responses to specific cues — such as boredom, stress or idle time — that typically deliver some kind of reward, according to the doctor. When no alternative behavior is available, people tend to fall back on the same routine, often without realizing it.

Research suggests that replacing an old habit with a new one tied to the same cue is more effective than trying to suppress the behavior altogether.

""[When] cutting out coffee — you need to have another drink to grab for, not just quit cold turkey. It's how the pathways in our brains work,"" Campbell said.

By substituting a different routine that still provides stimulation and engagement, people can gradually weaken the original habit and build a new automatic response.

""Simply stopping a behavior is very challenging,"" Amen said. ""Replacing one habit with something that is better for your brain is much easier. That's how lasting change happens, one step at a time.""

If alternatives are within arm's reach, people will be more likely to use them, the doctor said. ""Your brain does much better with small, simple actions than big, vague intentions.""

Instead of saying, ""I'll stop scrolling today,"" the doctor recommends choosing a small habit you can do in a few moments in specific situations, like knitting 10 rows of a scarf on your commute or reading a few pages of a book while waiting at the doctor's office.

Campbell shared her own examples of how to use an analog bag. At a coffee shop with friends, she said, she might pull out a crossword puzzle and ask others to help with answers when the conversation lulls.

Instead of taking dozens of photos on her phone, she uses an instant camera, which limits shots and encourages more intentional moments.

In casual outdoor settings, such as a park or winery, she brings a small watercolor set for a quick creative outlet.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) discusses the success of President Trump's operation in Venezuela and voices his support on ‘Fox Report.'

It can fairly be said that the most precarious jobs in the world are those of a golf ball collector at a driving range, a mascot at a Chuck E. Cheese and a Trump administration lawyer.

That was evident at the press conference yesterday as President Donald Trump blew apart the carefully constructed narrative presented earlier for the seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Some of us had written that Trump had a winning legal argument by focusing on the operation as the seizure of two indicted individuals in reliance on past judicial rulings, including the decisions in the case of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stayed on script and reinforced this narrative. Both repeatedly noted that this was an operation intended to bring two individuals to justice and that law enforcement personnel were part of the extraction team to place them in legal custody. Rubio was, again, particularly effective in emphasizing that Maduro was not the head of state but a criminal dictator who took control after losing democratic elections.

However, while noting the purpose of the capture, Trump proceeded to declare that the United States would engage in nation-building to achieve lasting regime change. He stated that they would be running Venezuela to ensure a friendly government and the repayment of seized U.S. property dating back to the government of Maduro's mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chávez.

This city is full of self-proclaimed Trump whisperers who rarely score above random selection in their predictions. However, there are certain pronounced elements in Trump's approach to such matters. First, he is the most transparent president in my lifetime, with prolonged (at times excruciatingly long) press conferences and a brutal frankness about his motivations. Second, he is unabashedly and undeniably transactional in most of his dealings. He is not ashamed to state what he wants the country to get out of the deal.

In Venezuela, he wants a stable partner, and he wants oil.

Chávez and Maduro had implemented moronic socialist policies that reduced one of the most prosperous nations to an economic basket case. They brought in Cuban security thugs to help keep the population under repressive conditions, as a third fled to the United States and other countries.

SECOND FRONT: HOW A SOCIALIST CELL IN THE US MOBILIZED PRO-MADURO FOOT SOLDIERS WITHIN 12 HOURS

After an extraordinary operation to capture Maduro, Trump was faced with socialist Maduro allies on every level of the government. He is not willing to allow those same regressive elements to reassert themselves.

The problem is that, if the purpose was regime change, this attack was an act of war, which is why Rubio struggled to bring the presser back to the law enforcement purpose. I have long criticized the erosion of the war declaration powers of Congress, including my representation of members of Congress in opposition to Obama's Libyan war effort.

The fact, however, is that we lost that case. Trump knows that. Courts have routinely dismissed challenges to undeclared military offensives against other nations. In fairness to Trump, most Democrats were as quiet as church mice when Obama and Hillary Clinton attacked Libya's capital and military sites to achieve regime change without any authorization from Congress. They were also silent when Obama vaporized an American under this ""kill list"" policy without even a criminal charge. So please spare me the outrage now.

JONATHAN TURLEY: WHY CAPTURE OF MADURO DIDN'T REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM CONGRESS

My strong preferences for congressional authorization and consultation are immaterial. The question I am asked as a legal analyst is whether this operation would be viewed as lawful. The answer remains yes.

The courts have previously upheld the authority of presidents to seize individuals abroad, including the purported heads of state. This case is actually stronger in many respects than the one involving Noriega. Maduro will now make the same failed arguments that Noriega raised. He should lose those challenges under existing precedent. If courts apply the same standards to Trump (which is often an uncertain proposition), Trump will win on the right to seize Maduro and bring him to justice.

But then, how about the other rationales rattled off at Mar-a-Lago? In my view, it will not matter. Here is why:

SEE PICS: VENEZUELANS WORLDWIDE CELEBRATE AS EXILES REACT TO MADURO'S CAPTURE

The immediate purpose and result of the operation was to capture Maduro and to bring him to face his indictment in New York. That is Noriega 2.0. The administration put him into custody at the time of extraction with law enforcement personnel and handed him over to the Justice Department for prosecution.

The Trump administration can then argue that it had to deal with the aftermath of that operation and would not simply leave the country without a leader or stable government. Trump emphasized, ""We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.""

I still do not like the import of those statements. Venezuelans must be in charge of their own country and our role, if any, must be to help them establish a democratic and stable government. Trump added, ""We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind.""

The devil is in the details. Venezuelans must decide who has their best interests in mind, not the United States.

However, returning to the legal elements, I do not see how a court could free Maduro simply because it disapproves of nation-building. Presidents have engaged in such policies for years. The aftermath of the operation is distinct from its immediate purpose. Trump can argue that, absent countervailing action from Congress, he has the authority under Article II of the Constitution to lay the foundation for a constitutional and economic revival in Venezuela.

He will leave it to his lawyers to make that case. It is not the case that some of us preferred, but it is the case that he wants to be made. He is not someone who can be scripted. It is his script and he is still likely to prevail in holding Maduro and his wife for trial.

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says that the Trump administration's capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro projects strength abroad on ‘The Big Weekend Show.' 

With Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro extracted from Caracas on Jan. 3, Venezuelans and the world are anxious to learn about the future that awaits.

In a press conference following the Maduro operation on Saturday, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. is ""going to run the country"" until a transition can be safely made.

Isaias Medina, an international lawyer and former senior Venezuelan diplomat, said a peaceful transition is vital for the 9 million to 10 million Venezuelans who are forcibly displaced and living in exile. Medina, who resigned his diplomatic post in protest against Maduro's rule in 2017, told Fox News Digital that exiled Venezuelans ""have been preparing ourselves to go back to rebuild our nation.""

With support from international organizations like the Organization of American States, Medina said the most important next step for Venezuela is to establish a transitional government that can restore the rule of law and rebuild institutions that have been decimated under the Maduro regime. Setting in place free and fair elections is particularly important, Medina said, noting that it's ""a legal obligation owed to [Venezuela's] people, because on their occupied territory, it was never equitable or really free.""

Under Maduro, Medina said that ""there was no separation of powers, there was no rule of law, there was not even sovereignty."" Instead, Medina said Venezuela had an occupied territory extensively influenced by terrorist and trafficking organizations Hamas, Hezbollah, the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). He said these groups were exploiting Venezuelan resources.

David Daoud, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that so long as Venezuela poses no threat to U.S. national security, the ""ideal situation"" for Venezuela ""would be American guidance for determined local action.""

""The best we can shepherd Venezuela to be is a productive member of the family of nations, and that's something that we can help with a softer touch, without boots on the ground,"" Daoud said. ""I don't think we need to be in the business of trying to create Jeffersonian democracies anywhere.""

Following Maduro's ouster, Daoud said the level of chaos allowed to exist inside Venezuela will determine whether terror groups like Hezbollah and Hamas will be able to continue operating there. ""It would really depend — does the day after in Venezuela create a stable state that is able to properly exercise control over all its territory, is interested in implementing the rule of law, is not corrupt. That would make things very, very complicated, if not impossible, for Hezbollah to operate, at least in the way it has been operating for a decade-plus, ever since the linkage between it and the original Chávez regime came about.""

Going forward, Medina suggested that the country will also have to manage guerrilla forces like the colectivos, violent groups of Venezuelans who were armed and trained with old U.S. and Russian military weapons. Medina said having these guerrillas ""return the weapons for freedom"" could help to ""unite the nation under one banner of development and evolution… so that we can have a country that really meets the expectations, not only of the riches that it has, but of the people and the development of their education and training and jobs, because it has been completely destroyed by design.""

Though the road ahead is uncertain, Medina is filled with hope. ""What we have ahead of us is a great journey to be able to build upon the ruins of what this regime left us. But I think we're going to become stronger, and this is the moment. The time has come,"" Medina said.

Former U.S. Army Capt. Doug Truax and former U.S. Navy Capt. Brent Sadler join 'Fox News Live' to discuss strike on Venezuela and the capture of Nicolas Maduro, breaking down details of the raid on Maduro's compound and more. 

Women's tennis legend Martina Navratilova took to social media on Saturday to share her thoughts on the U.S. intervention in Venezuela, supporting the idea of criminal sanctions on American companies that try to take oil from the country. 

Navratilova praised a post on X suggesting the sanctions, writing ""love it"" in response to journalist Lauren Windsor's post that read, ""Any American oil company that expropriates oil from Venezuela should be sanctioned by the International Criminal Court.""

Navratilova later shared further thoughts about the operation that resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, with President Donald Trump saying that the U.S. will ""run"" Venezuela until a transition of power is complete.

""Holding a country hostage while pillaging its natural resources. Next stop- either Greenland or Nigeria,"" Navratilova wrote in response to a thread that included a report about Wall Street firm officials in the finance, energy and defense sectors visiting Venezuela after the recent strikes. 

Roughly twice the size of California, Venezuela holds the world's largest proven oil reserves. At an estimated 300 billion barrels, about 20% of the global total and nearly four times U.S. reserves, that endowment dwarfs that of any other nation.

Venezuela's stockpile, now larger than those of energy titans like Saudi Arabia, has become a central flashpoint in the geopolitical struggle surrounding the country's future.

‘WE BUILT VENEZUELA'S OIL INDUSTRY:' TRUMP VOWS US ENERGY RETURN AFTER MADURO CAPTURE

Venezuela's reserves are dominated by heavy and extra-heavy crude that requires specialized equipment, constant maintenance and advanced refining capacity, much of which has deteriorated after years of underinvestment and skilled labor losses.

During his address on Saturday, Trump accused Venezuela's socialist government of seizing American energy assets and dismantling an industry built with U.S. investment.

""Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,"" Trump said. ""They took all of our property.""

""We built Venezuela's oil industry with American talent, drive and skill, and the socialist regime stole it from us,"" he added.

Trump added that U.S. energy companies would play a key role in rebuilding the Latin American country's oil sector.

""We are going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,"" he said.

A new memorial honoring unborn children, set to be unveiled on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade's end, is sparking debate among Tennesseans, WTVF in Nashville reported last week.

Approved by state lawmakers more than seven years ago, the first phase of a granite memorial honoring unborn children appears to be underway and is slated for installation on the grounds of the Tennessee Capitol on June 24.

""We just want to honor the fact they were created in the image of God, they were human beings, and we need to show some reverence for humans and our fellow man,"" state Sen. Janice Bowling, a Republican who helped front the effort, said, per WTVF.

The privately funded memorial is expected to resemble a cemetery marker and will feature language reflecting grief and sorrow, the outlet reported.

Bowling said the memorial will be larger than a typical cemetery marker and described the space as one meant for ""reflection, for remembrance, for closure for some people.""

Democratic opposition has remained strong since the proposal was first introduced, however, with Nashville Rep. John Ray Clemmons accusing the memorial of ""stigmatizing"" women who were forced to make ""the most difficult decision of their life"" or those who ""didn't have a decision,"" according to WTVF. 

Critics have also questioned whether placing the memorial on Capitol grounds amounts to the state endorsing a specific viewpoint on abortion, arguing it could further deepen divisions in the ongoing debate over reproductive rights.

""This is a very divisive issue, and just for that reason alone, it should not be something we're memorializing up at the Capitol,"" Rep. Heidi Campbell, D-Nashville, said, per WTVF.

""I know the intent is to reflect compassion, but really it reflects control because it's really about erasing women's agency, reducing complex medical realities to political symbolism,"" she added.

Bowling dismissed the rhetoric, defending the memorial by pointing to its support from both chambers of the legislature.

The project faced years of delay because state law requires private funding, with movement resuming only after a $4,000 private donation was made and approved by the State Building Commission last August.

Bowling said fundraising efforts for the project will resume, with additional proceeds going toward flowers to be placed at the marker, WTVF reported.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Tennessee secretary of state's communications team for comment.

War Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed on Saturday night that President Donald Trump will determine the future for Venezuela after he authorized strikes on the South American country and captured its now-former president, Nicolas Maduro.

Hegseth was asked by CBS News's Tony Dokoupil to elaborate on Trump's statement after the strikes that the United States would temporarily “run” Venezuela as it transitions to new leadership. While not disclosing what such intervention would look like, Hegseth did suggest the U.S. will have a heavy hand in the process.

“It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And ultimately he'll decide what the iterations are of that,” Hegseth said. “Ultimately we're gonna control what happens next because of this brave decision. President Trump has shown American leadership and he'll be able to dictate where we go next.”

The war secretary said next steps will see the Trump administration's crackdown on drug trafficking and illegal immigration in Venezuela continue, as well as guaranteeing the return of “stolen” oil to the U.S. The blockade Trump imposed on oil tankers going in and out of the country will also remain in effect, Hegseth added.

Hegseth's comments echo Trump's own at a press conference about the strikes on Saturday morning.

Then, Trump told reporters the U.S. would effectively control Venezuela “until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.”

He also said he will bring in American energy companies to take over Venezuela's oil industry, which officials have suggested is running at too low of a capacity for an oil-rich nation.

“We're going to have our very large U.S. oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,” Trump said.

Trump authorized the strikes late Friday night on at least seven locations in Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela.

First, there was fraud in the Department of Agriculture's Federal Child Nutrition Program. Then it was fraud in Medicaid's “nonstandard benefits” programs. Now, there is fraud in the Department of Health and Human Services's Child Care and Development Block Grant program. The common element running through all these scandals is Minnesota's Somali community. This is a story not just about fraud, but about how the United States has failed to think seriously about cultural compatibility in immigration policy, and how the costs of that failure are borne by taxpayers and by the rule of law.

Minnesota's Somali population is almost entirely a post-1990 phenomenon. Refugee resettlement following Somalia's clan wars brought more than 10,000 Somalis to the state in the 1990s, with the population tripling by 2010 and surpassing 75,000 by 2024. Nationally, more than 110,000 Somali refugees were admitted between 2000 and 2024 alone. Nearly all (99.7%) are Muslim.

This population did not scatter randomly across the country. Somali migrants disproportionately settled in states offering the most generous public benefits: expansive Medicaid eligibility, large child care subsidies, extensive language services in schools, and dense networks of refugee-focused nonprofit organizations. Minnesota became the epicenter, but similar targeting occurred elsewhere. That was not an accident; it was rational behavior in response to incentives.

What followed has been a sustained failure of assimilation, and, increasingly, an explosion of fraud.

The data are stark. More than half (52%) of children in Somali immigrant homes in Minnesota live in poverty, compared with just 8% of children in native-headed households. Roughly 39% of working-age Somalis lack a high school diploma, versus 5% of natives. Among working-age adult Somalis who have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade, about half still cannot speak English “very well.”

Welfare dependence mirrors these gaps. About 54% of Somali-headed households in Minnesota receive food stamps, and 73% include at least one person on Medicaid. For native households, the comparable figures are 7% and 18%. Nearly 9 in 10 Somali households with children receive some form of welfare.

Against that backdrop, the repeated revelations of nutrition program fraud, Medicaid abuse, and now child care payment scandals are not shocking. They are predictable.

Many cultural patterns from Somalia, particularly clan-based social organization, informal economies, and deep distrust of state institutions, travel with the diaspora. In Somalia, these norms evolved as survival mechanisms in a stateless society. Transplanted into a high-trust welfare state with weak enforcement and poorly designed incentives, they become something else entirely. Fraud networks are not aberrations; they are the extension of familiar institutional behavior into a permissive environment.

This is not a matter of temporary adjustment. Economist Garrett Jones has documented how cultural traits persist long after migration. Even generations later, immigrant communities retain distinct attitudes toward savings, regulation, and trust, patterns visible among descendants of Italian and Swedish migrants alike. Assimilation happens, but it is partial, uneven, and slow.

At the national level, the same pattern holds. If you want to know how prosperous a country is today, Jones argued, you should look at what the ancestors of its population were doing in 1500, before conquest and colonization reshuffled borders. Culture persists, even after migration.

Crucially, this is not about race. Black immigrant groups from high-trust, English-speaking societies often thrive in the U.S. Jamaican immigrants, for example, exhibit extremely high English proficiency, only about 1% are limited-English speakers, and a higher share hold bachelor's degrees than the U.S. average. Culture matters, and it varies enormously across countries regardless of race.

That reality helps explain why Robert Macdonald, the former mayor of Lewiston, Maine, was right when he told Somali migrants to “accept our culture and leave your culture at the door.” Macdonald was pilloried for the remark, but his core insight was correct. A society cannot function if newcomers reject its norms while demanding its benefits. The furious pushback from Somali activists only underscored the problem: they did not want assimilation; they wanted accommodation.

Immigration policy is selection. For too long, the U.S. pretended otherwise. It admitted large numbers of migrants from failed states defined by clan loyalty, low trust, and hostility to formal institutions, then acted surprised when those traits reappeared here.

TRUMP'S TOTAL CONTROL OF THE BORDER IS THE SUCCESS STORY OF 2025

Credit is due, then, to President Donald Trump for recognizing the problem. Terminating temporary protected status for Somali nationals, instituting travel restrictions on Somali citizens, halting most visa and refugee entries, and pausing asylum applications are not acts of cruelty. They are acts of realism.

A nation has the right, and the obligation, to choose migrants whose cultures are compatible with its values. America ignored that truth for decades, and Minnesota's experience shows what happens when it does.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A contingent of black leaders in New York has warned that socialist policies pushed by Mayor Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Socialists of America's star candidate of 2025, would disproportionately harm black communities.

Mounting debate over the DSA's influence in municipal government comes as Mamdani is about to take over the largest city in the country as chief executive. His rise has drawn scrutiny from more centrist figures on the political Left who fear that the DSA's revolutionary-left agenda could inadvertently harm vulnerable black residents, a demographic that the DSA claims to champion in the name of racial justice.

Chantel Wright, a bishop and local faith leader, said in an interview with the Washington Examiner, “There is no clear black agenda for the people who voted for him. It's really not clearly defined what his position is as it pertains to black people.”

“I am just hoping that there will be greater clarity as to all of those who jumped on the Mamdani bandwagon,” Wright said. “What is he really planning to do for our community, making sure that we are looked after and taken care of?”

Wright mentioned the Mamdani transition team's lack of outreach to the black community, despite leaders within the community reaching out several times for a seat at the table.

Urging the inclusion of all constituents in the policymaking process, Wright said, “New York is very, very intricate. It's a mosaic. And when you think that you can leave one of the tiles out, you're sophomoric in your thinking.”

In a recent New York Daily News opinion piece, dated Dec. 4, 2025, National Black Empowerment Action Fund President Darius Jones raised concerns about whether the new mayor would implement the agenda items of the DSA, whose policy vision he said has “consistently clashed with the needs and dismissed the interests of the very Black and Brown communities that are most affected by the outcomes of City Hall.”

“For years the DSA has promoted ideas that sound righteous in theory but unravel when applied to the communities that bear the brunt of policy failures,” Jones said, asserting that socialists “borrow the language of justice and liberation from our history while pushing proposals that rarely account for our safety, our schools, our daily lives, or our economic reality.”

His strongly worded article took aim, in particular, at the DSA's positions on public safety.

Mamdani has publicly distanced himself from the DSA's calls to abolish the police, but, in the past, he said on Twitter that the city's police department should be “defunded” and “dismantled” altogether. While running for mayor, Mamdani reportedly walked back anti-police posts he had made during the 2020 racial justice uprisings.

“Madness,” Wright said of abolishing the police. “Over our dead bodies.”

Wright, a Harlem resident, noted how she and other community advocates have worked to build relationships with the New York Police Department. “Who's going to suffer the most?” she wondered. “So if you abolish it altogether, communities that already have high crime rates are going to be warfare zones.”

Jones said that DSA policies, such as eliminating the NYPD's gang database, decriminalizing prostitution, and legalizing dangerous drugs, would just increase crime, drug abuse, and sex trafficking in poor neighborhoods.

As for the city's gang database, which opponents consider “discriminatory” against certain racial groups, Jones said, “Many parents and neighborhood leaders see it as a tool that can prevent violence before it reaches their block. Reforms may be necessary, but dismantling it outright would be reckless.”

Other black religious leaders in New York have also voiced opposition against the DSA's policy priorities.

“The DSA wants to defund the police and decriminalize hard drugs,” Pastor Zidde Hamatheite of the Wayside Baptist Church in Brooklyn previously told the New York Post. “That's not progress, that's surrender. And it's wrong for black communities in New York.”

In the same article, Rev. James Kilgore of the Friendship Baptist Church in Harlem criticized the DSA for opposing school choice: “The DSA wants to defund some of the only high-quality public schools we have access to and evict more than 130,000 black and brown children from those few high-quality public schools. How is that even remotely progressive?”

On the campaign trail, Mamdani promised that, if elected, he would oppose the expansion of charter schools, which are publicly funded and largely educate minority, low-income students from working-class households. Charter schools operate independently from traditional school districts, often offering higher-level curriculum compared to their public school counterparts. Studies show that disadvantaged students in urban areas tend to perform better at these types of educational alternatives.

“I oppose efforts by the state to mandate an expansion of charter school operations in New York City,” Mamdani said in a candidate survey ahead of the Democratic primaries in June 2025. In the Staten Island Advance questionnaire, Mamdani declared that he even opposes charter schools sharing space on city-owned property and further vowed to audit ones that are co-located in city Department of Education buildings, suggesting that they receive too much public funding.

“For those already co-located,” Mandani pledged, “my administration would undertake a comprehensive review of charter school funding to address the unevenness of our system.”

Many black leaders told the media that they were offended by Mamdani claiming to be “African American” when he had applied to attend Columbia University. Mamdani, who is of Indian ancestry but was born in Uganda, checked off both the “Black or African American” and “Asian” boxes regarding his race on his 2009 college application.

Critics said Mamdani co-opted a black identity to further his professional career, suspecting that he tried to pass himself off as African American to gain an advantage in the admissions process, courtesy of Columbia's race-conscious affirmative action policies.

“The African American identity is not a checkbox of convenience,” then-New York Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement after the information from Mamdani's application was leaked in July 2025. “It's a history, a struggle, and a lived experience. For someone to exploit that for personal gain is deeply offensive.”

“You don't get to be black when it's convenient for you,” Wright said of Mamdani. You don't understand the burden we bear. How dare you use that to your advantage for some sort of privilege?”

Wright said that Mamdani has never directly apologized to the black community for misrepresenting himself.

“Who do you think you are, thinking that you could do that and then turn around and then act like we don't exist? Shame on you,” said Wright, a staunch supporter of Adams, who had entered the general election as an independent but withdrew and endorsed former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

In October 2025, Cuomo's campaign posted a video that contained interviews with black New Yorkers about their thoughts on the Mamdani admissions scandal.

“You're a Ugandan Indian. OK? You're not black!” one black New Yorker answered, saying that Mamdani was trying to use “the black card” to get in.

“Why would you make yourself seem like something you're not?” another asked, suggesting that Mamdani “impersonated” a black person.

Mamdani told the New York Times, which had first reported on his college application based on hacked documents shared with the newspaper, that he does not consider himself either black or African American, rather “an American who was born in Africa.” He said that the application did not have a category that fully represented the complexity of his ethnic origins, so he marked multiple boxes, working within the limited options available to him.

“Most college applications don't have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background,” Mamdani said. A section of the application allowed students to add “more specific information where relevant,” and Mamdani said that he wrote “Ugandan.”

“Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was,” Mamdani said.

Mamdani was eventually not accepted at Columbia and ended up attending Bowdoin College, where he majored in Africana studies.

Months before the application bombshell, Mamdani said that it would be “misleading” for him to self-identify as African American. A resurfaced social media clip captured him making the acknowledgment on camera as he was questioned about his heritage. 

“I'm an Indian, Ugandan, New Yorker,” Mamdani told black performance artist Crackhead Barney when she approached him on the street in April 2025. Asked if he would ever claim African American status, Mamdani insisted, “No, I would not. I'm proud to be Ugandan, but I think that is misleading.”

“We don't trust him,” Wright said following the revelations.

Wright also characterized Mamdani's promises of government-run grocery stores, rent freezes, and free rides on city buses as snake-oil salesman pitches.

“None of it makes any sense,” Wright, 60, told the Washington Examiner. “First of all, if you promise a free bus ride, who's going to pay for it? Because the buses still have to have gasoline or electricity. They still have to be maintained. Where's that money coming from?”

Mamdani's father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor of government at Columbia University, and his family reportedly lived close to campus in taxpayer-subsidized housing provided by the Ivy League college.

“It's all great and fanciful for people who don't have real connections to black people,” Jones said.

Jones, who was former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's deputy national political director during his 2020 presidential bid, has been a vocal critic among black voices speaking out against Mamdani and informing black New Yorkers about the DSA's hard-left platform.

Leading the charge in these awareness efforts is Jones's nonprofit organization, the National Black Empowerment Action Fund, a national black advocacy group operating in major metropolitan areas across America, including New York, that are known to be political, civic, and business hubs for black communities. Fighting for “common-sense” policies that empower black communities to thrive, the NBEAF is dedicated to the economic, educational, and social uplift of black America.

In the lead-up to the New York mayoral election, the NBEAF launched a $2 million ad campaign against Mamdani, warning voters that the DSA's agenda “threatens” decades of social and economic progress achieved by black Americans throughout U.S. history.

The anti-Mamdani ads, which were billed as “A Message From the Black Community,” accused the DSA of “insulting our intelligence” and “taking us for granted.”

“Instead of claiming to speak for us and acting like you know what's best for us, try listening to us!” one of the ads, directed at DSA, said.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

The president told The Atlantic that Delcy Rodríguez needs to comply with U.S. wishes—or else.

In a telephone interview this morning, President Donald Trump issued a not-so-veiled threat against the new Venezuelan leader, Delcy Rodríguez, saying that “if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” referring to Nicolás Maduro, now residing in a New York City jail cell. Trump made clear that he would not stand for what he described as Rodríguez's defiant rejection of the armed U.S. intervention that resulted in Maduro's capture.

During our call, Trump, who had just arrived at his golf club in West Palm Beach, was in evident good spirits, and reaffirmed to me that Venezuela may not be the last country subject to American intervention. “We do need Greenland, absolutely,” he said, describing the island—a part of Denmark, a NATO ally—as “surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.” And in discussing Venezuela's future, he signaled a clear shift away from his previous distaste for regime change and nation building, rejecting the concerns of many in his MAGA base. “You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse,” he said.

The severe tone he took with Rodríguez contrasted with the praise he had offered her yesterday, hours after U.S.-military forces attacked Caracas and captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, for criminal prosecution. Trump said in a news conference after the attack that Rodríguez had privately indicated a willingness to work with the United States, which Trump declared would temporarily “run” her country.

“She's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again,” he said yesterday.

Rodríguez rejected that suggestion moments later, declaring that the country is “ready to defend our natural resources” and that the nation's defense counsel remained prepared to carry out the policies of Maduro, whose return she demanded. “We shall never be a colony ever again,” she said. The prospect of Maduro's government continuing to resist the U.S. raised the risk of a protracted fight for control of Venezuela that would require increased U.S.-military involvement and even occupation. Trump yesterday signaled his willingness to order a second wave of military actions in Venezuela, should he deem it necessary.

“Rebuilding is not a bad thing in Venezuela's case,” he said. “The country's gone to hell. It's a failed country. It's a totally failed country. It's a country that's a disaster in every way.”

In a speech in December 2016, Trump declared as president-elect that the U.S. will “stop racing to topple foreign regimes that we know nothing about.” He had campaigned that year in opposition to “nation building,” arguing that the country needs to focus on rebuilding at home instead of in nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan.

When I asked this morning why nation building and regime change in Venezuela would be different from similar efforts he previously opposed in Iraq, Trump suggested posing the question to former President George W. Bush.

“I didn't do Iraq. That was Bush. You'll have to ask Bush that question, because we should have never gone into Iraq. That started the Middle East disaster,” Trump said.

Trump has said he believes that the United States needs to maintain control over the Western Hemisphere, invoking his own version of the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine, which rejected European colonialism in the hemisphere. He calls his approach the “Donroe Doctrine.” But in the interview, he said that the decision to kidnap the Venezuelan president was not made simply because of geography.

“It's not hemisphere. It's the country. It's individual countries,” he said in the phone call.

I asked him whether the attack on Venezuela could indicate a willingness to take military action to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, which has rejected American territorial claims. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that the world should take notice after the Venezuela operation. “​​When he tells you that he's going to do something, when he tells you he's going to address a problem, he means it,” Rubio said. Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. “needs” to control Greenland.

Trump said it was up to others to decide what U.S.-military action in Venezuela means for Greenland. “They are going to have to view it themselves. I really don't know. He was very generous to me, Marco, yesterday,” Trump said. “You know, I wasn't referring to Greenland at that time. But we do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.”

Crossing Delancey's charm, a reimagined Shakespearian classic, and more culture and entertainment recommendations

This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.

Welcome back to The Daily's Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer or editor reveals what's keeping them entertained. Today's special guest is Sara Krolewski, a deputy research chief who helps oversee fact-checking at The Atlantic and has worked on articles about a vanished kayaker, the second Trump administration (and the president's phone calls with Atlantic reporters), and Benjamin Franklin's relationship with his son.

Sara is excitedly awaiting the New York City premiere of Romeo & Juliet Suite in March. She also enjoys watching Crossing Delancey, refreshing her Depop feed, and revisiting Picasso's Le Moulin de la Galette.

— Stephanie Bai, associate editor

A good recommendation I recently received: My friend put the 1988 film Crossing Delancey on an end-of-year recommendation list, and it turned out to be the perfect nightcap for a dreary winter's day: a wry romantic comedy of errors that doubles as an ode to Manhattan's Lower East Side. Its love interest is a pickle salesman—utterly charming! [Related: The 10 best movies of 2025]

The upcoming arts event I'm most looking forward to: Benjamin Millepied's Romeo & Juliet Suite at the Park Avenue Armory in March. Millepied is best known outside of the dance world as the ex-husband of Natalie Portman; the two met when he worked on the choreography for her Oscar-winning turn in Black Swan. (He also has the most apposite name for a dancer: Millepied roughly translates to “thousand-footed” in French.) What tabloid dross tends to obscure is his impressive career—first as a star dancer at the New York City Ballet, then as a roving choreographer of complex, dynamic work that is rooted in balletic conventions but not restricted by them. Romeo & Juliet Suite riffs on the famous tragedy and promises to make use of the Armory's cavernous Drill Hall, like a show I saw last year in the same space: the German artist Anne Imhof's Doom: House of Hope. That, too, was partially based on Romeo and Juliet and featured a cast of elite dancers. Spectators were meant to wander the warehouse-like venue and mingle with the performers (think Sleep No More with pointe shoes).

Part of the appeal of restaging Romeo and Juliet lies in its familiarity. There's room to play (both Imhof and Millepied have excised characters and incorporated live video into their performances), but the core of the narrative—forbidden love—remains the same, providing a kind of structural integrity. And I'll never tire of Sergei Prokofiev's brilliant score, which accompanies Millepied's production. Prokofiev fiddled with the source material as well: His original ballet in 1935 had the two lovers reunite and live happily ever after. [Related: Hands off Shakespeare]

A favorite story I've read in The Atlantic: One of the perks of working in research is making sojourns to The Atlantic's archive, where many gems are hidden. For one: Agnes de Mille, an icon of American dance, was an Atlantic contributor in the mid-20th century, and her ardent tribute to the choreographer Martha Graham is among the great works of American dance writing. It's also a vivid profile of an irascible, legendary artist—one who “could not be bought or pushed or cajoled into toying with her principles,” and who “never slept for two nights” before a performance, apparently.

I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention my former journalism professor Kate Bolick's 2011 cover story, “All the Single Ladies.” It's a terrifically engaging read—playful yet interrogatory—that remains as relevant as ever in our age of “heteropessimism” and dating-app malaise.

Best novel I've recently read: I just finished Barbara Comyns's The Juniper Tree, a short but haunting novel loosely based on a lesser-known Brothers Grimm tale. Comyns is herself a lesser-known British writer whose eccentric work is reminiscent of Jean Rhys's novels about female anomie, albeit with a distinctly British sensibility. The Juniper Tree's protagonist carries on in the face of maternal abuse, a scandalous out-of-wedlock pregnancy, and a series of calamitous events that expose the dark underside of domesticity.

An actor I would watch in anything: The prolific British actor Peter Finch, whose range is unmatched. Most will recognize him as the crazed, prophetic newscaster Howard Beale in Network, but my favorite performance of his is in John Schlesinger's Sunday Bloody Sunday, in which he portrays a prim-and-proper doctor locked in a very bohemian love triangle. (He also makes a scene-stealing appearance in Schlesinger's sumptuous Far From the Madding Crowd.)

My favorite way of wasting time on my phone: Feeding my algorithm on Depop, an app that is sort of like a Room of Requirement for secondhand clothes. Although I've had little success in flogging my own wares, I've become a highly proficient purchaser.

A piece of journalism that recently changed my perspective on a topic: After two middle schoolers died while subway surfing in October, The New Yorker's Doreen St. Félix wrote about the oft-fatal trend among New York City teens. She draws on her own experiences growing up in the city to shed light on what might be driving the phenomenon, and how deterrence methods tend to rely on aggressive surveillance practices that may be more punitive than effective.

A painting that I cherish: I'm partial to Picasso's Le Moulin de la Galette (on view at the Guggenheim in New York City), which he painted around 1900. It bears the influence of Impressionism and is totally unlike any of his later, more famous work—but there is something surreal and captivating about the café patrons' blurred, masklike faces, hinting at the experimentalism to come in his career. Plus, these folks seem to be having a really fun night.

An author I will read anything by: Elizabeth Hardwick is perhaps the only writer who could tackle such disparate subjects as the Menendez brothers, Herman Melville, and the city of Boston—which she despised enough to excoriate in a savage takedown—and make every essay sing. Open her Collected Essays to any page, and you'll discover a sentence so authoritative and crystalline that reading it feels like a small religious experience. (Here's one I just found: “Power, the most insidious of the passions, is also the most cunning.”)

Here are three Sunday reads from The Atlantic:

The Week Ahead

Essay

Albert Einstein's Brilliant Politics

By Joshua Bennett

As Albert Einstein wrote elegantly about our experience of time and space, he also devoted his days to the process of social transformation: the question of how one world becomes another. He was concerned about not just the perils of progress—including modern science's role in the creation of apocalyptic weapons—but also the promise of a more just society. From his very first years in the United States, Einstein wrote powerfully in opposition to American segregation, drawing on his personal experience of Nazi persecution as well as his ties to the long-standing African American community in Princeton, New Jersey, where he lived. In 1946, deep in the Jim Crow era, he visited the nation's first degree-granting historically Black institution, Lincoln University, where he gave talks and accepted an honorary degree. Eighty years later, after searching through the archives of his correspondence that are housed in Princeton, I'm reflecting on the full scope of what we have inherited from him.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

The president's operation targeting Nicolás Maduro can advance U.S. interests—but it's unclear whether it actually will.

Nicolás Maduro and his wife awoke yesterday in a safe house on a heavily fortified military base in the center of Caracas. Courtesy of a brilliant, audacious U.S. military operation, the two ended their day in a New York City jail cell. The 1989 operation to apprehend the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega required 27,000 American troops and took weeks to carry out. Removing the Venezuelan president from power, and from the country, took just two hours and 20 minutes.

President Donald Trump characteristically described the operation as “big stuff,” and for once he was right. Maduro's fall can and should serve American interests and transform Venezuela for the better. Maduro was corrupt and repressive. He was implicated in drug and human trafficking, and he stole his nation's 2024 election. He was also an incompetent manager who ran an oil-rich economy into the ground. Nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country. The world should be better off after his departure.

Whether the world will be better off, however, depends on what happens next. Trump says that the United States will henceforth “run” Venezuela, with the details to be filled in later. One lesson of other regime-change operations is not to topple a government without a plan for what comes next. Yet what comes next in Venezuela seems as vague as the plan for running postwar Gaza under a Board of Peace.

The administration may well default to working with a compliant President Delcy Rodríguez and most of the existing government. Rodriguez, who was Maduro's vice president, would, however, need to cooperate with Washington. In her first public remarks after Maduro's capture, she demanded his release and denounced the United States. Even if that amounts to rhetorical fodder for the chavista base, governing Venezuela through existing structures will be no easy task. Without broader changes in personnel and policy, exchanging the country's president for its vice president would hardly amount to regime change.

For the opposition, this initially seemed like the long-awaited hour of liberation. With the tyrant gone, leaders including the Nobel Prize winner María Corina Machado called for the recognition of Edmundo González Urrutia, the winner of the 2024 election, as president. Trump seems unimpressed by both their courage and their domestic support. He dismissed Machado as lacking respect within the country and did not mention Urrutia by name in remarks he gave yesterday.

Nor did he mention democracy. The omission causes an immediate problem for the political legitimacy of the Venezuelan government, at least until a new election or a transition to real democracy takes place. Many would-be supporters of the U.S. operation hoped for freedom, not just a different approach on drugs and oil. Trump's priorities include the return of migrants, the cessation of drug flows, and a share of oil revenues. The restoration of democracy in Venezuela is not obviously among them.

Countries in the Western Hemisphere had mixed reactions to yesterday's drama. Most wanted Maduro gone, not least because they desire the Venezuelan refugees in their countries to return home. But in forcibly toppling an unfriendly leader, the United States changed the rules. Other leaders in Latin America now enter a new, nervous era. The president of Colombia should “watch his ass,” Trump said yesterday, and observed that “something's going to have to be done with Mexico.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio added that he'd now be concerned if he were in the Cuban government. The Pentagon has reportedly drawn up military plans for securing access to the Panama Canal. Even if the administration has no further military designs on the Western Hemisphere, a virtual sword of Damocles hangs over the head of truculent governments.

None can expect much help from elsewhere. Russia, Iran, and Cuba were unwilling or unable to save their friend in Caracas, just as Moscow, Pyongyang, and Beijing stood by when Israel and the U.S. attacked Iran last year. Autocratic friendship has its limits. So do expressions of concern and declarations of illegality by democratic countries. Most European governments spent yesterday pledging to actively monitor the situation.

Yet the greatest consequences will fall on Venezuela and the United States. For 25 years, every U.S. president has opposed nation building abroad and then gotten involved in it. Trump, with his commitment to run Venezuela, appears to be the latest to do so. Nation building, we know from experience, is a long-term endeavor, and one with a mixed record at best. Yesterday's operation was big stuff indeed. But the welcome fall of Maduro is not the end. It is not the beginning of the end. It is only the end of the beginning.

Breaking:The U.S. has attacked Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Read our full coverage.

I thought I was okay, until I started watching musicals with my daughter—and couldn't stop crying.

Of the two things that I can claim any great paternal accomplishment for, one is that my daughter, age 3, drinks a collard-and-dandelion-green smoothie almost every morning. The other is that she loves Gene Kelly. You see, we've reached the point where she's old enough for me to start showing her the things I love, which thrills me in the same way I get excited to tour my own city when someone comes to visit. “This guy sells the best carrots and strawberries at the farmers' market.” “This is the shrimp taco from Mariscos Jalisco.” “This is Singin' in the Rain.”

If anything was going to spark my daughter's fascination with Kelly, it had to be the greatest movie musical of all time. We began about 30 minutes into the film, with Donald O'Connor's rendition of “Make 'Em Laugh,” the slapstick number in which he runs up and crashes through walls—and soon she, like O'Connor, was thrusting her elbows and skating across the carpet on her knees (she calls the song “Dancing on My Knees”). She asked for it over and over until I insisted that we watch something else, and skipped ahead to the song the film is named for. This time, Kelly was the star, and my daughter was transfixed—the pronounced jaw, the twinkle in his eye. “Who is that?” she asked.

The next night, we started the movie from the beginning. It wasn't long before Kelly's character, Don Lockwood, became smitten with Debbie Reynolds's Kathy Selden, and then he was off, gliding around lampposts and stomping in puddles. But on this viewing, something changed in me. Watching Kelly through my daughter's eyes—his bliss in the soundstage downpour, his body a flexile stack of lean musculature and joyous masculinity—I felt a heavy swell in my core. It reminded me of being too drunk in my 20s, overreacting to something beautiful and becoming somehow enraptured and despondent all at once. A flood of adrenaline spread from my rapidly beating heart and exited as moisture from my eyes, and I realized that maybe I wasn't okay.

I might have forgotten that reaction as a mere aberration, but the next night my daughter asked, “Can we watch more Gene Kelly?” Although she also liked having Mary Poppins and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory on repeat, she had never asked to see “more Julie Andrews” or “more Gene Wilder.” In fact, I still don't think she has registered that Mary Poppins and Maria from The Sound of Music are the same person. But for her, Singin' in the Rain was not about Don Lockwood—it was about Kelly. We watched again, and it was as if a protective seal had been peeled off my chest cavity, like the lid from a can of Pringles. We watched Anchors Aweigh, and although my daughter was bored through most of it, she sprang to life when Kelly taught the cartoon Jerry Mouse how to sing and dance—and I felt as if I were floating and sinking simultaneously.

Another night, I put on Les Demoiselles de Rochefort, Jacques Demy's underappreciated masterpiece—a French New Wave homage to American musicals—and although my daughter admired the bright colors of The Girls in the Hats, as she called it, the rest was beyond her. So I tucked her into bed and kept watching alone. The movie thrust forward, and I felt my body nearly levitate when Kelly, now in his 50s, showed up, dancing through the streets, exuding athleticism and glee. But that levitation was quickly followed by a steep decline. And the emotions kept hitting.

Perhaps, I thought, this was simply paternal pride—my wonderful daughter, dancing along to Golden Age musicals!—opening a floodgate of emotion. Or maybe I was just becoming a cliché, another “man of a certain age” who gets suddenly teary at the sight of old, elegant things. But no, somehow, these sensations felt deeper, like something dormant awakened: Why the hell was Gene Kelly making me feel so much?

I had expected fatherhood to change me. I knew it would make me care about my family more than myself. But becoming a parent doesn't automatically remove ego or selfishness. Your baggage carries through even after your kids are born (my wife and I also have a 1-year-old son), even after you think you've grown up and gotten through the worst of it.

I had a tendency toward depression in my 20s and early 30s. But historically—and here I'm certain I'm not alone among men—I also tended to bottle it up, to put my head down and deny its existence. I was typically the last person to recognize that I wasn't doing well. Yet as I entered my 40s, I had become quite sure that I had sort of passively balanced out my emotions, that my condition had taken care of itself. As I watched Kelly gracefully leap up walls and swing from rooftops, however, I realized that balance and stability are related but not the same.

This whole time, I had figured that I'd reached an even keel by just getting through it: prepare breakfast, pack a lunch, take them to school, meet your deadlines, cook dinner, show up, show up, show up. But what you do and how you do it are very different things. Singing and dancing perfectly, but without joy, does not make you Gene Kelly. Or put another way: “Doing everything” but being in a crappy mood while you do it does not make you a good husband or dad. When I didn't complete a task perfectly, I would overreact and beat myself up. Sometimes I would get a little too mad—at my daughter, at myself—and beat myself up all over again. Kids pick up on energy, and my energy was awful. I sensed that I was standing with one foot shaking on a pinpoint, waiting for the tiniest burst of air from a single jeté to knock me sideways. Kelly, of all people, was the enthusiastic breeze who blew me over—a bellwether more than an instigator of my emotional state.

It was clear to my wife that something was wrong long before it was to me. One afternoon, I made a mistake while trying to help her with a project, costing her a couple of thousand dollars out of her own pocket. It wasn't an earth-shattering loss. But my error crushed me. I started hyperventilating, so I quickly hid in our bedroom—and then the tears came. When my wife eventually discovered me and held me, I collapsed.

Read: Dad culture has nothing to do with parenting

I spoke with my doctor about this episode during a routine physical. She had not seen Rochefort, but she did refer me to the Harvard Study of Adult Development, the famous, long-running analysis of human well-being, and to research describing some people's tendency to hit an emotional rock bottom in their 40s. Much of the research indicates that such declines can happen gradually, or even at different times, rather than coming on as the all-of-a-sudden shock of a stereotypical midlife crisis—which made me think that had I been more emotionally aware, I might have seen my own breakdown coming from a lot further off. Learning about the research was a comfort, in a way, but it didn't exactly cure me. Depression doesn't work that conveniently.

Many years ago, I read the actor and writer Stephen Fry discussing depression as being “similar to weather,” as something that comes and goes on its own. This taught me it was something that you have only so much control over and something that you can't explain by just looking at your circumstances or failures. I've since found that the most nefarious thing about depression is that it doesn't simply feed you lies about yourself to make you feel sad. It takes the things that you already feel and are afraid of—you're rotten inside; somehow, that rottenness will seep into your family—and supercharges them, so that they seem undeniably true. The Harvard study said of depression that it could “take people who started life as stars and leave them at the end of their lives as train wrecks.” The question I needed to answer, now that I was a father, was how to avoid the wreck.

As I worked through my Kelly-tumbled feelings, I thought back to that famous number in Anchors Aweigh, when he dances with the cartoon mouse. People can watch the clip on YouTube and marvel at it, out of context. But the reason it exists within the narrative of the film is what strikes me now. Kelly's Joe Brady is a sailor on leave after having received a medal during World War II. He visits the class of a young boy, who asks Joe how he got his award. Rather than tell a horrifying truth about the war, Joe makes up a fanciful tale: One day, he happened upon an animated kingdom where the Mouse King, ashamed that he didn't know how to sing or dance, had banned his subjects from doing either. Joe takes it upon himself to teach the king how to do both, delighting the king and spreading happiness to the land, earning his medal. It is perhaps the most joyous suppression of trauma in cinema history—Joe's obfuscation a touching way to shield those young kids from whatever had happened. I, less healthily, was moving through life in a fog, suppressing my emotions in a way that allowed them to grow like mold.

This all twirls in my head as my daughter twirls in front of the TV, hammering home what I now understand as an obvious truth about parenthood in general and my own fatherhood in particular: You can't take care of your family without taking care of yourself. Or, rather, you—no matter how much weight you are capable of withstanding—are responsible for the weight you make your family carry too.

From the July/August 2022 issue: Why is Dad so mad?

Many thousands of words have been written by people worried about the state of “men today” and tussling over conceptions of masculinity. Frankly, I've been less concerned with those arguments and more with figuring out for myself which parts of masculinity actually matter, especially when it comes to fatherhood. For instance: “Providing” for your family—a traditional tenet of masculinity—is, to my mind, about so much more than money. Fathers provide their children with an example of the type of person we want to exist in the world. It is not inherently masculine to come home angry from work or to drown your emotions in brown liquor. A “real” man is someone strong enough to admit his faults and mistakes, and to strive to improve.

The Harvard well-being study notes that “the happiest and most satisfied adults” in midlife were “those who managed to turn the question ‘What can I do for myself?' into ‘What can I do for the world beyond me?'” This reframing has also made me think more about what helping really means. Yes, it helps the people I love when I cook them dinner. But it helps them a great deal more if I am engaged and present—never mind if dinner winds up running 20 minutes behind schedule.

It's still an absolute point of pride for me that my daughter wants to stay up late watching Gene Kelly. She doesn't know that he was a maniacal perfectionist, that he practiced for terrifyingly long hours to make everything look easy. She doesn't know that balance and stability do not just emerge naturally, but require lots of regular, hard work. Those lessons will come. For now, as my kids grow older, I know what I will keep working to show them: that admitting our flaws and failures is necessary, that showing vulnerability is a kind of strength—that ultimately, a joyful and openhearted home is even better for you than dandelion greens.

﻿Boyfriends. Ugh.

In recent months, freelance writer Chanté Joseph noticed a surprising trend on her social media feeds: Women had stopped posting pictures of their boyfriends.

For a long time, boyfriend pics were good social media fodder. Whether on vacation or chilling at home, these images sent a message of heterosexual bliss, of contented couplehood. A world, as Joseph wrote, “where women's online identities centered around the lives of their partners, a situation rarely seen reversed.”

But then the boyfriends disappeared. You might see a hand, or a shadow, or the back of a head. But the faces of these men were cropped out or blurred out, “as if they want to erase the fact they exist without actually not posting them.”

Women were living their lives, and their guys no longer served their personal brands.

Joseph puzzled this out in an article for Vogue called “Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?” The piece went viral, sparking a wave of TikTok discourse and prompting a follow-up story a couple of weeks later.

Today, Explained host Astead Herndon called Joseph up to talk about her piece, the reaction it received, and the state of heterosexual dating now.

You wrote what I would think is one of the most memorable pieces of the year, a piece for Vogue that went viral in 2025, specifically about a question that you put into the zeitgeist. Can you tell me about the piece?

The piece was essentially asking this question if having a boyfriend has lost the social standing it once provided women. And I was analyzing this through the lens of social media.

I was looking at the way that women are very private about posting their romantic partners online. A lot of people were sticking emojis over their boyfriend's heads. We've all seen this and I think it started to ramp up, and then it became a little bit of a parody where people would just edit out their boyfriend's heads completely.

But then I noticed that people would post their wedding videos or they would post their engagement videos and photos. They were edited in a way that you never knew what the husband looked like. And I was like, “Okay, this is feeling a bit extreme.”

You're noticing something that has really become clear on the timeline. I remember boyfriend reveals or things like that, but it's gone to outright hiding. So what did your piece find and what did you even mean by “embarrassing”?

So I found basically three things.

The first was, people said they didn't want to do this simply for privacy reasons. And I questioned, “Well, why is it only this area of your life?” And then they would go on to say, “Well, if I posted my boyfriend and he cheated on me next week and I had to go back and delete the pictures…I'd have to deal with the shame of that.”

But then there were women who just outright thought the idea of having a boyfriend was inherently embarrassing because it didn't align with the brand. A lot of people felt like “if I post my boyfriend on Instagram or on social media, I'm indicating something about me to the world that I don't want people to know.”

In the piece, one of the comments that I quote is this idea of someone saying, “Why does having a boyfriend feel Republican?” I think it's the way that the heterosexual romantic relationship has almost been co-opted a little bit by the right. It feels traditionally very conservative. I feel like I'm aligning to this idea of the world that doesn't really feel natural to me.

I was going to ask specifically about how we should think about this alongside rising trends like “tradwives” and others. Are these things that are happening at the same time? Are these just different communities?

I think they are happening at the same time. I think about the reaction to my piece — whether it's from the men who were just really angry that I could ever talk disparagingly about men or the women who were very proud of their relationships — feeling as if [it] was an attack on them.

I think the way we talk about relationships online has changed so much. I was talking about the ReesaTeesa “Who the fuck did I marry?” [series] or the “Danish Deception,” these women coming online making these 60-part TikTok videos, detailing all of the horrible things that have happened to them.

West Elm Caleb. I remember that one.

All of these things. So there is no illusion around the fantasy anymore. And so I think that has gripped a lot of people.

You did a call-out on your Instagram, and the responses from followers said that there was “an overwhelming sense…that regardless of the relationship, being with a man was almost a guilty thing to do.” So are we talking here just about, like, shame of heterosexuality partnerships? It seems like straightness is at the core of this.

Oh yeah, 100 percent. And I think this is what really upset people as well. We don't talk about heterosexuality in this way. We very much see it as a norm. This is just the way to be in society. And so we should never really question what's going on here.

But actually, I was like, no, it's deeper than that. So one of the inspirations behind this piece was a book by professor Jane Ward. Her book is called The Tragedy of Heterosexuality, and in the book, she has a chapter that is dedicated to the things that queer people say behind their straight friends' backs.

And it was absolutely fascinating to get into the perception of straightness, straight people, and straight culture. And I think the idea of embarrassment definitely came from reading that and really realizing the ways that, yeah, straight culture is very embarrassing.

What do you think we've learned about straight relationships from this episode?

I think what I've learned is that people are still trying to claim the privilege that being in a relationship, particularly a straight relationship, gives them. And I think for some people, their anger to this piece was about them realizing that they might lose this privilege, and they might not have many other privileges. And so losing this feels like a big deal.

Do you feel like you've come through this thinking boyfriends are more or less embarrassing?

Do you know what? I think I've come away thinking that they're more embarrassing. I can't lie because the men are being embarrassing, and the women with boyfriends upset about this piece are even more embarrassing. So I'm like, damn, I might have to double down.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here's what the smartest people in foreign policy, business, and economics are saying about Trump's raid on Venezuela","https://www.businessinsider.com/economists-foreign-policy-experts-react-donald-trump-raid-venezuela-maduro-2026-1","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 05:02:00 GMT","

President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that the US had conducted a raid on Venezuela, resulting in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and big names in business and foreign policy have been reacting as the aftermath unfolds.

Here's what they've been saying:

Myers, chairman of political risk consulting firm Signum Global Advisors, told Business Insider that foreign investment in oil, tourism, and construction will be the ""centerpiece"" of Venezuela's financial recovery going forward, adding that he expects the country's economy will grow ""faster over the next two years than people anticipate because of the extent or scale of foreign investment.""

Myers, also a former head of investment advisory firm Evercore, is planning a trip of 15-20 investors to visit Venezuela in March to identify investment opportunities. Signum Global Advisors has hosted similar trips for investor groups in Syria and Ukraine.

Bremmer, founder of the political risk research and consulting firm, Eurasia Group, in a post on LinkedIn, wrote that the ""US presumption is next Venezuelan leaders will now do what the Americans want because they've just seen the 'or else.'""

Accompanying the post was a photo of a drawing of a horse. The hindquarters of the horse were drawn in intricate detail, and labeled ""SOF operation to capture Maduro,"" referencing the special operations forces mission that was executed early Saturday. The horse's head was depicted as a rudimentary children's drawing, captioned ""plans for future of Venezuela.""I wouldn't exactly call it a plan,"" Bremmer added.

In a separate post, he wrote: ""The law of the jungle is dangerous. What applies to your enemies one day can apply to you the next. Make no mistake where the world is heading here.""

The billionaire hedge fund manager wrote in a post on X that ""The removal of Maduro will lower oil prices, which is good for America and very bad for Russia. A weaker Russian economy will increase the probability that the war in Ukraine ends sooner and on more favorable terms for Ukraine. And Putin will be sleeping in his safe room from this point going forward.""

Gao is a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation and a law professor at Singapore Management University. In a series of posts on X, he said the raid on Caracas ushered in ""the brave new world of international law.""

""Maduro's capture has triggered the biggest revival of international law since Grotius — and overnight turned everyone on X into an international law wonk, eager to compare Venezuela to Taiwan,"" he wrote.

""But China has never treated the Taiwan issue as a matter of international law,"" he continued. ""It has always been framed as an internal affair, with Taiwan regarded as a renegade province. The reason China has not acted is not because it lacks legal justification, but because it lacks the capability. Thus, US ops in Venezuela provide China with no additional legal justification.""

The Democratic senator from Massachusetts is a former Harvard Law professor who holds deep expertise in bankruptcy and consumer finance. In a post on X, she wrote that Trump's action to seize Maduro, ""no matter how terrible a dictator he is — is unconstitutional and threatens to drag the US into further conflicts in the region.""

""What does it mean that the US will 'run' Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?"" Warren wrote. ""The American people voted for lower costs, not for Trump's dangerous military adventurism overseas that won't make the American people safer.""

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent most of Saturday posting praise for the Trump administration and the military operations in Venezuela, posting that it was ""heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant.""

In another post, Musk retweeted a White House image of Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima after being apprehended, with the caption ""Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere.""

Musk and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, alternating between appearing to be close allies and trading sharp criticisms in the media.

Writing on X, the British billionaire and founder of the Virgin Group said Maduro's ""corrupt and inept reign"" had ""caused endless suffering for the Venezuelan people and brought this beautiful country to the verge of economic and social collapse.""

""He will not be missed,"" he wrote.

Branson added that a ""just and fair transition means handing power to Venezuelans, and especially to those with a clear mandate to lead.""

A large part of erstwhile President Nicolas Maduro's security team was killed in the U.S. raid that led to the leader's Saturday capture, said Venezuelan Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino, in a televised statement on Sunday morning.

Padrino did not give an exact figure of causalities but backed the declaration of Vice President Delcy Rodriguez as interim president and said the armed forces have been activated across the country to guarantee sovereignty.

The U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro — praised by President Donald Trump as stunning and powerful — leaves behind uncertainty about who is running the oil-rich country.

Trump said on Saturday that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, part of the powerful cabal at the top of the country's government, had been sworn in after Maduro's arrest and that she had spoken with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, leading to speculation that she would take the reins.

Under Venezuela's constitution, Rodriguez becomes acting president in Maduro's absence and the country's top court ordered her to assume the role late Saturday night.

But shortly after Trump's remarks, Rodriguez appeared on state television flanked by her brother, the head of the national assembly Jorge Rodriguez, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and said that Maduro remained Venezuela's only president.

The joint appearance indicated the group that shared power with Maduro is staying united - for now.

Trump publicly closed the door Saturday on working with opposition leader and Nobel Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, widely seen as Maduro's most credible opponent, saying she doesn't have support inside the country.

After Machado was barred from running in Venezuela's 2024 elections, international observers say her stand-in candidate won the vote in a landslide, despite Maduro's government claiming victory.

For more than a decade, real power in Venezuela has been held by a small circle of senior officials. Analysts and officials say though that the system depends on a sprawling web of loyalists and security organs, fueled by corruption and surveillance.

Within the inner circle, a civilian-military balance reigns. Each member has their own interests and patronage networks. Currently Rodriguez and her brother represent the civilian side. Padrino and Cabello represent the military side.

This power structure makes dismantling Venezuela's current government more complex than removing Maduro, according to interviews with current and former U.S. officials, Venezuelan and U.S. military analysts and security consultants to Venezuela's opposition.

""You can remove as many pieces of the Venezuelan government as you like, but it would have to be multiple actors at different levels to move the needle,"" said a former U.S. official involved in criminal investigations in Venezuela.

A big question mark surrounds Cabello, who exerts influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage.

""The focus is now on Diosdado Cabello,"" said Venezuelan military strategist Jose Garcia. ""Because he is the most ideological, violent and unpredictable element of the Venezuelan regime.""

The United Nations found both SEBIN, the civilian agency, and DGCIM, the military intelligence service, have committed crimes against humanity as part of a state plan to crush dissent. Eleven former detainees - including some who were once security personnel themselves - described electric shocks, simulated drownings, and sexual abuse at DGCIM black sites to Reuters in interviews before Maduro's capture.

""They want you to feel like you are a cockroach in a cage of elephants, that they are bigger,"" said a former DGCIM agent who was arrested and accused of treason in 2020 after having contact with military dissidents.

In recent weeks, as the United States mounted its biggest military build-upin Latin America in decades, Cabello has appeared on live TV ordering the DGCIM to ""go and get the terrorists"" and warning ""whoever strays, we will know.""

He repeated the rhetoric in a state television appearance on Saturday, clad in a flak jacket and helmet and surrounded by heavily armed guards.

Cabello has also been closely associated with pro-government militias, notably groups of motorcycle-riding armed civilians known as colectivos.

Cabello, a former military officer and a major player in the socialist party, has influence over a meaningful fraction of the armed forces, even though Venezuela's military has been formally run by Defense Minister Padrino for more than ten years.

Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.

Beyond contracts, military officials profit from illicit trade, defectors and current and former U.S. investigators say.

Documents from an opposition security consultant, shared with the U.S. military and seen by Reuters, say commanders close to Cabello and Padrino are assigned to key brigades along Venezuela's borders and in industrial hubs.

The brigades, while tactically important, also sit on major smuggling routes.

""There are some 20 to 50 officers in the Venezuelan military who need to go, probably even more, to fully remove this regime,"" said a lawyer who has represented a member of senior Venezuelan leadership.

Some might be considering jumping ship. The lawyer said that around a dozen former officials and current generals had reached out after Maduro's capture, hoping to cut a deal with the U.S. by offering intelligence in exchange for safe passage and legal immunity.

But those close to Cabello said he was not currently interested in cutting a deal, the lawyer said.

Airlines scrambled to add dozens of extra flights for tens of thousands of stranded travelers throughout the Eastern Caribbean on Sunday after the Federal Aviation Administration's flight restrictions in the area though some customers found no seats available for days. 

The FAA had closed airspace in the region to U.S. commercial flights after the United States' strikes in Venezuela. The restrictions expired overnight, allowing flights to resume.

The flight curbs forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights in the region on Saturday, stranding customers at the end of the busy holiday period.

FlightAware showed about 20 cancellations in San Juan on Sunday, compared with 400 a day earlier. However disruptions for some travelers could last for days because seats were scarce and previously scheduled flights were packed for the end of the New Year holiday weekend and school vacations.

Airlines received complaints from some users on X that they couldn't find available seats back to the U.S. until the end of the week. Some said they didn't have places to stay or couldn't afford additional nights at Caribbean hotels. 

American Airlines told CNBC it added 17 extra flights between San Juan, Puerto Rico, as well as Aruba, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, Antigua, Barbados, Dominica and Barbados, and its hubs in Miami and Charlotte, North Carolina. Southwest Airlines added six extra round-trips between San Juan on Sunday and another eight on Monday as well as two additional flights to Aruba on Sunday.

""We are looking for opportunities to add more capacity to both places in the coming days,"" the airline said in a statement.

But as of Sunday morning, even new flights were listed as unavailable on airline websites, as seats sold out quickly in the demand surge.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines plan to add additional flights on Sunday. Carriers were evaluating using larger planes, like those normally used for Europe or Asia, to accommodate the surge in demand. 

American said it would use two Boeing 777-300s, the largest aircraft in its fleet and that sits 304 passengers, for two San Juan-Miami roundtrips on Monday.

Airlines generally add flights and send bigger planes ahead of evacuations for hurricanes but had little time to prepare after the United States' attack in Venezuela.

The airlines waived change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the closures if they rebooked flights later in the month. More than a dozen airports in the region were included in the waivers.

Major U.S. airlines have not served Venezuela directly for years. American Airlines was the last major carrier to halt flights to the country in 2019 amid unrest.

The temporary restrictions were set to expire at midnight ET, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X. 

The United States' attack on Venezuela resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Maduro was indicted on narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges in the Southern District of New York. His indictment was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday.

The flight restrictions after the U.S. attacks underscored how quickly military action can disrupt civilian air travel, forcing airlines to suspend operations well beyond the immediate conflict zone.

Airlines have been forced to take longer routes to avoid airspace if not periodically halt flights altogether due to conflicts in the Middle East as well as after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung began a state visit to China on Sunday, hoping to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula hours after rival North Korea launched ballistic missiles.

The visit, Lee's first to China since taking office in June, comes amid heightened global tensions after Pyongyang's aggressive display, on the heels of the U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Lee is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping during the trip for their second meeting in just two months, an unusually short interval that, analysts say, signals China's keen interest in boosting economic collaboration and tourism as its relations with neighbouring Japan have sunk to the lowest point in years.

Beijing was incensed when Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan. China claims the democratically governed island as its own - an assertion rejected by Taiwan's government.

Sunday's missile launches by North Korea represent ""a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China's stance on denuclearisation"", said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.

Lee arrived in Beijing with a delegation that includes more than 200 South Korean business leaders to start the four-day visit, Chinese state news broadcaster CCTV reported.

These included Samsung Electronics 005930.KS Chairman Jay Y. Lee, SK Group chairman Chey Tae-won and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung, according to photos published by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency.

China and South Korea are expected to discuss matters such as supply chain investment, the digital economy and cultural exchanges during Lee's visit, CCTV said.

In this article

Valuations of several technology and artificial intelligence stocks are expected to remain in focus in 2026, as investors are concerned about the payoffs on massive AI spending.

Nonetheless, top Wall Street analysts continue to be bullish on several tech and AI plays based on thorough analysis of their fundamentals, strong execution, and growth potential.

Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first pick is e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). In a research note on the 2026 outlook for stocks in the AI and internet space, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson called Amazon one of his favorite ideas, citing ""Best in-class visibility on AI infrastructure ROIC [return on invested capital] with compelling product cycle/capacity acceleration cycle coming.""

Erickson reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock with a price forecast of $300. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock with an ""outperform"" rating but a lower price target of $240.

The top-rated analyst said that he likes the structural positioning of the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit for two key reasons. First, Erickson highlighted that AWS has the most diversified and hedged revenue sources, with its core business largely unaffected by generative AI and not a competitor of ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Second, Erickson thinks that AWS is the most disciplined hyperscaler when it comes to capital spending.

Notably, based on his ROIC scenario analysis, Erickson expects Amazon to see the fastest returns, with Alphabet-owned Google expanding more gradually, and Meta Platforms lagging in capital efficiency due to its indirect revenue model. He expects AWS to have the highest marginal contribution margin as the cloud unit increases its spending, thanks to its pay-as-you-go model and strong efficiency, with new capacity that is often pre-booked and revenue that is directly linked to infrastructure usage.

Based on his optimistic outlook, Erickson raised his revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) estimates for 2026 and 2027, driven by higher AWS growth expectations and cost efficiencies. For 2028, the analyst expects revenue growth of 10% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%.

Erickson ranks No. 195 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 21.9%. See Amazon Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks.

Let's look at another tech giant, Microsoft (MSFT). Following meetings with the company's executives across businesses, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterated a buy rating on MSFT stock with a price target of $650. The stock scores an ""outperform"" rating from TipRanks' AI Analyst with a price target of $562.

""Meeting with executives across Microsoft businesses leaves us with conviction on robust demand translating to durable mid-teens top-line growth and increased confidence in ROI contributing to continued operating margin expansion,"" said Weiss.

Among the key takeaways from his meetings that he mentioned, Weiss highlighted that demand for Microsoft Azure has been stronger than what the company expected at the start of the year. The analyst added that demand is solid not only for Azure AI but across every product within the Azure portfolio, thanks to broader IT modernization efforts of enterprises.

Consequently, Weiss raised his Azure estimates, assuming Azure AI gross margin (excluding OpenAI revenue share) reaches 30% by fiscal 2029. In fact, Weiss thinks that Azure AI margin can exceed 40%, suggesting huge upside to his estimates in the years ahead.

Overall, Weiss called MSFT his Top Pick in the large-cap software sector, with the stock trading at 23x his calendar year 2027 GAAP EPS estimate of $20.65. The analyst contends that sustained top-line demand and the possibility for further margin expansion, as reflected in the company's Q1 FY26 results, are not yet fully valued by the market.

Weiss ranks No. 400 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.1%. See Microsoft Technology Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Memory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU) impressed investors with market-beating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. The company also issued an upbeat outlook for the fiscal second quarter, reflecting strong demand for its high-performance memory and storage products amid the rapid growth in AI data centers.

Impressed by the Q1 FY26 print, Stifel analyst Brian Chin reiterated a buy rating on Micron stock with a price target of $300. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on MU stock, with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $285.

Discussing the ""blockbuster"" quarterly performance and outlook, Chin observed that Micron easily surpassed Stifel's above-consensus expectations with a higher average selling price (ASP) driving a 20% sequential growth in DRAM and NAND revenue. The 5-star analyst highlighted the robust demand, saying, ""Demand is outstripping supply, with Micron only able to meet 1/2 to 2/3 of some key customers' near term demand.""

Chin also noted the impressive rise in margins across all of Micron's business units, including the consumer-oriented Mobile and Client Business division, which saw its gross margin jump to 54% in Q1 FY26 from 36% in Q4 FY25.

The analyst also discussed Micron's solid guidance and added that despite industry supply constraints, Micron expects both DRAM and NAND bit shipments to increase by 20% in 2026. Overall, Chin remains bullish on MU stock and noted that after another round of positive estimate revisions, the stock trades at less than 6x his next-12 months earnings per share estimate.

Chin ranks No. 350 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 25.6%. See Micron Financials on TipRanks.

When 51-year-old Annouk Perret came to pay her respects to the victims of the Swiss New Year bar fire that killed at least 40 people in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, she knew that she too could have been one of the parents mourning a lost child.

Authorities say most of the victims of the blaze that ripped through the Le Constellation bar were young people in a country renowned for orderliness and unaccustomed to mass fatalities.

Laying flowers with her son Emile and her tearful mother-in-law Carmen outside the now cordoned-off popular bar, Perret recalled how her 17-year-old daughter wanted to go in too that night - but did not because of the long queue outside.

Instead, she said her daughter went to a bar opposite with friends. When flames engulfing the bar sparked a blast, they first assumed it was fireworks; when police quickly arrived, the group feared it was gunfire and fled, Perret said.

Afterwards, the family learned that another friend of her daughter decided to enter ""Le Constellation"" just before the fire and lost her life there, Perret told Reuters.

""We've come today because we need to be here. We need to see the place where it happened,"" she said. ""(She) could have been dead, but is not. But others are dead.""

Perret spoke just as Swiss authorities were announcing they had identified four more victims aged 16-21, without naming them. Very few of the dead have so far been identified, with the severity of burns making identification hard.

That will be a tough process for Crans-Montana, she said, a wealthy town of over 10,000 people with a popular golf course.

Prosecutors on Saturday said the two people who ran the bar are now under investigation suspected of crimes including homicide by negligence.

Damiano Vizioli, a 24-year-old living in neighbouring Sion, was in Le Constellation on New Year's Eve but had gone outside to smoke a cigarette when the bar suddenly burst into flames.

He was stunned to see people with their clothes on fire scrambling to escape from the burning bar, he said. The distressing scenes he witnessed have stayed with him.

""I'm not sleeping well because I can hear the people screaming,"" said Vizioli, who went back to the bar desperate for news of a friend working there whom he has not heard from since.

The blaze has hit many nationalities, with the injured and missing coming from all corners of Europe and as far afield as Australia. But most of the tally are Swiss.

Mutual support was crucial for coping, Perret said.

""Now we call each other, each parents, because everybody has children who were in there or almost were there, or didn't go... and everybody's completely shaken,"" she said.

Reporters from all around Europe rushed to get to the Alpine retreat as images of the inferno began circulating online.

Eric Schmid, a 63-year-old local businessman, said he had received messages from all over the world since the news broke.

""The scar will be quite deep, and I think it'll take time to heal,"" he said. But the Swiss are resilient, he added.

""We are mountain people. We will survive, of course, but that's not the most important thing,"" he said. ""It's more about the kids and all these people who have been affected. But the messages and signs of solidarity are super important.""

Among those who expressed gratitude for the solidarity is Pierre Pralong, an 89-year-old anxiously awaiting word of his missing granddaughter Emilie, 22, who went to the bar. The uncertainty had caused the family great suffering, he said.

But even as hopes dwindle, faith in God was helping him as he recalled Emilie's joyful nature. ""I have a feeling she's probably passed on into the next life,"" Pralong said.

Oops, something went wrong

The US' capture of the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has done little to affect Bitcoin prices over the weekend, with some experts claiming crypto markets will not suffer as a result of Washington's strikes.

On X, Michaël van de Poppe, the founder of the crypto investment firm MN Fund, said he did not foresee “a widespread Bitcoin correction based on the attack in Venezuela.”

“It's a planned and coordinated attack on Maduro, and is already past us,” van de Poppe said.

While crypto markets seem unmoved, some fear the picture will change when equities and commodities markets reopen on Monday.

“The likelihood of more negativity on the markets from that single event [is] relatively slim. I would assume we'll see Bitcoin north of $90,000 [in the] coming week,” van de Poppe said.

But others were less optimistic.

“There's a lot of geopolitical tension, and next week the big players will return,” the crypto market analyst Lennaert Snyder wrote on X. “So we'll probably see more volatility on Bitcoin after the weekend.”

An editorial in the Indian newspaper Economic Times noted that geopolitics “has muscled its way back into markets at the very start of 2026.”

“An audacious US military operation […] has jolted investors into reassessing risk, setting up potential turbulence across crude oil, precious metals, currencies, and equities when trading resumes on Monday,” the newspaper's senior digital producer Riya Sharma wrote.

Sharma said market participants expect oil prices to drop when trading opens on Monday.

“Heightened geopolitical risk typically drives capital out of risk assets and into perceived safe havens,” Sharma added. “Equity markets may not be spared. Wall Street could see a knee-jerk reaction given that the US is directly involved in this conflict, unlike the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Iran war that dominated markets in 2025.”

Bitcoin prices continued their slow crawl back above the $90,000 mark over the weekend, apparently unaffected completely by the events of January 3, which saw US special forces capture Maduro and his wife.

Maduro has since been taken to Manhattan, where he was sent to the same detention center that once held Sam Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of the crypto exchange FTX.

Worries about incoming turbulence will come as a New Year shock to Bitcoin investors, who enjoyed their least volatile year to date in 2025.

K33 Research reported that huge Bitcoin price swings are now a thing of the past, and added that Bitcoin's four-year price cycle “no longer applies.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin, ether price news: BTC rises above $91,000 as Trump ousts Maduro","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/04/bitcoin-tops-usd91-000-with-ether-dogecoin-higher-amid-u-s-action-on-venezuela","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 05:04:12 GMT","

Bitcoin climbed above $91,000 on Sunday as traders extended the early 2026 rebound across major tokens, with ether, solana and cardano posting broad gains as geopolitical headlines out of Venezuela added to risk appetite.

Bitcoin traded around $91,300 in Asian morning hours, up about 1.4% on the day and more than 4% over seven days. Ether rose roughly 1% to near $3,150 and is up about 7% on the week, while solana gained about 1.6% and has climbed more than 8% over seven days. XRP hovered just above $2, rising about 0.6% on the day and nearly 10% over the week, while cardano was modestly higher on the day and up about 8% in seven days.

The move followed a sharp liquidation flush that cleared crowded positioning and reset near term leverage. 

Data showed roughly $180 million in futures positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, with about $133 million coming from shorts and $47 million from longs. The imbalance suggests traders were caught leaning against the rally, forcing buybacks as prices pushed higher.

Sunday's gains also came as traders reacted to a fast moving political situation in Venezuela. 

President Donald Trump said the U.S. plans to “run” Venezuela, while the White House offered few details on what that would entail. Venezuela's Supreme Court granted Vice President Delcy Rodríguez all presidential powers in an acting capacity after ousted President Nicolás Maduro was taken into U.S. custody. 

Trump also signaled a focus on Venezuela's oil, saying the U.S. would have a “presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” and suggested U.S. troops on the ground would not be necessary if Rodríguez “does what we want.”

Crypto traders often treat such headlines as a volatility catalyst rather than a direct macro driver, but the risk tone can still matter. 

In periods when liquidity is thinner, even modest spot demand can push prices through technical levels and trigger stop driven moves in futures markets. 

That dynamic is amplified when shorts are positioned for a pullback, as forced covering can turn a grind higher into a sharper break.

Bitcoin's price is unlikely to see a sharp, broad correction in the days following the US military strike on Venezuela, according to MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe.

Van de Poppe wrote on X:

“I don't think we'll see a widespread correction based on the attack in Venezuela on Bitcoin.”

The strikes reportedly began around 6:00 a.m. UTC on Saturday and lasted about 30 minutes.

Van de Poppe described the action as a “planned and coordinated attack” that has “already passed us,” arguing the odds of “more negativity on the markets” are “relatively slim.”

Bitcoin rose about 1.66% over the past 24 hours to reclaim the $90,000 level.

BTC was trading around $91,290 at the time of publication.

Over the last 24 hours, about $60.04 million in leveraged bitcoin positions were liquidated.

Shorts accounted for $55.01 million of that total.

Bitcoin has previously dropped during periods of geopolitical escalation, including Iran-Israel tensions and the Russia-Ukraine war.

In June 2025, bitcoin fell 2.8%—from $106,042 to $103,053—within 90 minutes after explosions in Tehran later attributed to Israel.

Crypto analyst Tyler Hill said markets tend to “nuke” when investors expect conditions to worsen afterward.

Crypto analyst Shagun Makin added that bitcoin has shown it can “stay firm” amid “geopolitical noise,” reinforcing confidence it can hold above $90,000.

Bitcoin surpassed $91,000 for the first time in 2026 and since Dec. 12. Bitcoin reached a high of $91,764 on Sunday as traders extended the early 2026 rebound across major cryptocurrencies as risk appetite improved.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up 1.72% in the last 24 hours to $91,192 and up 3.8% in the last seven days.

While traders are watching for what comes next in the markets, community analyst at on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant Maartunn hints that the next few hours till Sunday's close might be crucial to watch.

According to Maartunn, Sunday nights can bring volatility. Some instances have seen prices rise on Sundays only for the markets to reverse, plunging most assets into losses.

Sunday nights can bring volatility 🌙

But the last two Sundays have been relatively flat — not much to trade on. pic.twitter.com/MiAGflQKEo

Maartunn noted an exception to last two Sundays, which were relatively flat with not much to trade on. It will be watched to see if Sunday's volatility trend as highlighted will play out, with the next few hours being watched.

Volatility coming?

Bitcoin has traded in a tight range between $85,000 and $90,000 in recent weeks. As a result, the gap between its Bollinger Bands, volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day MA, has narrowed.

Bollinger Bands' squeeze often suggests a low-volatility period in which the market is building energy for the next big move. History confirms massive price swings often follow these squeezes.

This latest squeeze, however, calls for trader vigilance as prices could soon move rapidly in either direction, up or down.

The next major resistance target for Bitcoin lies slightly below $107,000 and then above $116,000, while support is expected near $83,000.

Bitcoin recently marked its 17th anniversary; on Jan. 3, 2009, the Bitcoin network was born when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the Bitcoin genesis block. Embedded in this block was the text ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,"" which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain's fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.

The breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin's first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.

“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.

Buterin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.

At the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.

Ethereum's new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.

ZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.

Meanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.

The Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.

“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.

George Kadianakis from the foundation's cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.

“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we've been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.

Buterin outlined a four-year deployment schedule beginning with large non-ZKEVM-dependent gas limit increases in 2026 through Balance Attack Limits and enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation, alongside the first opportunities to run ZKEVM nodes.

Between 2026 and 2028, developers will implement gas repricing, state structure changes, and the migration of execution payloads into blobs to safely support higher throughput.

By 2027 through 2030, Buterin expects ZKEVM validation to become the primary block verification method as gas limits increase substantially beyond current capacity.

The roadmap also includes distributed block building as a third critical component, with Buterin describing a “long-term ideal holy grail” in which full blocks are never concentrated in a single location, reducing centralized interference risks and improving geographic fairness.

While celebrating technical progress, Buterin warned in a separate January 1 post that Ethereum must resist the urge to chase “fleeting trends” like tokenized dollars or political memecoins.

“Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals,” he wrote, calling for applications that pass the “walkaway test” by continuing to function even if original developers disappear and remain stable regardless of external disruptions, including hypothetical scenarios like Cloudflare being compromised by state actors.

The co-founder also cautioned separately last month that the protocol complexity undermines trustlessness by limiting the number of people who can understand the system end-to-end.

“If only five people can understand how your privacy protocol works, you haven't achieved trustlessness, you've just changed who you trust,” privacy network INTMAX stated, echoing Buterin's concern that growing technical abstractions risk concentrating functional control among experts.

Institutional adoption continues to accelerate despite these architectural challenges, with Ethereum's total value locked projected to rise tenfold in 2026.

Already, JPMorgan is launching a $100 million tokenized money-market fund on Ethereum, and Deutsche Bank is developing a Layer 2 using ZKsync technology, alongside 24 financial institutions testing asset tokenization under Singapore's regulatory framework.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said new privacy and data-handling technologies have effectively solved the blockchain's long-standing scalability challenges.

However, he cautioned that a full security rollout of these developments remains a few years away.

In a January 3 post on X, Buterin said Ethereum's integration of zero-knowledge virtual machines has changed the network's capabilities. 

He added that the shift is driven by the pairing of ZK-EVMs with the data distribution method, PeerDAS.

“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” he stated.

He claimed this combination resolves the “Blockchain Trilemma”—the historic engineering difficulty of achieving decentralization, security, and high bandwidth simultaneously.

Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance, remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it's time to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum.These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a…

Buterin compared the upgraded architecture to a “BitTorrent with consensus,” contrasting it with Bitcoin's model, which prioritizes decentralization but struggles with data throughput. 

With the new upgrades, he noted, Ethereum can now handle data loads comparable to massive file-sharing networks while maintaining the security of a decentralized ledger.

“The trilemma has been solved – not on paper, but with live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is on mainnet today, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is production-quality on performance today – safety is what remains,” he argued. 

However, the roadmap for implementing this vision extends well into the future.

While Buterin asserted that the technology has reached “production-quality performance,” he conceded that significant work remains to ensure the system's safety. 

According to his timeline, ZK-EVMs will not become the primary method for validating blocks until between 2027 and 2030. These systems will enable faster and cheaper transaction verification without exposing underlying data.

In the interim, the network plans to implement incremental upgrades. 

This year, Buterin expects the gas limit to increase. New protocol developments would enable this by separating transaction proposers from block builders and expanding the amount of work each block can handle.

Looking further ahead, Buterin outlined a goal for “distributed block building.” This is a system in which no single entity constructs a complete set of transactions. 

He said distributing this authority reduces the risk of centralized censorship and ensures transactions are processed more evenly across regions.

“A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place. This will not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us at least have the capability to do that,” Buterin wrote.

The technical pivot comes as Ethereum continues to face stiff competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains, pressuring developers to accelerate the deployment of these next-generation scaling solutions.

ETF optimism and Bitcoin's bounce lifted SUI, but weekly structure remains fragile.

On the 31st of December, it was reported that Bitwise filed for 11 cryptocurrency ETFs. One of the altcoins included was Sui.

Since then, the token's price has rallied nearly 19% in three days.

Bitcoin was challenging the $90k resistance zone at the time of writing. The Bitcoin Dominance has fallen noticeably since Tuesday, the 30th of December, a reflection of the relative strength in the altcoin market.

Can this strength last, and will Sui [SUI] embark on a sustained uptrend?

Source: SUI/USDT on TradingView

The 1-week chart was firmly bearish, but a price bounce was underway. A weekly session close above $1.79 would be a sign that SUI bulls have some temporary control.

This would drive prices toward $2.95 and $3.4. These levels were the key Fibonacci retracement levels overhead.

Neither the momentum nor the buying pressure reflected bullish strength on this timeframe, despite the recent gains.

Source: SUI/USDT on TradingView

The range formation (purple) has its high at $1.68, and SUI was trading above it at the time of writing. A daily session close above the range extreme would be a strong sign of bullish conviction.

Failure to exit the range could be an early warning of bearish strength and an incoming rejection. As things stand, this outcome appears less likely.

The OBV was attempting to climb higher, and the Awesome Oscillator had already made a bullish crossover, indicating rising demand and momentum. Bitcoin [BTC] has also scaled the local resistance at $90k, fueling bullish conviction across the market.

As the weekly chart showed, traders can buy the breakout and eye ambitious targets such as $3.40.

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin claimed the network has solved the blockchain trilemma through zero-knowledge virtual machines and new data-handling technologies.

However, full security implementation remains years away.

In a January 3 post on X, Buterin said the combination of ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS represents a fundamental shift for Ethereum.

He argued the trilemma has been solved ""not on paper, but with live running code.""

The blockchain trilemma refers to the difficulty of achieving decentralization, security and high bandwidth simultaneously.

Buterin stated that PeerDAS is live on mainnet while ZK-EVMs have reached production-quality performance at the alpha stage.

He described the upgraded architecture as ""BitTorrent with consensus"" in contrast to Bitcoin's model that prioritizes decentralization but struggles with data throughput.

Zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines enable faster transaction verification without exposing underlying data.

PeerDAS changes how Ethereum checks data availability by allowing validators to check small random parts rather than downloading all block data.

Buterin outlined a multi-year implementation timeline extending through the end of the decade.

Gas limit increases are expected to begin in 2026 through protocol changes that separate transaction proposers from block builders.

Between 2026 and 2028, developers will introduce gas repricings and state structure modifications.

ZK-EVMs will not become the primary block validation method until between 2027 and 2030 according to Buterin's roadmap.

He emphasized that significant work remains to ensure system safety despite production-quality performance.

Distributed block building remains a long-term goal to prevent centralized control over transaction construction.

The technical pivot comes as Ethereum faces competition from faster, lower-cost blockchains pressuring developers to accelerate scaling solution deployment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum Cracks Blockchain Trilemma with ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS","https://blockmanity.com/news/vitalik-buterin-reveals-ethereum-cracks-blockchain-trilemma-with-zk-evms-and-peerdas/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:33:45 GMT","

Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has made a bold claim. He says , one of the biggest hurdles in blockchain tech. This comes from new tools like zero-knowledge virtual machines (ZK-EVMs) and PeerDAS. These changes promise to boost speed, keep things secure, and stay decentralized.

The blockchain trilemma is a key challenge. It means blockchains struggle to balance three things at once:

Bitcoin picks decentralization and security but is slow. Other chains go fast but lose decentralization. Ethereum aims to fix this with smart upgrades.

In a recent post, Vitalik shared exciting news. ZK-EVMs are now at alpha stage. They run fast like production code. PeerDAS is already live on the mainnet. Together, they change Ethereum into a stronger network.

“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network.”

Vitalik calls it a “BitTorrent with consensus“. Think of BitTorrent sharing big files across many users. Ethereum now handles huge data loads like that, but with blockchain security. Bitcoin focuses on decentralization but can't match the data speed.

Let's break it down simply.

ZK-EVMs are zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines. They prove a transaction is valid without showing all details. This means:

Performance is ready for real use. Safety tweaks are next.

PeerDAS is data availability sampling. Nodes check block data in small samples, not full blocks. This lets Ethereum scale data to huge levels without trusting one spot.

Result? Ethereum hits high bandwidth while staying decentralized and secure.

Vitalik says: “The trilemma has been solved – not on paper, but with live running code.” PeerDAS runs now. ZK-EVMs are close.

It's not all done yet. Full rollout takes time. Vitalik shares the plan:

ZK-EVMs become main for block checks by 2027-2030. Faster, private verification rules.

No one builds a full block alone. Tasks spread out. This cuts censorship risk and evens global access.

“A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place.”

It's a big goal, but Ethereum devs aim high.

Ethereum faces rivals like Solana or Layer 2s. They're faster and cheaper now. But Ethereum's upgrades could leap ahead.

These changes make Ethereum a leader in Web3. Scalability fixes draw more users and money.

Safety is key. ZK-EVMs need audits to avoid bugs. Devs must test hard.

Competition pushes Ethereum. Rivals innovate fast. But Ethereum's community and ecosystem are huge strengths.

Watch for:

If Vitalik is right, Ethereum sets the bar. Other chains may copy ZK tech and DAS. Blockchain grows more usable for daily life.

From payments to games, scalable chains change everything. Ethereum's path shows how to balance the trilemma.

Stay tuned. Ethereum's journey is just heating up.

Ethereum's co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, just made waves in the crypto world. He claims Ethereum has finally cracked the  – that tough puzzle holding back blockchains everywhere. The secret weapons?  and PeerDAS. These upgrades promise to make Ethereum faster, safer, and more decentralized than ever.

If you're into crypto, you know speed and scale matter. Ethereum has been working hard on this for years. Now, with live code running, Vitalik says the future looks bright. Let's dive in and see how this changes everything.

The  is a big idea from Vitalik himself. It says blockchains can't be great at three things at once: scalability, security, and decentralization.

Bitcoin nails security and decentralization but is super slow. Solana is fast but has faced outages. Ethereum wants all three. Past fixes like sharding helped, but not enough. Enter  and PeerDAS.

In a recent blog post, Vitalik shared exciting updates. He said, “The trilemma has been solved – not on paper, but with live running code.” That's huge!

PeerDAS is already live on Ethereum's mainnet.  are in alpha stage and running at production speeds. Together, they turn Ethereum into a “BitTorrent with consensus.”

BitTorrent lets users share huge files peer-to-peer. Ethereum now handles massive data the same way, but with blockchain's trustless security. No more bottlenecks.

, or Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines, are a breakthrough. They prove a transaction is valid without revealing every step. It's like showing you won a game without replaying the whole match.

Key benefits:

Right now,  are alpha-ready. Next steps? Safety audits and tweaks. By 2027-2030, they could handle main block verification. Imagine Ethereum processing millions of transactions per second securely.

PeerDAS stands for Peer Data Availability Sampling. It's a smart way to check block data. Instead of downloading full blocks (which are getting huge), nodes sample small bits.

How it works:

Result? Ethereum scales data bandwidth to terabytes per block. PeerDAS is live now, proving it works in the real world.

These tools hit all three goals:

Vitalik's vision: “A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where the full block is never constituted in one single place.” This fights censorship and boosts access worldwide.

Ethereum doesn't stop here. Plans include:

It'll take time – think years – but progress is steady. Devs are testing hard to avoid bugs.

Solana boasts high speed, but centralization worries linger. Layer 2s like Optimism help Ethereum now, but base layer upgrades make it stronger.

With these changes, Ethereum could leap ahead. More users mean more DeFi apps, NFTs, and games. TVL (total value locked) might skyrocket.

Competition is good – it pushes innovation. But Ethereum's massive community and developer base give it an edge.

No tech is perfect.  need deep audits to prevent exploits. PeerDAS must prove reliable at scale.

Still, live tests show promise. Ethereum's history of upgrades (like The Merge) builds trust.

For everyday users:

Web3 gets real. From payments to social apps, Ethereum leads the way.

Vitalik Buterin has shown Ethereum  for real.  and PeerDAS aren't dreams – they're here. As code improves, expect massive growth.

Blockchain tech just leveled up. Stay tuned for more Ethereum wins. The crypto revolution is speeding up!

Former SWIFT CEO predicts the network will embrace cryptocurrencies like XRP once regulations stabilize.

Renowned crypto analyst SMQKE notes a growing trend that SWIFT may integrate cryptocurrencies like XRP as regulations become clearer. Former SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt highlights the promise and challenges of bringing digital assets into traditional finance.





“I think that the big part of Ripple's value proposition is the cryptocurrency XRP,” Leibbrandt acknowledged, noting that banks remain hesitant to adopt it due to currency volatility. 

His remarks show the cautious stance of global financial institutions, where the promise of faster, cheaper cross-border payments is tempered by the risks of fluctuating digital asset values.

SWIFT's cautious stance is largely driven by the uncertain legal status of cryptocurrencies like XRP. With regulations still evolving across jurisdictions, risk-averse banks face potential legal and compliance pitfalls that often outweigh operational benefits. 

Experts note that until regulatory clarity improves, large-scale adoption of digital currencies by banks remains unlikely.

Despite regulatory and volatility challenges, crypto adoption in traditional finance is accelerating. Ripple's XRP, built for cross-border payments, delivers faster settlements, lower fees, and greater transparency than conventional banking systems. 

SWIFT's eventual integration of XRP could transform international transfers, replacing slow, costly processes with efficient, near-instant transactions.

Leibbrandt indicates that SWIFT is closely watching the crypto space and could move once volatility eases and regulatory clarity improves, especially as Crypto Clarity & Market Structure Bills progress. As the ecosystem matures, adopting digital assets may shift from a tech upgrade to a strategic necessity for banks to stay competitive.

SWIFT's adoption of XRP depends on clearer regulations and stabilized markets, but its impact could be transformative. By combining traditional banking with cryptocurrency efficiency, XRP promises faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments. As regulatory frameworks evolve, this move marks a pivotal step toward integrating digital assets into mainstream finance, positioning XRP as a cornerstone of the future global payment system.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder of crypto exchange Binance, said on Saturday that the global crypto market is still small relative to the technology's long-term potential.

In a post on X, Zhao wrote that while the crypto market is still ‘tiny', the underlying blockchain technology has ‘unrealized' potential. With a market cap of $1.22 billion, Binance is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally by trading volume.

Its native token, Binance Coin (BNB), was trading at $887.34, up by 1.4% over the past day. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around BNB improved largely from ‘bullish' to ‘extremely bullish' territory, as chatter around the coin remained at ‘normal' levels over the past day.

Several users echoed CZ's view that adoption remains at an early stage. OpenLedger, a blockchain infrastructure firm, replied that crypto is still transitioning from “financial rails into value-producing infrastructure,” calling the current phase “just the beginning.”

Another commenter, Crypto Spotlight, pointed to adoption metrics, noting that less than 10% of the global population has interacted with crypto to date, suggesting room for broader adoption.

Others framed Zhao's comment in market-size terms. GameFi Crusher, a crypto research account, compared the crypto market's roughly $3 trillion capitalization with the global stock market's estimated $130 trillion, arguing that digital assets remain small relative to traditional financial markets. Zhao did not respond directly to the comments.

Previously, CZ predicted on X that only a small number of AI tokens would succeed in the long term. CZ pointed out that even if 5% of crypto experts were to emerge, most would be unable to defeat Bitcoin (BTC). 

According to CZ, just 4% of the 5% trade or allocate funds to blockchain initiatives, and they do not outperform buy-and-hold Bitcoin. Long-term Bitcoin investors, in comparison, outperform 99% of all crypto market participants and most traditional asset classes without breaking a sweat, he claimed.

Zhao founded Binance in 2017 and stepped down as chief executive in 2023. While no longer leading the exchange, he remains active on social media and continues to comment publicly on crypto-related topics.

Bitcoin climbed above $91,000 on Sunday as traders extended the early 2026 rebound across major tokens, with ether, solana and cardano posting broad gains as geopolitical headlines out of Venezuela added to risk appetite.

Bitcoin traded around $91,300 in Asian morning hours, up about 1.4% on the day and more than 4% over seven days. Ether rose roughly 1% to near $3,150 and is up about 7% on the week, while solana gained about 1.6% and has climbed more than 8% over seven days. XRP hovered just above $2, rising about 0.6% on the day and nearly 10% over the week, while cardano was modestly higher on the day and up about 8% in seven days.

The move followed a sharp liquidation flush that cleared crowded positioning and reset near term leverage. 

Data showed roughly $180 million in futures positions liquidated over the past 24 hours, with about $133 million coming from shorts and $47 million from longs. The imbalance suggests traders were caught leaning against the rally, forcing buybacks as prices pushed higher.

Sunday's gains also came as traders reacted to a fast moving political situation in Venezuela. 

President Donald Trump said the U.S. plans to “run” Venezuela, while the White House offered few details on what that would entail. Venezuela's Supreme Court granted Vice President Delcy Rodríguez all presidential powers in an acting capacity after ousted President Nicolás Maduro was taken into U.S. custody. 

Trump also signaled a focus on Venezuela's oil, saying the U.S. would have a “presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” and suggested U.S. troops on the ground would not be necessary if Rodríguez “does what we want.”

Crypto traders often treat such headlines as a volatility catalyst rather than a direct macro driver, but the risk tone can still matter. 

In periods when liquidity is thinner, even modest spot demand can push prices through technical levels and trigger stop driven moves in futures markets. 

That dynamic is amplified when shorts are positioned for a pullback, as forced covering can turn a grind higher into a sharper break.

Dogecoin rose to $0.1516 as buyers pushed the token back through a key technical band on volume running well above its 30-day norm — a move that signals renewed speculative appetite in meme coins even as the broader market remains range-bound.

Dogecoin and Pepe helped drive a sharp meme coin bounce as traders leaned back into “meme season” positioning to start 2026. DOGE rose about 11% on the day in the broader rally, while PEPE gained roughly 17%, with other dog-themed names also advancing — Shiba Inu up about 8%, Bonk up nearly 11%, and Floki up close to 10%.

The move extended beyond large caps. Mog Coin climbed about 14% on the day and around 37% over seven days, while Popcat gained nearly 9% and is up more than 17% on the week — a pattern traders often interpret as speculative flows spilling from larger tokens into smaller, higher-beta names once liquidity returns.

CoinGecko's GMCI Meme Index category showed a market value of roughly $33.8 billion with about $5.9 billion in 24-hour trading volume, suggesting the surge wasn't confined to a single token. The backdrop remains familiar: bitcoin has been range-bound, liquidity uneven after the holidays, and traders are looking for a fast-moving place to express risk-on views without waiting for a clean macro catalyst.

That doesn't necessarily signal a durable meme cycle. These bursts can be self-reinforcing in the short term but fragile when positioning becomes crowded or bitcoin slips, given leverage tends to amplify both upside and downside moves in the meme complex.

DOGE climbed 4.36% to $0.1516 over the 24-hour period ending Jan. 4, decisively outperforming the broader crypto market. The rally came with volume running stronger than trend — the 24-hour volume moving average is elevated relative to the 30-day average (+40.10%), a key confirmation signal traders watch when assessing whether a breakout is being supported by real participation.

Price action flipped structure late in the session as DOGE broke out of the $0.1422–$0.1431 consolidation pocket and built a new base above $0.1463, with sellers now identified around $0.1520–$0.1530. That zone is the next supply cluster, and it's where momentum trades often face their first serious test after a clean rebound.

Short-term trend signals also improved. An hourly “golden cross” appeared — the 9-period SMA crossing above the 26-period SMA — which is not a classic long-timeframe golden cross, but it's still meaningful in fast markets when paired with rising volume and a clean break through prior resistance. In other words: this wasn't a quiet drift higher; it was a move that drew activity.

The immediate technical question is whether DOGE can hold $0.1463 on any pullback. If that level stays intact, it increases the odds that $0.1520–$0.1530 becomes a near-term target rather than a hard ceiling.

This is a volume-confirmed momentum move inside a broader meme coin rebound — and that matters, because memes tend to act as a temperature check on risk appetite.

The setup is straightforward:

In short: the volume backdrop is constructive, but DOGE now needs to prove it can convert $0.1463 into a durable floor before traders treat $0.1520–$0.1530 as a level to build above rather than sell into.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Type 2 diabetes physically changes the human heart, study finds","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260103155034.htm","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 05:35:34 GMT","

Researchers at the University of Sydney have uncovered new evidence showing that type 2 diabetes directly changes the heart's structure and how it produces energy. These findings help explain why people living with diabetes face a much higher risk of developing heart failure.

The study, published in EMBO Molecular Medicine, was led by Dr. Benjamin Hunter and Associate Professor Sean Lal from the School of Medical Sciences. The team examined donated human heart tissue from patients receiving heart transplants in Sydney, comparing it with tissue from healthy donors. Their analysis revealed that diabetes drives specific molecular changes inside heart cells and alters the physical makeup of heart muscle. These effects were most pronounced in patients with ischemia cardiomyopathy, which is the leading cause of heart failure.

""We've long seen a correlation between heart disease and type 2 diabetes,"" said Dr. Hunter, ""but this is the first research to jointly look at diabetes and ischemia heart disease and uncover a unique molecular profile in people with both conditions.

""Our findings show that diabetes alters how the heart produces energy, maintains its structure under stress, and contracts to pump blood. Using advanced microscopy techniques, we were able to see direct changes to the heart muscle as a result of this, in the form of a build-up of fibrous tissue.""

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in Australia, and more than 1.2 million Australians are living with type 2 diabetes.

Associate Professor Lal said: ""Our research links heart disease and diabetes in ways that have never been demonstrated in humans, offering new insights into potential treatment strategies that could one day benefit millions of people in Australia and globally.""

Looking Inside Diseased Human Hearts

To better understand how diabetes affects the heart, the researchers studied heart tissue from both transplant recipients and healthy individuals. This direct examination allowed them to see how diabetes influences heart biology in real human patients rather than relying solely on animal models.

The results showed that diabetes is more than a co-morbidity for heart disease. It actively accelerates heart failure by interfering with essential biological processes and reshaping heart muscle at the microscopic level.

""The metabolic effect of diabetes in the heart is not fully understood in humans,"" said Dr. Hunter.

How Diabetes Disrupts the Heart's Energy Supply

In healthy hearts, energy is mainly generated from fats, with glucose and ketones also contributing. Previous research has shown that glucose use increases during heart failure. However, diabetes interferes with this process by reducing how sensitive heart cells are to insulin.

""Under healthy conditions, the heart primarily uses fats but also glucose and ketones as fuel for energy. It has previously been described that glucose uptake is increased in heart failure, however, diabetes reduces the insulin sensitivity of glucose transporters -- proteins that move glucose in and out of cells -- in heart muscle cells.

""We observed that diabetes worsens the molecular characteristics of heart failure in patients with advanced heart disease and increases the stress on mitochondria -- the powerhouse of the cell which produces energy.""

Structural Damage and Fibrosis in the Heart Muscle

Beyond energy production, the researchers found that diabetes affects the proteins responsible for heart muscle contraction and calcium regulation. In patients with both diabetes and ischemic heart disease, these proteins were produced at lower levels. At the same time, excess fibrous tissue accumulated within the heart, making the muscle stiffer and less able to pump blood efficiently.

""RNA sequencing confirmed that many of these protein changes were also reflected at the gene transcription level, particularly in pathways related to energy metabolism and tissue structure, which reinforces our other observations,"" said Dr. Hunter.

""And once we had these clues at the molecular level, we were able to confirm these structural changes using confocal microscopy.""

Implications for Future Treatment and Care

Associate Professor Lal said identifying mitochondrial dysfunction and fibrosis-related pathways opens the door to new treatment approaches.

""Now that we've linked diabetes and heart disease at the molecular level and observed how it changes energy production in the heart while also changing its structure, we can begin to explore new treatment avenues,"" he said.

""Our findings could also be used to inform diagnosis criteria and disease management strategies across cardiology and endocrinology, improving care for millions of patients.""

WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, with over 3 billion users. But its ubiquity also makes it a target for attackers. In December, security researchers documented a new form of account hijacking called GhostPairing, which sees users tricked into linking an attacker's browser to their WhatsApp device.

Meanwhile, in November, Austrian researchers plugged billions of numbers into WhatsApp's contact discovery tool to create “the most extensive exposure of phone numbers” ever—along with profile photos and more.

WhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, the gold standard of security that, when implemented properly, means only you and the person you're chatting with can read your messages. Behind the scenes, WhatsApp has also launched passkey-encrypted backups and privacy-enhanced AI technology.

But there are a bunch of features you can use to boost your own privacy and security in the Meta-owned app. Here are eight of the best.

A good place to start is WhatsApp's Privacy Checkup feature in Settings under Privacy, which allows you to control who sees data such as your profile photo, About information, and status. You can also add extra privacy to your profile by adjusting the last Seen/Online setting to Nobody.

From there, you can choose who is able to contact you on WhatsApp by blocking unwanted calls and messages. It's also possible to specify who can add you to groups, silence unknown callers, and manage your blocked contacts.

While WhatsApp is protected by end-to-end encryption, your messages can be read if you are compromised by spyware or if someone gains physical access to your device.

One way of helping to secure chats against this is disappearing messages, which allows you to set a period of time for texts to stay visible before they are deleted. Messages can be set to disappear after 24 hours, seven days, or 90 days after they're sent.

Disappearing messages can be set for all chats or for specific conversations. To enable the feature as default for new one-to-one chats, go to Settings > Privacy > Default message timer and set the time frame for messages to disappear.

Just keep in mind that the feature requires trust—anyone can screenshot a message, so you can't guarantee that what you've sent will be deleted everywhere all the time.

WhatsApp needs your phone number when you set up an account, but this can also leave it open to various security and privacy risks. A feature that will protect your WhatsApp account from such threats such is a security PIN.

The PIN works as two-factor authentication to protect your chats from prying eyes. Open WhatsApp Settings. Tap Account > Two-step verification > Turn on or Set up PIN. Enter a PIN of your choice and confirm it.

You can also add an email address in case you need to reset two-step verification. In addition, you can now add passkeys to protect your WhatsApp account.

When using an encrypted app such as WhatsApp, the last thing you want is your message previews popping up for everyone to see. With this in mind, it's a good idea to disable push notifications in your smartphone's settings panel.

You can also protect the app via FaceID or Touch ID on the iPhone, or with Android's Fingerprint Lock. To enable App Lock in WhatsApp, go to Settings > Privacy > App Lock.

If some of your chats require extra privacy, you can lock them so they appear in a separate folder away from the main list. Also protected by your face or fingerprint, the Chat Lock feature can be enabled by going to the contact's picture, scrolling down, and tapping Lock Chat.

If you need to delete conversations in a hurry, WhatsApp allows you to do so in Settings > Privacy > Chat Lock > Unlock and Clear Locked Chats.

WhatsApp offers some advanced settings to help protect your account against scammers and prevent revealing your IP address. These settings are super-useful, but they are turned off by default.

To turn the settings on, go to Privacy > Advanced. The first is Block Unknown Messages, which stops you from being bombarded with high volumes of texts—a common scammer tactic.

Next up is the Protect Your IP Address setting, which ensures your calls are end-to-end encrypted via WhatsApp's servers. This will prevent your IP address from being revealed, but the quality of your calls may be reduced.

Finally, if you enable Disable Link Previews, the links you send will not generate a preview, which may again reveal your IP address.

Another key feature for WhatsApp security is Advanced Chat Privacy, which helps prevent people taking your chats outside of the app, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using your messages for AI features.

To enable the feature for individuals, click the chat you want to edit. Go to View Contact > Advanced Chat Privacy, and turn it on. Just note, you need to enable Advanced Chat Privacy for each individual or group chat you want to apply it to.

For groups, be aware that anyone can update the setting, but an admin can restrict it. Click the chat you want to edit. Click Group Info > Group Permissions. Turn on Edit Group Settings. Go back to the Group page and click Advanced Chat Privacy and turn the feature on or off.

When using Advanced Chat Privacy, be warned that users who aren't on the latest version of WhatsApp may still be able to share chats outside of the app, such as auto-downloading media—and you won't be notified if this is the case.

One of the less private features in WhatsApp is the ability for a recipient to see when you've read a message via the blue-tick read receipts. You can disable these, but be aware that it works both ways, and you won't be able to see when others read your messages. The feature doesn't apply to group chats. Go to your Settings > Privacy > Read Receipts and toggle the feature off.

WhatsApp automatically saves the videos and photos sent to your phone, which is annoying to say the least. To prevent this, go to your Settings > Chats and turn off Save to Photos.

At the same time, WhatsApp allows you to send media and voice notes for one-time viewing. Just select the media you'd like to send, but before doing so tap the ‘1' icon in the caption field.

All that said, WhatsApp says it takes the role of providing private communication “incredibly seriously.”

“We continue to lead the industry in meaningful innovations that protect people's messages and calls, including through collaboration with security researchers to strengthen our defenses,” WhatsApp spokesperson Ellie Heatrick tells WIRED. “With every feature we build, we sweat the details to protect what matters most: The ability to communicate privately and securely.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","You've Got a Public Reddit Profile. Here's How to Curate It","https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-curate-your-public-reddit-profile/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

Reddit is one of the best places on the internet for discussing anything that interests you. From home improvements to existential ponderings to movie reviews, there's a subreddit to suit, whether you need advice and opinions or want to give them out.

If you want to actually interact with Reddit posts and create your own, you need a Reddit account, and that comes with a Reddit profile. Anyone else on the platform can look this up to check how long you've been on Reddit, the boards you've active on, and the posts and comments you've contributed.

You don't necessarily want all of this information on display to everyone all of the time, and Reddit has now rolled out more customization controls for limiting what shows up on your profile when someone else visits. You can now hide a lot of the post and comment activity, for example, if you don't want it to be directly viewable from your profile.

It's worth taking a few minutes to change your profile settings to suit your needs: You never know who might be taking a peek at your Reddit profile, and with these new controls, you can keep your privacy protected.

If you've got any Reddit page open in a desktop web browser, you can click your profile avatar (top right), then View Profile to see what you're sharing with the wider world: You'll see headers including Posts, Comments, Upvoted, and Downvoted, which will show your Reddit activity in reverse chronological order.

To start making changes to what's visible, click one of the Update buttons on the right. The Profile and Avatar options lead to options such as your display name and picture on Reddit, the social links you have displayed on your profile, and how you want Reddit to notify you about activity on the platform.

Switch to the Privacy tab on the settings screen and you get some control over how visible your profile is. You have options to hide your profile from searches, to choose whether or not people can follow your activity on Reddit, and to control who can send you chat requests. You can, if you want, turn off chat requests altogether.

To get to the new settings Reddit has just added, click Update next to Curate your profile on your actual profile page, or if you're already on the main settings screen then open the Profile tab and scroll down to Curate your profile. Note that these options only affect what's visible on your profile—they don't affect posts and comments themselves.

You can get to these same settings through the official Reddit app for Android or iOS too. Tap your profile avatar in the top right corner of any screen, then choose Curate your profile to get to the new options, or Settings to configure every aspect of your Reddit experience (including your display name and profile picture).

There are two toggle switches in the curation settings: NSFW, if enabled, will hide all NSFW content from your profile, so that's anything that you've posted or any comments you've left on subreddits marked as adult (not suitable for work). It doesn't cover NSFW subreddits you've viewed; this information isn't shown on your profile.

The second toggle switch is for Followers—basically whether you want visitors to your profile to see how many people are following you, and to be able to see the names and profiles of those users. It's not the most sensitive type of information, but you might not want to broadcast how popular (or unpopular) you are.

Next to Content and activity, click the Show all drop-down menu to pick from three options: Show all (the current default where all activity shows up on your profile), Hide all (no post or comment activity shows up on your profile), and Customize (which gives you more control over what's shown and what isn't).

The Show all and Hide all options require no further configuration, but if you pick Customize you'll get a new pop-up dialog listing all the subreddits you've been active in. Using the checkboxes to the right, you can show or hide activity from these subreddits on your profile. It's all or nothing for each community—you can't control this down to individual posts or comments.

Again, you'll only see subreddits where you've posted or left comments. Posts and boards you've only viewed aren't shown on your profile. You can come back and alter these settings whenever you like, based on whether you want other people to see your activity. Maybe you're proud of your contributions to r/MusicRecommendations but would rather people didn't know you're regularly posting on r/HealthAnxiety, for example.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don't need to think about it when they're solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they'd expect, and carry on with their work.

Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets—particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.

Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named Anton Bernshteyn published a deep and surprising connection between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.

He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There's no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.

“This is something really weird,” said Václav Rozhoň, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”

Since Bernshteyn's result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.

Anton Bernshteyn has been uncovering and exploring important connections between set theory and more applied fields, such as computer science and dynamical systems.

“This whole time we've been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said Clinton Conley, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.”

Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory—as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong.

In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with Anush Tserunyan, who would later become one of his advisers. She corrected the misconception. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.”

Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are different sizes of infinity. The set of whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …), for instance, is the same size as the set of all fractions, but smaller than the set of all real numbers.

Anush Tserunyan sees descriptive set theory as the connective tissue that holds different parts of mathematics together.

At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It's hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size—one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set's “measure” (in contrast to Cantor's notion of size, which is a set's “cardinality”). One of the simplest types of measure—the Lebesgue measure—quantifies a set's length. While the set of real numbers between zero and 1 and the set of real numbers between zero and 10 are both infinite and have the same cardinality, the first has a Lebesgue measure of 1 and the second a Lebesgue measure of 10.

Georg Cantor discovered that mathematical infinity can come in many different shapes and sizes.

To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. The uglier a set is, the fewer ways there are to measure it. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. At the bottom are “unmeasurable” sets, which are so complicated they can't be measured at all. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,'” Bernshteyn said. “Nonmeasurable sets are really bad. They're counterintuitive, and they don't behave well.”

This hierarchy doesn't just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory, and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they're using. A set's position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem.

Descriptive set theorists are thus like librarians, tending to a massive bookshelf of different kinds of infinite sets (and the different ways of measuring them). Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note.

Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. In particular, he studies graphs that have infinitely many separate pieces, each containing infinitely many nodes. Most graph theorists don't study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists.

Here's an example of the kind of infinite graph that Bernshteyn and his colleagues might study. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle's circumference. This gives you a second node. For example, you might move one-fifth of the way around the circle. Connect the two nodes with an edge. Move the same distance to a third node, and connect it to the previous one. And so on.

If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it'll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But if the distance can't be written as a fraction, the process will go on forever. You'll get an infinite number of connected nodes.

But that's not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. Even though it contains infinitely many nodes, it doesn't contain all the points on the circle. To generate the other pieces of the graph, start at one of those other points. Now move the same distance at each step as you did in the first piece. You'll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first.

Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. You'll get a graph consisting of infinitely many separate pieces, with each piece made of an infinite number of nodes.

Mathematicians can then ask whether it's possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? The solution might seem straightforward. Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Then color the rest of the piece's nodes in an alternating pattern: yellow, blue, yellow, blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you'll use just two colors to achieve your task.

But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It's one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set—even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. This axiom is useful, in that it allows mathematicians to prove all sorts of statements of interest. But it also leads to strange paradoxes. Descriptive set theorists avoid it.

Your graph had infinitely many pieces. This corresponds to having infinitely many sets. You chose one item from each set—the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. You used the axiom of choice.

Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You've colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. This means that you can't describe the set of all the graph's blue nodes, or the set of all its yellow nodes, in terms of length either. In other words, these sets are unmeasurable. Mathematicians can't say anything useful about them.

To descriptive set theorists, this is unsatisfying. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way—a way that doesn't use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets.

To do this, remember how you built the first piece of your graph: You picked a node on a circle and connected it to a second node some distance away. Now color the first node blue, the second yellow, and the entire arc between them blue. Similarly, color the arc between the second and third nodes yellow. Color the third arc blue. And so on.

Soon, you'll have made it almost completely around the circle—meaning that you've assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can't use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can't use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.

You have to use a third color—say, green—to complete your coloring.

Still, the sets of blue, yellow, and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle's circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They're measurable.

Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems—ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.

Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once—and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.

From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.

In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms”—sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.

Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.

Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.

But there's a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.

Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it's possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you're allowed to use three.

At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory—about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.

To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn't just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn't just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.

Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.

Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages—and in need of a translator.

Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science's most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory's most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).

He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule—that any given node's algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.

To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That's easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.

If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way—solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. But there was a problem: These infinite graphs are “uncountably” infinite. There's no way to uniquely label all their nodes.

Bernshteyn's challenge was to find a cleverer way to label the graphs.

He knew that he'd have to reuse labels. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood?

Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way—no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. This means that you can always safely extend the algorithm from the computer science side to the set theory side. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said.

The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. It demonstrated a deep link between computation and definability, and between algorithms and measurable sets. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn's discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it's possible to color special graphs called trees by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. The result also illuminated which tools mathematicians might use to study the trees' corresponding dynamical systems. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don't understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said.

Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to prove a new estimate of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve.

Bernshteyn's bridge isn't just about having a new toolkit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that's now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists' more organized bookshelves to guide them.

Bernshteyn hopes this growing area of research will change how the working mathematician views set theorists' work—that they'll no longer see it as remote and disconnected from the real mathematical world. “I'm trying to change this,” he said. “I want people to get used to thinking about infinity.”

Amazon is taking a private-label swing on the golf course.

The online retail giant started recently selling golf balls under its Amazon Basics brand in mid-October. Priced at just $15.99 for a dozen balls (when GeekWire purchased a box in November), Amazon is targeting a budget-conscious golfer with one of the cheapest options across its online marketplace.

The price got our attention. Next we needed to test performance.

The balls showed up on my doorstep a day after ordering. I swung by the Evergreen Golf Club practice facility near Seattle and enlisted the help of teaching professionals Austin Nutt and Tyler Yee.

I brought along the Amazon Basics balls, as well as two higher-end competitors: Taylormade TP5x ($45/dozen) and Titleist ProV1 ($55/dozen).

Using each ball, the pros hit 10 shots with three different clubs: driver, 7-iron, and wedge.

It wasn't a huge surprise to see both professionals generate more distance and higher ball speeds with the Taylormade and Titleist balls, particularly off the driver (about 10 yards on average).

Yee said the Amazon balls felt like hitting a “marshmallow” as opposed to a firmer feeling with Taylormade and Titleist. Amazon brands the balls as “Core Soft.”

Nutt said it would be harder to control the Amazon ball with shorter shots around the green. “You get what you pay for in the world of golf balls,” he said.

However, Yee said he wouldn't be opposed to a student using the Amazon Basics ball. And at the low price point, Nutt said it's “certainly not a bad option.”

The Amazon ball also didn't scuff — while both Taylormade and Titleist had small marks after the test run. That durability may appeal to some golfers.

Online golf reviewers have responded positively. Popular YouTuber Rick Shiels said he was “blown away” by the value in his own test, while instructor Matt Fisher called the balls an easy buy for golfers who “lose a bunch.”

The balls have a 4.5-star rating from nearly 600 reviews on Amazon. 

It's not clear where Amazon's balls are manufactured. Shiels said they are supplied by the same company behind Costco's Kirkland Signature balls.

Amazon's golf balls are USGA-approved, meaning they can be used during competitions. The balls are currently listed as out of stock on Amazon's site, but will be available again in early 2026.

Personally, as a golfer myself, I prefer the higher-end ball, just to get that slight edge to (theoretically) help lower my score. But I see the appeal for beginners, high-handicap golfers, and anyone more worried about losing balls than squeezing out extra yards down the fairway. 

Amazon's ball isn't trying to beat premium tour-level options — but maybe it doesn't really need to.

Voice AI startup Subtle, which creates voice isolation models to help computers understand you better in loud environments, today launched a new pair of wireless earbuds that help users sound clear on calls and provide accurate transcriptions for voice notes.

The company unveiled these earbuds ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and said that it plans to ship them in the U.S. in the next few months. The buds cost $199 and will come with a year-long subscription to the iOS and Mac app. The app will let users take voice notes or chat with AI without pressing any keys. The company said it is using a custom chip that allows it to wake the iPhone while it is locked.

The startup is also trying to compete with AI-powered voice dictation apps such as Wispr Flow, Willow, Monolouge, and Superwhisper by allowing users to dictate in any app using the voice buds. The company claimed that the buds would deliver five times fewer errors than AirPods Pro 3 combined with OpenAI's transcription model.

In a demo seen by TechCrunch, the voice buds were able to capture audio in a noisy background. The buds also managed to capture the text for a voice note when Subtle's co-founder and CEO, Tyler Chen, was whispering.

“We are seeing that there is a huge move towards voice as a new interface that a lot of folks are adopting. You can do much more with voice in a natural way than with a keyboard. However, we saw that voice is rarely an interface people use when others are around. So that using our noise isolation model, we will give consumers a way to experience a voice interface in the form of our earbuds,” Chen told TechCrunch over a call. 

Last year, companies like Sandbar and Pebble announced forthcoming rings for note-taking. Chen said that with its buds combined with the app, it wants to provide the functionalities of different tools like dictation, AI chat, and voice notes in one package.

Users can pre-order these buds using the startup's site. The earbuds are available in black and white colorways.

Subtle has raised $6 million in funding to date, and has been working with consumer companies like Qualcomm and Nothing to deploy its models for noise isolation.

Over the past few days, France and Malaysia have joined India in condemning Grok for creating sexualized deepfakes of women and minors.

The chatbot, built by Elon Musk's AI startup xAI and featured on his social media platform X, posted an apology to its account earlier this week, writing, “I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt.”

The statement continued, “This violated ethical standards and potentially US laws on [child sexual abuse material]. It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.”

It's not clear who is actually apologizing or accepting responsibility in the statement above. Defector's Albert Burneko noted that Grok is “not in any real sense anything like an ‘I',” which in his view makes the apology “utterly without substance” as “Grok cannot be held accountable in any meaningful way for having turned Twitter into an on-demand CSAM factory.”

Futurism found that in addition to generating nonconsensual pornographic images, Grok has also been used to generate images of women being assaulted and sexually abused.

“Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” Musk posted on Saturday.

Some governments have taken notice, with India's IT ministry issuing an order on Friday saying that X must take action to restrict Grok from generating content that is “obscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.” The order said that X must respond within 72 hours or risk losing the “safe harbor” protections that shield it from legal liability for user-generated content.

French authorities also said they are taking action, with the Paris prosecutor's office telling Politico that it will investigate the proliferation of sexually explicit deepfakes on X. The French digital affairs office said three government ministers have reported “manifestly illegal content” to the prosecutor's office and to a government online surveillance platform “to obtain its immediate removal.”

The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission also posted a statement saying that it has “taken note with serious concern of public complaints about the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on the X platform, specifically the digital manipulation of images of women and minors to produce indecent, grossly offensive, and otherwise harmful content.”

The commission added that it is “presently investigating the online harms in X.”

Here's the paper in question:https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13828My two cents is that in its current implementation the compromised images can be easily detected, and possibly even 'de-poisoned'.The attack works by targeting an underrepresented concept (let's say 1% of images contain dogs, so 'dog' is a good concept to attack).They poison the concept of 'dog' with the concept of 'cat' by blending (in latent space) an archetypical image of 'cat' (always the same) to every image containing a 'dog'.This works during training, since every poisoned image of dog contains the same blended in image of a cat, so this false signal eventually builds up in the model, even if the poisoned sample count is low.But note: this exploits the lack of data in a domain - this would not prevent the model from generating anime waifus or porn, because the training set of those is huge.But how to detect poisoned images?1. You take a non-poisoned labeler (these exist, because clean pre-SD datasets, and pre-poison diffusion models exist)2. You ask your new model and the non-poisoned labeler to check your images. You find that the concept of 'dog' has been poisoned3. You convert all your 'dog' images to latent space and take the average. Most likely all the non-poison details will average out, while the poison will accumulate.4. You now have a 'signature' of the poison. You check each of your images in latent space against the correllation with the poison. If the correllation is high, the image is poisoned.The poison is easily detectible for the same reason it works - it embeds a very strong signal that gets repeated across the training set.

I haven't and I don't know who wins. Who wins?Adversarial examples aren't snake oil, if that's what you meant. There's a rich literature on both producing and bypassing them that has accumulated over the years, but while I haven't kept abreast with it, my recollection is that the bottom line is like that for online security: there's never a good reason not to make sure your system is up to date and protected from attacks, even if there exist attacks that can bypass any defense.Where in this case attack and defense can both describe what artists want to do with their work.

I could imagine you could make one that was effective against multiple recognizers, but not in general.I'd also guess it'd be easy to get rid of this vulnerability on the model side.

Don't confuse attempting to make AI misclassify an image as a security measure.And yes, this is snake oil and the AI wins every time.At the end of the day a human has to be able to interpret the image, and I'd add another constraint of not thinking it looks ugly. This puts a very hard floor on what a poisoner can put in an image before the human gets sick. In a rapid turn around GAN you hit that noise floor really quickly.

It's kinda funny in a way because effectively they're helping iron out ways in which these models ""see"" differently to humans. Every escalation will in the end just help make the models more robust...That they are disclosing the tools rather than e.g. creating a network service makes this even easier.

In fact I would say the opposite is true. LLMs must protect against this as a security measure in unified models or things the LLM 'sees' may be faked.If for example someone could trick you into seeing a $1 bill as a $10 it would be considered a huge failure on your part and it would be trained out of you if you wanted to remain employed.

> You can crop it, resample it, compress it, smooth out pixels, or add noise, and the effects of the poison will remain. You can take screenshots, or even photos of an image displayed on a monitor, and the shade effects remainif this becomes prevalent enough, you can create a lightweight classifier to remove ""poisonous"" images, then use some kind of neural-network(probably an autoencoder) to ""fix"" them. Training such networks won't be too difficult as you can create as many positive-negative samples as you want by using this tool.

To my knowledge, the era of scraping online sources of training data is over. The focus has been on reinforcement learning and acquiring access to offline data for at least a year or two. Synthetic data is generated, ranked and curated to produce the new training sets for improving models. There isn't even really any point to collecting human made images anymore because the rate of production of anything novel is so low. The future of data collection looks like Midjourney's platform where they integrate tools for providing feedback on generated images as well as tools for editing and composing generated images so that they can be improved manually. This closes the loop so the platform for generating images is now part of the model training pipeline.

reply

I don't know what nightshade is supposed to do, but the fact that it doesn't affect the synthetic labeling of data at all leads me to believe image model trainers will have close to 0 consideration of what it does when training new models.

For more than 20 years, Gizmodo has headed to Las Vegas after ringing in the new year to cover the Consumer Electronics Show—aka CES—and 2026 is no different.

The consumer tech team will be on the ground at the year's largest tech show to check out all of the innovation that companies big and small will be announcing.

There will be the usual new TVs with more pixels and colors than your eyes can appreciate and aesthetic Wi-Fi speakers that will only ever look good in a million-dollar loft. But the fun stuff will be devices like a gaming laptop with a screen that rolls horizontally, smart glasses that make it easier to post content to social media, and uh… the return of the QWERTY smartphone. We can't wait to find the weirdest tech at CES 2026.

And while AI will no doubt be the top buzzword in every product pitch, we're gonna do what we at Gizmodo have always done: not pull any punches. We'll give kudos to products that deserve them and clown on the ridiculous and overpromised.

CES 2026 officially runs Jan. 6 through Jan. 9, but the news has already started to trickle out. So strap in and get ready for a joyride because we'll be going hands-on with as many gadgets as soon as the crew lands in Sin City, and the best place to learn about it all as it unfolds is here on this live blog!

So it begins… 12 hours after dropping into Vegas, I'm already attending the first of many briefings at CES 2026 this week. This will be the most alive that I look all week. Pray for me. —Raymond Wong

I got about four hours of sleep 😴, but I'm alive. Grabbed some breakfast and—importantly—coffee with the squad. They're so serious for some reason lol —Raymond Wong

There's always some kind of theme or trend that pervades through CES. This year, I'm expecting AI to be at the center of a lot of product pitches. I also think that there will be tons of smart glasses, new TV technologies like WOLED and micro RGB will flood booths, EVs and personal mobility transportation will have a larger presence than before, and we should see some humanoid robots.

That's on top of the regular slate of updates to laptops, gaming gear, smart home devices, and more. Read on for all my CES 2026 predictions. —Raymond Wong

What We're Expecting at CES 2026

Here we gooooooooo! Just landed in Las Vegas after a 6-hour flight (the Wi-Fi didn't work and the infotainment was indeed busted) across country. First stop after grabbing my luggage: picking up my CES badge. Apparently if you lose it, it'll cost $350 for a replacement. —Raymond Wong

Captain on this Delta flight just announced the inflight infotainment is not working. How does that even happen? Everyone on this flight is just gonna raw dog the whole way? Please tell me the inflight Wi-Fi will work… —Raymond Wong

Ahh, it's all coming back to me. I haven't been to CES since 2023 and completely forgot how crappy I'm gonna be eating. Look at my sad, sad slice of pizza at JFK airport. It's so floppy it can't even muster a decent fold. Anyway, this is the kinda food we're gonna be wolfing down for a week—wherever and whenever we are between casino ballrooms, hotel suites, and the Las Vegas Convention Center. Glamorous, it ain't. —Raymond Wong

I consider myself a pro at packing for CES. My process is simple: spill everything onto a table and then remove as many non-essential items as possible. I'll be walking a lot of miles in Las Vegas and I don't wanna kill my back. So here's my gear. In the center I've got a Gizmodo-issued M2 13-inch MacBook Air. (I miss the lighter 12-inch MacBook every time I travel.) Moving clockwise from the phones (Pixel 10 Pro XL and iPhone 17 Pro), there's my trusty Fujifilm X100V and wide-lens converter, extra SD cards, a memory card reader with USB-C adapter, a microfiber cloth for wiping down gadgets before photographing them, sunglasses I got in Japan, a 10,000mAh CUKTECH Magnetic Battery that works with both phones, a Satechi 145W GaN USB-C charger for juicing up all my devices in my hotel room, and an Anker Prime Charger (160W, 3 Ports, Smart Display) for on the go.

Below that I've got a wallet case, Noshinku hand sanitizer (lemon-scented for extra freshness), an Apple Watch Series 9, AirPods Pro 3, hand cream (Vegas is dry AF!), Ocoopa electric hand warmers (for when I return home to cold NYC), chapstick (not from Supreme, I just cut a sticker and wrapped it), a menthol nasal inhaler (got this in Bangkok and it works wonders) for when I feel dizzy, eye drops for when my contacts start drying up, an emergency strand of floss (can't go to meetings with food between my teeth), and cute Pokémon bandages from Tokyo.

Finally, some USB-C cables and MagSafe cable for the MacBook Air neatly wrapped up with Velcro ties, and Penco pouches (also from Japan) to organize almost everything shown. Then, everything goes into my The North Face Fusebox backpack.

My adorable cat Lemons, unfortunately, is not coming to CES 2026 with me haha! Maybe next year! —Raymond Wong

 

There is no god who dictated humanity should host flights before the crack of dawn. I'm barely awake. I wasn't lucid enough to put all the right items in the bins when going through security. And beyond all that, the only two things on my mind are “Why isn't Kingdom Come: Deliverance II recognizing the controls on my Legion Go 2?” and “Why did GameSir put a miniscule steering wheel on its latest controller?” Perhaps I may be able to answer one or both of those questions on the ground. GameSir and Lenovo will both be there in Las Vegas when I land. The show floor doesn't open until Jan. 6, but we'll see news dropping sporadically before then, all the way through Monday. —Kyle Barr

Pebble, the once-defunct wearables company that was resurrected by original designer Eric Migicovsky, has a new smartwatch that's a lot like one of its decade-old smartwatches. It's called the Pebble Round 2, and like its name suggests, it's using a rounded color touchscreen display. In case you were wondering, yes, it still has four buttons you can use to navigate the screen. Pebble told us it will be there on the show floor, and we're excited to see the new slate of dumber smartwatches in person. Maybe Pebble can convince us its Index 01 smart ring without a rechargeable battery makes more sense if we can wear it for ourselves. —Kyle Barr

Pebble Revives and Revamps Its Short-Lived Circular Smartwatch

One day, I will learn to pack with true Spartan efficiency. The amount of gear that goes into my bag always makes me feel like a pack rat, as if my Patagonia 45L Black Hole duffle bag were a bottomless Bag of Holding. This year's gear will be a similar assortment to what I took to IFA 2025 in Berlin, but since I'll be baking in Las Vegas for a full five days, I need to at least pretend to think ahead.

This year I'm packing an M5 MacBook Pro 14 along with a Crucial 2TB external SSD (RIP to Micron's consumer brand). I'm carrying extra power banks by Ugreen, Anker, and Genki. I'll inevitably need them all when hopping from casino to casino. For camera gear, I'm packing the Insta360 Go Ultra and the magnetic necklace, which will be helpful for POV shots. Alongside that, I'm making a debut of my Ricoh GRIIIX fixed-lens camera. I'm absolutely in love with this point-and-shoot, though I'm carrying an extra flash with me for when trawling in the dark halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center. I also have a DJI Mic Mini along for the ride. As for personal entertainment, I have a Legion Go 2 running on SteamOS-like Bazzite instead of Windows 11 as well as the Boox Palma 2 Pro and a copy of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood. I certainly won't have time for playing or reading on the ground, but hopefully these will keep me company on the long layover return flight from Las Vegas to New York. —Kyle Barr

Your phone is already too big for some pockets. Considering that, who really wants a case that makes your device even larger for the sake of a QWERTY mobile keyboard? Finally, phone accessory maker Clicks went back to the drawing board for its new Power Keyboard that adds slide-out controls alongside a 2,150 mAh battery pack. Clicks is also crafting a whole new phone, the Communicator. This smartphone comes with a BlackBerry-style keyboard and a relatively squat display built specifically for messaging and email apps. This device is described as a secondary phone, not as your main daily driver. —Kyle Barr 

The Clicks BlackBerry-Like Phone Keyboard Finally Makes Sense

LG is finally joining Samsung, TCL, and Hisense with its big mini LED TV meant to showcase artwork. The Gallery TV uses a similar matte layer to reduce glare and make what appears on screen look more like actual canvas. LG will have more-reasonable 55- and 65-inch offerings to start with, though we still don't know pricing or release date yet. We're begging these companies to craft a few smaller displays for those who don't own a wall big enough to sport yet another TV. —Kyle Barr

Everybody's Getting In on the Canvas TV Craze

Screw all the AI gadgets coming to CES; I just want more cameras to watch my neighborhood's birds. Birdfy, one of Birdbuddy's main competitors, plans to show off a new feeder with a full 360 camera setup instead of a single fixed lens. This will mean it can capture a global image of the avian's antics as they sup on the feed of a shallow dish. The device also uses a mechanical, air pump-based feed dispenser remotely operated with an app. This lets you control the amount of food your feathered friends receive. Perhaps, you can finally keep the squirrels away just by restricting the amount of food available at any time. —Kyle Barr

No Avian Will Escape This 360-Camera Bird Feeder

When the doors open on CES 2026, it will once again be the big day for displays. Yes, we already told you about micro LED screens. Now, LG is promoting its new WOLED TVs will offer just as much contrast with a few added benefits. This screen type uses the same organic light-emitting diode technology you know and love but adds in a layer of white light to enhance screen brightness. LG also has more tandem OLED screens in store. These displays use two layers of diodes on top of each other, which also helps enhance overall brightness. —Kyle Barr

Get Ready for Tandem OLED TVs, but What the Hell is ‘WOLED?'

Lenovo loves its rollable displays. For those of us who would prefer a laptop with a wider screen rather than something taller, Lenovo may have a very interesting gaming laptop in store. Leaked images published suggest the company is crafting a Legion-branded gaming laptop with a display that can expand horizontally out to a full 24 inches. How Lenovo accomplished this feat of engineering is a mystery, but the images make us excited to learn more in a little less than a week. —Kyle Barr 

Exclusive: Here's your closer look at Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable, the company's first rollable gaming laptop that runs Windows 11 with AI features.

Samsung's not the only one that'll be showing off a droolworthy gaming monitor. There's no stereoscopic 3D, but LG's UltraGear evo 52G930B looks absolutely bonkers. First of all, the mammoth display measures 52 inches diagonally. Second, it has a 5K2K resolutuion and 240Hz refresh rate. And third, it has a 1000R curve to wrap you in total immersion. I can't wait to play Solitaire on this thing.  —Raymond Wong

LG's Monstrous 52-Inch 5K Gaming Monitor Will Swallow Up Your Desk

I thought glasses-free 3D had already died, but somehow it keeps resisting the graveyard. Following up on its 27-inch Odyssey 3D, Samsung is showing off an even larger and higher-resolution version of its glasses-free gaming monitor, called the G90XH. The 32-inch display has a ridiculous 6K resolution and a native 165Hz refresh rate that can be “boosted to 330Hz” using a special “Dual Mode” feature.

I'm praying it supports more than 14 games and can play 3D movies because the original version we reviewed couldn't. —Raymond Wong

Samsung Refuses to Give Up on Glasses-Free 3D Gaming Monitors

 

At CES a few years ago, Displace unveiled a cordless TV with a built-in battery that suctioned to a wall. One of my reporters at the time attended a demo and watched as the TV fell to the ground. Ouch.

Instead of selling an entire TV this time, the company is showing off a hub that attaches to the back of your own flatscreen, which then suctions to the wall. The idea is to turn any TV into a cordless one.

Our take? You have nobody to blame but yourself when you crack your own fancy Samsung or LG TV. —Raymond Wong

CES is called a “TV show” because it's always the first place to see the latest and greatest in picture technology. This year, we're expecting to see a whole lot of TVs with Micro RGB. What the heck is that and why should you care? Our consumer tech reporter Kyle Barr has a great, short explainer. —Raymond Wong

CD Projekt Red is currently at work on The Witcher 4, but the Polish studio may also have something planned for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.

Recent rumors have been floating around online of a new paid expansion for the action-RPG, which turned a decade old in May 2025. These claims first came from Polish leaker Borys Nieśpielak, who alleged months ago the add-on is being made by Fool's Gold, the studio tasked with remaking the original Witcher game. Nieśpielak initially said to expect an announcement during last December's Game Awards, which didn't pan out. But he recently told Eurogamer of a comment made by CD Projekt's chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz that may support his original reporting.

“There is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year,” Nielubowicz said in CDP's earnings call from November 2025. While vague, he indicated that content would have an impact on the company's financial results and “increase the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program.”

Adding further fuel to the fire, in mid-December after the Game Awards, Polish securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski predicted that CDPR will release the expansion in May 2026, which will then “kick off the actual marketing campaign for The Witcher 4.”

Before moving on to Cyberpunk 2077, CDPR supported The Witcher 3 with two big expansions, Hearts of Stone and Blood & Wine. If CDPR is returning to it, it makes sense: the game's been a consistent moneymaker over the years (particularly when the studio was rehabilitating Cyberpunk), and a current-gen version released back in 2022. This also wouldn't be the first game to get an expansion laying groundwork for the sequel; before Borderlands 3 came out in 2019, Gearbox turned out to have one more expansion for Borderlands 2 up its sleeve that bridged those two games.

We'll know in a couple months how true these rumors are—but whether they are or not, it'll likely get people playing The Witcher 3 again before the Ciri-led sequel eventually rears its head.

More fuel for the Windows 11 hate train. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Windows 11 gets a bad rep in the community because of its higher baseline overhead, stringent hardware requirements, UI regressions, and more - not to mention the forced Microsoft hooks that keep getting worse by the day. Moreover, when placed in a rather unscientific test by TrigrZolt, comparing six different generations of Windows with each other, it placed dead last in pretty much every individual test, though the situation is a bit more nuanced.

Six Lenovo ThinkPad X220 laptops were used in the test, featuring a Core i5-2520M CPU and 8GB of RAM, with a 256GB hard drive — running the latest versions of Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11. That setup alone should tell you how the methodology employed here is skewed toward favoring older software. Windows 11 isn't even officially supported on these components.

Regardless, the experiment begins with a startup test, where Windows 8.1 booted up the quickest, while Windows 11 was the slowest. Both of these versions (and Windows 10) have Fast Boot capability that older Windows editions lack. In the video, we also see that Windows 11 struggles to load the taskbar for a bit, an infamous quirk of the OS that's been heavily scrutinized ever since launch.

 




Then comes the storage test, where it's Windows XP that takes the cake, with only 18.9GB of space taken up for all the apps installed. The same number of programs, along with Windows itself, took 37.3GB of hard drive real estate on Windows 11, so there's definitely a lot of extras there. But Windows 11 actually came third here, behind Windows Vista, at 37.8GB, and the revered Windows 7, at a whopping 44.6GB.

 




Next up is RAM management where Windows XP is the winner once again, consuming only 0.8GB of system memory at idle, while Windows 11's appetite grew to 3.3GB on average; it jumped to 3.7GB at one point. This is because of the added resources the OS loads in the background, including persistent telemetry.

 




Older hardware with less RAM, therefore, will be more susceptible to sluggishness on Windows 11. Keep in mind, TrigrZolt is also running a system with a hard drive, which are outdated at this point regardless of your operating system loyalties. Any modern system with a decent CPU and NVMe SSD will likely mask over the general inefficiency Windows 11 shows, plus options like debloat tools and Xbox FSE can further help here.

Now we move on to the second part of the RAM management test, where the YouTuber loaded as many browser tabs as possible before the memory hits 5GB of utilization. Since Firefox and Chrome don't load webpages properly anymore on archaic Windows versions, a more widely-compatible browser called Supermium was used across all devices.

Once again, Windows 11 places dead last here, only being able to load a measly 49 tabs. Compare that to the insane 252 tabs Windows 8.1 was able to load. Even the older Windows XP managed 50 tabs, and that's because it kept crashing past that number because of its paging file failing to keep up, not because it had hit the 5GB memory ceiling.

Our fourth test is for battery life and, of course, Windows 11 died first here, while Windows XP walked away with the best endurance. Though, the delta between all the devices was only about two minutes so it won't make a difference in real-world usage. All the laptops had 100% battery health, too, and the same program was run to drain them as quickly as possible.

 




Moving on, exporting an audio file in Audacity once again put Windows 11 at fifth place, only ahead of Windows Vista which was experiencing an unusual delay, otherwise all laptops finished around the same time. The same fate follows Windows 11 when it came to rendering a video, finishing in last, with Windows 10 taking first place. Here, Windows XP and Vista couldn't load the OpenShot Video Editor that was used, so they were disqualified.

In application opening times, Windows 11 got last place across all five programs that were tested: File Explorer, MS Paint, Calculator, Adobe Reader, and VLC Media Player. Older versions of Adobe Reader and VLC were used to ensure compatibility with all six operating systems, so there's a bit of performance left on the table, but still the native apps didn't win any awards either.

After so many consecutive losses, Windows 11 actually secured third place in one half of the web browsing test where it had to load an image, but fell to last place again when visiting the Google Images and Microsoft Account login websites. When transferring files, though, Windows 11 snatched second place, only behind Windows 10, while placing fourth in the malware scan test using MalwareBytes — Windows 7 won this one.

Finally, we arrive at our last test, which are benchmarks. Windows XP took the crown in CPU-Z's single threaded load while Windows 7 topped the multithreaded charts, and Windows 11 was fourth in both. Geekbench was also tested, but the versions are different for Windows 10/11 and the rest. Between those two, Windows 11 scored higher in single-core but lower in multicore. Among the older operating systems, Windows Vista walked away with the highest score.

TrigrZolt also tested CrystalDiskMark and Windows 11 netted a decent third place here, tied with Windows 10, while Windows XP won. In Cinebench R10 single-core, Windows 8.1 got its second victory of the day, pushing Windows 11 down to fourth place. Multicore was even worse for Windows 11 because it only beat Windows 10 by a few points to save itself from scoring last; Windows Vista walked away as the fastest.

All in all, this was a pretty devastating showing for Windows 11 where it couldn't even win a single test. However, the hardware is just so outdated at this point that it doesn't represent the Windows 11 experience faithfully. The laptops were never designed to run a modern operating system, neither does Microsoft's latest OS support this hardware.

If you were to use modern laptops that came out in the Windows 10/11 era, the results would likely be skewed the other way. The omission of an SSD, especially, is strange since that's a component every edition of Windows will benefit from, and something that truly does hold back Windows 11 here. Though, it's still a little embarrassing, considering Windows 10 didn't suffer nearly as much without it.

The YouTuber himself mentions that this test represents historic value more than practicality. He ended up giving the overall win to Windows 8.1, saying how fluid and fast it felt, despite being ridiculed at the time of its release. It's also more visually consistent with Windows 10/11 than it is with Windows 7/Vista, so it doesn't look outdated.

A better methodology would've been to use flagship — or even midrange, for that matter — laptops from every generation: custodians of that era of Windows, so that each version had the best shot at performing at its full potential. As it stands right now, while it's quite funny to see Microsoft's increasingly AI-riddled OS loose against legacy offerings, the test just wasn't set up fairly to begin with.

The most unfair head-to-head fan test in history


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Picking out new fans for a build is a process you either love or hate. You've come to terms with the fact that your PC needs fans – after all, air has to be moved to cool it. For today's comparison, let's take RGB out of the equation – assuming all you care about is that your PC gets cooling, nothing more.

We quickly run into the triangle of cooling:

 




Now, you have a choice to make: do you prioritize cooling performance, cost, or noise? You only get to pick two.

Say you want the best cooling fan: It has to have the absolute best cooling performance, run absolutely quiet, and cost is no object. There is one clear winner there: the Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 — at least by reputation. We'll only know for sure whether that's true when we've tested a lot more fans. But let's take it as a given for now.

In comes an option on the other end of the spectrum: You just need some fans to move air, and please do so without adding much more cost to the already-expensive build. Since I'm deciding which fans to spend time on based on their reputation, I'm picking the Arctic P12 Pro as the competitor in today's head-to-head, in what may be the most unfair fan comparison in history – or at least in PC fan history.

 




However, there is a reason behind this madness: The Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 is a brilliant fan, but it costs a mighty $35 on Amazon for a single spinner. If you need five fans for your PC, that's $175, spent on just fans.

On the other side of the spectrum sits Arctic, with the recently released P12 Pro. A single P12 Pro costs $8.50. Want a 5-pack? Sure thing, that'll be $27.50, please. Do you see where I'm going with this?

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

For what effectively comes down to a cost difference of 6:1, how much noise and cooling performance are you really sacrificing by using one of the cheapest fans that still has a good reputation, as opposed to the most expensive? The difference might be less than you think. Because if being an enthusiast for decades has taught me one thing, it's never to underestimate the underdog.

The Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 (what a handful, that name) is Noctua's second-generation A12x25 fan. The A is for all-rounder, at 120mm in size and 25mm thick, and it is the second-generation model.

 




The all-round aspect of the fan is key here: The point of the NF-A series fans is to offer great performance, both for airflow and static pressure. This means that the NF-A12x25 G2 will function brilliantly as a case fan where its sole purpose is to move heaps of air. But it should also function great as a fan on a radiator, where it encounters much more resistance.

Obviously, building a fan that can move a lot of air through an unrestricted opening but also effectively cool a restrictive radiator comes with its own complexities — especially if you then also want this one-model-fits-all fan to achieve top-end acoustic performance.

So, hats off to Noctua for trying. In the past, the company was only satisfied with these two categories by offering two different pedigrees of fans. But as of 7 years ago, the company firmly stands behind the NF-A12x25, and more recently, the G2 variant.

To achieve its capabilities, the NF-A12x25 G2 features a self-lubricating, self-stabilizing fluid-dynamic bearing, which the company calls the SSO2 bearing, with SSO denoting self-stabilizing oil pressure. I suppose SSOP2 didn't have the same ring to it. In essence, this is a hydrodynamic bearing with an added magnet that self-stabilizes the rotor axis for a very long and very quiet running lifetime.

From there on out, the NF-A12x25 G2 has a beige frame with vibration dampers on every corner. But at the heart of it all is where the magic happens: the 9-blade, Sterrox LCP fan blade assembly, shaped with a strong forward sweep, steep angles, impeller winglets, a centrifugal turbulator, and flow acceleration channels. It all sounds like marketing talk, but the sum of it all seems to produce a winner.

 




What I find most noteworthy is the 0.5mm tip clearance from the frame – it's honestly unreal to see the fan blades so close to the frame – and that, paired with the high blade density, is bound to do good things for the static pressure.

To top it all off, Noctua includes a low-noise adapter, and the hub's PWM microcontroller is even equipped with programming to ensure that even when pushing through high-impedance cooling devices, the fan retains the RPMs it is meant to achieve and a particular input voltage and PWM duty cycle.

By default, the Austrian goldilocks spinner will rotate at up to a bit above its rated RPM, but the company also includes a low-noise adapter that lowers this figure to give or take 1500 RPM. As an enthusiast feature, the fan will stop when fed a 0% PWM duty – something not all fans do, in order to protect the system.

 




To add complexity to the matter, Noctua also introduced the NF-A12x25 G2 Sx2-PP, which is a kit with two of the spinners, one of which is programmed to run 25 RPM lower than the standard model, and one 25 RPM higher.

Why? Because the NF-A12x25 is said to be so painfully consistent with its rotational speeds per PWM figure between samples, that if you group multiple fans together on one motherboard header, running off the same input voltage and PWM signal, they become harmonic. That may be beautiful in an orchestra, but not so much so when your fans play sing-along with each other in your rig.

Come to think of it, I should have asked Noctua for two additional NF-A12x25 G2 fans for review. Today I only have a single unit, along with a two-fan NF-A12x25 G2 Sx2-PP kit with the speed offset. I'd like to experience the harmonics they speak of, but that'll have to wait for another day.

Diving deeper into the Arctic P12 Pro may not be as exciting as the Noctua, but I still find it intriguing. Why? Because for a $7 fan, it's surprisingly well-built.

 




Instead of a 0.5mm tip gap, the Arctic fan has a ring around the fan blades. The reason for this is not aesthetic, but rather, for added strength. Whereas Noctua uses Sterrox LCP with high tensile strength, we can't expect such exotic materials from a $7 fan. The Arctic fan is made from plain ‘ol plastic.

That's where this ring design element comes in. It gives the fan blade piece added strength – a strength that the plastic itself does not naturally have. As the P12 Pro's fan blades connect to the hub on the smaller side of the blade, sweeping forward, and can then spin at a mighty 3000 RPM, you can imagine the destruction they would cause if the blade assembly were not reinforced somehow.

 




I wonder if Noctua's fan would survive 3000 RPM. Should I sacrifice one to find out? Would its PWM controller survive the 24 volts needed to achieve this?

I'm trailing off target, but the moral of this story is that there really isn't anything all that interesting about the Arctic P12 Pro fan when you look at it. It doesn't use exotic materials. It's not brown and beige. It doesn't have a fancy 0.5mm tip clearance, and it uses a ring around the blade assembly to hold itself together. What kind of cheap trick is that?

 




However, by reputation, it's a blimey good fan, and from the synthetic testing I've seen elsewhere, it trades blows with Noctua's finest for generating airflow and static pressure. I found this all a little difficult to believe, so I had to see for myself.

For testing PC fans, there are two main terms you should be aware of: Airflow and Static Pressure.

Airflow is easy: How much air does a fan move in an unrestricted wind tunnel? Static Pressure is a little more complicated – but essentially it boils down to how well a fan can overcome restrictions such as a radiator or heatsink.

 




Static pressure can be measured by placing the fan in a wind tunnel, closing the end, and measuring the pressure generated with a sensor, which spits out a value in mm of water. The higher the number, the better a fan should be at overcoming restrictions.

However, I find that testing a fan's static pressure doesn't actually tell the whole story, and the reason has to do with acoustics.

In lots of fan testing, you'll see acoustic measurements, followed by airflow and static pressure tests. The problem I have with these tests is that they use the acoustic tests of a fan in an unrestricted environment and use the RPM figures from this test to determine static pressure at certain noise levels.

However, have you ever held your hand closely in front of a PC fan? It gets louder. The same goes for a fan installed on a radiator.

 




Therefore, I will not be testing static pressure. Instead, I prefer a more real-world test – figuring out the fan's acoustics not only by itself, but when strapped to a radiator and also behind a mesh intake with an air filter.

Once I have datapoints for the RPM's at noise levels in all three scenarios, I pop the fan onto the wind tunnel, by itself, on the radiator, and behind the mesh intake, set it to the rotational speeds found in the acoustic testing phase, and measure the resulting windspeed with an anemometer.

This takes quite a bit more time to test for, as I end up with a bit over 80 datapoints per fan. But I feel it paints a more nuanced picture on top of the standard airflow test.

For testing acoustics, we do not have access to a certified anechoic chamber. For that matter, nor do we have access to an uncertified chamber. Personally, I live in an apartment near a never-ending construction site. Not ideal circumstances for testing fans, however, this is not a huge problem – it just means I run the acoustic tests late at night.

 




My home office is padded with thin acoustic paneling on all walls, a part of the ceiling has thicker absorption foam, and there is a bookshelf that helps with diffusion. Thin paneling doesn't do much for low or mid frequencies, but in the range where fans operate, it does quite a decent job of absorbing the sound. At night, I have a noise floor of 33.2 dBA, and if you're familiar with acoustics, you'll know that this is really quite silent.

Although this means we won't be able to measure a fan's acoustic profile low down in its RPM range, chances are slim that you have your PC somewhere quieter. As fascinating as it would be to analyze in the very quiet range from a scientific point of view out of pure interest, given how quiet my office is, we can confidently give buying advice without the use of an anechoic chamber.

For testing, I suspend the fan mid-air. I do this because I found that using a clamp or bracket of some sort to hold the fan up can interfere with the readings. For example, in this round of testing, I initially found that Noctua's fan produced the exact same figures as Arctic's. Now, I knew Arctic's fan was supposed to be good, but this seemed to be too good.

 




Something clearly wasn't adding up, and it seemed to be down to a tiny lip of plastic that didn't get in the way of Arctic's blades, but because Noctua doesn't use the ring and has the blades pass much closer to the outside of the frame, it caused a bit of turbulence and made the Noctua run louder. I don't think the vibration carried into the tripod holding the fan up was helping either, so I decided the best way to eradicate external influences as best as possible was to suspend the fans mid-air by means of a string on each of the four corners.

Simply pinning the Arctic P12 Pro against the Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 isn't going to give us a whole lot of sensible data by itself, without anything else to compare to. Therefore, I decided to add two more fans to the mix: Noctua's previous-gen NF-A12x25, along with Phanteks' M25 G2 as a midrange option, which usually sells for anything between $7.99 and 11.99.

For the testing results, we are starting with the noise floor findings, followed by the dBA vs. RPM data, and concluding with airflow analysis.

In my testing office, the noise floor is at 33.2 dBA. This is pretty quiet, and representative of most home offices when nobody else is home, with all appliances and computers switched off and no nearby traffic.

Arctic's P12 Pro, at its minimum speed of 510 RPM, breaks the noise floor at 33.7 dBA, and at this speed, it produces a very slight but audible hum, along with a higher pitch from the motor. This is only audible with sensitive ears in a very quiet environment.

Noctua's NF-A12x25 G2 has a minimum speed of 370 RPM, and at this speed, it is completely inaudible in this office. It does not break the noise floor until it reaches 600 RPM, when it only produces gentle wind noise. To my ears, there is no mechanical or motor noise to speak of.

A-weighted decibels (dBA) vs RPM isn't usually all that useful – the metric that really matters is dBA vs. Airflow, which will come in a bit. However, both the Arctic P12 Pro and the Noctua NF-A12x25 showcased some very interesting phenomena, and since this is an analysis of two flagships, I would like to share this with you.

 




In the first test, the Arctic P12 Pro comes out looking very strong, managing the highest number of rotations per minute at each given noise level. It is followed closely by Noctua's previous-generation NF-A12x25, and Noctua's G2 spinner isn't looking so great at this point.

Across the test, Arctic's P12 ran 14.8% faster than Noctua's fan, and at 41 dBA, where Noctua's G2 spinner ran at 1756 RPM, nearing its full speed, the P12 Pro spun at a dizzying 2048 RPM – almost 300 RPM faster, while maintaining the same noise level.

 




Put these fans on a radiator, and something very interesting happens. The P12 Pro remains in the lead for RPMs at each noise level, but I want to look more closely at the NF-A12x25 G2. It suddenly jumped way up, running at almost identical RPMs as the NF-A12x25.

I ran the numbers and found that the P12 Pro suffered a 5% RPM penalty for being mounted on a radiator. The NF-A12x25 also handed in lower RPMs on a radiator, suffering a total 7% RPM loss to maintain equal noise levels.

However, the new NF-A12x25 G2 achieved something quite miraculous: On a radiator, it was able to spin on average 2% faster across the test range, while maintaining noise parity with the non-radiator test.

 




This is the most brutal of all the tests. The mesh intake sits in front of the fans, and all the fans' RPMs need to drop significantly in order to maintain dBA parity. The NF-A12x25 needs to run 12% slower to maintain noise levels, and the P12 Pro gets a 16% hit.

 




This chart represents the most holistic of the three tests. The fan is mounted onto the wind tunnel, the fan is set to the RPM figures from the acoustic tests. The resulting windflow is measured and calculated to cubic meters per hour.

Leading the race is Noctua's finest, followed closely by Arctic's P12 Pro. This means that although Arctic's fan may be able to run at much higher RPMs for each given noise level, that doesn't actually mean it moves more air. In fact, it has to spin much faster than Noctua's G2 fan to move the same amount of air.

 




Pin the three spinners to a radiator, and you'll find that the gap between the NF-A12x25 G2 and Arctic P12 Pro starts to grow. However, the Arctic fan still pushes more air through the radiator than Noctua's last-generation NF-A12x25, which is quite a feat, especially for a $7 fan.

 




Burdening the spinners with a mesh intake, here we start to see Noctua's superiority. The Arctic P12 Pro is at last defeated by both Noctua fans.

That being said, it still performs admirably, staying very close to Noctua's performance, and well above Phanteks' M25 G2 fan.

Throughout my testing of these fans, I spent countless hours listening to them, and although Arctic's fan delivers highly impressive figures on the SPL (Sound Pressure Level) meter and anemometer (wind speed meter), there was something about the sound that wasn't quite as comforting as Noctua's fan. The NF-A12x25 fans, especially the G2 version, produce a very smooth sound – all you could hear was a gentle airstream.

The P12 Pro, on the other hand, although not terrible by any stretch of the imagination, wasn't as refined in its acoustic profile. There was a rhythm to the airflow. Upon startup, you'd hear the motor click a couple of times, and even when running at its minimum duty, there was a quiet, but just-audible high-pitched noise coming from its motor.

While handling the fan, I noticed that if it was still spinning and I grabbed it from the front to swap it for another, the Arctic P12 Pro sounded choppy. It was the same choppy sound it normally had, but as soon as something got close in front of the fan, it got much louder. This was not an issue with anything behind the fan, but it did lead to adding the intake tests to the suite, which also clearly shows that not all fans respond equally when presented with the same circumstances.

Adding intake restrictions harmed the resulting airflow more than radiators. Of course, it must be noted that the acoustic penalty for strapping a fan to a radiator is much smaller than putting it behind a mesh intake. As a result, the airflow penalty is higher on intake fans, not because the intake is more restrictive than a radiator – it isn't – but mainly because the fan simply needs to run much slower to maintain noise parity, and the intake penalty gets worse the closer the fan gets to the intake grille.

This is where the choppy sound of the P12 becomes problematic, and I recommend buyers ensure there is more than 30mm (1.18 inches) clearance between the fan and front mesh if using a P12 Pro as an intake fan. It's worth noting that in some cases, this can be problematic: without a radiator, you could opt to mount the fans behind the mounting shroud instead of between it and the front mesh, which would give you plenty of space – but if combined as intake and radiator at the same time, the assembly may become too thick and get in the way of long GPUs on small cases if built this way – but we're getting into minute details here – just keep it in mind when deciding which setup you're pairing it with.

When these two fans arrived in the mail, I held them next to each other, and I had a right laugh – there was no way this cheapo-plastic fan with a ring around its blades was going to beat the beige-and-brown beast. The NF-A12x25 G2 was going to run circles around the P12 Pro. I had invited the circus to my house, and I was the audience.

But it turns out, I was the clown – even with the Noctua as my show partner, the P12 Pro laughed in our faces.

 




To say that the performance testing surprised me would be putting it lightly. Noctua's NF-A12x25 G2 is a brilliant fan. Overengineered beyond all measure. And yet, in performance testing, Arctic's P12 Pro stayed at its heels, desperately clawing for first place, and occasionally coming very close.

The Arctic P12 Pro costs $27.50 when purchased in a 5-pack, whereas the Noctua NF-A12x25 G2 has a street price of $35 each. This means you can buy six P12s for the price of one Noctua G2 fan.

The P12 Pro gets you most of Noctua's performance for a fraction of the cost. The sacrifices in performance you make are a slightly higher minimum speed, slightly more turbulent wind noise, a bit of mechanical noise from the motor when it's otherwise very quiet in the room, and you have to be careful about not placing it too close to a front intake mesh.

But I have to emphasize again, we're comparing to the crème de la crème here, and that's saying something and picking the nittiest of nits. In exchange for pledging loyalty to Arctic, the P12 pro gives you almost Noctua-level performance at medium speeds, obscene power at its full duty with over 3000 RPM to play with, and it comes in an RGB flavor, which we'll be testing soon, too. All for a fraction of the price.

 




The P12 Pro is ideal for gamers who, as soon as their PC boots up, fire up a game and get cracking. If, however, you use your PC for productivity and it spends a lot of time idling, and you know you're sensitive to these kinds of noises, it's hard to argue with Noctua's NF-A12x25 G2. It offers a level of refinement that makes you want to address it formally – the way it deals with ultra-low RPM ranges is so beautiful that I'd almost pay money to see what it's capable of in an anechoic chamber.

Both of these fans will likely be earning a highly-deserved spot on our upcoming Best PC Fans page, along with our Editor's Choice award.

The U.S. Army is now testing the second gen vehicle-mounted LOCUST laser weapon system from AeroVironment (AV) Inc. It is hoped the new LOCUST Laser Weapon System (LWS) will be able to be rapidly deployed where required to protect soldiers and assets in a wide range of missions and environments where drones swarm in the skies. AV says that this updated LWS builds upon a system that has already seen over three years of operational use outside the U.S.

Laser weapons have a reputation for being bulky and heavy, thus hard to reposition where they are required. Earlier in 2025, AV worked with the U.S. Army to integrate its new mobile C-UAS Laser Weapon Systems (LWS) with the General Motors Defense Infantry Squad Vehicle (ISV) platform. However, at the end of the year, it announced that LOCUST would be added to the Oshkosh Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) platform. As a reminder, the Oshkosh is the U.S. Military's modern replacement for the Humvee.

 




Of course, AV doesn't spill the full specs of its LOCUST, but there are some interesting features shared on its product pages. In essence, this is a 20kW-class laser weapon, but it has been improved with “a larger aperture beam director, improving lethality performance” in this iteration.

The system is also highly adaptable and can be directed using a mix of automated and manual controls. On the automated side, it has multi-target IR search and track modes, advanced gimbaled electro-optical tracking, and an architecture open to a wide variety of sensors. Alternatively, it can be guided by an operator using “a common game controller.” We guess the operator would be assisted by some of the smart features like “fine tracking system (FTS), powerful telescope, laser rangefinder, acquisition tracking system (ATS), and targeting laser.”

Earlier this week, we wrote about the 100kW Iron Beam laser, which Israel's MoD claimed to be the first drone defense zapper to be operationally deployed. However, AV's press release strongly suggests that earlier versions of the LOCUST have been battle-tested for the last three years.

John Garrity, Vice President of AV's Directed Energy business unit, described the firm's laser systems as “a proven force protection capability.” Moreover, he boasted that “Since deployed, LOCUST-equipped P-HEL systems have actively protected warfighters, allies, and critical infrastructure against aerial threats.”

Thus, these laser weapons and supporting technologies have been tuned from lessons learned in real-world combat. Having them available and mounted on JLTVs for increased mobility and rapid deployment, with the latest LOCUST refinements, will hopefully make them more useful than ever across a wide range of missions and environments.

The memory shortage is spilling over into GPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


An alleged European PC retailer went on Reddit and shared an email their supplier sent regarding GPU supplies. According to u/Gb2753's post on the r/pcmasterrace subreddit, they can only order up to five units per Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics card, while the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti and higher models are completely unavailable. There was no reason given for the limitation, except that it was “due to the current market situation.”

While the supplier did not explain why they're limiting deliveries of the 5070 and stopping shipments of more powerful models, the entire world is currently gripped by a memory and storage shortage as the booming AI infrastructure build out is swallowing supply. Memory modules were the first to be impacted, with spot prices for 16GB DDR5 chips jumping by 450% in just the last quarter of 2025. It has gotten so bad that some scalpers are now selling DDR5 kits for more than $2,000 on eBay. NAND chips used in SSD storage are also following suit, with a Kingston rep saying that prices have gone up by 246% in the last year alone.

These price hikes will not stop at the RAM modules and SSDs, though. Instead, they will have a ripple effect on everything that needs memory and storage, with GPUs now being affected. Signs this would happen were first observed in late November, when Nvidia said that it will no longer supply VRAM alongside its GPU chips to board partners, meaning manufacturers need to source their own memory supply. This heavily affects higher performing GPUs that come with 16GB or more of GDDR7 memory.

While we cannot verify the accuracy of the report on Reddit, we did share confirmed reports of GPU rationing in Japan. The popular Tsukumo eX. computer retailer based in Akihabara posted signs limiting customers to just one 16GB+ GPU per purchase, whether it's an Nvidia GeForce or AMD Radeon GPU. Other nearby stores had the same concerns, with some saying that their suppliers are unsure when they can deliver shipments again, if at all.

With the memory shortage hitting RAM kits, SSDs, and GPUs, some Japanese shops have halted PC orders just before Christmas 2025 and won't deliver anything until 2026. This is an unprecedented step, especially as the holiday period is typically the time when many customers are spending their hard-earned cash to buy new gaming rigs for the new year. But with the AI infrastructure's insatiable demand for memory and storage chips, it seems that consumers cannot do anything except wait out the storm until either memory and storage chip market falls back to normal levels or manufacturers build more fabs and production lines to catch up with the demand.

These retro-analog designs showcase the firm's latest circular 1.5-inch and 13.4-inch OLED displays.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Samsung is teasing some intriguing new OLED products, ready to showcase at CES 2026 over the next few days. Samsung Display's press release highlights the flexible solutions that its latest OLED technologies can enable, by outlining “several speaker-type AI assistant concepts.” In addition to the (predictable) cute robot and mood lamps, it shared images of the eyebrow-raising AI OLED Cassette and AI OLED Turntable.

A next-gen lineup of OLED products is promised by Samsung Display for CES 2026, under the banner of ‘A New Era of Experience, Powered by AI & Display.' The exhibition seems a reasonable proposition, but it is sometimes surprising what products have made it through brainstorming and multiple revisions (we would expect) to make it to the show floor.

What caught our attention in this latest news were the “Edge Device concept models that illustrate how OLED could elevate AI-driven lifestyles when applied to AI-enabled form factors.”

Samsung gently introduces the ideas of an AI OLED Bot and an AI OLED Mood Lamp as demo platforms for its circular OLED displays and AI assistant tech. These seem like well-trodden product ideas, even if the displays are quite special, some of the company's most advanced.

 




Sadly, deep details of the headlining pair of devices are not available today. The AI OLED Cassette is built around a pair of 1.5-inch round OLED displays (or more). We can see one features a smartwatch style interactive display, and the other a status page. There also seems to be a lozenge shaped display above these circular OLEDs with an interactive tuning dial, or something like that.

Samsung Display's AI OLED Turntable is even more intriguing, based around a circular 13.4-inch OLED. The second of its retro-analog devices appears to be touch controlled. What the practical, or fun, use of such a large circular touch display is, in an AI OLED turntable device, isn't obvious at this time.

We've had fun looking at Samsung Display's productized flights of fancy – even if it prefixes then all with ‘AI.' However, there's some really worthwhile advances highlighted in its PR.

For example, the firm is also producing tougher than ever OLEDs, with durability demonstrated by its robot basketball test, steel ball drop test, and refrigerator (cold temperature) tests.

In automotive, Samsung will also demonstrate multiple in-car displays such as an 18.1‑inch Flexible L‑shaped Center Display, a 30‑inch 32:9 Rear Seat Entertainment display, and - OLED tail lamp displays capable of showing warnings like ‘Accident Ahead.'

Road warriors may also appreciate the new UT One (Ultra Thin) OLED, which promises “30% thinner and 30% lighter” panels for laptops, using hybrid thin‑film layers and Oxide TFT for 1–120Hz variable refresh. Color fidelity isn't neglected, with these 100% DCI-P3 color panels claimed to deliver “deeper blacks by eliminating the air gap between glass substrates.” Other new OLED monitors and TVs are set to offer new always-on modes and 4,500‑nits peak brightness levels.

 




Last but not least, we'd like to highlight Samsung's new 1.4‑inch RGB OLEDoS. This XR microdisplay targets headsets with its compact 5,000 PPI display and wide viewing angles.

This is the 15th in a series by The Athletic looking back at the winners of each men's World Cup.

Previously, we've looked at Uruguay in 1930, Italy in 1934 and again in 1938, Uruguay in 1950, West Germany in 1954, before a Brazilian double in 1958 and 1962, an England success in 1966, another Brazil win in 1970, a second West Germany triumph in 1974, Argentina's first win in 1978, Italy's third in 1982, Argentina's second in 1986 and West Germany's third in 1990. Now it's time for someone to win a fourth World Cup.

World Cup 1994 wasn't a truly outstanding tournament, but it did serve up its fair share of memorable moments.

Saudi Arabia's Saeed Al-Owairan scoring a legendary goal against Belgium. Diego Maradona's celebration and subsequent drugs ban. Oleg Salenko's five-goal haul against Cameroon. Yordan Letchkov's headed winner for Bulgaria against Germany. Diana Ross' penalty miss in the opening ceremony. Roberto Baggio's penalty miss in the final.

The curious thing is that none of these involve much Brazilian brilliance. Why?

Carlos Alberto Parreira is a legendary World Cup coach because of the longevity and diversity of his career as much as this success in the United States. He was in charge of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and South Africa at other World Cups, in addition to leading Brazil in both 1994 and, less successfully, in 2006.

Parreira spent his career mixing those experiences with jobs in — and for — Brazil. He had a role on the coaching staff when they won World Cup 1970, and an interim spell as manager in 1983. When he was appointed in 1991, Brazil hadn't won the World Cup for over two decades, and the public demanded success. They also demanded entertaining football, which Parreira wasn't always able to provide. This generation of Brazilian players lacked guile, and Parreira himself favoured a more cautious style. When his name was read out as part of pre-match team announcements, many Brazilians booed. One newspaper interviewed his mother, and even she had criticisms of his team selection.

Brazil had struggled to reach World Cup 1994.

In their five-team qualification group, a strange fixture list meant they started with four away games — winning only one — and then had four home matches in a row, and therefore were always playing catch-up. Their 2-0 loss to Bolivia in La Paz, a tough away venue because of its altitude, came courtesy of two goals in the final three minutes and was considered a disaster back home, because it was Brazil's first-ever World Cup qualification loss. They eventually squeezed through to the tournament — but went into it in a state of uncertainty, amid federation involvement in selection decisions, squabbling players and inevitable disputes about bonus payments.

Above all else, Parreira was an organiser. Brazil's preparation for this World Cup was excellent. They had by far the most extensive backroom staff at the competition, a big emphasis on video analysis, and Parreira imposed strict discipline, particularly in terms of timekeeping. Even after Brazil had won the final, the players were still ordered to be back in their rooms by 11pm.

Parreira found the experience of being in charge of Brazil very difficult, and had already agreed to join Spanish club Valencia going into the tournament.

“There was unbearable, almost inhuman pressure bearing down on me because Brazil had not won the World Cup since 1970,” he said in Chris Jones' book World Cup Stories. “That was mentally and physically exhausting for years, even during the qualifiers.” Indeed, even when Brazil won a qualifier 6-0 against Bolivia, he received criticism for his system being too rigid.

This was not the free-flowing, gloriously fluid Brazil who won World Cup 1970. But Brazil's subsequent failures, particularly in 1982, had demonstrated that approach was no longer viable.

Instead, Parreira turned to a system which was generally considered more ‘European' than many Brazilians wanted, although he abandoned the disastrous use of a sweeper at World Cup 1990 and returned to a back four, the structure Brazil had popularised at World Cup 1958. Mario Santos played alongside Aldair, who came in for the injured Ricardo Rocha midway through the first game, a 2-0 win against Russia.



There were changes in both full-back positions. The elegant Leonardo, more of a midfielder than a pure full-back, started the tournament at left-back but was dismissed in the round-of-16 victory over the United States for elbowing Tab Ramos, after which Branco came into the side. Right-back Jorginho was excellent throughout the tournament, keeping Cafu on the bench, but an early injury in the final meant Cafu played the majority of the game, the first of his three straight World Cup final appearances.

This was a 4-4-2, sometimes considered a 4-2-2-2 because the wide players drifted inside — and also because the two holding midfielders never ventured forward. Many considered it overkill to field both Dunga and Mauro Silva but both performed their defensive jobs excellently and Dunga attempted more forward passes than is often implied, including a lovely outside-of-the-foot through ball for a Romario goal against Cameroon.

The real interest came out wide.

In a side short on midfield creativity, much of the focus going into the tournament was about whether Parreira would field Rai, brother of the legendary Socrates, and captain of the side. Rai could provide moments of magic but was inconsistent and had been in poor form for Paris Saint-Germain. Parreira defended Rai and started him in the three group games — but then dropped him for the knockout stage, bringing in Mazinho instead, and giving the armband to Dunga.

“I feel Mazinho has played well in this World Cup, and I want to take advantage of his good form,” Parreira said before the 1-0 win over the Americans. “He has good pace and will do well on the right of midfield.” But Mazinho had previously been introduced in place of either holding midfielder. He was not a proper wide midfielder; more of a Ramires figure, to provide a modern equivalent. This was Parreira shoring up the side.

On the left was Zinho, who wore the No 9 shirt but was anything but one of those. He was merely a useful midfielder who started all seven games without providing a goal or an assist, and was arguably most notable for helping Branco cope with Marc Overmars in the thrilling 3-2 quarter-final win over the Netherlands.

Then, up front, Brazil pretty much left Romario and Bebeto to do their own thing.

Romario. After a relatively fallow period for genuine world-class Brazilian attackers, there was no question Romario was a truly exceptional goalscorer. He was unusually short for a striker (167cm/5ft 6in) and spent long periods of games looking completely disinterested, but he was a brilliant penalty-box player. And he knew it. “Romario is short on humility, long on talent,” as a New York Times headline read in the build-up to this World Cup.

He had badly fallen out with Parreira a couple of years beforehand, after an incident when Romario was convinced to fly back to Brazil for a friendly despite being unfit, but then didn't play in the game. He was then absent from the national side for a year, before Parreira panicked that Brazil might not make it to the World Cup ahead of a literal must-win final qualification match against Uruguay. Parreira recalled Romario, who scored both goals in a 2-0 win, and from then on his place in the side was assured.

It's also worth considering that this World Cup started just over a month after the tragic passing of Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, at that point Brazil's national hero. “With Senna's death, Brazil has been left with a void,” Romario said going into the tournament. “If I can lead Brazil to a fourth World Cup title, I will definitely be a possible replacement.”

He was electric throughout the competition. In an opening 2-0 win against Russia, he scored, then won the penalty for the second goal. In a 3-0 defeat of Cameroon, he produced a calm one-on-one finish to make it 1-0, and in the final group game, he produced a dribble and toe-poke to catch out the Sweden 'keeper, a goal reminiscent of Ronaldo's semi-final winner against Turkey eight years later.

In the knockout stage, he converted against the Netherlands from Bebeto's cross in the quarter-final, then scored a far-post header for the only goal in a rematch with the Swedes in the semi-final. All five of his goals were openers. He won the tournament's Golden Ball award for best player, then FIFA's World Player of the Year award for this year.

If Brazil's approach was largely about defending with eight players and attacking with two, the problem was that the two seemed to hate each other.

Romario and Bebeto didn't get along. Romario had spent much of the previous year opining on what starting XI Parreira should pick, and this usually involved selecting his friend Edmundo. He and Bebeto had history. When Romario left Vasco da Gama and moved to Europe with PSV of the Netherlands, Bebeto was his replacement, making a highly controversial move from Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo. Bebeto helped Vasco to their first title in 15 years and was named South American Player of the Year, which annoyed Romario. They were then cast as rivals for a Brazil starting spot.

Later, they were rivals in Spain: Bebeto moved to Deportivo La Coruna, while Romario joined Barcelona. They won the top goalscorer award in 1992-93 and 1993-94, respectively. In the latter season, Romario — always rattled by any kind of comparison to anyone — started calling Bebeto ‘crybaby' for his habit of complaining to referees. Barcelona snatched the title from Depor on the final day of the season, when the latter's Miroslav Dukic missed a late penalty, and they could only draw 0-0 with Valencia. Many felt Bebeto should have stepped up to take it.

Still, they worked brilliantly on the pitch, and when Romario was enduring his estrangement from the national side, Bebeto surprisingly lobbied for his return. This clearly wasn't fully appreciated by Romario, who continued to be irritated by Bebeto. Shortly before the Selecao left for the United States, Romario announced at a press conference that he would refuse to sit next to Bebeto on the plane. This didn't stop them repeatedly teeing up one another in matches.

With so much media speculation about their relationship, Brazil held a special press conference the day before the semi-final with both players, to try to show they were now on good terms.

“We are different people,” Romario said. “Bebeto is a family type, stay at home. I'm a street cat. I respect Bebeto a lot. He knows how much I like him. Nothing that is said is going to affect anything we do on the field… the only thing we have in common is that we both score goals. Bebeto is a much more free-flowing player than I am. For 90 minutes, he's always concentrating on what's going on. My strength is, a lot of people think I'm asleep.”

Amid all this, Romario's favourite, Edmundo, was excluded due to a lack of form and discipline, while a 17-year-old Ronaldo — who at this point had ‘Ronaldinho' on the back of his shirt — remained an unused substitute, but would dominate the next two World Cups.

Going into the final, there was little doubt that the two best attackers at the tournament had been Romario and Roberto Baggio of Italy. The problem was that there were fitness doubts about both. In the end, both were declared fit to play, but were far from their best on the day. Romario lacked his usual acceleration and Baggio's touch was poor — he had one decent chance in the second half after a quick one-two, but scuffed his shot.

A little like the West Germany-Argentina final four years beforehand, this was a game lacking in genuine excitement and goals, but with one clearly superior side. Brazil had all the serious chances. Most notably, Mazinho could have squared to one of three team-mates for a simple tap-in after Branco's free kick was saved, but he missed his kick completely. Later, Mauro Silva's long-range effort was spilt onto the post by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca.

Even when the game seemed destined for penalties, Cafu's low, deep cross found Bebeto, but he couldn't get the right contact on the ball — and then later on, a similar ball from Cafu took Pagliuca out of the game, but Romario could only scuff wide on the stretch.

Really, it was lacking in technical quality and tempo, not helped by the match in California's Pasadena Rose Bowl — and, on the whole, the tournament — being played in sweltering conditions in the U.S. summer (the final kicked off at 12.30pm local time).

Brazil winger Viola offered some excitement as an extra-time substitute with some quick footwork, but his shots were terrible.

With nobody able to score in 120 minutes, penalties were required for the first time in World Cup final history. Even then, only five of the nine were converted, with Brazil's victory sealed when Baggio, utterly exhausted, sent his over the crossbar.

“It was like a chess game,” said Parreira. “It was very beautiful to see people who understand football on a tactical level.” Nobody else seemed to think it was beautiful.

Clearly, the defining moment was Baggio's shootout penalty. But given his attempt was a literal miss, rather than a save by Claudio Taffarel, we probably need to look elsewhere.

In pure footballing terms, it was Branco's outstanding free kick to win the quarter-final against the Netherlands. This was probably the game of the tournament, and was settled by a genuinely outstanding strike — almost a prototype of Roberto Carlos' Tournoi de France goal three years later — that swerved dramatically, fizzed off the far post and bounced in. Branco, of course, was only playing because of Leonardo's suspension.

“Before hitting the ball, I looked up at the scoreboard,” he later said. “There were 10 minutes to go. And I got it into my head that it was the right moment, just the right moment.”

But perhaps the most-repeated moment came earlier in that game.

When Bebeto sneaked in behind a Dutch defence who had completely stopped playing because Romario was in an offside position — the ‘not interfering' interpretation was relatively new — he rounded the goalkeeper, slotted into an empty net and then ran off to perform his famous ‘rocking the baby' celebration as a tribute to his newborn baby Matheus, who was two days old. He was joined by Romario and Mazinho for a celebration which, more than most of the 1994 side's football, was an example of the Brazilian joy the world wanted to see.

Matheus went on to have a decent career, making over 100 appearances in the Portuguese top flight — although nothing compared to Mazinho's sons Thiago and Rafinha Alcantara, who have 15 major league titles between them.

It's difficult to make a case for anyone else.

Italy scrapped their way through to the final with an overly rigid system, thanks to the magic of Baggio. Swedish and Bulgarian players became national heroes by reaching the semi-finals, but few would make a case that those teams deserved anything more. The Dutch showed flashes of inspiration, but Brazil deservedly beat them.

Brazil's only problem was that they were being compared to the country's legendary sides of 1958, 1962 and, in particular, 1970. They weren't on that level, but ultimately didn't need to be.

MagentaTV really went all out for this World Cup.

German television is rarely short of star names to talk about the World Cup. In 2022, for example, then then still-retired Toni Kroos worked with his brother Felix Kroos and a certain Michael Ballack, watching as Germany crashed and burned. Germany will be hoping to do far, far better in 2026 World Cup. As captured by @iMiaSanMia, we now know that the pundits for this event will be the former Germany internationals Thomas Müller and Mats Hummels as well as Jürgen Klopp.

Telekom's Head of TV, Arnim Butzen, had this to say about the trio: “With our team of experts for the 2026 World Cup, we are setting new standards. With Müller, Klopp, and Hummels, we've been able to attract real football personalities who will clearly express their opinions and bring the tournament closer to the fans in an entertaining way. And that's what MagentaTV stands for.”

Müller and Hummels are, of course former stars for the German national team and are very popular in Germany. They are also, incidentally, very good friends from their shared time with the national team and the three years they spent as teammates at Bayern Munich. They even have their own YouTube channel named the ThoMats channel. One can expect a lot of banter and know how from the popular duo,

The latter of trio, Klopp, was arguably the most popular of them all before he recently joined Rasenballsport Leipzig. He gained notoriety for his work at Mainz 05, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool FC, even coaching Hummels for quite some time. From rivalries to friendship to camaraderie to expertise to charisma, this trio checks a lot of boxes. Truly, this is an all star trio of pundits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Explained: Why Enzo Maresca opted not to demand potential £14m Chelsea pay-off after shock exit from Blues","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/explained-why-enzo-maresca-opted-not-to-demand-potential-14m-chelsea-pay-off/bltd99fddebb9f044ed","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 07:55:45 GMT","

Enzo Maresca chose against demanding a £14 million ($19m) pay-off from Chelsea when he walked out of Stamford Bridge. The Italian and the Blues have parted company after a dismal run saw the Blues fall away from league leaders Arsenal, sitting 15 points behind the Gunners at the time of his exit.

Maresca left Chelsea last week, with the club making a change after the Blues slipped down to fifth in the Premier League table, after a run of just one win in their last five fixtures. Now, the club are preparing for their fixture against Manchester City, with Under-21 coach Calum McFarlane set to take charge of the first-team. The Sun has reported that Maresca's decision to walk away from the Blues saw him turn his back on a potential £14m pay-off, amid reports that he had held talks with Manchester City over potentially replacing Pep Guardiola.

According to the report, Maresca felt so angry about being undermined by the Chelsea hierarchy that he did not discuss exit terms with the club. He would have been due around £14m, having signed a five-year deal, with the option for a further year, when he joined the club from Leicester City in 2024. He was earning around £4m-per-season, and leaving after 18 months has left an immense amount of money on the table. Maresca's camp also deny any reports that he attempted to strong-arm Chelsea into handing him a new contract by leveraging City's interest in him.

At the time of his sacking, Chelsea said: ""During his time at the Club, Enzo led the team to success in the UEFA Conference League and the FIFA Club World Cup. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.

""With key objectives still to play for across four competitions including qualification for Champions League football, Enzo and the Club believe a change gives the team the best chance of getting the season back on track.

""We wish Enzo well for the future.""

Maresca is also understood to be angry at suggestions that he fell out with the club's medical staff, and subsequently risked the health of first-team stars such as Cole Palmer and Reece James. He was frustrated with the amount of confrontations he was forced to have with the club's power-brokers, especially when it came to team selections and potential substitutions.

Regardless, he has been tipped to make a swift return to the dugout by Premier League legend Alan Shearer.

He said: ""His time at Chelsea should be viewed as a successful spell for Maresca. They beat the best team around last year in PSG; he out-coached the Coach of the Year. They won the Conference League, which you'd expect, but not many thought they'd go to the Club World Cup and win. 

""He's in and around the top four, so for me, he's done a really good job. He'll leave with his stock high. I don't think he'll struggle to get another job because of the work he's done at Chelsea and Leicester. Whether he gets one of the big ones remains to be seen. There's been talk about City, hasn't there, but it depends on if Pep Guardiola decides to leave and when, but he won't struggle for a job in England or abroad.""

He added: ""You know when you go into that job what you're doing, it's a very different football club to others in terms of how it's managed. That's not Maresca, that's the people above him. Their model is obviously to buy young, develop them, and give them crazy long contracts with the potential to sell. I don't think you're going to win the league like that. You might get into the top four because you can spend, but in the main, the guy coming in has to do better than the guy that's just left.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Luke Littler urges Lennart Karl to join Man Utd & bring Harry Kane with him after receiving motivational message from Bayern Munich wonderkid before winning second World Darts Championship title","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/luke-littler-lennart-karl-join-man-utd-bring-harry-kane-motivational-message-bayern-munich-wonderkid-world-darts-championship-title/blt2bc686c302b8f278","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:21:10 GMT","

Luke Littler has, on the back of successfully defending his World Darts Championship title, invited Bayern Munich wonderkid Lennart Karl to join Manchester United and bring prolific frontman Harry Kane with him. Littler is a passionate Red Devils supporter and would love to see players of potential and pedigree make their way to Old Trafford in upcoming transfer windows.

Littler, who continues to dominate his chosen profession at 18 years of age, knows all about the challenges of being a teen sensation. He is among those to have been impressed by the development of Karl in Germany.

At the age of just 17, the highly-rated forward is rewriting the history books in Bavaria. He already has Bundesliga and Champions League goals to his name, with there no holding the youngster back as he heads down a similar path to Barcelona superstar Lamine Yamal.

In darts circles, Littler has made a mockery of his own lack of experience at the very highest level. Fresh from capturing a first global crown in 2025, he has repeated the trick by going back-to-back. Messages of support have flooded in his direction as he captures the imagination of a worldwide audience.

Littler has revealed, during a discussion with Sport1, that he was contacted by Karl when making his way through another major tournament at Alexandra Palace. The Bayern starlet urged him to “keep it up” while blowing opponents away.

Little crushed Dutch star Gian van Veen 7-1 in the 2026 final, landing himself a £1 million prize in the process. Karl is hoping that he will have silverware to lift over the coming months, as Bayern remain in the hunt for domestic and continental crowns.

The odd question has been asked of his long-term future, with inevitable admiring glances being shot in his direction. Bayern may find it difficult to fend off advances if huge transfer offers are tabled.

United would hope to be in the mix if an exit door opened up at the Allianz Arena. They need to find consistency before setting their sights that high, with Ruben Amorim struggling to get the Red Devils moving in the right direction.

Littler would like to see Karl tread a path to Manchester. He joked when asked about a future deal for the Red Devils: “If he wants to, he can help us”. Littler added that the youngster can “bring Harry Kane along too!”

England captain Kane, who broke his trophy duck with Bayern last season when becoming a Bundesliga title winner, has been linked with United on a regular basis across recent windows. No deal was ever done with Tottenham.

He does have clauses in his contract that can be triggered in 2026, with it suggested that a bid of £57 million ($77m) would be enough to enter into talks. A return to the Premier League has been mooted for Spurs' all-time leading scorer - with Alan Shearer's goal record in that division still there to be shot at.

Ex-United defender Danny Simpson believes a move to Manchester could happen, saying of the options available to Kane: “I don't know where else he could go, if I'm honest. He can't go to City. He can't go to Arsenal. I can't see him turning Manchester United down.

“He can come back, and get the goals record. I'd love to see it. I said it when he was leaving Tottenham, I'd love to see him at Manchester United. It's a good fit. If that's an option I'd 100% go for it.

“He could help [Benjamin] Sesko as well. Sesko would understand not playing every game, learning under Harry Kane, and not having that pressure. He's won his trophies at Bayern now, so if he comes back and gets Manchester United back up to the top of the Premier League, he could be a Manchester United legend like when [Robin] van Persie came.”

Kane has registered 115 goals for Bayern through 121 appearances. United are crying out for that kind of firepower, with Littler and Co seeing big-money summer signing Sesko find the target on just two occasions through his debut campaign in England.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Joe Cole has revealed that his ""dream"" managerial appointment for Chelsea is Jurgen Klopp after Enzo Maresca's Stamford Bridge exit. The Italian and the Blues parted company last week and the west London giants are now seeking a replacement, with the former Liverpool boss touted as an ideal candidate.

Klopp is currently working as RB Leipzig's sporting director and Cole has claimed that the German tactician would be the ideal appointment for the west London club. Liam Rosenior appears to be the current frontrunner, as he works at the Blues' sister club, Strasbourg, which is also owned by BlueCo. Nevertheless, Cole thinks Klopp should be at the top of the list, although he concedes that his pitch may well be viewed as ""mental"". 

Cole was speaking exclusively to Paddy Power: ""I know it's a mental one but Jurgen Klopp, I know he probably won't even consider it because it's Chelsea and he's Liverpool, but you just never know. If your main aim as a football club is to win trophies and you have the money, you go and speak to the top, top boys. I know it seems like it's pie in the sky, but if you don't have that mindset then you're always banking on developing the next best manager, which they thought they were doing with Enzo Maresca.""

Cole also believes that Chelsea acted too quickly when it came to relieving Maresca of his duties, with the Italian having won the Conference League and the Club World Cup last season. 

He said: ""I'm never surprised. Managers don't get a fair crack of the whip across the board in football. There's so much infrastructure around a manager now, how much power does he actually have? He picks the team on the weekend and in a lot of cases I don't even think that's completely down to them. I think there's pressure put on managers to pick certain players, based off the managers I've spoken to that are in and out of jobs. I don't think he was given enough time. He'd done a good job in the circumstances and the club's statement on his departure reflected that.""

Cole and Rosenior actually know each other, with their professional relationship going back to their time at West Ham, and he believes he would ""fit the bill"". 

He added: ""I've known Liam a long time, he was on trial as a young player at West Ham and had a very good career in the Premier League. Obsessive about football, fits the bill in terms of where Chelsea have gone with their last few managers, young and something to prove. Circumstances used to be that when Chelsea needed a manager, the phone was only ringing to the top dogs, but this isn't how the current ownership is operating. Those types of managers will come in and want the full run of the place to get it going again.""

Chelsea face Manchester City on Sunday and will be managed by Calum McFarlane, the Under-21 coach. 

He has spoken about his meeting with Pep Guardiola, telling reporters: ""Ultimately it's a football match. It's not about me, my first game or playing against Pep - it's Chelsea vs City. Two top sides, we'll go there and compete. We've seen this year how this team can do in big moments.

""I'm quite relaxed about it. It might be more nerve-wracking and daunting when it gets closer to the game. 

""I don't feel famous, other than the text messages you usually get. I'm just focused on coming in every day and doing the best I can. It doesn't feel different. 

""I think that we know we're up against a really good team in really good form with a great manager, but we have a really good team. I wouldn't say we have nothing to lose, no.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Inter Miami star Lionel Messi's wife has been accused of blocking model Suzy Cortez from attending the MLS Cup final, after she allegedly bombarded Messi with 'sexy messages', according to a new report from The Sun. Messi eventually lifted the trophy, but Cortez was not present to witness his heroics.

Per The Sun, Messi's wife Roccuzzo personally took steps to ensure model Cruz could not attend Inter Miami's MLS Cup final clash with Vancouver Whitecaps. Messi led his side as they won 3-1, adding yet more silverware to an already overflowing cabinet. Cortez has previously been blocked by Messi after she allegedly bombarded him with ""sexy pictures"" on Instagram. A former winner of the Brazilian 'Miss BumBum' crown, she staged a racy photo-shoot after being unblocked by the Barcelona legend. Now, she has hit out at Roccuzzo for limiting her real-life access to her husband.

Cruz has claimed she was ""humiliated"" by Roccuzzo's insistence she not be allowed into the final. She is reported to have made the request to Miami's staff personally. She has also said that she has once again been blocked by Messi and his extended family on social media.

Speaking to Extra, she said: ""I felt humiliated. No one should be banned from a public sporting event because of personal issues or disputes on social media.""

She has also not ruled out the prospect of confronting Messi's family at the 2026 World Cup, which she plans to attend in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Cruz is a Messi super-fan, and even has tattoos inspired by the ex-PSG star in intimate areas. She has previously posted a video of her adding a Messi-inspired tattoo to her bottom.

Roccuzzo has previously opened up about her relationship with Messi, and their family life, something she is clearly very keen to protect.

She told Grazia: ""We love our routine. It's very important for our family, the structure. We wake up really early, we take the kids to school, and then I try to train at least five times a week. Then I try to do meetings or errands or photoshoots in that gap where the kids are in school. And then just picking up the kids and going to all soccer activities or after-school activities. Then having dinner and going to bed. We are like a normal family.""

She added: ""It's not just me. I really feel like my family is my priority and I always support my husband and my family, beyond everything, but I feel like he also supports me and we are really a great team. And that's what we want to build as a family. Between everyone, we have the family structure. So it's not just me, it's everyone there.""

""I feel really grateful and really happy, but at the same time, I am trying to find the balance between professional and personal because sometimes it's hard to know how to deal with a lot of shooting (photoshoots), meetings, whatever, and at the same time being with the kids. But in the end, I feel like I'm working hard, and I'm really happy and proud of it.""

She added, on their adaptation to American life: ""Coming from Paris, the weather there was really cold and gray. For me, coming here was just an amazing experience.

""They [the kids] always surprise us in a very positive way. Even when we moved to Paris, or here, they were always super easy to adapt. And we always feel super proud in terms of how they make our lives really, really easy.""

How to watch the Africa Cup of Nations match between Morocco and Tanzania, as well as kick-off time and team news.

Morocco and Tanzania meet in the Round of 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations with contrasting ambitions but a shared goal: a place in the quarter-finals. The clash is set to take place at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where the Atlas Lions will enjoy home support and will be expected to produce.

For Morocco, this fixture represents another step in a tournament where expectations are high, given they are playing at home and have a golden generation of footballers. The Atlas Lions enter the knockout phase as one of the strongest teams in the competition, combining tactical discipline with high-level individual quality.   

Their group-stage performances underlined their control in possession, defensive organisation, and ability to manage games efficiently. Coach Walid Regragui has publicly urged his squad to stay humble and avoid complacency, warning against underestimating Tanzania despite their lower ranking.

For Tanzania, it is a rare opportunity to test themselves against one of Africa's elite nations on the knockout stage, with an upset set to send a massive statement. They progressed to the Round of 16 for the first time in their AFCON history, despite earning only two points in the group stage — a record low for a qualifying side.

Our NFL expert offers his Ravens vs Steelers predictions, picks, and odds for tonight's 8:20pm EST decisive AFC North game in Pittsburgh (1/4).

Longtime rivals, the Baltimore Ravens (8-8, -3.5) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (9-7) meet in the NFL Regular Season finale with the AFC North championship and playoff spot on the line. In a playoff-like atmosphere, points may be hard to come by. Consider under 40.5 points (-110).

Pat Freiermuth 50+ Receiving Yards @ +190

Derrick Henry 90+ Rushing Yards @ -115

Under 40.5 Points @ -110

All odds are courtesy of Sportsbooks, correct at the time of publishing, and subject to change.

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will be without some key targets tonight. Wide receiver DK Metcalf will serve the final game of a two-game suspension, which hurts the Steelers quite a lot.

Metcalf caught seven passes for 148 yards when the Steelers picked up a 27-22 win in Baltimore in Week 14. Meanwhile, tight end Darnell Washington broke his arm in last weekend's 13-6 loss against the Cleveland Browns.

With WR Calvin Austin III also listed as questionable, expect TE Pat Freiermuth to play a big role in the Steelers' passing game once again. In Week 17, Freiermuth caught three passes for 63 yards. His five targets were also tied for his second-highest total of the season

Without many other options, expect Rodgers to look for Freiermuth again today. You can get Pat Freiermuth 50+ receiving yards at +190 odds.

Ravens running back Derrick Henry has been a one-man wrecking crew over the past few weeks. Henry had a massive game against the Packers in Week 17, with 216 yards and four touchdowns on 36 carries.

With Henry's huge performance, the Ravens didn't miss QB Lamar Jackson much. Jackson, who is nursing a back injury, is expected to play tonight, which will likely mean fewer carries for Henry.

Even so, he's averaged 134.5 rushing yards in the previous four games and has managed 90+ in four straight. That includes 94 rushing yards when the Ravens met the Steelers in Week 14.

Sure, the Steelers have been one of the best run-stopping teams in recent weeks, but being able to stop the 6'2”, 250-pound Henry is a different question.

Frankly, the Steelers looked awful on offense against the Browns without Metcalf in the lineup. Even winning the turnover battle 2-0, the Steelers scored just six points and picked up under 300 total yards.

Metcalf is out once again, and this line opened up at O/U 42.5 points. Bettors are hammering the under, as the Steelers look incompetent on offense and the Ravens run the ball on a higher percentage of plays than any other NFL team.

The last 11 games between these two teams have averaged 34.5 points, and the under is 8-3 in those games. In what could be an unpredictable slugfest, bet on under 40.5 points (-110) tonight.

Injured Ravens QB Lamar Jackson is expected to suit up for this crucial season finale against the Steelers. Baltimore has gone 7-3 in its last 10 games after starting the season just 1-5. While the momentum is with the Ravens, the Steelers will lean on the home crowd.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Why Stan Wawrinka's last dance will be more salsa than slow waltz","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/stan-wawrinka-final-season-feature-united-cup-2026","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:59:57 GMT","

A farewell tour?

That's not a phrase that sits well with Stan Wawrinka as he begins his 25th and final season on the ATP Tour.

Send your well wishes and accolades and they will be received politely and with appreciation. But Switzerland's other tennis treasure is determined to crown - rather than tarnish - one of the finest careers of the past 20 years by doing in 2026 what he does best: fighting with all his might to win as many matches as possible.

For evidence, look no further than Wawrinka's season opener at the United Cup in Perth: Toiling for three hours and 18 minutes in baking heat, the 40-year-old rallied from a set down to upset Top 30 Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a third-set tie-break. It was a spirited victory - the 583rd of his career - that backed up his comments just one day earlier to ATPTour.com.

“I'm good with my decision to announce this is my last year, but I'm not doing a year just to say goodbye,” Wawrinka said. “I'm a competitor. I want to push my limit, I want to still fight against good players. I want to still win matches. I want to try to be back at the Top 100 at 40 years old.

“Throughout my career I do feel like I maximised everything I could; that always has been my goal and it's still on for the last year. It was always to push my own limits and I achieved way more than I could dream when I was young.""








Despite more than two decades on Tour, the three-time Grand Slam champion remains a fierce competitor at his core. Why else would he grind through 29 ATP Challenger matches in 2025 as his PIF ATP Ranking [now 157] languished well outside the Top 100 and kept him off the main tour for extended periods?

“He likes the hard work and the tough lifestyle, pushing his body to the physical and mental limits,” said longtime coach Magnus Norman this week in Perth. ""And he likes to perform in front of people. At the Napoli Challenger last year the crowd was really into the matches. For him it doesn't matter if it's a Challenger or a Grand Slam.""

Wawrinka, a winner of 16 titles, concurs: “I'm lucky enough to have had the chance to win Slams and play on the biggest stages, but just the emotion I get from playing a match, the feeling from the competition and playing in front of people is the same even when you play on the small courts. When you're passionate about what you're doing, the stadium doesn't matter.”

ATP Challengers are a far cry from the centre courts of Roland Garros and the Australian and US Opens where Wawrinka inked his legacy. With Norman by his side, Wawrinka won majors for three consecutive years between 2014-2016: at Melbourne Park in 2014, Roland Garros in 2015 and in the cavernous Arthur Ashe Stadium in 2016.

Norman shared a favourite memory of Wawrinka's final Grand Slam triumph, a four-set win over Novak Djokovic in the 2016 US Open final. As the referee called the finalists to assemble for their escort to the court, the Swede delivered an emotional speech.

“He had been playing very good tennis and I thought he would have a good match, but against Novak you're not sure if it will be enough,"" Norman said. ""I told him that no matter what happens, that I'm so proud of what he had done.”

The words moved Wawrinka to tears, which then brought Norman to tears.

 “The referee is calling the match and we're both in the lockerroom crying. But it was what we needed because there had been a lot of tension. It was a little bit of a release for both of us,” Norman added.



For his part, Wawrinka said that his earlier Grand Slam final victory over Djokovic at Roland Garros in 2015 remains his favourite.

“They all are really special in different ways,” he said. “Australia was where I won my first Slam [against Rafael Nadal] the year after I lost the tough match to Novak in five sets. For me that was a turning point in my career. 

“But if I had to pick one, I will take the French Open. I grew up in the French part of Switzerland and when I was young, I was watching the tournament every summer. It was easy to watch French Open all day long and I had friends and family coming because it's really close to home. 

“I grew up playing on clay, so for many reasons, I will pick this one.”

Victory over Djokovic on Court Philippe-Chatrier included one of the most iconic moments in modern Grand Slam finals: an around-the-net topspin backhand winner from deep and wide behind the baseline that left fans gobsmacked. 

“It's an amazing memory of course; at that moment I was really feeling good. That was one set all and it was a break for me in the third. I was really feeling and playing the way I wanted to.

“I saw the ball. I saw the gap. I went for it. 

“In that moment you just feel so good because it's already an amazing achievement to be in the French Open final and then to hit that shot and play so well against Novak Djokovic is something I'll always remember.”

Wawrinka has a combined 12-63 record against the Big Three - Nadal (3-19), Federer (3-23), Djokovic (6-21) - but many of the victories came when they counted most. In Grand Slam finals he was 3-1.

“In his prime, if Stan had a good day no-one was safe,” Norman said. “He could hit winners from both sides from two to three metres behind the baseline. He was serving and moving well, was physically strong.

 “He was really good in the big moments. Grand Slam champions have something that other players don't have. I was in a Grand Slam final and the moment got to me. He could handle those situations. I think you're born with it.” 

Wawrinka beat Nadal in the 2014 Australian Open, his first major title

He beat Djokovic in the 2015 Roland Garros final and the 2016 US Open final. In 2014 he pipped the Serbian 9-7 in the fifth set of the Australian Open quarter-finals en route to the title win over Nadal, one year after Djokovic edged him 12-10 in the fifth in the Australian Open fourth round.

Wawrinka beat Federer in the 2015 Roland Garros quarter-finals en route to the title and in the 2014 Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters final, his lone Masters 1000 title.

Who was the toughest to beat?

“All three were really difficult to play against,” he said. “You can see my record against them: I lost more than 20 times to each of them, but of course Rafa especially on clay was the toughest with him hitting high forehands into my one-handed backhand, constantly putting pressure. It's tough to generate something from there and put him under pressure. And then he had the lefty serve.”

Having played through the Big Three era, Wawrinka believes the new Big Two dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner is likely to endure, at least in the short to medium term.

“I do believe we are in the Carlos and Jannik era; they've been proving that for a few years their level is higher than the rest of the players,"" said Wawrinka. ""I'm not sure we will have a player to fight against them constantly, but for sure they're not gonna win every single title all the time. 

 “I still believe they're gonna dominate this sport for the next many years. It will be really interesting to see where they're gonna end up in 5-10 years or 15 years. The thing is to challenge the Novak records, you need to last 15 years at least.” 

For all the success on the court, Norman is equally, if not more, proud of the man Wawrinka has been off the court.

“He's like a normal good guy who has always stuck to his values,"" said the former World No. 2 and Roland Garros finalist. ""He was always very humble and treated everyone the same whether he was winning or losing. I think that's a big part of why we are together after so many years. He respects everyone whether it's the ballkids, a World No. 1 or the cleaning lady.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Nicholls/Skupski deny Osaka-led Japan at United Cup with help from ‘Timeout Tim'","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/great-britain-japan-united-cup-2026-sunday","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:05:16 GMT","

 Olivia Nicholls and Neal Skupski held their nerve to complete a dramatic victory against Japan on a rollercoaster day for Great Britain at the United Cup. 

 Sunday began with the news of Emma Raducanu's withdrawal from the WTA singles match against Naomi Osaka in Perth, but it ended with Great Britain celebrating a hard-earned 2-1 triumph in their Group E opener. In between, Billy Harris downed Shintaro Mochizuki in the opening singles rubber before Osaka overcame Katie Swan to force a mixed-doubles decider. 

 Nicholls and Skupski edged Nao Hibino and Yasutaka Uchiyama 7-5, 4-6, 10-7 in a one-hour, 46-minute nailbiter to secure victory for their country. The closing stages also featured tactical use of a timeout from both captains: Japan's Go Soeda called one before Nicholls served at 6/5, and Skupski promptly netted an easy volley on the following point. Henman then returned the favour by calling a timeout of his own with Briton leading 7/6, and his doubles pair subsequently reeled off back-to-back mini breaks before going on to clinch the tie. 

 “It was instigated by the Japan team. They went first, but it was certainly on the radar once we got into that deciding tie-break,” revealed Great Britain captain Henman in his on-court interview. “The spirit has been so good since we arrived in Perth. Their work ethic and the camaraderie has been absolutely outstanding. My request was for them to go out there and enjoy the challenge and compete for every point.” 

 Skupski added: “Obviously it was a very up-and-down tie-break. Both captains brought out the time out, and I was a bit confused when it all happened, but extremely proud to get through that moment. It's a great win for GB.” 

 Nicholls and Skupski, along with the rest of their British teammates, will now prepare for Monday's clash with Team Greece in Perth. The winner of that tie will qualify for the quarter-finals as the winner of Group E, while Japan is eliminated. 

 “Unbelievable. We had amazing support from the crowd,” said Nicholls. “I've actually got family here who I'm staying with in Perth this week which is making it even more special. We've had amazing team spirit this week. I've really enjoyed being part of this team, so it's just incredible to get the win.” 

MADNESS IN PERTH 🤯 pic.twitter.com/3Fk5tqWswl

 Osaka was originally slated for a second career meeting with Raducanu, but a late lineup change handed her a new challenge in 26-year-old Swan. 

 Osaka passed the test, though not without complications, defeating Swan 7-6 (4), 6-1 in one hour and 53 minutes. It marked Osaka's first career match win at the United Cup and the first in Team Japan's history, with the nation making its event debut this year. 

 “Just fighting, no matter what the score was,” said Osaka when asked what she was most pleased with. “I've never played her before and she's a really tough opponent. And to have one of the first matches of the year is definitely really tough, but I'm glad to be back here. I haven't been here since 2017, so thanks for having me.” 

 Osaka's serve set the tone, as she won the first 10 points on her serve and 11 of the first 12. By match end, the former World No. 1 had won 78 per cent of her first-serve points and struck six aces. The performance from the service line provided a crucial cushion given her early struggles on return, as she converted just one of 10 break points in the opening set. 

 Despite the loss, the match will stand as a career highlight for Swan, who has endured repeated injuries and setbacks. Despite the adversity, she entered the contest with 16 ITF singles titles -- including four in 2025 -- and was a girls' singles finalist at the 2015 Australian Open. 

 Swan competed in the inaugural United Cup in 2023, going 2-1 in singles with wins over Nuria Parrizas Diaz and Zoe Hives, while losing to Madison Keys. Her last WTA Tour main-draw win came at the event, while her most recent tour-level main-draw appearance had come at Wimbledon in 2023, where she lost to Belinda Bencic. 

 The Briton battled throughout Sunday's match, showing resolve from the opening game. She earned the first break of the match for a 4-3 lead in the first set and saved the first eight break points she faced, but it ultimately wasn't enough to avoid a winner-take-all mixed doubles match. 

 Osaka broke back to level at 5-5, claimed the first-set tiebreak 7/4 and then pulled away in the second set. 

 “[Winning the first set] was definitely really important,” Osaka said. “And just, I guess for my confidence, trying to just build more. So yeah, I definitely appreciated winning the first set for sure.” 



 Harris had earlier settled British nerves in the wake of Raducanu's morning withdrawal with a rock-solid 7-6(4), 6-3 triumph against Mochizuki. The 30-year-old quickly handed his team a welcome boost with an impressive triumph against a player 29 spots above him in the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 “Great atmosphere… It got me through the match,” said Harris in his on-court interview. “A lot of Brits out here. Great to get the first win for the team. Some shaky bits in there, but I managed to close it out there in the end, so I was happy with that."" 

 Harris initially rallied from 3-5 in the opening set against Mochizuki but then failed to serve it out at 6-5. The Briton promptly delivered a rock-solid first-set tie-break showing, however, to capitalise on the inconsistencies of the World No. 99 Japanese. 

 With frequent motivational calls from his captain Tim Henman on the team bench, Harris completed his one-hour, 50-minute win after claiming the only break of the second set in the fourth game. It was his first tour-level triumph since he defeated Dusan Lajovic at Wimbledon last July. 

 “Having Tim on the bench, it's great having advice from someone like that, so you are listening every changeover and those little bits of advice can make a difference,"" said Harris. 

 Mochizuki was chasing Japan's first match win of the 2026 United Cup after it fell 0-3 to Greece on Friday. However, his efforts were undermined by a wayward performance from the baseline: the 22-year-old produced 19 unforced errors in the first set alone and made just 40 per cent (27/68) of first serves overall, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Joao Fonseca's start to the 2026 ATP Tour season has been delayed by a lower back injury.

The Brazilian withdrew Sunday from the Brisbane International presented by ANZ and will be replaced by a lucky loser.

The 19-year-old former Next Gen ATP Finals champion is at a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings. This time last year, he won the ATP Challenger in Canberra before winning through qualifying at the Australian Open and upsetting then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev to reach the second round.

Fonseca is next scheduled to compete at the Adelaide International, which begins 12 January.

Felix Auger-Aliassime carried his strong 2025 form into the new season with a commanding tie-clinching victory for Canada against China on Sunday at the United Cup in Sydney.

The 25-year-old, at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings, overpowered Zhang Zhizhen 6-4, 6-4 with an authoritative, big-hitting performance. The win — his first opening victory of a season since 2021 — followed an impressive comeback earlier from 19-year-old Victoria Mboko, sealing an unassailable 2-0 lead for Canada.

“I can be very pleased with this first match of the year,” said Auger-Aliassime. “Tennis is about rhythm, playing important points under pressure, so you never know what to expect. I woke up this morning hoping for the best, and then I played some of my best tennis.”

Auger-Aliassime and Mboko then ensured a 3-0 sweep by teaming to defeat Xiaodi You and Rigele Te 6-1, 6-3 in the mixed doubles rubber.

Auger-Aliassime ended the 2025 season in fine form, highlighted by a semi-final run at the US Open, a title at the ATP 250 in Brussels and a last-four finish at the prestigious Nitto ATP Finals. He showed no signs of slowing down as he launched his 2026 campaign.

His serve proved especially decisive against Zhang, as he won 87 per cent (33/38) points behind his first delivery and saved the only break point he faced to level their Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 1-1.

Earlier, Mboko rallied from a set down on her United Cup debut to defeat Lin Zhu 2-6, 6-2, 6-0 in 1 hour, 39 minutes. Zhu had won their only previous meeting, but Mboko responded with an emphatic finish.

It was Mboko's sixth consecutive win on the WTA Tour after she ended 2025 on a five-match winning streak that earned her the second WTA Tour title of her season in Hong Kong.

Belinda Bencic concluded her singles group-stage play at the United Cup with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Italy's Jasmine Paolini, and secured their spot in the quarterfinals with a mixed doubles by Jakub Paul and Bencic.

PERTH, Australia -- The United Cup has its first confirmed quarterfinalist with Switzerland taking the top spot in Group C, following a 2-1 victory in the tie with Italy.

Belinda Bencic delivered a standout all-around performance on Sunday at the United Cup in Perth. The 28-year-old concluded her singles group-stage play with a 6-4, 6-3 defeat of Italy's Jasmine Paolini before returning to the court later in the day to help decide the tie in the mixed doubles.

After Flavio Cobolli levelled the contest with a dramatic deciding-set tiebreak win over Stan Wawrinka, Bencic teamed with Jakub Paul to defeat three-time major champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori 7-5, 4-6, [10-7].

The result secured Switzerland top spot in Group C with a perfect 2-0 record and sent them into the United Cup quarter-finals for the first time in the tournament's history.

""I think it just starts with the team energy,"" Bencic said to reporters. ""We didn't see each other much before this. We made sure we're bonding, doing stuff together. I think this makes such a big difference. In the important moments, you feel like everyone is behind you.""

In the first rubber, Bencic and Paolini traded five straight breaks, highlighted by a Bencic backhand crosscourt return that glided past the Italian in the fifth game. Bencic provided the game's first hold and extended her lead to 4-2 against the World No. 8, who Bencic lost two twice in 2025 -- in a three-set thriller in Ningbo and at last year's United Cup group stage.

Paolini recovered quickly and held her serve, coming back from triple break point, and then broke Bencic once more, leveling at 4-4.

Just as Paolini was building momentum, Bencic, No. 11 on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, halted it. She broke Paolini with an on-the-run backhand pass down the line, one of 10 backhand winners on the evening. The World No. 11 then held her serve and took the set 6-4.

Despite holding her serve to start the second set, Paolini dropped three of the next four games. She held her serve, requiring seven games points in the deuce as Bencic was a tall task, to remain a break down at 4-3. Bencic closed the match once more with her sixth break of Paolini's serve, and propelled Switzerland to a 1-0 lead.

""It's very nice to get the revenge of course,"" Bencic said. ""She's a very good player. I'm really happy with my level today. [There] was some key moments where it was really important, because I had [gotten] a little bit in my head the last few matches, what I did wrong and some situations. I'm really happy I overcame myself in this.""

Bencic is now 2-0 in singles, following her 6-2, 6-4 win over Leolia Jeanjean Saturday. Paolini will face Jeanjean in Italy's next tie against France. 

Cobolli embraced the responsibility of the moment on Sunday, sending Italy to a deciding mixed-doubles match. The 23-year-old, who helped steer his country to its third consecutive Davis Cup title in November, produced a gutsy finish to withstand spirited 40-year-old Stan Wawrinka 6-4, 6-7(2), 7-6(4) to level the tie.

Wawrinka, in his final season on tour, pulled off a dramatic third-set tie-break win over Arthur Rinderknech on Saturday. The three-time major champion remained competitive throughout much of the match against Cobolli, but was unable to generate a break point as the Italian maintained his composure.

Wawrinka and Cobolli treated the RAC Arena crowd to a captivating duel deep into the deciding set, highlighted by a moment of magic from Cobolli.

He steadied himself under pressure and fired a stunning forehand winner on the run to claim a mini-break in a tense final-set tie-break en route to improving to 2-0 against Wawrinka.

World No. 8 Jasmine Paolini and and No. 11 Belinda Bencic meet in Perth in a group stage rematch from last year's United Cup, while the main draw begins at the Brisbane International on Sunday.

As this 2026 WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season unfurls, they are two of the most intriguing players based on their past performances -- and, going forward, what the future holds.

A stellar match -- the best strictly in terms of rankings in group play -- sees No. 8 Jasmine Paolini versus No. 11 Belinda Bencic. Paolini is a two-time Grand Slam finalist, while Bencic won the singles gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.

Bencic won their first two meetings, but they played twice in 2025 with Paolini triumphing both times. The first match -- at the United Cup -- deserves an asterisk. Paolini was a 6-1, 6-1 winner, but it was Bencic's first match back after becoming a mother in 2024. It was much closer this past fall in a Ningbo quarterfinal won by Paolini 5-7, 7-5, 6-3.

This is the Italian's third United Cup appearance.

""Maybe some years ago I felt more pressure playing as a team,” Paolini said. ""I couldn't play well in Billie Jean King Cup. Then I get more relaxed. Hopefully this year it's going to be the same.""

Bencic comes in with some serious momentum after winning two matches in a 3-0 victory over France -- including the decisive mixed doubles with Jakub Paul in a match-tiebreak.

""It's been a great day for us, thanks to Belinda to play so well and to show us the way,” said Swiss captain Stan Wawrinka. “We are just living in Belinda's world, so we're enjoying that. Thank you.""

Originally, Japan's Naomi Osaka was scheduled to face Great Britain's Emma Raducanu, but Katie Swan will now take Raducanu's place in the women's singles match in a revised lineup.

Swan, 26, plays primarily on ITF circuit, and she last competed in a tour-level event over two years ago as a wild card for the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, where she lost in the first round to Bencic. 

Get ready Perth! It's going to be a good one 🤩 pic.twitter.com/gI19XeuR1b

""It's been a while since I've been part of the Great Britain team in any capacity,"" Swan said at Great Britain's media day in Perth. ""Last time was probably with Tim (Henman) at the first United Cup in Sydney, and I loved every part of that experience. I'm really happy to be back here with this team.""

After giving birth to a daughter in the summer of 2023, Osaka has gradually rediscovered her elite game, reaching the semifinals of the 2025 US Open, suggesting she soon might be a threat in Melbourne.

This is the first United Cup experience for Osaka, who looks to bounce back following a loss to Maria Sakkari on Friday.

""Being able to play the best players in the world straight off the bat, I think is a privilege,"" Osaka told reporters after the match vs. Sakkari. ""For me, I really enjoy matches like that. I just feel like it's going to be really fun.""

United Cup/Sydney

If Sydney's opening match is any indication, we're in for a treat. The tie between China and Belgium went down to a mixed-doubles match-tiebreak with two players who had never been partners.

Zhu Lin and Zhang Zhizhen stunned Elise Mertens and Zizou Bergs 5-7, 7-6 (5), 10-6 in a thriller at Ken Rosewall Arena.

“It's a tough day today, especially for Triple-Z,” Zhu said of her partner. “He just finished a three-set match and didn't get too much time to rest. I lost my singles today, so at the beginning of the game I was kind of slowly into the game, and he was there to cheer me up, to tell me to believe in myself.”

China again will have to dig deep on Sunday with another challenge – Canada, led by rising star Victoria Mboko and Felix Auger-Aliassime. Zhu beat Mboko in their only previous meeting, but that was more than three years ago in Monastir, Tunisia -- when Mboko was only 15 years old.

The first tie is Germany vs. Netherlands. No. 40-ranked Eva Lys and Suzan Lamens (No. 89) have split their two career matches, with Lamens winning the most recent two years ago in Osaka qualifying.

The 'Frankenstein' filmmaker made the announcement on Saturday, noting he may be absent from some awards events this season as a result. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Guillermo del Toro emotionally announced the passing of his brother while being honored at the Palm Springs Film Awards on Saturday.


	The director, on hand to receive the Visionary Award at the annual star-studded event, was joined on stage by his Frankenstein stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth, as he spoke about how, at 61 years old, “I've come to believe that everybody's born with one or two songs to sing. That's it, and we keep repeating them and repeating them until we get them sort of right. And Frankenstein was the song I was born to sing.”

	Del Toro told the crowd at the Palm Springs Convention Center how he approached the iconic tale by “making it about fatherhood and forgiveness, because I believe that we want to be forgiven and forgive. And now, very recently, something has became very clear to me. Three days ago, I lost my older brother but I'm here, and I'm here because the film speaks about a condition that is purely human; that is proved by the final phase in the film, which says the heart may break and the broken live on. Even a broken heart pumps the blood and keeps you going.”

	“My brother and I played Victor and the creature on many moments in our lives,” he said in reference to Frankenstein‘s two main characters, and “many years ago, we granted each other love and granted each other peace. So I'm here for family.”

	











	The filmmaker — who skipped the event's red carpet — didn't reveal his brother's name or any details about his death, but announced “I may be absent at a few functions this [awards] season, but not this one. I'm here because this is family,” as he gestured to his stars. “Life gives you a family on the way.”

James Cameron's threequel achieved the milestone Saturday at the New Year weekend box office. Other holiday victors include sleeper hit 'The Housemaid' and Timothée Chalamet's 'Marty Supreme.'


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	After a bumpy 2025, the new year is off to a good start at the domestic box office, thanks to a varied menu of holiday titles that moviegoers are continuing to feast on before schools and college resume and extended work vacations end. Indeed, New Year's weekend revenue looks to be a post-pandemic best.


	Leading the pack, of course, is James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash, which flew past the $1 billion mark at the global box office on Saturday. Disney and 20th Century will announce full details Sunday morning. It's another notch in Cameron's belt, who already directed three of the four biggest movies of all time at the global box office, led by Avatar and followed by Avatar: The Way of Water and Titanic.

Avatar 3‘s global earnings through New Year's Day (Thursday) were a mighty $935 million, including $266 million domestically and  $699 overseas. On Friday, it earned another $14 million in North America from 3,832 theaters to finish the day with a domestic total of $280 million. Based on those returns, it should win the weekend with a chart-topping $36 million to $38 million as it crosses the $300 million mark in North America in addition to the billion-dollar milestone.

	And, as of Saturday, it is one of only three Hollywood movies released in 2025 to cross $1 billion after fellow Disney titles Lilo & Stitch ($1.038 billion) and the record-smashing Zootopia 2, which has grossed $1.51 billion to date since its Thanksgiving release.

	











	And its still going strong. Zootopia 2 is expected to fall a scant seven percent in its sixth weekend to come in second with $18 million or more from 3,285 cinemas.


	Earlier this week, the sequel passed up Frozen II ($1.453 billion) to become the top-grossing title in the history of Walt Disney Animation Studios, not adjusted for inflation. It has also become the top-grossing Hollywood animated film of all time in China with a running total north of $560 million, and is the second-biggest film of all time behind  Avengers: Endgame in 2019.


	Disney has enjoyed a banner year, amassing $6.5 billion in ticket sales for the first time since the pandemic.


	Several other titles are also holding in exceptionally well at the New Year's weekend box office. Lionsgate and Paul Feig's well-reviewed sleeper hit The Housemaid could fall just six percent to $14 million for a domestic tally nearing $75 million.


	The female-skewing thriller is a major win for all involved, and particularly Sydney Sweeney. The actress came under fierce attack for an American Eagle jeans campaign — she recently began addressing the issue — followed by the disastrous box office performance of Christy, an awards vehicle for Sweeney.


	A24's high-profile period pic Marty Supreme — directed by Josh Safdie and starring Timothée Chalamet as a 1950s table tennis champion — is another holiday stand-out. It was the biggest surprise of Christmas weekend in placing second with $27.1 million. The pic's Friday-Sunday haul of $17.5 million was the second-best showing in the history of A24.

	











Marty Supreme is headed for a fourth-place finish this weekend with $11 million to $12 million from 2,887 cinemas. It continues to outpace Sony's Anaconda and Focus Features' critical darling Song Sung Blue, starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson. Alongside Angel Studio's faith-based David, Song Sung Blue boasts the highest audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes (98 percent) of any Christmas title playing nationwide. 


Anaconda, rebuffed by many critics, should round out the top five this weekend, followed by Paramount's The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, David and Song Sung Blue, which is based on the 2008 documentary of the same name about Mike and Claire Sardina, who performed in the popular Neil Diamond tribute band Lightning & Thunder.


	Universal's Thanksgiving event pic Wicked: For Good is headed for ninth-place, while the weekend's only new nationwide opener — We Bury the Dead — may have to settle for tenth place if it can't get much past $2.7 million.


	Playing in 1,172 theaters, Zak Hilditch's indie zombie thriller stars Daisy Ridley, and premiered at 2025's South by Southwest. The story follows a young married woman who travels from America to Tasmania in hopes of finding her husband alive. The U.S. military botched a nearby weapons test that obliterated the population of Tasmania, creating either a pile of dead bodies or zombies that gradually become more aggressive. Ava's husband, Mitch, had the misfortune of being on a work retreat there at the same time.

	











	Brenton Thwaites, Matt Whelan, Mark Coles Smith and Kym Jackson also star in the movie, which Vertical is handling.


	Numbers will be updated Sunday morning.

The star was honored for her 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' song at the Palm Springs Film Awards, where she said of the awards race, ""There is no single best, it's only our personal best work.""


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


Miley Cyrus was celebrated for her Avatar: Fire and Ash song “Dream As One” at the Palm Springs Film Awards on Saturday, where she spoke out about a downside of Hollywood's awards season.


	Taking the stage at the Palm Springs Convention Center, the star shouted out the orchestra playing her song, teasing, “You guys did amazing — if you're available for the Oscars, that's what we're hoping for.” She also joked that the night was “truly the most elegant Palm Springs party that I have ever been to. There are fewer drag queens than I like, but I'll be stopping by Toucans on the way back to L.A. to get my fix.”

	Cyrus noted how refreshing the awards show was “without the stress of competition,” as the 12 honors are all announced in advance. “So often during awards season, we're set up as competitors, but we're meant to be a community, not opponents. There is no single best, it's only our personal best work,” she said. “Numbers can make it feel like a sport, but performance runs so much deeper than a scoreboard, because each artist, they bare their soul in a completely unique way, and every contribution leaves its own mark on history.”

	“Whether you're in or out of this industry, we all have a persona, even the ones that are rooted in authenticity, because self creation is an art form, and all of us, we perform genuinely,” she continued. “That's something that I deeply admire in both award-winning actors and actresses, and the drag queens of Toucans — they're kind of the same.”

	











	Cyrus also expressed her appreciation to support “stories like Avatar by my friend James Cameron — it's always cool to say that,” and thanked the room for “recognizing their work that I'm totally backpacking off of. They've worked on this movie for 16 years; I've been involved for like a month, and I get to go to all the same events!”

DiCaprio will still have his presence known, as a source indicates he will send in a recorded acceptance speech that will play after a tribute from his 'One Battle After Another' co-stars Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Leonardo DiCaprio will not be in attendance at the Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala on Saturday night due to restrictive airspace amid the ongoing political conflict in Venezuela. 


	He was set to be honored with the Desert Palm Achievement Award attached to his role in Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another. Despite his absence, DiCaprio will still have his presence known during the Film Awards as a source indicates to The Hollywood Reporter he will send in a recorded acceptance speech that will play after a tribute from his One Battle After Another co-stars Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti.

	DiCaprio is among a pool of A-listers who are slated to be recognized at the awards gala, including Timothée Chalamet, Miley Cyrus, Kate Hudson, Adam Sandler, Rose Byrne, Michael B. Jordan, Amanda Seyfried and Ethan Hawke, plus the filmmakers and casts of Frankenstein, Hamnet and Sentimental Value.


	Earlier Saturday, President Donald Trump said the United States would “run” Venezuela after leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife were seized overnight from their home on a military base, per the Associated Press. The U.S. president also shared a photo of Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima on Truth Social. 

	











	The Palm Springs International Airport released a statement on X in the afternoon on Saturday, indicating that an “FAA air traffic control issue is impacting SoCal airspace today. Departing flights are under a ground stop. Aircraft have been able to arrive, though some inbound flights have diverted and delays are expected.” 


	A few hours later, the airport released a follow-up statement, which read, “The FAA ground stop impacting flights at Palm Springs International Airport has been lifted. Departures and arrivals will begin to slowly resume, though delays are expected to continue as operations normalize. Travelers should check flights with airline.” 


	Also earlier on Saturday, One Battle After Another was named best picture by the National Society of Film Critics. DiCaprio's co-stars Benicio del Toro and Teyana Taylor were presented with the best supporting actor and actress awards, respectively, while Anderson nabbed the best director win. 


Variety was first to report that DiCaprio would miss the Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards Gala.

The absent award winner, honored for his work in Paul Thomas Anderson's ‘One Battle After Another,' sent in a recorded video with a message about the importance of original storytelling. 


							By 

	Chris Gardner



Leonardo DiCaprio was a surprise no-show at tonight's Palm Springs International Film Awards — the Oscar winner couldn't make his flight due to restrictive airspace amid a political conflict in Venezuela — but he sent in a recorded message that doubled down on the need for original movies and the theatrical experience.


	“I'm stuck on the East Coast,” DiCaprio said in an opening the clip following a tribute from his One Battle After Another co-stars Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti. “I wish I was there to celebrate with all of you. I'm truly grateful to be a part of it even from the distance.”

	DiCaprio, accepting the Desert Palm Achievement Award during a starry ceremony, then turned his attention to One Battle filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. “Thank you for inviting all of us into something bold and original, for never settling and for trusting the process enough to let the work become what it needed to be.”

	He continued by recalling when he first fell for storytelling on the big screen. “My father used to take me to the movies at the Vista Theater in Los Angeles. I lived four blocks away and it's now home to one of the last VistaVision projectors on earth. It was my neighborhood theater, it was where I first felt the power of cinema, and sitting in that dark room with my father, watching something bigger than myself, I realized how deeply movies can affect all of us.”

	











	DiCaprio said they shot One Battle on VistaVision, “not out of nostalgia, but out of a belief, a belief in scale and texture, and in the idea that movies are still meant to be experienced together in a theater. Right now, that belief matters more than ever. Original films are harder to make and harder to protect, but movies still matter. Not content, but cinema. Stories made by people meant to be shared in a dark room in a communal experience.”

According to the listing, the decision was made due to ""an adverse reaction to a prescription medication.""

	Jessica Lynch



Morrissey has canceled the first concerts of his 2026 touring schedule, calling off two California shows scheduled for early January.


	The singer was set to perform Friday night (Jan. 3) at Agua Caliente Casinos in Rancho Mirage, California, but the venue's website now lists the show as postponed indefinitely, with the change reflected on the day of the scheduled performance. 


	According to the venue listing, the decision was made due to “an adverse reaction to a prescription medication,” though no further medical details were provided.

	A second performance, scheduled for Tuesday (Jan. 6) at the San Diego Civic Theatre, has also been canceled. The venue similarly confirmed the cancellation on its website, with no rescheduled date announced as of publication.


	Ticket holders for both California shows have been advised by the venues to consult their original points of purchase for refund or exchange information.


	The developments mark Morrissey's first confirmed concert cancellations of 2026 and extend a long-running pattern of disrupted live dates in recent years, with multiple tours affected by postponements or cancellations tied to health, scheduling conflicts, or venue-related issues. 


	In September, the singer canceled a concert in Ottawa after citing safety concerns tied to a threat posted on Bluesky. The following month, a scheduled performance in Turkey was called off amid public backlash related to Morrissey's statements in support of Israel. 


	In November, he canceled his South American tour, attributing the decision to “extreme exhaustion,” and in December, he abruptly canceled what was set to be his first-ever concert in the Dominican Republic.

	











	As a result, upcoming dates on his calendar have often remained subject to change until shortly before showtime.


	As of now, Morrissey's next scheduled appearance remains set for Jan. 10 at the Boeing Center at Tech Port in San Antonio, Texas. That show was previously rescheduled from a May 8 date. Morrissey has not performed in San Antonio in more than 15 years; planned appearances there in 2016 and 2017 were rescheduled before ultimately being canceled.


	No additional details have been provided in connection with the January 2026 cancellations beyond the venue statements. Morrissey has not publicly commented on the Rancho Mirage or San Diego cancellations.

Leonardo DiCaprio, who is set to receive the 2026 Palm Springs Film Festival‘s Actor counterpart of the Desert Palm Achievement Award for his turn in Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another, will be forced to miss the event due to air restrictions resulting from the U.S. attack on Venezuela.


	“Leonardo DiCaprio is unable to join us in person tonight due to unexpected travel disruptions and restricted airspace. While we will miss celebrating with him in person, we are honored to recognize his exceptional work and lasting contributions to cinema. His talent and dedication to the craft continue to inspire, and we are delighted to celebrate him with the Desert Palm Achievement Award this evening,” the festival said in a statement.

	The Palm Springs International Airport also posted online about travel restrictions impacting Southern Californian airspace and leading to delays. Departing flights were noted to be “under a ground stop,” though arrivals have proceeded as normal or otherwise been diverted. (DiCaprio was vacationing off the coast of St. Barts with Jeff Bezos and his wife Lauren Sánchez during the New Year festivities.)


	The Sonoran Desert fete, which runs from Jan. 2-11, is hosting its film awards gala tonight at the Palm Springs Convention Center.


	Expected honorees and attendees include Miley Cyrus, Timothée Chalamet, Adam Sandler, Amanda Seyfried, Michael B. Jordan, Kate Hudson, Rose Byrne and Ethan Hawke, as well as the casts and filmmakers behind Oscar-buzzy projects Frankenstein, Sentimental Value and Hamnet.












	This year will also see the return of the festival's Book to Screen program, hosted in partnership with Deadline.


	PTA's rousing father-daughter adventure drama has made over $205 million at the box office worldwide and appears poised to be an Academy Award frontrunner. Earlier today, it was named the National Society of Film Critics‘ Best Picture of 2025. As the awards circuit heats up, DiCaprio will also vie for Best Actor at the Critics' Choice Awards tomorrow.


	In the early morning hours today, President Donald Trump oversaw strikes on Venezuelan soil in a proposed invasion of the South American nation. After toppling and capturing leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who have since arrived in New York to face charges — including of narco-terrorism conspiracy and destructive devices against the United States — Trump indicated his advisers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, would be tasked with running the country.


	As reasoning for the non-Congressionally approved move, the POTUS has cited Venezuela's rich oil reserves and its alleged role in drug trafficking to the U.S. The tactical decision has drawn harsh criticism and protests for its dubious legality, as some Democrats have branded the military incident an Iraq War deja vu. The Senate is prepared to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution to block the GOP leader from continuing its offensive in Venezuela.


Variety was first to report on DiCaprio's absence.

Hollywood actors have previously visited Venezuela, but not since the country really went off the rails. The first was Danny Glover, a veteran sympathizer of leftist regimes in Latin America, who received $10 million from the Venezuelan government in 2008 for a film on a Haitian Revolutionary hero that still hasn't been made.

In 2010, Sean Penn was given funding from the Venezuelan government for his charity work in Haiti. Like Glover, he too visited the presidential palace and spoke kindly in public of former President Hugo Chávez. Penn went so far as to say that journalists who called the socialist leader a dictator should go to prison.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Tony Dokoupil made his debut as CBS Evening News‘ permanent anchor on Saturday with an extended interview with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.


	“Great to be with you tonight, two days earlier than expected, with that major breaking news, news that could shape the year, maybe even the century,” Dokoupil said, as he introduce a half hour devoted to the U.S. invasion of Venezuela and its seizing of its leader, Nicolás Maduro.


	The latter half of the program was devoted to a live interview with Hegseth, identified as the “Secretary of Defense,” even though the Trump administration has rebranded the Pentagon as the “Department of War.”

	Dokoupil asked Hegseth about Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. would be running Venezuela, and asked what that means. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	“What does that look like? Does that mean we are going to see Americans on the corners of Venezuela? In the government of Venezuela? Are you prepared to have troops on the ground in Venezuela?”


	Hegseth's answer was not specific.


	“It means that we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms, and ultimately he will decide what the iterations are of that.” He later said that Trump “takes nothing on the table, so what happens next will be in the hands of Venezuelans to decide, but ultimately America will benefit, security wise and with prosperity we believe the Venezuelan people can as well.”


	At another point, Dokoupil also asked, “Is it about freedom, or is it about oil? At the press conference today, President Trump seemed to indicate that both were a factor.”


	Hegseth replied, “Freedom, security, prosperity. Of course what was done by Venezuela against American oil interests and oil companies is well understood and never should have happened. And President Trump is willing to recapture that. But it is also the security of our hemisphere.”


	Hegseth also was vague when Dokoupil asked whether they would seek congressional authorization “for a full-scale U.S. intervention to stabilize the country of Venezuela.” “Of course we will keep Congress involved,” he said, while insisting that the U.S. operation was a “law enforcement exercise” that did not require informing the legislative branch.

	











	Hegseth's sit down was a rather rare one with a mainstream broadcast news outlet, as he has routinely criticized the press since becoming Defense Secretary, and initiated new restrictions that led to the exit of much of the regular Pentagon press corps from the complex.


	Dokoupil invoked the U.S. invasion of Iraq 20 years ago, which bogged the U.S. down in the region for a decade. “Many of the president's own supporters tonight are wondering, how is this, this time around, going to be different, and how is it in the U.S. interest?”


	Hegseth claimed that it was “the exact opposite.” “We spent decades and decades, purchased in blood, and got nothing economically in return. President Trump flips the script. He says, first through strategic action we can ensure that we have access to additional wealth and resources … without having the spend American blood.


	Dokoupil was to have first taken the chair on Monday, with a planned two-week tour of American cities before returning to CBS studios in New York.


	But the U.S. action in Venezuela changed those plans. Dokoupol, who anchored from San Francisco on Saturday, will  broadcast from New York on Monday and the tour will start later in the week, the network said.

Trump just violated international and domestic law committing an oil heist and this tool lobs softball after softball. Pathetic.

CBS = complete BS

CBS is a laughing stock.

The anchor has quoted as saying he wants to be the voice of the average American and ask the questions that Americans want to know. Judging from this softball interview, it ain't gonna happen!

If Americans can steal other countries resources per PH's quote – “He says, first through strategic action we can ensure that we have access to additional wealth and resources … without having the spend American blood.” Then, what is to stop other countries for coming for us?

Tonight, stars descended on the Sonoran Desert for the Palm Springs Film Festival, running from Jan. 2-11, for the event's film awards, held at the Palm Springs Convention Center.

Some of the fest's honorees, as previously announced, include: Miley Cyrus, Outstanding Artistic Achievement Award for her new song “Dream As One” from James Cameron's in Avatar: Fire and Ash; Timothée Chalamet, Spotlight Actor of the Year Award for his performance in Marty Supreme; If I Had Legs I'd Kick You star Rose Byrne, Breakthrough Performance Award; Song Sung Blue‘s Kate Hudson and Sinners‘ Michael B.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


Tom Cruise and Paramount are cleared for takeoff on more Top Gun thanks to a trio of federal judges.


	Three and a half years after the now David Ellison-owned studio was first buzzsawed by a Top Gun: Maverick copyright infringement from the estate of the journalist who penned the piece the original flyboy flick was based on, an appeals court has shut the whole thing down — at least for now.


	“The question under the extrinsic test is whether the expression in Maverick is substantially similarto the original expression in “Top Guns,” and it is not,” writes Judge Eric D. Miller of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Reconfirming the April 2024 decision of  U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson, the unreserved January 2 opinion ruled against the widow and son of Ehud Yonay, who penned “Top Guns” from the now-defunct California magazine's May 1983 edition. Having sold his work to producers back in the day, Yonay, who died in 2012, was credited in the Reagan Era Top Gun. Common in the Ninth Circuit, the extrinsic test looks at comparison, context and, in a case like this, specific plot elements.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“The panel affirmed the district court's conclusion that Maverick did not share substantialamounts of the original expression of “Top Guns,” and plaintiffs therefore failed to establish a triable issue as to substantial similarity, as required to establish copyright infringement, Judge Miller also stated, writing for a trio that heard the appeal last year. “The panel concluded that there was a lack of similarity in protectable elements of the article, and plaintiffs did not establish an original and protectable selection and arrangement of elements.”


	The  aforementioned panel of three judges included Trump appointee Miller, as well as Andrew D. Hurwitz, and Jennifer Sung.  With the likes of thorn-in-many-a-studio-paw Marc Taboroff and studio go to lawyer Daniel Petrocelli arguing for their respective clients, the trio of Pasadena-based judges heard arguments back in early June. 

	











	Additionally, Judge Miller noted that “the panel held that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Paramount on plaintiffs' claim that Paramount breached its 1983 agreement withEhud Yonay by not crediting him in the 2022 movie.”


	One of a couple of suits that the Joseph Kosinski directed blockbuster has faced since its 2022 release, Shosh Yonay and Yuval Yonay's breach of contract, declaratory relief, and copyright infringement action claimed “Top Guns” rights reverted to them in January 2020 under copyright statutes. They alleged the $1.5 billion box office hit violated termination rights and Paramount, Cruise and  producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and now Par owner David Ellison had no standing to make the sequel to 1986's Top Gun. 


	While there is still a path for the Yonays to request a to stay the mandate and seek a petition for rehearing, it will be a dog fight. Yet, as has proven the case with Superman, Jack Kirby and other copyright suits, Toberoff rarely releases a case from his jaw until there is nothing left to knaw on. 


	“Under the panel's reasoning, the more vividly a journalist captures the truth, the less protection he receives,” the lawyer told Deadline today. “That result punishes exactly the kind of original expression copyright was designed to reward.”


	He went on to say: “We are evaluating all appellate options, including seeking en banc review or certiorari. This decision fundamentally misapplies the substantial similarity doctrine in ways that threaten creators across every medium and is particularly concerning in the age of AI.


	Sounding a lot like they did in 2024 when Judge Anderson found in their favor, Paramount kept it short and sweet. “We are pleased that the Ninth Circuit recognized that plaintiffs' claims were completely without merit, a spokesperson for the WBD bidding company said. 


	As for the next move for Paramount, a Top Gun 3 is getting primed for takeoff.

I'm no fan of MAGA Paramount but this is a very reasonable decision.

That's right Iceman, I am dangerous.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Pregnant Hailee Steinfeld shows off growing baby bump, hints at infant's name","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/03/celebrity-news/hailee-steinfeld-shows-off-baby-bump-hints-at-infants-name/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:07:00 GMT","

Hailee Steinfeld teased her baby's name while showing off her pregnancy in a sweet new baby bump photo. 

The “True Grit” actress shared a snapshot of her shadow in her Beau Society newsletter on Friday, which showed her growing bump. 

Alongside her silhouette on the wall was a framed drawing of a red heart reading, “Mothers are underrated.” 

In her 2025 roundup, the mom-to-be, 29, also shared an image of a baby onesie embroidered with “Baby Beau” and photos from her romantic May wedding to Josh Allen. 

“This past year — this holiday season included — has brought milestones, growth, and moments that have reshaped me in ways I'm still processing,” the “Sinners” actress wrote.

“Not all of them were loud or public, but they felt meaningful. When I think back on this year, the details blur, but the overall feeling doesn't. It's steadiness. A sense that I'm standing exactly where I'm meant to be.” 

Steinfeld added that she's “become more intentional about choosing what actually feels right” in the past year and revealed that she's been “asking questions that don't necessarily require answers or actions right away, but invite clarity over time.” 

The actress and Buffalo Bills quarterback revealed they're expecting their first child together in a newsletter entry last month. 

The “Hawkeye” actress made the revelation while sharing a list of “29 moments I love this year” to mark her 29th birthday on Dec. 11 — featuring a video of Allen kissing her baby baby bump.

Allen kissed her bump and the couple cuddled before turning their attention to a miniature snowman, indicating their impending arrival.

The “Bumblebee” actress wore a black jacket with the word “mother” emblazoned across the back and front to drive home the point. 

Steinfeld first sparked pregnancy rumors after appearing at the Governors Awards red carpet on Nov. 16, where she wore a pleated gray Stéphane Rolland frock that appeared to strategically obscure her stomach and midsection. 

One social media user commented at the time, “not to be that person but is she pregnant because this is giving hidden pregnancy dress.”

The pair was first romantically linked in May 2023, though they kept the relationship under the radar until going going Instagram-official in July 2024. 

The NFL star popped the question to the actress beneath an arch of flowers in November 2024. “♾️ 11•22•24 ♾️,” they captioned a joint post featuring a photo from the seaside proposal.

Jessica Alba locked lips with Danny Ramirez during a Mexico getaway as their romance continues to heat up. 

The “Honey” actress was pictured passionately kissing the “Captain America: Brave New World” actor on the beach in Los Cabos, Mexico on Friday. 

Alba wore a ball cap and tank top while leaning in to shirtless Ramirez, who rocked a pair of black swim trunks for the outing.

The couple was also seen sunbathing during their romantic getaway, with Alba modeling a skin-baring thong bikini while sunning her back as Ramirez looked on. 

Alba later donned a full-length sundress for a hand-in-hand walk on the beach with Ramirez. 

The actress previously shared photos with Ramirez from a tropical Thanksgiving holiday getaway, with a snapshot showing the swimsuit-clad duo walking toward the ocean hand-in-hand. 

At the time, she also shared pics with her kids Honor, 17, Haven, 14, and Hayes Warren, 8, and included several inspirational quotes.

The Honest Company co-founder, 44, and actor, 33, have been romantically linked since July. 

Though the pair was spotted kissing during a casual date in London in May, Ramirez wasn't publicly identified until they jetted to Cancún last summer.

They've since been spotted on PDA-packed date nights in both Los Angeles and New York. 

In September, she and Ramirez attended the US Open with her dad, and they made their red carpet debut a month later on a group outing at the Mill Valley Film Festival in October. 

The “Dark Angel” alum and estranged husband Cash Warren announced their split in January, with Alba filing to end their nearly 17-year marriage the following month citing “irreconcilable differences.”

The movie producer, 46, has since been seen stepping out with model Hana Sun Doerr, 25, and Seanna Pereira, 20. 

Warren reassured TMZ over the summer that he's “happy for” the “Fantastic Four” actress amid her romance with Ramirez.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Where Was 'Lost in Paradise' Filmed? Inside Lacey Chabert & Ian Harding's New Hallmark Movie","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/lost-in-paradise-location/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 03:54:22 GMT","

Hallmark Channel premieres the first of five Winter Escape movies on January 3, 2026, with “Lost in Paradise” starring Lacey Chabert and Ian Harding. 

According to Hallmark's synopsis, Chabert plays a “high-end fashion company” founder and Harding plays a chef in the new rom-com. While they're “marooned on a deserted island,” romance blossoms as they try to survive their tropical conundrum. Here's everything we know about the making of “Lost in Paradise!”

On September 24, 2025, Chabert revealed in a social media post that she had just returned from Fiji, where she spent a month filming “Lost in Paradise” with Harding. He joked in his Instagram Stories that day, “I truly can't believe @thereallacey put up with me for a month.”

Chabert later posted a selfie video from her car, excitedly telling fans, “I can finally tell you about what I've been doing this past month! Ian Harding and I filmed a movie in Fiji. I just got back a couple days ago, and it was just the most spectacular experience. So many stories. The people there are the most incredibly loving, kind people, and welcomed us with, just, open arms. And it was just such a special one and I can't wait to tell you more.”

In the days before the film's premiere, Chabert shared more via social media and in interviews about their remote filming location, including a video montage of them filming. According to the Australian government, the Republic of Fiji is “an archipelago of 322 islands” that about 900,000 people call home. 

Chabert wrote in her post, “When we had to use a rope to climb up a mountainside the first day of filming to get to set, I knew this was going to be a true adventure!”

Turns out that adventure included conquering her fear of snakes, Chabert revealed on “Good Morning America” before the movie's premiere, explaining, “When I showed up on set, there were not one but five snakes. I was counting them the entire time: ‘I'm keeping my eye on all of you!' But I actually faced my fear, and I ended up holding a snake by the end of the day.”

In addition to revealing their upcoming movie to fans on September 26, Chabert and Harding were featured in a photo posted that same day by Synthentic Cinema, the production company behind many of Chabert's recent Hallmark movies, including 2025's “She's Making a List,” 2024's “The Christmas Quest,” and 2023's “Haul Out the Holly.” 

When they weren't filming, the cast and crew stayed at the luxurious Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour, according to a post from Synthetic Cinema. 

On September 19, the company posted photos of its “Lost in Paradise” crew, writing, “A huge thank you to our incredible international crew from the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji.” 

The post continued, “What a team – fast, friendly, professional, and creative. The footage you all pulled together over the past month is nothing short of amazing. And to our cast – thank you for diving headfirst into the adventure with us. Your energy and spirit made this fun and unique rom-com truly special. Can't wait for everyone to see this movie! 🎥💫 Gratitude all around!”

Chabert reiterated that on “Good Morning America,” calling the experience “magical,” and gushing about the native Fijians they met. 

“I mean, the most incredible people, so kind, so welcoming,” she said. “We got there, out of the van, just getting to the hotel, they welcomed us with this ceremony and a song. It was just the kindest people.” 

“Pretty Little Liars” alum and Hallmark regular Harding also shared how much he loved filming in Fiji, posting a photo carousel on December 30 and writing that working with Chabert “was somehow even better than I imagined it.” 

He continued, “Thank you @syntheticcinema and @hallmarkchannel for having me, thanks to our little yet mighty crew that gave everything they had and became a fun little family for the three weeks we ‘worked' on the film. And Vinaka Fiji for welcoming us with open arms.” 

Overseen by popular Hallmark director Dustin Reikert, “Lost in Paradise” also features supporting cast members Lauren Gibson, Paul Hughes, Sean Miguel Perez, and James Trevena, who are all new to Hallmark. 

On September 19, Synthetic Cinema posted photos from what it called “the most epic Fijian wrap party ever,” hiding Chabert and Harding's faces since the movie had not yet been announced. The beachside party included food, drinks, and dancing with music from local performers. 

The production company's post said, “What an incredible journey – we've made friends, shared laughs, and created memories that will stay with us forever. Though it's hard to say goodbye, we know this is not the end…Fiji has a way of calling you back. A huge vinaka vakalevu to The Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour for being our home away from home and embracing us with kindness every step of the way.”

“Lost in Paradise” premieres on Hallmark Channel on January 4 at 8 p.m. Eastern time, and will be available to stream the following day on Hallmark+. 

That was an Awesome Movie. Lacey was AMAZING as always. The Scenery was Beautiful. Thank You Hallmark for another Fabulous Movie.

Marvel star Evangeline Lilly is bravely opening up about her health, more specifically, the brain damage she has suffered after a concussion.

Lilly posted a video on Instagram on January 2, detailing how she had a brain scan, and the results showed her brain is functioning at decreased capacity. “It's late on January 1, the first day of 2026, and I'm entering into this new year — the year of the horse —  with some bad news about my concussion,” she said. “The results came back from the scans, and I missed every area, and my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity.”

She continued, “So, I do have brain damage from the TBI, and possibly other factors going on.” A TBI refers to a traumatic brain injury, which was caused by a head injury. “Now, my job is to get to the bottom of that with the doctors, and then embark on the hard work of fixing it,” she shared. “I don't look forward to it because I feel, like, hard work is all I do. That's OK, my cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finished 2025.”

The “Ant-Man” actress is taking time to slow down and focus on her health and recovery. She ended her message with a hopeful outlook, thanking fans for caring, and expressing gratitude and feeling blessed “to be able to play one more day, one more year on this beautiful living planet.”

In the caption, Lilly shared her thoughts. “Verdict's in…I do have brain damage from my tbi. Comforting to know my cognitive decline isn't just peri-menopause, discomforting to know what an uphill battle it will be to try to reverse the deficiencies,” she shared. “Thank you all for always asking, for always caring, and for your continued prayers.“

The post was flooded with loving messages from fans and celebrities. Actress Michelle Pfeiffer reacted, writing, “You are a warrior. Nothing-not even this will defeat you my friend. “ 

Alyssa Milano also showed her support. “Thinking about you,” she wrote. 

Other reactions include, “Wishing you well Evangeline,” “SO MUCH LOVE YOUR WAY!!!,” and “No Evangeline no …This is the saddest news I could have in this new year. I'm crying for you I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart, please Evangeline fight with all your strength don't give up.”

Broadway performer Bret Hanna-Shuford, whose resume included roles in musicals like “Wicked” and “The Little Mermaid,” sadly passed away on January 3, 2026, according to an Instagram post from his husband. He was 46 years old.

Earlier this year, Shuford had announced he had been diagnosed with HLH and T-Cell Lymphoma. According to his husband's Instagram post, at the time of his death, Hanna-Shuford was surrounded by family, and he passed peacefully.

Hanna-Shuford had a thriving career both on stage and on screen. According to IBDb, he performed in nine Broadway shows and two touring productions. Fans may have seen him as Doctor Dillamond in “Wicked,” as the understudy for Eric in “The Little Mermaid,” in the ensemble of “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,” or in “Cirque du Soleil Paramour.”

He also booked roles in TV shows and movies. Shuford was in the 2019 Hallmark movie “Love to the Rescue,” in which he played the moderator. He was also in various New York City-filmed TV shows, such as “Only Murders in the Building,” “The Good Fight,” and “FBI: Most Wanted,” according to IMDb.

Many actors, influencers, and producers took to Instagram to express their shock and and sadness over the news. Kara Lindsay, known for originating the role of Katherine Plumber in “Newsies” on Broadway, commented, “Oh my heart just broke into a million pieces. Bret, you are so loved and will be missed here on earth. Praying for you, Stephen, and your sweet son. I'm so very sorry for your loss.”

TV actor Busy Phillips expressed deep sadness in her comment. “This news is absolutely heartbreaking and I'm so, so sorry for your loss. You both have brought such light and beauty and hilarity into the world and I'm just sending you and your family so much love and my deepest condolences,” she wrote.

Michael Buckley, a retired YouTuber, posted on his Instagram story to honor Hanna-Shuford. One post reads, “Oh Bret. Your love and sobriety and friendship were so important to me.” Another post features Buckley talking to the camera. “I am so sad to hear about Bret … I've known Bret since, I think, 2010, and I just always loved and admired him as a performer,” he said. “The thing about Bret that I've never really said publicly is he very much positively impacted my sobriety,” Buckley added.

Tony-winning producer Ken Davenport commented his sympathies as well: “Heartbroken and so sorry for your loss. He was light.”

Fans also shared their condolences. One wrote, “I am so incredibly sorry for your loss. My prayers are with you and your sweet son. May you feel the love of all those whose lives you touched. My heart is broken. You are in my heart today.” Another commented, “My heart is breaking for you all. I'm so sorry. Sending all of the love I can give.”

Hanna-Shuford will be deeply missed.

It's been a little over a month since Robert Irwin was crowned “Dancing with the Stars” Season 34 champion, and he has not stopped to rest. The wildlife conservationist is currently in South Africa and, as he embraces 2026 and all it has in store for him, he is also trying out a new look. 

Irwin posted a short video clip on Instagram on January 3, showing himself removing his stubble and leaving only his mustache. In the clip, he informs fans that he has had “a week off filming” and is about to go back, and that he decided to use the opportunity to shave. He shaves off his stubble but leaves his mustache for “a little prank on the crew.” He then puts on a pair of aviator sunglasses and compares himself to a character from the film “Top Gun.”

In the caption, Irwin shared his thoughts, writing, “New year. New look.” And fans have flooded the comment section with their thoughts. “Robert, you are the epitome of cool!” a comment reads. “It's giving Ron Burgundy,” another person wrote. 

Other reactions include, “You'll be the next top gun crew!,” “The full beard looked great!!,” and “I love that you're cracking yourself up in these videos.” Even the official “Top Gun” movie account reacted, writing, “Lookin good there.” 

However, it was the reaction from Irwin's mother, Terri Irwin, that really got fans' attention. “Potential Ned Flanders vibes,” she wrote, referring to the “The Simpsons” character. 

On January 1, 2026, Irwin celebrated the new year with a reel on Instagram showcasing highlights from 2025. The images and short clips include his time on “Dancing with the Stars” with professional dance partner Witney Carson, as well as his wildlife conservation work. In the caption, he wrote, “Best year of my life. Thank you.”

Fans applauded Irwin with reactions, including one from his sister, Bindi Irwin. “What. A. Year. Love you so much!” she wrote. 

Carson also reacted, writing, “Epic.” 

Other fan reactions include, “You had an incredible 2025. Ya know what? I think 2026 is gonna be even better!,” “Thank you Robert, for sharing your year with us!!,” and “The most deserving.” 

As 2026 started, Irwin also shared footage from his time in South Africa, and he looks to be embracing every opportunity and having a great time.

Evangeline Lilly revealed that medical tests showed she suffered brain damage following a nasty fall onto a boulder that the Lost actress endured last year.


	In May, Lilly wrote that she “fainted at the beach. And fell face first into a boulder,” while also sharing photos of her bloodied and injured face from the incident; the actress added she had been prone to fainting, or “blacking out,” since childhood.


	Lilly suffered a concussion following the incident, and later announced her departure from acting amid the injuries she suffered. In an update to fans on Friday, Lilly revealed the full scope of her “traumatic brain injury (tbi).”


	“Verdict's in…I do have brain damage from my tbi. Comforting to know my cognitive decline isn't just peri-menopause, discomforting to know what an uphill battle it will be to try to reverse the deficiencies,” Lilly wrote. “Thank you all for always asking, for always caring, and for your continued prayers.”


	Lilly added in a video that doctors performed brain scans on her and “almost every area in my brain is functioning at a decreased capacity.”

	“My job is to get to the bottom of that with doctors and then embark on the hard work of fixing it, which I don't look forward to because I feel like hard work is all I do,” Lilly said. “But that's okay. My cognitive decline since I smashed my face open has helped me to slow down and helped me to have a more restful finish to my 2025.”

	











	Michelle Pfeiffer, who starred alongside Lilly in the Ant-Man series, shared her support in the comments of the video, “You are a warrior. Nothing-not even this will defeat you my friend.”

This post contains spoilers for the series finale of Stranger Things. 


	The Stranger Things kids are all right. They're a little banged up and eternally trauma bonded, haunted by violent images of the things they've seen and the heartbreaking losses they've endured… but they really are all right. After five wild seasons, the series finale of Netflix's global phenomenon brought the journey of Hawkins' finest nerds to a dramatic close, vanishing Vecna for good. But how did it happen? And is the ending really as peaceful as meets the eye, or did the Duffer Brothers (who also wrote and directed the finale) leave a couple strategic loose ends? Let's rewind. 


	Season Five, Episode Eight, cheekily titled “The Rightside Up,” opens with the main gang gathered together for “one last fight” against Vecna and the Mind Flayer, as Mike (Finn Wolfhard) classically puts it. The military's Wolf Pack unit, led by evil scientist Dr. Kay (legendary Linda Hamilton) is on the hunt for them, while Henry/Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) still has Holly and several other kidnapped children trapped, their bodies wrapped up in the Pain Tree. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) and Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) go into the void of Eleven's mind to begin tracking down Henry/Vecna, explaining to a confused Max (Sadie Sink) that the only way to destroy him is by going into his mind (in a very “English, please?” micro moment). The rest of the gang heads up to the Squawk tower to the Abyss, ready to blow up the Upside Down once Vecna is dead, with some explosive help from Murray (Brett Gelman), and sideline aid by Erica (Priah Ferguson) and Mr. Clarke (Randy Havens). Easy, right? 

	











	Naturally, the plan goes awry fast. Eleven and Kali find Henry and the kids fairly quickly. But before they're able to destroy him, Vecna plays mental tricks on Hopper, who's guarding Eleven's body in the tank. First, he manipulates Hopper into seeing a vision of his late daughter. Then, he allows Hopper to overhear Kali tell Eleven that the only way to truly destroy Vecna is to sacrifice themselves, too. With Kali and Eleven still alive, there will always be a portal to the human realm, and the military will always be chasing them down. Then, Vecna tricks Hopper into shooting his gun and hallucinating that he's shot Eleven. Hopper desperately pulls her out of the tank, which yanks Eleven, Max, and Kali out of the Upside Down (and leaves little Holly in charge of saving the children and leading them to the cave where they can escape back to the real world, with Henry hot on their heels). Kicked out, Eleven and Kali head to the abyss instead, joining the others to fight Vecna there. But before they can do that, Hopper threatens to not detonate the bomb that will destroy the Upside Down if Eleven actually plans on sacrificing herself. “I have to end the cycle,” Eleven insists. From that moment on, savvy viewers know: There's no way Eleven is making it out of this finale alive. Season after season, she's had the weight of this world on her shoulders, forced to live a brutal existence as a result of her father's cruelty. How is there any possible way she could survive?

	Before we can contemplate these larger questions for very long, the Wolf Pack catches up to them. Eleven uses her powers to fight them all and disarm them — but Kali gets caught in the crossfire, shot in the stomach. “My story was always going to end here,” she says, accepting her fate and dying quietly. 


	Back over with the others, Will (Noah Schnapp) is using his connective power to get into Henry's mind. He sees the childhood memory that led to Henry becoming Vecna (which features a young Henry bludgeoning a mysterious scientist to death). “You're just like me, Henry, a vessel,” Will pleads with a tearful Henry. But Henry resists, determined to forever be the villain and to give himself over to the enormous Mind Flayer. “Will realizes he was led down the same path as young Vecna, but the only difference was that Will fought it and Vecna gave into that evil,” Schnapp said in an interview with Netflix.

	With that, Henry wakes up the Mind Flayer and sets off to kill Steve, Nancy, Robin, Dustin, Lucas, and Will. Eleven finds her way to them, jumping inside the Mind Flayer to destroy Vecna, who's controlling it from within, while Will fights telepathically from the outside, no longer empathetic or afraid to go toe to toe with his former saboteur. The rest of the gang does everything they can, shooting at the Mind Flayer and destroying it bit by bit. “Everyone contributes in some meaningful way,” co-creator Matt Duffer told Netflix. “In that sense, it also feels very much like the climax of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, where every character has a special skill, and they're able to bring it to this final fight.”


	They eventually bring the Mind Flayer down after Eleven pushes Vecna back with her telekinetic powers, impaling him on a jagged fang. The rest of the gang rushes inside to be at Eleven's side and save the children who are trapped inside on the Pain Tree, while Vecna burbles and gasps for air. He's alive, but not for long. Joyce (Winona Ryder) strides up to him with an axe in hand. “You fucked with the wrong family,” she says. Then she swings, chopping his head off and destroying him once and for all. (As she does it, the score swells and a montage of all the hell these characters have gone through plays, reminding viewers just how much has happened in the last decade, and how adorably tiny the cast used to be.)


	But they're not in the clear yet. Dr. Kay and the military are waiting for them, still eager to nab Eleven. In the midst of the chaos, Eleven pulls Mike into the void and tells him that she's going to sacrifice herself. As Prince's “Purple Rain” plays, the two of them reminisce on their good times and short-lived romance. “I will always be with you. I love you,” Eleven tells him, before sending him back into the real world and letting herself be destroyed in the explosion that destroys the Upside Down. 

	











	And then… that's that. No more Upside Down, no more military pursuit, no more anything. Hawkins is just another place. And, aside from Eleven, everyone lives. Now all they have to do is get ready for high school graduation and start planning the rest of their lives. (And somehow, in one of the more mind-boggling twists, Dustin manages to be valedictorian.) Graduation goes off without a hitch. Joyce and Hopper get engaged. The older kids — Robin, Nancy, Steve, and Jonathan — reminisce about their high school days, vowing to always be friends, in a very Gen X-, Reality Bites-coded scene.

	The series ends how it began — with the main gang, plus Max, playing a heated game of Dungeons & Dragons. During the game, Mike reveals that he thinks that before her death, Kali cast a powerful spell to protect Eleven, and that the Eleven who died in the explosion was just an illusion to permanently ward off the military. The real Eleven, Mike rhapsodizes, is off in a distant land, somewhere beautiful and free, with three waterfalls in the distance, just like he'd always hoped. This vision of his brings the rest of the kids to tears. The show takes things a step further, showing Eleven backpacking through nature, on her way to peace and safety. In their interview with Netflix, the Duffer brothers refused to reveal the truth about Eleven's fate. The story Mike tells is emotional respite for the Hawkins kids. “She lives on in their hearts, whether that's real or not,” Ross Duffer said. 


	Then the gang wraps up the game, so Holly and her friends can take over, adorably carrying on the Dungeons & Dragons tradition. It's full-circle and shockingly neat for a series that had as many twists and turns and secrets as it did. Almost everyone makes it out alive! There's no revelatory post-credits scene! No plot twist where Vecna's hand twitches in some place beyond the Upside Down, insinuating a never-ending ending! All is actually well. In a landscape of sequels and overly pillaged IP, the Stranger Things finale is finite and close-ended, the credits rolling once and for all.

The British military thought there was ‘basis in fact' to UFO sightings and wanted to get their hands on the ‘extraterrestrial' technology, previously secret files show.

Confidential memos from the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) within the Ministry of Defence warned that ‘unidentified aerial phenomena' (UAP) were a ‘potential threat' to the UK in the 1990s.

The documents – now in the National Archives in Kew – also reveal how Britain's most well-known UFO sighting at Rendlesham Forest was ‘confirmed' by US military personnel.

One internal correspondence from March 4, 1997 reads: ‘Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact.

‘It could be argued that UAPs pose a potential threat to the defence of the realm since we have no idea what they are!'

Intelligence officers appeared particularly concerned about the reports of large, silent, low-flying black triangles which came out of Belgium in their thousands between November 1989 and April 1990.

The reports sparked calls for Britain to try get hold of the technology.

The document noted: ‘A supplementary issue is the possibility of technology acquisition.

‘UAPs do not appear to use conventional reaction propulsion. 

‘The Belgian deltas (confirmed by the country's MoD) hovered for long periods and accelerated quickly to supersonic speeds, outrunning F-16s. 

‘If this represents real technology perhaps it should be acquired.'

Another briefing letter, marked ‘Secret UK Eyes B', acknowledged that the British military did not have the ‘reported technology'.

It added: ‘No matter the origin, the determination of the technology, and possible acquisition, is a matter for Defence Intelligence Staff [DIS].'

The correspondence added that ‘some reports described objects in terms of manoeuvre, speed and shape which lie beyond our engineering knowledge and that which could be reasonably expected from hostile powers.'

The file also stressed that most UFO reports were tenuous, with only a small number that could not be explained immediately.

The documents jokingly dismissed the possibility of alien life as part of fringe conspiracy theories.

The file reads: ‘Mention of UAPs is guaranteed to generate mirth and Little Green Men jokes, possibly because of the fringe element of “crazies”.'

A separate file from the British Military sheds new light on the Rendlesham Forest incident.

Dating back to December 1980, members of the US Air Force stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unexplained lights and a craft in the forest.

Witnesses, including high-ranking officers, described seeing a glowing, metallic, triangular object hovering and emitting strange beams of light.

The document says that the Rendlesham Forest ‘landing' was ‘confirmed by the US unit commander and others'.

It adds: ‘In both [Rendlesham Forest and Belgian] cases the UAP apparently did not use any conventional propulsion system and could hover as well as move at considerable speed. 

‘The French have always had an interest in this topic … and I am aware that there is an informal intelligence grouping in the US.'

The sighting has fuelled decades of speculation and conspiracy theories ranging from alien encounters to secret military tests.

One UFO expert, Philip Mantle, told Metro he is convinced something happened over those fateful nights in 1980 – but doesn't necessarily think aliens were involved.

The former Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association speculated that soldiers could have come into contact with ‘strange plasma' that caused ‘electromagnetic effects'.

The previously secret file also claimed to have a ‘Moscow report' that suggested ‘two military scientists are responsible for UFOs'.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","British military wanted to 'acquire alien tech' after black triangle UFO sightings","https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/british-military-wanted-acquire-alien-36495051","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:02:00 GMT","

Military intelligence pondered whether UAP technology ""should be acquired"" and they may have alluded to black triangle UFO sightings on the continent, historic documents suggest.

In eye-opening documents that emerged in The National Archives in Kew, Richmond, it has reportedly been indicated that a military intelligence unit in the 1990s took the often stigmatised topic seriously.

The Defence Intelligence Staff (the former name of Defence Intelligence, an organisation in the Ministry of Defence) was tasked with investigating ""unidentified aerial phenomena"" or UAP, an acronym that has also gained traction in modern times.

Indeed, in a memo (dated March 4, 1997), the author spoke of ""strange objects in the sky"" and acknowledged that there ""may be a basis in fact"" before suggesting they could even pose a risk to national security.

As reported by The Sunday Times, it reads: ""Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact.

""It could be argued that UAPs pose a potential threat to the defence of the realm since we have no idea what they are!""

In a further revelation, a report appeared to allude to the notorious black triangle UAP - the subject of various reports from people in Belgium from 1989 to 1990 - and it implied that they wanted to harness the technology.

In the report, which also refers to the incredible speed of the craft, it reads: ""A supplementary issue is the possibility of technology acquisition. UAPs do not appear to use conventional reaction propulsion.

""The Belgian deltas (confirmed by the country's MoD) hovered for long periods and accelerated quickly to supersonic speeds, outrunning F-16s. If this represents real technology perhaps it should be acquired.""

It wouldn't be the only case that the documents referred to, however, as mention was also made of the Rendlesham Forest incident, noting that it was ""confirmed by the US unit commander and others"".

It refers, of course, to the famous British case involving personnel from the US Air Force, situated at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk. Back in December 1980, they reported seeing bizarre lights and a UFO in the forest.

In reference to the two incidents, both Rendlesham Forest and the Belgian triangles, the document noted that the craft appeared not to have what was described as a ""conventional"" propulsion system.

It also detailed how they could reportedly hover and travel at ""considerable"" speeds and referred to a French ""interest"" in the subject, an American ""intelligence grouping"" and a so-called ""Moscow report"".

In terms of the latter, it was also implied that two scientists were ""responsible"" for these types of craft. In a further revealing letter, it divulged that the technology, if it was indeed real, would represent an innovation that they weren't in possession of.

Secret files reveal Defence Intelligence explored unidentified aerial phenomena in the 1990s, considering potential threats and technological gains.

Previously undisclosed Ministry of Defence documents show that Britain's military actively investigated the possibility that UFOs, or “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP), could represent real and highly advanced technology during the 1990s. According to files released at the National Archives in Kew and reported by Times UK, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) treated the phenomenon with serious consideration, prompted by reports that UFOs could outmanoeuvre any known human aircraft.

One memo, dated March 4, 1997, noted that “logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact,” and suggested UAPs could pose a threat to the defence of the realm. Intelligence officers particularly highlighted incidents in Belgium between 1989 and 1990, where thousands of witnesses reported large, silent, low-flying black triangles capable of hovering and accelerating beyond supersonic speeds. Officials even raised the possibility that the UK could benefit from acquiring technology that appeared far beyond its capabilities.

The documents also referenced the Rendlesham Forest incident of December 1980, when US air force personnel reported a glowing craft landing briefly near a Suffolk base. The DIS observed that in both Belgian and Rendlesham cases, the reported UAPs did not use conventional propulsion and exhibited manoeuvrability beyond known engineering limits. Other intelligence suggested international interest, including informal US and French inquiries, and even a “Moscow report” claiming that two military scientists could be behind the phenomena.

Briefing letters described the potential technology as something “we do not have” and stressed that whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial, further investigation was warranted. While acknowledging that research into UAPs might provoke ridicule, with jokes about “Little Green Men,” the DIS advised keeping an open mind, noting that discoveries of exoplanets and the age of other suns made it plausible that life—and perhaps intelligent life—could exist elsewhere in the universe.

The files also confirm that the DIS, renamed Defence Intelligence in 2009, officially ceased UAP investigations that year. Defence minister Luke Pollard told MPs in December 2024 that no dedicated team currently studies UFO reports, and the MoD has found no evidence that sightings over 50 years posed any military threat to the UK.

Times UK reports that the newly released documents offer a rare insight into a period when the British military treated the possibility of extraterrestrial technology with the same strategic seriousness as conventional weapons development.

Philip Wyatt, a Buckhead, Atlanta hairdresser by trade, also has a side interest that is more unusual than, say, knitting or pickleball: He seeks spirit activity as the head of Georgia Paranormal Investigations in the United States.

The volunteer group solicits clients via social media and website, though Wyatt isn't even sure calling them “clients” is proper since the group doesn't charge anything for its services.

“It's more like a passion or a calling,” said Wyatt. “This is not a profession.”

While he said he's a medium who can talk to spirits, that isn't a requirement for the other eight team members who help him with investigations.

“Everyone on our team really, at some point in their lives, had paranormal experience that was a catalyst to getting into the paranormal investigation world,” he said.

Tiffany Frazier, an Atlanta author of paranormal romances who once saw an unexplained shadowy figure as a child, said she sought out local groups online to help make her books more accurate.

“I needed to understand how the equipment worked and do the field justice,” she said.

One ghost hunting group she hung out with at a cemetery was “super rude” and seemed to be trying to “provoke” the spirits, she said.

But when she observed a GPI investigation, she was impressed.

“They were respectful” to the ghosts, she said.

Wyatt sensed her interest and asked her to join the team in 2023.

“Philip has a knack for remaining grounded, and that's critical when investigating,” Frazier said.

“Philip's goal is to make sure every explainable explanation is looked at first. Then and only then does he allow for paranormal explanations.”

Wyatt is well aware of skeptics. In a recent Gallup poll, only 39% of respondents said they believe in ghosts. But that is up from 32% in 2005.

He thinks the growth in ghost hunting shows on networks like the Travel Channel over the past two decades may have had an impact.

“People are more open-minded now than older generations,” Wyatt said.

Still, the stigma lingers. Sometimes people don't want their neighbours to know what's happening, so they request GPI arrive without identifying T-shirts.

“We'll pull into their garages and shut the door before unloading equipment,” he said.

And he doesn't love the way many shows portray ghosts as evil. To him, that isn't the case. Most ghosts, he said, are benign.

“Our No. 1 goal is to educate the public,” Frazier said. “Not everything is evil or demonic. TV shows tend to embellish. Most of our investigations are boring. We're often bored. We're there to gather data. We're not there to make a scene.”

Wyatt said the “scientific community does not consider paranormal investigation a science. Scientifically, you can't prove the human consciousness exists after bodily death. So what we're doing is based on hypotheses and theories”.

He himself saw his first ghost as a nine-year-old growing up in the mid-1970s in a religious household in tiny Statesville, North Carolina.

“I saw this figure of a woman standing next to my bed,” he said. “I started screaming bloody murder. My mum came in and got frustrated. ‘Stop making things up!'” he recalled her saying.

After that, whenever he saw a figure who wasn't supposed to be there, “I kind of ignored it. I didn't talk about it. I pushed it aside until I got older. And we didn't have the Internet back then. Our tiny library didn't have books on the subject.”

He grew up, moved to Atlanta and opened The Philip Wyatt Salon in Buckhead about a quarter century ago.

Wyatt eventually began reading about paranormal activity.

“I used to go on ghost tours and ghost hunts for fun,” he said. “That is different than paranormal investigating. Ghost hunting is thrill seeking. You don't do any kind of research. I'm interested in the science aspect of it.”

His group, which he began four years ago, doesn't just take any client. They hold Zoom calls and seek more details. They glean motivations. They have them fill out a questionnaire.

Wyatt hasbeen investigating paranormal events for 15 years, a pursuit that began after personal experiences sparked his interest.

People who seek GPI out often “just want to know that whatever is going on in their house, they're not imagining it”, Wyatt said. “We do not guarantee anything. We're not exterminators. We're evidence gatherers.”

The investigation usually takes several hours. Wyatt uses different equipment to pick up abnormalities that may indicate paranormal activity. He measures unusual shifts in radiation, temperature and sound.

They also set up cameras and record sound in hopes of catching video and, more commonly, voices.

“We try to pick up a sound we can't hear with our own ears below human hearing range,” Wyatt said.

When they arrive on a site, they tell suspected ghosts specifically that “we are here to communicate with them, not to harm them”.

Their goal is to ensure the ghosts and the homeowners have an understanding and don't bother each other.

Patricia Hill, who owns Kennesaw salon Patricia Hill Color Studio in a 137-year-old home, said for years, she would pick up overnight loud, unexplained bangs on security cameras.

Wyatt holds a Paranormal Detector Instrument, while in the centre is a Nuclear Radiation Detector Instrument.

In 2018, a piece of paper inexplicably flew off a shelf that was caught on video. Hill's research uncovered that the building was built in the 1880s by a family who owned indentured servants.

She found GPI on Facebook, and Wyatt checked her salon out in 2023. Wyatt's team found so many voices the first time, they came back again for more information.

Based on Wyatt's findings, Hill thought one of the servants may have been hanged on an old tree that still exists on the property. She put a cross there to honour the person who may have died.

“I kid you not, it's like a weight lifted,” Hill said after GPI came to her salon. “The space feels so much better. It doesn't have any mean energy. It feels light. I want the spirits to be free. I want them to be happy.”

GPI only gets a couple of queries a month and will do a handful of investigations a year. Sometimes they'll visit an existing public site known for ghosts and investigate for fun. They hold occasional library lectures.

Wyatt said he has been touched by and has held conversations with ghosts.

“I've been freaked out a few times,” he said. “It's more exhilarating after you come off the initial shock. This isn't for the faint of heart. You have to have confidence and a passion for learning.” – The Atlanta Journal-Constitution/Tribune News Service

As we have now moved into a new year, I thought it would be a good opportunity to look back at the old one, especially as 2025 proved quite difficult from the start, with the sad passing of my beloved father, back in January.

Over the Christmas period of 2024, his health started to fail him, and he spent Christmas itself in hospital, so our family celebrations, at that time, were a bit muted.

Luckily, we got him home for New Year, so we had our Christmas with him then. Sadly, throughout January, he had a few setbacks, and we finally lost him on the 28th. The weekend before he died, it was my partner, Sarah's, birthday, and we celebrated by staying in London, and watching a few shows...we had no idea what was about to happen, as he was being well cared for back in hospital.



We got home on the Monday, and, whilst I was having a quiet moment in the bathroom, I heard a scrapingnoise along the wall next to me, coming from the spare room. When I investigated, I found that an old, boxed up, artificial Christmas tree, that had been stored on top of a wardrobe, and never used, during all the years I'd lived with Sarah, had beendragged off, on to the floor...the next day Dad died.

I've taken that as a sign from Dad, acknowledging the fact that we hadn't had much of a Christmas that year, withhim being in hospital, but that, going forwards, we would have to celebrate without him, and still put our trees up and decorate our houses.

This one just gone, we tried our best, but it was very different without him. Throughout the year, there have been other signs of him still being around, and making his presence felt.

At the funeral, we played Fly me to the Moon, by Frank Sinatra, for him, as he loved sky watching, with his telescope...that song has been cropping up all year, in the most unexpected places, ever since.

We had his ashes interred, at Bristol Crematorium, in December, giving him a view of the Clifton Suspension Bridge. Being a civil engineer himself, he always appreciated the great work of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, so a fitting final resting place. We intendto visit him on his anniversary, this January, and I'm intrigued to see if he messes around with our Christmas tree again, the day before...

Still in January, on the 9th, we have one of my favourite paranormal anniversaries, the Battle of Bovey Heath. Back in 1646, Cromwell himself, led his soldiers into Bovey Tracey, in an attempt to stop the King's cavalry returning to Exeter, and trying to liftthe siege that the city was under, where the queen had retreated to, to give birth to her child, in a place she felt safe. The two armies clashed on Bovey Heath, and it was the Royalists who were defeated, having been taken by surprise by the arrival ofCromwell's troops.



It is the sounds of this battle, that are said to replay themselves on the anniversary. For the past two years, I've been planning to stake out the site to see if anything happens. On both days in question, it has snowed...conditions not suitable for any lasting vigil...which it also did on the day of the actual battle. So maybe, part of the alleged re-enactment, includes the weather conditions from that time.

At the moment, the forecast is for rain. Let's see how brave I'm feeling tomorrow (if you are reading this on the day of publication) as it's the anniversary...

Other odd events happened in Bovey Tracey, on the eve of the battle, that have left their mark...but if you want to hear about those, you will need to join me on one of my Ghost Walks, the next one I'm planning, is for the Half Term week in February,more details soon...

Talking of my Ghost Walks, last January, I launched my Brixham one. Starting at the Conservative Club, and then heading out around the Haunted Harbour. This has been well received, so much so that I've managed to host almost one a month, thusfar, and practically every week throughout the Summer Season.

If you fancy joining me, then the next one I'm planning, is on Wednesday 21st January...followed by the Wednesday in Half Term week. If you wish to book, then contact me via my email address davidtiptrips@gmail.com

Throughout last year, as well as hosting my Ghost Walks, I've also given talks at various locations, for groups and organisations. A couple of them have been in tandem with another fellow storyteller, Helen Bruce, who works for the DPA (Dartmoor Preservation Association), who I met at a networking session at Two Bridges Hotel, the previous year.

The first venture was held at Field System in Ashburton, an art centre and workshop, the owners of which were happy to host us. The talk was about The Devil coming to Dartmoor, and his various wicked exploits, along with tales of witchcraft and weird sisters. I came up with the idea of holding it on Good Friday, but, for our purposes, renaming it Bad Friday, as a bit of a publicitystunt.

I started to share word of it online, and one of the first reactions I received, was from an elderly lady in Totnes, upset that I was tainting the holy day by renaming it...I stopped promoting it in Totnes...

We had a few bookings, and, if the weather hadn't been so bad, we might have gotten a few more on the day, but there was a downpour on the evening, and people stayed away...so imagine my surprise when, as I drove into Ashburton, to park up, before the event, I spotted a crowd of people standing outside Field System holding up placards, as though in protest, and getting drenched for their trouble.

Straightaway, my mind went to that lady in Totnes. Had she brought her mates along, because she didn't like what we were doing? I parked up, and waited for Helen. She arrived, and had spotted them too, as she drove past. We both assumed thewelcoming committee was for us. So, we bravely prepared ourselves for having to explain our intentions with the talk...but, as we emerged from the walkway opposite Field System, there was no one to be seen!

Puzzled, we entered the studio, to ask the owner what that was all about. Laughing, he explained that the group had beengathering outside, ever since they had taken over the premises, protesting about something or other...this week it was for Peace in Palestine. I had spotted that some of the wording on the placards was in Hebrew, so something religious...but not about our Bad Friday talk after all. I must admit to feeling a bit disappointed about our non-confrontation, however, I will be careful where I use that title in future!

Alongside my tried and tested Ghost Walks, I set up several others this year, including one in Ivybridge, which is probably best done in the lighter evenings, as it involves an atmospheric trek along the River Erme, telling stories as we go. Getting dimpsy as we head out of the woods, is fine, but tackling it in the dark, isn't a good idea.

For Halloween last year, I added Moretonhampstead and Buckfastleigh to my repertoire. Both involve access to other buildings of interest, namely the old Bell Inn (now a studio for the MED Theatre Company), and The Valiant Soldier. All my walks will be included in my schedules, for the coming year, but I am also available for private hire, if you fancy your own walk for family, friends, or work colleagues. Just get in touch and see what sort of experience we can put together.

My services were also hired to provide walks as part of various walking festivals, including the DPA, who wanted their guests to experience my Witches Triangle walk, which proved very popular, and, as a result, should be happening again this year, closer to Halloween again. Hopefully other organisations will recognise my potential too.

We did get time to have a change of scenery last year, but still with an eye on the paranormal. One opportunity took us to Cheltenham, where we checked out several allegedly haunted locations, including Snowshill Manor, which also contains a collection of artefacts, once used for witchcraft purposes.

Some of the objects, which were found there, are now on display in the Witchcraft Museum in Boscastle, and we had a chance to check them out when we spent a weekend at The Wellington Hotel.

Whilst there, we led a bit of a ghost hunt around the property, heard some stories which we weren't aware of from our previous visits, and witnessed shadowy feet passing outside the room we were actually staying in...

Shortly after that visit, we had a family week away, to celebrate my brother's 60th birthday, our first family holiday without my father. We went to Dorset, staying in a barn conversion, in a village called Dewlish, just outside of Dorchester. The villageeven had its own ghost, but it didn't come out to play for us, sadly.

However, we did get to visit other haunted sites, throughout the week, including Athelhampton House, Corfe Castle, and Dorchester itself. Many brought back childhood memories from when we visited many years ago.

We plan to have another family holiday, later on this year, as my mother turns 90 in April, this time in North Devon. Other events, and weekends away, are already in the pipeline, so, as always, if anything interesting occurs, I will be sure to share it with you here.

For now, Happy New Spooky Year to all my readers!

Secret files reveal Defence Intelligence explored unidentified aerial phenomena in the 1990s, considering potential threats and technological gains.

Previously undisclosed Ministry of Defence documents show that Britain's military actively investigated the possibility that UFOs, or “unidentified aerial phenomena” (UAP), could represent real and highly advanced technology during the 1990s. According to files released at the National Archives in Kew and reported by Times UK, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) treated the phenomenon with serious consideration, prompted by reports that UFOs could outmanoeuvre any known human aircraft.

One memo, dated March 4, 1997, noted that “logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact,” and suggested UAPs could pose a threat to the defence of the realm. Intelligence officers particularly highlighted incidents in Belgium between 1989 and 1990, where thousands of witnesses reported large, silent, low-flying black triangles capable of hovering and accelerating beyond supersonic speeds. Officials even raised the possibility that the UK could benefit from acquiring technology that appeared far beyond its capabilities.

The documents also referenced the Rendlesham Forest incident of December 1980, when US air force personnel reported a glowing craft landing briefly near a Suffolk base. The DIS observed that in both Belgian and Rendlesham cases, the reported UAPs did not use conventional propulsion and exhibited manoeuvrability beyond known engineering limits. Other intelligence suggested international interest, including informal US and French inquiries, and even a “Moscow report” claiming that two military scientists could be behind the phenomena.

Briefing letters described the potential technology as something “we do not have” and stressed that whether terrestrial or extraterrestrial, further investigation was warranted. While acknowledging that research into UAPs might provoke ridicule, with jokes about “Little Green Men,” the DIS advised keeping an open mind, noting that discoveries of exoplanets and the age of other suns made it plausible that life—and perhaps intelligent life—could exist elsewhere in the universe.

The files also confirm that the DIS, renamed Defence Intelligence in 2009, officially ceased UAP investigations that year. Defence minister Luke Pollard told MPs in December 2024 that no dedicated team currently studies UFO reports, and the MoD has found no evidence that sightings over 50 years posed any military threat to the UK.

Times UK reports that the newly released documents offer a rare insight into a period when the British military treated the possibility of extraterrestrial technology with the same strategic seriousness as conventional weapons development.

	By Amanda Mullen

Supernatural ended in 2020, but the CW series has a lasting legacy — so much so that there's still talk of whether Season 16 could ever happen. Although the show gives the Winchester brothers and Castiel definitive fates, all of them have reputations for returning from the dead. So, apparently, does the story, as both the fans and actors seem open to revisiting it in the future. Supernatural Season 15's ending would be difficult to come back from, but if any series can accomplish it, it's this one.

While nothing is set in stone, Jensen Ackles told Collider that he's currently booked and busy, but “if it happens, then let's go.” Meanwhile, Jared Padalecki told the outlet that his “single answer is yes,” but it has to be the right time for it (via Collider). Their remarks don't mean a revival or additional outing will happen any time soon, or even at all. However, such comments make it clear that a return is on the table. Unfortunately, looking at Supernatural‘s greatest episode, it's likely a sequel or Season 16 would be a mistake.

When identifying Supernatural‘s best installment, fans are usually divided between Season 5's “Swan Song” and Season 6's “The French Mistake.” The latter certainly captures what made the CW series so successful; its self-aware humor, willingness to challenge the status quo, and performances all elevate it to greatness. It's no wonder several members of the cast told Entertainment Weekly it was their favorite. However, when it comes to the series' top-rated chapters on IMDb, Supernatural Season 5's finale comes in just above it. And I'd agree that it's the stronger offering in terms of satisfaction and emotion.

“Swan Song” brings five seasons' worth of storytelling together in a way that feels right, and it's one of the most devastating episodes of Supernatural to grace the screen. It's obvious that it was supposed to be the series' ending point, and it was Eric Kripke's final installment, even though the show continued past it. “Swan Song” highlights the characters' growth over the series' original arc, leaving them both in unexpected but fitting places before the credits roll. It also pays homage to the story and characters well, giving them emotional send-offs while working the series' signature humor in throughout. Had it been the final episode, it would have ended Supernatural on a high note. And that might have been better for the show in the long run, as much as it hurts to admit it. 

While “Swan Song” was a strong way to wrap up Sam and Dean's story, Supernatural‘s actual series finale is far less satisfying, and thus, more divisive. The biggest complaints about Season 15's “Carry On” have to do with the fate of Dean Winchester, who gets a pretty bleak conclusion after all is said and done. It's underwhelming after all the time put into his growth. His original ending — which saw him accepting that more was possible for him than dying on a hunt — did a better job of showing how he'd changed. As such, it was more pleasantly surprising. The series finale's heaven scene has also proven controversial, both due to characters not included and the fact that it doesn't tonally fit with the rest of the show. By contrast, “Swan Song” feels more grounded in everything Supernatural was. 

And looking back, it does seem as though the CW show missed an opportunity to end on an upswing — even if there were some incredible moments and episodes that happened because it continued. The ultimate result was that the series sacrificed a better ending for a more middling one. It risks doing this all over again if it ever continues. Season 16 would already have to jump through some major hoops to work, and it's hard to imagine what it could do to make new episodes feel fresh and necessary. With that in mind, Supernatural Season 16 could deliver an even worse, third ending. Perhaps the series should learn from its “Swan Song” mistake instead and leave well enough alone. We may miss the Winchesters, but it's not worth further tarnishing their legacy to bring them back.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","The Greatest Fantasy Drama of All Time Comes Back in a Big Way Following Shock Netflix Exit","https://collider.com/jensen-ackles-jared-padalecki-supernatural-streaming-success-peacock-top-10-january-2026/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 16:01:00 GMT","

Since the road ran out nearly six years ago, Supernatural fans have had one major way to reconnect with the beloved series — reruns. For quite some time, Netflix was the home to all 15 seasons of the Eric Kripke-created fantasy drama, but that all came to a screeching halt at the beginning of December. In the weeks since, Peacock has been enjoying an added boost of viewership thanks to the fan-favorite characters played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. And, although the streamer is home to plenty of original content for subscribers to fully dig their claws into, the spooky mystery show of yesteryear is claiming viewership numbers left and right, currently holding the number two spot on Peacock's Top 10.

When the series initially bowed out on November 19, 2020, the creative team did so without leaving any stone unturned. We won't spoil it for you here, but they essentially did everything in their power to give audiences an emotionally satisfying conclusion. However, as is the case with so many favorite titles, the Supernatural fandom has long been crying for the familiar faces to return to the fold for one (or many) more seasons. Hoping to satiate the dedicated following's cries, Ackles, along with wife Danneel Ackles and Robbie Thompson, struck out to deliver a prequel series, titled The Winchesters. The project focused on the younger lives of Sam (Padalecki) and Dean's (Ackles) parents, Mary and John Winchester, with Meg Donnelly and Drake Rodger in the roles, respectively. Although the series ran for just one season, it was a fun way to explore the lore of the Supernatural multiverse and bring characters like Dean, Loki (Richard Speight Jr.), Rowena (Ruth Connell), Bobby (Jim Beaver), and Jack (Alexander Calvert) back into the fold.

Most recently, Supernatural has jumped from screen to page in a brand-new lineup of graphic novels from Dynamite Entertainment. Penned by Greg Pak and illustrated by Eder Messias, the books pick up between the first and second seasons of the show, tagging along with the demon-hunting brothers on a handful of new spooky adventures. Longtime fans will likely agree that those first few seasons were the absolute gold of the series, meaning that the comics are perfect for those looking to get back to the heyday with some new material.

Get your wheels turning and burn some rubber with the Winchester brothers and their beloved Impala over at Peacock where all 15 seasons of Supernatural are now streaming.

Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","Researchers identify two psychological traits that predict conspiracy theory belief","https://www.psypost.org/researchers-identify-two-psychological-traits-that-predict-conspiracy-theory-belief/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 13:07:30 GMT","

New research published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology identifies specific psychological traits associated with a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. The findings suggest that individuals who perceive the world as fundamentally unjust and those who struggle with uncertain or ambiguous situations are more likely to endorse conspiratorial narratives.

Psychological research into conspiracy theories has expanded significantly in recent years. While many studies focus on specific beliefs, such as those regarding climate change or public health events, fewer have examined the broader mindset that makes someone prone to these ideas.

The authors of the new study aimed to explore the “cover-up” aspect of conspiracy thinking. This perspective involves the belief that powerful organizations conceal the truth and that skeptics are the ones who are misguided.

“I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so. Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up' perspective of conspiracy believers,” study author Adrian Furnham, a professor at the Norwegian Business School. “I have also long been interested in both beliefs about justice (Just World Theory) and more recently Tolerance of Ambiguity, which I believe is neglected in the Big Five framework. Both seemed obviously associated with conspiracy theories.”

The concept of “Tolerance of Ambiguity” describes how a person reacts to vague, inconsistent, or unclear information. The researchers wanted to test if the discomfort caused by ambiguity drives people toward the clear explanations offered by conspiracy theories. They also investigated how beliefs about justice in the world interact with these personality traits.

To conduct the study, the research team recruited 253 adults to participate in an online survey. The participants came from various countries, with the largest groups residing in Great Britain, South Africa, the United States, and Canada. The average age of the respondents was approximately 49 years old. The majority of the sample held a university degree.

To measure conspiracy mentality, the researchers used a ten-item scale. This scale included statements about secret organizations influencing political decisions and government agencies monitoring citizens. It also included items specifically designed to assess the belief that official narratives are deliberate cover-ups. One such item asked participants if they believed politicians usually hide the true motives for their decisions.

Participants also completed assessments regarding their demographic information, political views, and religious beliefs. They rated their level of optimism and whether they believed the world is generally just or unjust. Additionally, they completed a personality assessment known as the High Potential Trait Indicator. This tool measured six specific traits, including Adjustment, Competitiveness, Risk Approach, and Tolerance of Ambiguity.

The researchers found several distinct patterns among the participants. Demographic factors showed that younger individuals were slightly more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs than older individuals. Women also showed a slightly higher tendency to endorse these views compared to men. However, these demographic effects were relatively small compared to other variables.

Political and religious factors played a more substantial role. Participants who identified as more religiously observant tended to have higher scores on the conspiracy mentality measure. Similarly, those who identified as politically conservative were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories than those who identified as liberal. These findings align with previous research linking certain ideological frameworks to conspiratorial thinking.

The most significant predictors were related to how individuals view the world and process information. The study found a strong link between a belief in an unjust world and conspiracy thinking. Those who felt that the world is fundamentally unfair were more inclined to believe that powerful groups are secretly manipulating events. This sense of injustice was a powerful indicator of a conspiratorial mindset.

Tolerance of Ambiguity emerged as another primary factor. Participants with lower scores in this trait, meaning they feel uncomfortable with uncertainty or vagueness, were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories. The data indicates that for these individuals, conspiracy narratives might provide a sense of certainty and closure that is otherwise missing. When faced with complex events, a conspiracy theory offers a definitive cause.

“Important determinants of those who believe in many/all conspiracy theories is the extent to which they see Justice in the World as well as their personal discomfort with various forms of ambiguity,” Furnham told PsyPost.

The study also produced results that ran contrary to common assumptions. The researchers found that a participant's level of education was not related to their likelihood of believing in conspiracy theories. Holding a university degree did not appear to buffer individuals against these beliefs. Additionally, the personality trait of Curiosity, often associated with openness to new ideas, did not show a significant relationship with conspiracy beliefs.

These findings provide evidence that conspiracy theories may serve a psychological function for certain individuals. When people face uncertainty or feel a lack of control, they may experience anxiety. Adopting a conspiracy theory can offer a coherent explanation for confusing events. This helps reduce the discomfort associated with ambiguity by replacing chaos with a structured narrative of cause and effect.

The connection to the “unjust world” belief is also significant. Belief in a just world is often considered a coping mechanism that helps people navigate difficulties. It allows people to believe that good things happen to good people. On the other hand, viewing the world as unjust can lead to feelings of powerlessness. Conspiracy theories may validate these feelings by attributing misfortune to the actions of malevolent actors rather than random chance.

Individuals with a low tolerance for ambiguity often exhibit specific cognitive patterns. They may seek to avoid uncertainty by adhering to rigid or simplistic interpretations of events. This is sometimes described as a black-and-white view of the world. Conspiracy theories often present a clear distinction between “good” victims and “evil” perpetrators, which appeals to this cognitive style.

The researchers note that this intolerance of ambiguity is not just a preference but a personality trait that influences how people process threats. Previous studies have shown that people who are uncomfortable with uncertainty may react more strongly to perceived threats. In this context, a conspiracy theory acts as a tool to manage the anxiety produced by the unknown. It transforms a vague threat into a specific enemy that can be identified and blamed.

As with all research, there are some limitations to note. The sample size was relatively small, which limited the statistical power to detect smaller effects for some variables. Additionally, the participants were predominantly middle-aged professionals. This specific demographic group may not fully represent the general population.

Future research could benefit from larger, more diverse samples to verify these associations. The researchers expressed an interest in further exploring the function that conspiracy theories serve for believers. They hope to investigate how people discover these theories and how they form groups of like-minded believers. Understanding the social dynamics of these beliefs remains a priority for future investigation.

The lack of association between education and conspiracy beliefs suggests that intelligence is not the primary factor at play. Smart, educated people are also susceptible to these narratives if they have specific personality traits. This challenges the stereotype that conspiracy theorists are simply uninformed. It points instead to deep-seated psychological needs for structure and justice.

The study, “Conspiracy Theory Mentality, Injustice and Tolerance of Ambiguity,” was authored by Adrian Furnham, Stephen Cuppello, and David S. Semmelink.

Vaccines? Who needs them? Raw milk? Drink up. The wellness space is being infiltrated by conspiracy theorists and the right wing. Shannon Mahanty investigates the rise of misinformation for the worried well

This June, in the rolling British countryside, like-minded festival-goers gathered for four days in search of a good time. By day, they ate organic food, went to breathwork classes, and attended talks by notoriously contrarian speakers. By night, they watched guitar bands, danced to live DJ sets and sat around campfires until the early hours. But Glastonbury this was not. Sounds Beautiful in Dorset is a festival for the so-called ‘Freedom movement', a loose coalition of natural-health advocates and conspiracy theorists. Amid the singing and the cider were influencers promoting  questionable diets, a whole host of vaccine conspiracies – and definitely no 5G.

Ever since the Covid pandemic, when the world became more isolated, more anxious and more online, wellness and conspiracy cultures have been dramatically colliding. What often starts as an innocuous desire to enhance mental and physical wellbeing can lead to a rabbit hole of  misinformation, especially online, as social media users are funnelled by algorithms and served increasingly extreme content, from drinking your own wee as a cure for Covid to treating cancer with coffee enemas. Increasingly in the US and the UK, there is a political edge; extreme wellness ideas are being co-opted by right-wing movements who frame these choices as acts of resistance against government control and a ‘woke' culture that advocates for evidence-based healthcare.

Lee Tilghman is a former wellness influencer who recently published her memoir If You Don't Like This, I Will Die, detailing the tolls of internet culture. What started as posting shots of smoothie bowls and herself wearing athleisure quickly became something darker. ‘I unlocked an entire content strategy', she writes in the book. ‘The more personal, the better. The more extreme, the better. I started going hard on “I quit” posts: why I quit coffee, why I quit caffeine, why I quit sugar. These posts performed so well, and the algorithm seemed to favour them. My account was featured a few times on the app's Explore page, which seriously boosted my follower count.' 

Tilghman wasn't just posting spurious content, but consuming it. She writes about only eating bananas for two days, after seeing claims online of the diet's ‘detoxing' impact, and applying menstrual blood to her face (#periodbloodfacemask has over seven million views on TikTok). In 2019, she took a hiatus from Instagram, recognising she had developed orthorexia, a proposed eating disorder characterised by an excessive preoccupation with only consuming foods deemed ‘pure' or ‘healthy'. ‘What drew me to wellness was the promise that I could find nirvana, perfection and control, if I just stuck with it and went deeper,' she says. ‘The darkness came when I realised this was an empty promise.' A few months later she returned to social media as a critic of online wellness culture, warning other women against getting drawn in. ‘Finding my own definition of health, wellness and self-care, away from my audience, away from the opinions of others, away from the spotlight, grounded me in the place I am today – much more nuanced and not so extreme.'

A 2024 UK Parliamentary report found that people are more likely to believe  disinformation if they are repeatedly exposed to it, if it aligns with pre-existing beliefs, provokes an emotional response, or comes from a source they trust. ‘By aligning themselves with what is “natural” and “pure”, untainted by greed and  corruption, alternative-health influencers who promote conspiracy theories and misinformation are able to position themselves as more enlightened than the general  public,' says Stephanie Alice Baker, an  author and academic who studies the spread of false information. ‘[They are] therefore able to help their followers  to “see the light” as they embark on a personal journey of self-actualisation and spiritual awakening.'

Take the recent controversy around raw milk. Despite there being little-to-no scientific evidence of its purported health benefits (including better digestion and boosting your immune system), public figures such as Gwyneth Paltrow and US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr have touted unpasteurised milk (that hasn't been heat-treated to prevent disease) as a kind of superfood. In reality, drinking raw milk increases a person's chance of catching serious infections; a US study found that unpasteurised dairy products cause 840 times more illnesses than those that are heat-treated. And yet, the myth persists with the top 500 #RawMilk TikToks amassing over 231 million views.

In the UK, the pandemic fractured public trust in an already over-stretched NHS, and in the years that followed  a growing proportion of the population is rejecting evidence-based medical advice in favour of wellness misinformation. In the US, the raw-milk trend is causing rising hospitalisations according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK, milk misinformation is  also running rife. Last year, Arla Foods announced the launch of Bovaer, a synthetic compound that inhibits methane  production in dairy cows and could  potentially reduce methane emissions by 30%, which would have huge implications for the climate crisis. But champions of  raw milk were quick to react with unsubstantiated claims that the additives caused infertility and that shadowy elites were using it to control the population. Videos spread on social media of users pouring milk down the toilet in protest.

When it comes to health concerns, many of us turn to the internet to seek advice or find community, but dangerous health and wellness content proliferates  in digital spaces that aren't properly  regulated. Earlier this year, Netflix's Apple Cider Vinegar followed the true story  of Belle Gibson, an Australian wellness influencer who faked a brain tumour and told her followers she cured it through nutrition and alternative therapies. She gained 200,000 followers in a year, launched an app and landed a recipe-book deal before a whistleblower and an investigative journalist ultimately exposed her as a fraud. 

Perfidious influencers such as Gibson and yoga-teachers-turned-cult-leaders Guru Jagat and Bikram Choudhury (the subject of HBO and Netflix documentaries respectively) largely target women by exploiting insecurities around health – from weight loss to fertility issues and menopause – to promote products under the guise of empowerment. ‘For decades, women's health has been under-researched, under-funded and under-diagnosed,' says Dr Tosin Sotubo-Ajayi, a medical doctor and women's health advocate. ‘The online world has given women a voice to share their experiences and speak out. People often feel let down by traditional healthcare, and this may be pushing them to seek advice elsewhere – such as online spaces where misinformation thrives.'

‘I do see things online – women talking about whether or not to eat their placenta, or only eating raw foods – but I choose to actively avoid that kind of content,' says Delia Baker, a London-based yoga teacher and acupuncturist. In being discerning in the accounts she follows, Baker's algorithm hasn't funnelled into conspiracyland, but she recognises how wellness ideas taken out of context can adopt a more dangerous form. ‘Our attention spans are very short on social media. For example, ideas from Chinese medicine about eating less in the evening make a lot of sense when you talk it out, but if you see a snapshot online about intermittent fasting, it ignores the fact that it can impact women's hormones and reproductive health differently to men.'

The wellness-to-conspiracy-theorist pipeline is often associated with the post-truth era of US politics. Billionaire CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have created a digital climate where conspiracy theories can thrive by removing fact-checkers from social-media platforms for their own political gain. Reform UK is tapping into the same political playbook, appealing to a disenfranchised audience by amplifying conspiracy theories. Several candidates have shared misinformation online, from anti-vaccine content to claims that the climate crisis is a hoax. Andrea Whitehead, who stood as a candidate for Leeds West and Pudsey last year, shared ‘chemtrail conspiracy' content, arguing that plane exhaust fumes are actually a means of controlling the weather and food supply.

In 2021, an NHS nurse was struck  off for posting anti-vaccine content. Kate Shemirani (one of Sounds Beautiful festival's headline acts) bills herself as a ‘Natural Nurse in a Toxic World' and played a key role in organising anti-lockdown protests during the pandemic. She's compared NHS staff to Nazi war criminals and charges hundreds of pounds for ‘natural health' consultations. Last year, her daughter Paloma Shemirani died aged 23 after refusing chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which doctors believed she had an 80% chance of  surviving if treated.  

‘It's almost a year since my sister died – I don't think I've had a single night's sleep where I haven't had nightmares about what I could have done differently,' says Sebastian Shemirani, who, alongside his brother Gabriel, has been campaigning to combat health misinformation by calling for the government to tighten policies and introduce stricter financial regulation of the wellness market. 

Sebastian says his mother's world view has always been shaped by paranoia and, as teenagers, he and his brother started to question her behaviour and break away from the same ideologies. ‘She's always been highly  narcissistic and contrarian – conspiracy theories are a manifestation of her existing personality traits.' In July, Kate Shemirani told an inquest into her daughter's death that paramedics were to blame, denying accusations that she influenced Paloma's decision to refuse chemotherapy.

For Sebastian, the issue isn't only legal, it's gendered – conspiracy theories target our insecurities. Get-rich-quick schemes and misogynistic influencers such as  Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson prey on men's feelings of vulnerability and loss of status. ‘Women's conspiracy theories are often based around health,' he says. ‘These people will connect ideas together when it's profitable for them to shift you over. It's everything on the pipeline of useless to harmful – from yoga mats and dodgy  supplements to, ultimately, anti-vaccine and anti-medicine ideology, which is what happened to my sister.' Their story is the subject of BBC Panorama's ‘Cancer Conspiracy Theories: Why Did Our Sister Die?', a documentary that follows the brothers' campaign to combat deadly wellness misinformation.

In the wake of pressure from the likes of Sebastian and Gabriel Shemirani, the UK government is taking online misinformation more seriously. In March, Ofcom gained the power to fine tech companies up to 10% of their global revenue if they fail to stop or take down harmful content. New measures are also being introduced to improve algorithmic transparency and address AI-generated content.

‘We need to create non-judgemental, safe spaces where curiosity is welcomed, but gently guided by credible information,' says Dr Sotubo-Ajayi. ‘We have a real res- ponsibility here to listen to people's needs and address them with evidence-based information. Wellness has to stop being marketed as a luxury and start being reframed as a basic right.'

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Unsolved+Mysteries","12 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries In Star Wars, Ranked","https://www.looper.com/2062466/star-wars-unsolved-mysteries-ranked/","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 17:18:00 GMT","

George Lucas' epic science fiction fantasy ""Star Wars"" universe spans the rise and fall (and rise again) of intergalactic civilizations, painting in exhaustive detail every corner of society; from the bustling metropolis of Coruscant to the wild worlds of the Outer Rim, and everything in between.

Over the course of every film, TV show, cartoon, novel, comic book, video game, role playing game, and collectible trading card, he and LucasFilm have fleshed out everything you could ever think to ask about how the world of ""Star Wars"" works. And with the Walt Disney Corporation keeping us busy with even more sequels, prequels, tie-ins and spin-offs, we now have answers to everything from what happened to Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison) after he fell in the Sarlacc Pitt — he became the Daimyo of Mos Espa — to how Han Solo (Harrison Ford) got his name — it was bestowed on him by the ""Star Wars"" equivalent of the TSA.

And yet, there are still many mysteries with far reaching implications for the galaxy. In this list, we'll lay out 12 of the biggest lingering questions that have yet to be answered.

Cassian Andor's (Diego Luna) journey from criminal outcast to die-hard rebel starts in his childhood, where we find young Kassa as one of the sole survivors of a Republic mining operation that left a small band of children and teens behind to eke out a living on the planet Kenari. With him in this ""Lord of the Flies"" village was his younger sister Kerri (Belle Swarc), but when Kassa joins an expedition to investigate a crashed ship, it ends with Kassa being taken off the planet by intergalactic scavengers Maarva (Fiona Shaw) and Clem Andor (Gary Beadle).

Kassa grows up to become Cassian, and the opening moments of the critically acclaimed series ""Andor"" chart his quest to reunite with his sister. Cassian arrives at a brothel on the planet Morlana One looking for Kerri, but the dead end sets off a chain reaction that ultimately kickstarts Andor's destiny to fight the Empire.

The question of what happened to Cassian's sister looms large over the show's first season, but it's never fully resolved what exactly happened to Kerri and the other kids on Kenari. His adoptive mother Maarva implores Cassian to stop looking, telling him that everyone on Kenari was killed shortly after she rescued him, but Cassian won't give up hope.

Is Maarva right about what happened to Kerri and all the other children on Kenari? Or was Cassian right to believe that he could be reunited with his sister? ""Andor"" creator Tony Gilroy had an idea for an answer, but decided that leaving the mystery open was more powerful for Andor's story. That's a good reminder to us all that some mysteries really are best left unresolved.

Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) looms large over the entirety of J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens."" The Jedi Master has turned into a recluse, and young adventurer Rey (Daisy Ridley) is tasked with tracking him down. Along the way, she crosses paths with Maz Kanada (Lupita Nyong'o) where she discovers Luke's (Mark Hamill) blue lightsaber hidden in the basement of the Mos Eisely-like Takodana Castle.

Little is known of how the lightsaber made it into Maz's possession after it fell into the bowels of Cloud City, back when Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) chopped off Luke's hand at the climax of ""Star Wars Episode II: The Empire Strikes Back."" The Skywalker saga came to a dramatic close with Rey taking the mantle of the Skywalker family, but Maz never let slip how exactly she found herself in possession of the lightsaber.

""The Acolyte"" was one of Disney+'s most ambitious shows, featuring a hefty $230 million price tag. The series told the story of twins Osha and Mae Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg). Osha turns to the light side of the Force, thanks to Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), while her twin is drawn to the dark side, represented by the Sith Lord Qimir (Manny Jacinto).

But all that flipped in the season finale, with Osha becoming disillusioned after discovering Sol's lies. Qimir then wipes Mae's memories, and we're left with the promise of Mae chasing after her sister to save her from the dark side.

Despite its mixed reception from fans, the series was well regarded for its interesting and novel depiction of Jedi, and for giving us our first live action foray into the High Republic while also teasing connections to the prequel era. Fans of that era were gripped by the appearance of Qimir's master, Darth Plagueis.

The fate of Mae and Osha's story was left on a tantalizing cliffhanger in the season finale, but no one expected this would turn out to also be a series finale, with Disney canceling the series, reportedly because of its budget. We likely will never see the final fate of the twins' journey, but the promise of the Expanded Universe means that one day, we'll see Qimir and his beefy arms dual wielding again.

The origins of ""Star Wars"" come from George Lucas' fascination with real world mythology, but within the galaxy itself, these are usually represented through flesh and blood characters interacting with metaphysical forces. That line gets blurred on the planet Mortis, first introduced on the animated series ""The Clone Wars.""

A trio of episodes in the series' third season finds Anakin Skywalker (voiced by Matt Lanter), Obi-Wan Kenobi (James Arnold Taylor) and Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) marooned on a mysterious planet where they encounter a family known as the Mortis gods. These beings are physical embodiments of the Force, with the brooding Son (Sam Witwer) representing the dark side of the Force, the glowing Daughter (Adrienne Wilkinson) representing the light side, and their elderly Father (Lloyd Sherr) standing between them as the keeper of the balance.

Anakin discovers the reason they have arrived on Mortis is because the Father wants him to take over his position, keeping the peace between his Son and Daughter and echoing the destiny of a Chosen One (more on that later) that promises to see him bring balance to the Force entire. Ultimately, the Father fails to maintain that balance, and his death leads to the disappearance of Mortis, with Anakin and his partners losing all memories of what happened.

We've seen hints of them in both ""Rebels"" and ""Ashoka,"" but the Mortis gods themselves have yet to appear again, giving us no answers as to whether their appearance was literal, or if they were merely a representation of the internal battle waging inside of Anakin's soul.

The story of ""Andor"" follows individual rebellions snowballing into all out civil war, and we got one of the most thrilling sequences in Star Wars history in the climactic prison break of ""Andor."" After finding himself locked up in the Narkina 5 prison, Andor gets to work convincing his fellow prisoners that they need to find a way out of their shackles. But Kino Loy (Andy Serkis), a fellow prisoner tasked with maintaining order on his floor, refuses to take part in their seditious plans. That is, until he discovers that the Empire has no intentions of allowing any of them to leave when their prison sentences are up.

Cassian kicks off the revolt, but it's only with Kino's gravitas that they are able to inspire the entire Narkina prison population to take up arms. They successfully send the Imperials into hiding and make it to the prison's exit. As Andor prepares to jump into the waters to freedom, he takes one last look back at Kino, who makes a heartbreaking admission: ""I can't swim.""

Before Cassian can reply, he gets knocked into the water, leaving Kino behind on the platform. What becomes of this unsung hero of the Rebellion, we will likely never know — despite pleas from fans asking to be sure he's okay. In the end, his story echoes Luthen Rael's (Stellan Skarsgard) own journey. He burned his life for a sunrise he'll never see.

There is no one in the galaxy quite like Yoda (puppeted by Frank Oz). The aged Master led the Jedi from the High Republic through to the fall of the Republic at the hands of Darth Sidious (Ian McDiarmid) with his sage wisdom and surprisingly agile fighting style.

But despite appearing in virtually every episode of the Skywalker Saga, we know next to nothing about Yoda and his species of little green Muppets. Over time, the ranks of what we can only call Yodas has grown. First, with the prequel films introducing the female Yaddle (voiced by Bryce Dallas Howard in ""Tales of the Jedi"") and next, the baby Grogu in ""The Mandalorian.""

Based on the very limited information we have about Yoda's species, we can guess that they are all extraordinarily adept at their Force powers. Perhaps the upcoming film ""The Mandalorian and Grogu"" will shed light on one of the biggest mysteries in ""Star Wars."" Perhaps we'll finally see a whole planet of Yodas. Likelier, they'll remain a one-of-a-kind beings in this galaxy far, far away.

At the conclusion of ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker,"" Rey succeeds where her mentor, Luke, had failed, redeeming Ben Solo (Adam Driver) from the dark side of the Force and returning him to the light so they could vanquish Darth Sidious once and hopefully for all.

The film then returns to Tatooine, where the saga began. Rey buries Luke's lightsaber while choosing to carry the Skywalker name into the future. Here, the film positions Rey to carry on Luke's legacy, this time by challenging the other failure he had suffered: rebuilding the Jedi Order.

Luke's attempt was well-documented throughout the Legends non-canon universe, allowing the Jedi Master to take on a new class of young apprentices, but whether or not Rey will succeed where Luke failed in the canon Disney sequel universe is still a mystery.

We remain potentially due to see first hand how it goes in a new Rey film. Daisy Ridley is optimistic about her return, although we haven't heard any solid updates on the project since it was announced in 2023.

This one is a little more philosophical than others, but given the proliferation of artificial intelligence, it's become all the more important: are droids people?

Droids make up some of the galaxy's most colorful characters, from our hero R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) to burly K-2SO (Alan Tudyk), but the nature of droid sentience has never been fully resolved. Some stories allow droids to be as fully realized as their organic counterparts, with all the telltale signs of sentience that would allow a droid to pass the Turing Test. But other stories feature droids that are little more than walking appliances, no more alive than a refrigerator.

The current canon understanding of droid sentience is that, as a droid operates, it develops personality quirks that accumulate over time, which is meant to explain how a droid can become as fussy as C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). If you wipe a droid's memory, then it would return to its base operating personality. Except we see that C-3PO and K-2SO are quirky from the moment they're first turned on, so that explanation doesn't actually work.

The subject has been rarely broached in either the official canon or the previous Legends continuity, except in ""Solo"" with L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) attempting to lead a droid rebellion. It's largely played off as a joke.

Considering that slavery is outlawed in the Galactic Republic, this is a big question. If droids are indeed sentient, then their involuntary servitude at the hands of organic beings is a matter of intergalactic civil rights, and deserves to be resolved. Droids of the galaxy, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!

For as much as we know about the life, death, rebirth, and redemption of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), we know shockingly little about his birth. According to the story Anakin's mother Shmi (Pernilla August) tells Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,"" Anakin has no father, so what are we to make of his virgin birth?

The theories about Anakin's immaculate conception fall largely into two camps: one of the light side of the Force, and the other on the dark. Either Anakin is a fated product of the Force itself, a being who will bring balance (either by killing his master or by killing the Jedi, your call in this argument). Or he is a product of the dark side itself. The theory goes that when Palpatine told Anakin that Darth Plagueis discovered how to manipulate the Force into creating life, the product of that ""unnatural"" power was Anakin himself.

This was just a theory for years, until a recent ""Darth Vader"" comic depicted Vader's journey through a dark side vision that finds Sidious looming over his pregnant mother. Was this proof Palpatine fathered Anakin? Or was it simply the dark side toying with him? The answer is still a mystery.

""A Chosen One shall come, born of no father, and through him will ultimate balance in the Force be restored."" That is about all that we know about the prophecy that foretold the rise of Anakin Skywalker. But where this prophecy comes from, and how it came to be misread by the Jedi Order, has never been resolved.

To complicate matters further, the canon reference text ""The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire"" by Chris Kempshall tells us that the Sith have their own prophecy of the Sith'ari, which tells the familiar story of ""the coming of one who was born of the Force itself and who would wield tremendous power.""

Did the light and dark side of the Force uncover these prophecies independently? Or did they both use the same source material to come to wildly different conclusions? James Mangold's upcoming Star Wars film will reportedly explore the origins of the very first Jedi, and may just provide us an answer to one of the biggest mysteries in the galaxy.

Force ghosts have been with ""Star Wars"" from inception, with Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) sacrificing his life to the Force and returning as an apparition to guide Luke Skywalker through the rest of his journey. The actual mechanics of becoming a Force ghost remain a mystery even to the Jedi masters.

We've seen hints of the Jedi Order's discovery of a life beyond death, most notably in an episode of ""The Clone Wars"" in which Qui-Gon Jinn contacts Yoda (voiced by Tom Kane) from beyond the grave thanks to his mastery of the Force. ""All energy from the Living Force, from all things that have ever lived, feeds into the Cosmic Force, binding everything, and communicating to us through the midi-chlorians,"" Jinn teaches his former master. ""Because of this, I can speak to you now.""

The actual abilities of a Force ghost are inconsistent to say the least, but perhaps the ability of some ghosts, like Yoda's in ""The Last Jedi,"" to interact with the living world is dependent on their own skills. They seem to only be able to appear sparingly, in moments of great crisis for their living friends and family. Whether that is a conscious choice to not interfere in the affairs of the living, or a limitation of their powers, will probably never be solved (because it would kill story conflict if an army of ghost Jedi could arrive to save the day.)

We've already discussed the nature of Anakin's prophecy, which the Jedi Order believed would allow the young Jedi to bring balance to the Force for once and for all. But is such a thing even possible?

The story of the entire ""Star Wars"" mythos is one of perpetual conflict between the light and dark side of the Force. Both the Jedi and the Sith believe they can eventually triumph over the other, but the conclusion of each trilogy proves no side can be victorious for very long.

Inspired by the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang, these two equal but opposite forces don't just oppose, but are also interdependent on one another. Any time one side of the Force becomes too powerful, such as when Anakin destroyed the Jedi Order in ""The Revenge of the Sith,"" the Force provides a counter balance in his children Luke and Leia (Carrie Fisher). On the other hand, when the light triumphs over Sidious at the end of ""The Return of the Jedi,"" Ben Solo is born and becomes drawn to the dark side.

By the end of ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" Rey and Kylo discover they are part of a Force Dyad, which could potentially represent a new path forward for the galaxy, in which the light and dark side exist in harmony for the very first time. Kylo's death closed the dyad, cutting off answers. Maybe Rey will rebuild the dyad in her potential film, but until then, the battle between the light and dark side continues.","{'href': 'https://www.looper.com', 'title': 'looper.com'}","other"

Francis Crick is best known as one of the figures behind the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, but the familiar story leaves out as much as it explains. Historian of science and zoologist Matthew Cobb looks closely at how Crick's life actually unfolded, revealing a career shaped less by inevitability than by luck, conflict, false starts, and a series of highly contingent moments.

The double helix itself may have been waiting to be found, but what followed was anything but predetermined. Crick's influence came from asking uncomfortable questions about what the structure of DNA implied for genetics, evolution, and life itself. Along the way, myths hardened around personalities, credit, and rivalries, especially in the case of Rosalind Franklin, whose role has been both misunderstood and oversimplified.

The conversation also traces Crick's later turn away from molecular biology toward the problem that fascinated him from the beginning: consciousness. From visual perception to the search for neural correlates of experience, his ambition was to push back against mystical explanations and insist that even the most elusive aspects of the mind belonged to the material world.

Matthew Cobb is a professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Manchester. He is the author of numerous works of science and history. His new book is Crick: A Mind in Motion, a biography of the legendary scientist Francis Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.

            Venezuela is entering a new and very uncertain era after the sudden capture and removal of Nicolas Máduro, the country's president for the last 12 years.
    


            Amid widespread apprehension about what comes next, the streets of the capital Caracas and other cities have been quiet. People are apprehensive about being out and about, with the security forces on edge. But there has been little sign of the government-backed paramilitary groups known as colectivos on the streets.
    


            Those that have ventured out have one priority: Stocking up on basic supplies in case the capital sees clashes or looting. There's no sign of panic buying but Venezuelans are used to stocking up whenever there is a crisis.
    


            Videos obtained by CNN on Saturday showed mostly empty streets, but long lines as people gathered at supermarkets and pharmacies.
    


            “You can't hear anything on the streets except the birds singing,” reported journalist Mary Mena Sunday.
    


            Opposition supporters are celebrating in private, but there have been no rallies supporting the US action. Mena said they are likely to keep their heads down unless leading opposition figures can show they have support among Venezuelan officials or military commanders.
    


            Little information is trickling in from other cities. Reuters reported long lines for groceries in the city of Maracaibo, an oil hub. Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner there, said he had “gone out to check on my business because I was afraid of looting, but the street is deserted.”
    


            “I wanted to fill up my gas tank, but the service stations are already closed, so I took the opportunity to buy food because we don't know what's coming,” Chacin told Reuters. “Honestly, I have a mix of fear and joy.”
    


            “I've just taken the dog out and it feels like an abandoned city, people are shut inside,” said Alejandra Palencia, 35, a psychologist in the city of Maracay. “There is fear and ⁠uncertainty,” she told Reuters.
    


            That uncertainty is pervasive.
    


            “I want to know what will come next,” said Nancy Pérez, a 74-year-old woman who went out to a bakery near her home in Valencia, central Venezuela.
    


            Some Venezuelans are unhappy at the prospect of decisions for Venezuela being taken at the White House. As she stocked up on groceries in Caracas, Jenny Salazar told CNN: “I don't agree with another president, outside of Venezuela, taking control of us Venezuelans.”
    


            Trump said at a news conference Saturday that his administration will govern Venezuela “until there can be a transition.”
    


            Teo Tilin, who lives in Miami and had traveled to Venezuela to visit his mother, was also apprehensive about how Venezuela would be governed. “How is it that (Donald Trump) is going to have control? What kind of control will you have? Where are the people who are going to control that? (…) I don't know.”
    


            A doctor in the capital who declined to give his name said the role of the military would be crucial.
    


            “The position of the Venezuelan Armed Forces is fundamental. We have to wait and see how they are going to define themselves,” he said. He hoped for a rapprochement between the US and the Venezuelan opposition.
    


            Under the Venezuelan Constitution, the acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, is meant to call fresh elections within 60 days.
    


            “I'm very interested in knowing what the transition will be like. What is the plan? Will she be in charge of the country and the organization of the elections? How can we trust it?” asked another Caracas resident.
    


            State media in Venezuela has featured supporters of the regime with defiant messages for Trump. One young man told a live broadcast by Telesur on Saturday: “We are the children of (Hugo) Chávez, we achieved sovereignty, and we will not allow you, who think you are the world's police, to change this.”
    


            Chavez was president before Maduro, from 1999 to 2013, and the founder of what became known as Venezuela's Bolivarian movement.
    


            Rodriguez, who has been nominated as president by the Supreme Court now that Maduro is gone, has not spoken Sunday – but the government appears to be focused on continuity. Maduro frequently said that the regime will continue regardless of whether he was still president.
    


            Authorities have said that the main international airport remains open and that the National Assembly will be sworn in on Monday as scheduled.
    


            Many Venezuelans were surprised that Trump suggested the US could work with Rodriguez as the new head of state in Venezuela – deepening the uncertainty over the country's future.

President Donald Trump has dismissed Venezuelan opposition figure Maria Corina Machado as a potential national leader, despite the Nobel laureate's vocal support of the US military operation against her own country.

Early on Saturday, US forces carried out airstrikes on the oil-rich country and captured its president, Nicolas Maduro, along with his wife. Both were transferred to the United States and charged with conspiracy to traffic narcotics, allegations Maduro has long denied.

During a press conference, Trump was asked whether he was in contact with Machado or viewed her as a viable leader following Maduro's capture.

“I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader. She doesn't have the support or the respect within the country. She's a very nice woman but she doesn't have the respect,” Trump said.

Machado, a former congresswoman who maintained close contacts with the US government for decades, has previously led anti-government protests and accused Maduro of “illegally” seizing power during the 2024 elections. She was barred from holding public office after authorities accused her of backing foreign sanctions and calling for US military intervention.

In December, Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for what the Nobel Committee described as “her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”

Asked if she backed US military action against her own country, Machado later said she believed “the escalation that's taking place is the only way to force Maduro to understand that it's time to go,” yet insisted this is “not regime change, this is enforcing the will of the Venezuelan people.”

President Trump declared on Saturday that the US will now “run” Venezuela and control its oil production until a proper “transition of power,” while threatening to stage a “second and much larger attack” if Caracas refuses to cooperate.

NEW YORK, January 4. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could take on a leading role in the process of establishing control over the situation in Venezuela following the capture of the country's president Nicolas Maduro by US special forces, Bloomberg reported, citing a US official.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said on January 3 that the United States had attacked civilian and military facilities in Caracas. He condemned Washington's actions as a military aggression. A state of emergency has been imposed in Venezuela. US President Donald Trump has confirmed the attack on Venezuela.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio defends capture of Nicolás Maduro and says US has ‘leverage' over country

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and prominent Republicans swiftly backpedaled from Donald Trump's assertion that the US will run Venezuela in transition after US forces snatched the president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to the US to face federal criminal charges.

Rubio appeared on numerous US politics shows on Sunday morning to defend the US operation in the early hours of Saturday to capture Maduro and his wife despite critics calling the operation illegal on multiple levels and the White House failing to demonstrate how it would run the South American nation.

The secretary of state was challenged repeatedly in a number of appearances to confirm whether the US would run Venezuela.

Rubio said on ABC that the US had “leverage” over the country and that: “We expect that it's going to lead to results here. We're hope so … hopeful that it does. Positive results. For the people of Venezuela, but ultimately, most importantly, for us, in the national interests of the United States.”

He added that the US would “set the conditions” so that Venezuela is no longer a “narco-trafficking paradise” aligned with US adversaries including Iran and militant proxies such as Hezbollah.

ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos asked a follow-up question. “What is the legal authority for the United States to be running Venezuela?”

Rubio responded: “I explained to you what our goals are and how we're going to use the leverage to make it happen.”

The previous day Trump, speaking at a press conference in Florida just hours after the strikes and raid on Caracas and elsewhere in Venezuela, said the US would run Venezuela “with a group” and would be “designating various people” in charge, while pointing to Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Dan Caine, behind him.

Trump also said that Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, now considered the interim president by Venezuelan leadership, had spoken to Rubio and had told the US she would do whatever it needed, with Trump adding: “She really doesn't have a choice.” Rodríguez appeared on state television in Venezuela not long afterwards and, in contrast, was sharply critical of the US actions and insisted that the country “will never again be anyone's colony”.

Rubio told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday morning that actions were different from rhetoric and it was too soon to know how the Venezuelan leadership would now respond to the US's audacious action in the country and, now, pressure to conform to US plans to stop drug trafficking and control its oil operations.

“We are going to make our assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly. We're going to find out. Do I know what decisions they're going to make? I do not. But I know that if they don't make the right decisions the United Sates will retain multiple levers of influence to ensure our interest are protected and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things … we're going to see what they do.”

And Rubio told NBC that the US was not at war in Venezuela and did not currently have US forces on the ground there.

In response to anchor Kristen Welker asking if he, Hegseth or any of the US leadership Trump indicated was going to be running Venezuela during its transition, Rubio said: “Well, it's running policy … we want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.”

Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, also rowed back on Trump's assertions, saying there were “still a lot of questions to be answered” about what happens next in Venezuela.

When asked who was running Venezuela right now he responded: “Who is not running Venezuela is Maduro.”

Cotton said Rubio was in consultation with the Venezuelan government and with the opposition to “see what a transition government would look like … we will see whether they [the post-Maduro Venezuelan leadership] will let the opposition back into the country and hold elections.”

Trump on Saturday was dismissive of the opposition, headed by recent Nobel peace prize winner María Corina Machado, who is in exile, saying she did not have sufficient support and respect in Venezuela, without being more specific about whether he was referring to leadership, the military or voters.

Meanwhile, on Sunday Trump threatened Rodríguez that “if she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

In a telephone interview with the Atlantic magazine Trump also appeared to acknowledge US aspirations in the country as amounting to something congressional Democrats say they were explicitly told was not the plan – regime change.

“You know, rebuilding there and regime change, anything you want to call it, is better than what you have right now. Can't get any worse,” Trump said.

Cotton said the US did not recognize Rodríguez as legitimate. Maduro was widely considered to have lost the 2024 presidential election in Venezuela, but stayed in power anyway.

He added: “The new leaders of Venezuela need to meet our demands,” he said. “Our demands are … that we want them to stop the drug trafficking. We want them to stop the weapons trafficking. We want them to expel the Cubans and the Iranians and the Islamic radicals.”

Senator Jim Jordan, a Republican representing Ohio and the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, also could not confirm that the US would run Venezuela.

When asked directly on CNN what Trump meant when he indicated that the group standing behind him at the press conference would be in charge of the plan for the US to run the country, Jordan said: “We do not know exactly what that means.” When asked what is next for Venezuela, he said: “We'll see.”

And despite the mandate of the US Congress to act as a check on executive power and interrogate controversial actions such as the Venezuelan operation, Jordan said he trusted Trump, Rubio and Hegseth in “making the best decisions” and he trusted the US military.

Democratic congressman Jim Himes said that Jordan's answers were “giving the game away” that the Republican-controlled Congress was not interested in acting as a check on the White House and condemned the intervention in Venezuela as an “imperial adventure”.

Meanwhile, earlier on CBS, Rubio referred to the current Venezuelan regime and defended the US decision not to remove more of Maduro's inner circle.

“You're gonna go in and suck up five people?” he said. “Okay, they're already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people … we got the top priority, the number one person on the list.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

People gather around a makeshift memorial to the victims of the fire that ripped through Le Constellation bar in the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve.MAXIME SCHMID/AFP/Getty Images

Hundreds marched in silence Sunday to honor the victims of the New Year's Eve fire at a bar in the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana, which left 40 dead and many severely injured.

Somber mourners, many with reddened eyes, filed silently out of the chapel to organ music after the hourlong Mass at the Chapelle Saint-Christophe in Crans-Montana. Some exchanged hugs, others applauded, before joining the silent march up the hill to Le Constellation bar.

Many hundreds of people, some cradling flower bouquets, walked in the dense snaking procession in the bright sunlight past shuttered stores. Up on the mountain overlooking the town, snow machines sent plumes of white flakes into the air.

At the top of the street, in front of Le Constellation that is still largely shielded from view by white screens, the swelling crowd stood in near total silence, some weeping. 

Then they broke out into sustained applause – hands in gloves and mittens against the cold – as a stream of mourners and well-wishers deposited flower bouquets at a makeshift memorial piled with flowers, cuddly toys and other tributes.

“Through this tragic event, I believe we must all remember that we are all brothers and sisters in humanity,” Véronique Barras, a local resident who knows grieving families, said. “It's important to support each other, to hug each other, and to move forward towards light.”

Cathy Premer said her daughter was out celebrating her 17th birthday on Dec. 31 when she called in the early hours of the morning to say she was stuck because Le Constellation was cordoned off. 

“For the young – but even for adults – it's hard to understand things that seem inexplicable,” she said. “They went there to party, it's a destination for Dec. 31, it's very festive, there were people of many nationalities ... and it all turned into a tragedy.”

In the crowd, Paola Ponti Greppi, a 80-year-old Italian who has a house in Crans-Montana, called for safety checks in bars. 

“We need more safety in these places because it's not the only place like this. Why didn't the town do the proper checks? For me that's terrible.”

During the Mass, the Rev. Gilles Cavin spoke of the “terrible uncertainty” for families unsure if their loved ones are among the dead or still alive among the injured. 

“There are no words strong enough to express the dismay, anguish, and anger of those who are affected in their lives today. And yet, we are here, gathered because silence alone is not enough,” he said.

In the crowded pews, a grieving woman listened intently, her hands clasped tightly and sometimes clasping rosary beads, as speakers delivered readings in German, French and Italian.

Forty people died and 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s.

By Sunday morning, Swiss authorities identified 24 out of the 40 fatalities. They include 18 Swiss citizens aged 14 to 31 years, two Italians 16 years old, one dual citizen of Italy and the United Arab Emirates also 16 years old, an 18-year-old Romanian, a 39-year-old French and a Turkish citizen, 18.

One of the victims was 16-year old Arthur Brodard, whose mother had been frantically searching for him.

“Our Arthur has now left to party in paradise,” a visibly shaken Laetitia Brodard said in a Facebook story posted on Saturday night, speaking to camera. “We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.”

Brodard's frenzied search for her son reflected the desperation of families of the young people disappeared during the fire, who did not know whether their loved ones were dead or in the hospital.

Swiss authorities said the process of identifying victims was particularly hard because of the advanced degree of the burns, requiring the use of DNA samples. Brodard also had given her DNA sample to help in the identification process.

In her Facebook post, she thanked those who “testified their compassion, their love” and to those who shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son. Other parents and siblings are still waiting in anguish.

Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation of the bar managers.

The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, the Valais region's chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, told reporters Saturday. The announcement of the investigation did not name the managers.

Investigators said Friday they believe sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire when they came too close to the ceiling of the crowded bar.

Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.

Swiss President Guy Parmelin announced a national day of mourning for the victims on Jan. 9.

France's Health Minister Stéphanie Rist said 17 patients have received care in France, out of a total of 35 transferred from Switzerland to five European countries. Other patients were planned to be transferred to Germany, Italy and Belgium.

Forty people died and 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar.

In this article

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday appeared to backtrack on President Donald Trump's claim that the U.S. will ""run"" Venezuela after U.S. forces on Saturday captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and hauled him to the U.S. 

Asked for details on how the U.S. plans to run Venezuela, Rubio said the U.S. would use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims. He did not say the U.S. would directly govern Venezuela.

The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean. 

""What's going to happen here is we have a quarantine on their oil, that means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,"" Rubio said on ABC's ""This Week with George Stephanopoulos."" 

""That leverage remains, that leverage is ongoing and we expect that it's going to lead to results here,"" Rubio said. 

Trump said on Saturday said the U.S. would ""run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition."" 

The comments sparked a firestorm of criticism from Trump's adversaries and some allies, who warned against a nation-building exercise in Venezuela. 

""We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and dollars,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on ABC on Sunday. 

Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president following Maduro's capture. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in New York on Saturday night to face charges related to drug trafficking. 

Rubio's comments suggest that the U.S. will take a softer approach with Venezuela than Trump's initial suggestions of ruling the country with a ""group."" Though Rubio said Trump still may take further military action to achieve U.S. goals. 

Asked on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" about further military action in Venezuela, Rubio said Trump ""retains all his optionality.""

Rubio also extrapolated on the U.S.' aims with Venezuela's oil reserves. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. is ""going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure.""

Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. 

""Ultimately, this is not about securing the oil fields; this is about ensuring that no sanctioned oil can come in and out until they make changes to the governance of that entire industry,"" Rubio said on ABC. ""The way to address it to the benefit of the Venezuelan people is to get private companies that are not from Iran or somewhere else to go in and invest in the equipment."" 

Rubio said he has not spoken to specific U.S. oil companies about the prospect of starting business in Venezuela. Currently, only Chevron operates in the country. 

""We're pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest from Western companies,"" Rubio said. 

Rubio said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be ""taking an assessment and speaking to some of these companies.""

Clarification: The U.S. military captured Nicolas Maduro and removed him from Venezuela. That was not clear in a reference in an earlier version of this article.

https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kHV_RoRuWEHbGQyjmQNIwQ

On January 3, 2026, the U.S. military launched a large‑scale strike against Venezuela. Venezuelan President Maduro was rapidly arrested and transferred.

Some people commented, “A memecoin issuer was arrested by someone who issued an RWA token.”

In fact, that's exactly how it looks.

On February 20, 2018, Venezuelan President Maduro announced on television the issuance of the world's first sovereign‑backed digital currency — Petro.

At that time Venezuela was in the midst of the worst economic crisis in its history, with inflation soaring to nearly 1,000,000% (yes, you read that right). The national currency, the bolivar, had become nearly worthless, and harsh U.S. sanctions only made the situation worse for this oil‑rich South American nation.

Maduro placed his hopes on this digital currency as the country's last straw for salvation.

However, in early 2024, when the Venezuelan government quietly terminated Petro's operation, the world barely raised an eyebrow.

This digital token — once hailed as the “world's first sovereign cryptocurrency” — barely lived during its brief existence. Its end was like the silent final act of a loud drama, closing a surreal story of crypto tech, national sovereignty, and economic collapse.

The fate of Petro reflects the total collapse of a country's governance system.

Born on Ruins

To understand Petro, we must first understand pre‑Petro Venezuela.

It was a nation scorched by hyperinflation. The bolivar lost value by the hour, and people's lifelong savings vanished overnight. Meanwhile, severe U.S. financial sanctions acted like a tightening noose, isolating Venezuela's economy from the global financial system.

Petro emerged amid this economic wasteland, bearing an almost impossible mission: to “save the country.”

Its blueprint was ambitious and seductive.

First, Petro claimed to use blockchain to bypass the U.S.‑dollar‑driven global financial system and open new financing and payment channels. Second, it stated that each Petro was backed by a barrel of real oil reserves — 100 million Petros allegedly tied to $60 billion worth of oil.

In August 2018, Venezuela formally designated Petro as its second official currency, to circulate alongside the beleaguered bolivar.

The Maduro government promoted Petro with unprecedented zeal.

Pensions for retirees were switched to Petro. Christmas bonuses for civil servants and military personnel were paid in Petro. At the end of 2019, Maduro even air‑dropped 0.5 Petros to retirees on national TV as a Christmas gift.

Beyond domestic promotion, Venezuela also tried to bring other countries onboard.

Time Magazine reported that Petro received personal approval from Putin, and Russia sent two advisors to help design the project. The Russian side pledged investment and considered using Petro in bilateral trade settlements to jointly confront dollar hegemony.

Venezuela also attempted to promote Petro to OPEC member states, hoping to build a de‑dollarized oil trade system. Oil Minister El Aissami proclaimed, “Petro will become the settlement method accepted by all OPEC member countries.”

To increase adoption, the government behaved like a crypto‑project team: it built infrastructure, released detailed purchase guides on official sites, developed four ecosystem apps, and authorized six exchanges, including Cave Blockchain and Bancar to publicly sell Petro.

But reality struck hard and quickly.

Public Indifference and Distrust

The vigorous government promotion was met with widespread public apathy.

Under Maduro's Facebook post announcing Petro, the most liked comment read: “It's unbelievable that anyone supports this terrible government… they are destroying the country.” Another popular reply said: “The government has learned to make every stupid idea end in failure, then blame other countries.”

Venezuelan media commentator Gonzalo tweeted sharply: “Petro is the anesthetic for this failed state.”

Terrible user experience further aggravated distrust. Petro registrations required uploading front and back of ID cards, detailed address, phone number, etc., yet applications were often inexplicably rejected. Even those who somehow succeeded faced frequent issues with the “Fatherland Wallet” and repeated service failures.

Even worse was the payment experience. Many merchants reported Petro payment failures, forcing the government to admit system defects and offer compensation.

One Venezuelan woman said: “Here, you can't feel Petro's existence at all.”

Externally, the U.S. government conducted targeted attacks on Petro.

In March 2018, just one month after the launch of Petro, Trump signed an executive order completely prohibiting U.S. citizens from buying, holding, or trading Petro. The Treasury Department stated explicitly that any transaction involving Petro would be considered a violation of sanctions against Venezuela.

Sanctions quickly expanded. In 2019, the U.S. sanctioned Evrofinance Mosnarbank, headquartered in Moscow, accusing it of financing Petro. The Treasury bluntly stated “Petro is a failed project attempting to help Venezuela evade U.S. sanctions.”

A Blockchain‑Clad Worthless Coin

Petro's fatal flaw was that it made no technical or economic sense.

A real cryptocurrency relies on decentralized trust. Petro was nothing but a centralized database fully controlled by the government.

For an ordinary Venezuelan, that meant the value in their digital wallet was not determined by any market, but could be changed by presidential decree.

The government claimed that each Petro was backed by a barrel of oil from the Ayacucho region's Atapirire town, with 530 million barrels in reserve. But Reuters reporters on the ground found dilapidated roads, rusty oil rigs, overgrown weeds — no evidence of large‑scale production.

Exiled former Venezuelan oil minister Rafael Ramírez estimated that extracting the promised 530 million barrels would require at least $20 billion in investment — an impossible sum for a government that struggled to import basic food.

Ramírez said bluntly: “Petro was designed with arbitrary value. It exists only in the government's imagination.”

Even more absurdly, the government later quietly changed Petro's backing from 100% oil to a mix of oil, gold, iron, and diamonds at 50%, 20%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.

This arbitrary revision of the “white paper” would be frowned upon even in the crypto world.

Technical issues were just as severe. Although Petro claimed to be blockchain‑based, its block explorer showed extremely abnormal data. The white paper stated Petro should produce blocks every minute like Dash, but in reality blocks were produced every 15 minutes, and on‑chain transactions were nearly zero.

Unlike Bitcoin and other decentralized crypto, Petro's price was completely government‑controlled. Its exchange rate went from 1 Petro = 3,600 bolivars, to 6,000, then 9,000 at whim.

Although the government declared an official price of $60 per Petro, on the black market in the capital Caracas, people could only trade it for goods or cash worth less than $10 — if they were lucky enough to find someone who would accept it.

Petro was essentially a blockchain‑skinned control tool.

The Final Blow: Internal Corruption

If Petro's life was a slow path to obsolescence, the final straw was a monumental corruption scandal.

On March 20, 2023, Venezuelan political circles experienced a “tectonic shift.”

Maduro's core circle member and Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami suddenly resigned.

Days earlier, Venezuela's anti‑corruption police arrested his aide — Joselit Ramírez Camacho, head of SUNACRIP, the national digital currency regulator responsible for Petro's oversight and operation.

As the investigation deepened, an astonishing multi‑billion‑dollar scam surfaced.

Attorney General Tarek William Saab revealed that some senior officials had signed oil loading contracts with no administrative control or guarantees, with proceeds that never reached the national oil company, instead being diverted through crypto to private pockets.

Investigations showed the corruption network involved $3 billion to $20 billion, with stolen funds used to buy real estate, crypto, and cryptocurrency mining facilities.

In April 2024, former Oil Minister El Aissami was arrested on charges including treason, money laundering, and criminal conspiracy, and over 54 people were prosecuted for their roles in the scandal.

This corruption scandal dealt a devastating blow to Venezuela's crypto industry. SUNACRIP was forced to shut down, and the government launched nationwide anti‑mining operations, seizing over 11,000 ASIC miners and cutting all mining farms off the national grid.

By 2024, the government had halted Petro trading, banned crypto mining, and shut down all authorized exchanges. An industry once aggressively promoted by the state completely collapsed under corruption.

Petro didn't die because of Washington's ban — it died from rot within.

A tool intended to counter sanctions became a tool for corrupt officials to launder money.

A Mirror of National Failure

Petro's failure almost perfectly mirrors Venezuela's collapse.

It was a band‑aid policy. Instead of solving deep structural economic problems, the government created a flashy gimmick, trying to cover rot with digital illusion — like painting fresh walls on a building with a collapsing foundation.

The Maduro government tried to use technology to fix institutional problems — a flawed premise from the start. The value of any digital currency still depends on the issuer's credibility. In a country with hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods, what credibility could the government possibly have? When people no longer trust the national currency, how could they trust a brand‑new digital one?

Petro instead used up the last remnants of government credibility.

Imagine this: a retired teacher, her savings eaten away by inflation, is forced to receive pension in Petro. She walks into shop after shop, only to hear “We don't accept this” or “The system is down.”

The root of Venezuela's economic problems was its structural imbalance. Venezuela suffered from classic “Dutch Disease” — overreliance on oil exports destroyed manufacturing, leaving an extremely narrow economic base. When oil prices dropped, the whole economy collapsed. Petro tried to anchor itself to oil but only deepened dependence without fixing structural flaws.

Practically, the Venezuelan government lacked the technical and operational capacity to implement a blockchain project. From abnormal chain data to failed payment systems and arbitrary pricing, every detail exposed incompetence — worse than a basic outsourced tech studio.

Today, Petro has vanished into the dust of history. Maduro's “national salvation experiment” ended in abject failure. Venezuela remains mired in crisis, its people still suffering under inflation's flame.

The real path forward for this nation is not chasing the next “Petro‑style” shortcut, but mustering the courage to face reality, return to common sense, and begin the long, difficult work of genuine reform.

Historians and divers are trying to retrieve prehistoric clues from beneath the waves—but they have to act fast.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Around 8,000 to 6,000 BCE, the North and Baltic seas ... weren't seas at all. Instead, they were vast plains that were home to ancient human civilizations. But as the curtain drew to a close on the last Ice Age, water levels rose and inundated these low-lying areas, wiping away any trace of prospering civilizations. Well—almost any trace. 

The University of Bradford's Submerged Landscapes Research Centre in the U.K., TNO Geological Survey of the Netherlands, Flanders Marine Institute, and the University of York will soon explore these long-lost civilizations as part of a research collaboration known as SUBNORDICA. One of the ancient lands the project aims to explore is Doggerland, which is thought to have thrived in North Sea region some 8,200 years ago.

“Twenty-thousand years ago, the global sea level was 130 metres lower than at present. With progressive global warming and sea-level rise, unique landscapes, home to human societies for millennia, disappeared,” Vincent Gaffney, leader of the Submerged Landscapes Research Centre, said in a press statement. “We know almost nothing about the people who lived on these great plains. As Europe and the world approaches net zero, development of the coastal shelves is now a strategic priority. SUBNORDICA will use the latest technologies to explore these lands and support sustainable development.”

Among those technologies will be advanced seabed mapping and computer simulation of lost settlements, as well as additional AI tools, seismic and acoustic surveys, and boreholes. In March, the University of Bradford announced its plan to analyze data gathered from magnetometer surveys intended for the environmental impact assessment of future green energy initiatives. University researchers say magnetic fields can help identify “peat-forming areas…or where erosion has occurred, for example in river channels.” 

And time is of the essence for investigating these water-logged civilizations. Thousands of years ago, an additional 7.7 million square miles were above water, and of that portion, 1.16 million square miles lay along Europe's existing coastline. Researchers describe the region as “the most attractive land for prehistoric settlement anywhere in the continent.” 

Today, this land largely makes up the coastal shelf that is currently under development as North Sea nations install offshore wind farms to combat climate change. This vast expansion of green energy infrastructure could limit scientific access to these areas, so projects like SUBNORDICA are rushing to investigate the area before it's too late. 

“SUBNORDICA will investigate the significance of ancient coastlines and its resources for humans. Through diving surveys in Aarhus Bay [in Denmark] we will determine how widespread coastal settlements were compared to those in the interior and determine how marine resources were exploited 9000 to 8500 years ago,” Peter Moe Astrup, underwater archaeologist at Denmark's Moesgaard Museum, said in a press statement. “This knowledge will then be used to target archaeological investigations in less accessible areas.”

As nations fight against rising seas—a fight that for some North Sea countries never truly ended—scientists are rushing to discover what happened to these prehistoric humans who similarly experienced a rise in temperature that threatened, and eventually vanquished, their civilizations.

Hardware maker Plaud launched a new AI notetaker called Plaude NotePin S, along with a desktop app that helps you take notes for digital meetings, ahead of this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.

The company first launched its pin-styled notetaker in 2024, which my former colleague Brian Heater really liked. The new pin brings a physical button that lets you start and stop the recording. Plus, during the recording, you can tap the button to highlight a certain point — just like you can do on the newly launched Plaud Note Pro. 

One nice thing about the $179 Plaud NotePin S is that you get a clip, a lanyard, a magnetic pin, and a wristband in the package. That means you can wear the device however you like. The company is also adding Apple Find My support for the pin, so that you can easily look for the device if you can't find it.

The core specifications of the device remain the same from the previous generation. There is 64GB of onboard storage with a battery capacity of 20 hours of continuous recording. The device has two MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) mics that can capture clear audio within 9.8 feet of range. Users will get 300 minutes of transcription per month for free and

As compared to the Note Pro, this device has a shorter recording range and lower battery life. But it is smaller in size to carry using any of the above mentioned accesories. The company said that the pin is suited for people who are constantly on the go.

This is Plaud's fourth device, and the company has sold more than 1.5 million devices until now. With these devices, the focus has been on in-person meetings. However, Plaud also wants to take on meeting notetakers like Granola, Fathom, and Fireflies with a new desktop client that works across meeting apps. The company said that the app can detect when a meeting is active and prompt you to capture the transcript.

The Mac app takes notes using system audio to capture the meeting, and then structures the transcription into notes using AI. The company introduced multimodal inputs for notetaking with its app that allows users to add images and typed notes along with audio transcription last year. Plaud is bringing that functionality to its desktop app as well.

Heck, Suno has gotten me to the point where I play so much more piano (the recording -> polished track loop is very rewarding) that not only did I publish an album to Spotify in my favorite genre, of music that I'm really happy with, I've also started to produce some polished acoustic recordings with NO AI involvement. That's just because I've been spending so much more time at the piano, because of that reward loop.

They don't think like graphic designers, or like programmers. It's not easy for beginners. It's not aimed at ease of implementation. It's not amenable to automated validation. It's not meant to be generated.If there is some person for whom CSS layout comes naturally, I have not met them. As far as I can tell their design goal was to confuse everyone, at which they succeeded magnificently.

Now I can genuinely point Claude Code at them and say ""upgrade this to the latest versions"" and it will do most of that tedious work for me.I can even have it fill in some missing tests and gaps in the documentation at the same time.

In fact, it's a lot more fun for me to approach this today. Modern PHP is a joy. MariaSQL is very much MySQL (and switching to Postgres isn't exactly a bump in complexity). It's way easier to write code that won't get injected.If you want to slice your designs in Photoshop (ehem, the real OGs used Fireworks) go ahead and use Dreamweaver, go ahead. That said, HTML5 makes not having to use tables for layout easy, not more complex and VS Code has all the good parts of Dreamweaver (trust me, you don't need or want the WYSIWG... if you must, just use inspect elements and move the changes over to the HTML file).I guess all this is to say that web dev is simpler, not more complex for solo devs today. There exists more complicated tooling, but if you're solo-dev'ing something for fun, skip it!EDIT: Also, phpMyAdmin was fun to use but also the best way to get your box popped. Today, something like DBeaver suits me just fine.

I've been making web stuff for a similar length of time as Mattias by the sounds of it. I started with Perl but moved to PHP 4 pretty soon after. I recognise this problem but I have different take.All the complexity was there 20 years ago, but we ignored it. That doesn't mean it was simpler. It just means we took crazy (with hindsight) risks. Sure, there were no build pipelines like today, but we had scripts we ran to build things. There was Adobe Pagemill for making site wide changes before we deployed a new version. Back in the day we made those changes, did a very brief check that things worked locally, and then manually FTP'd files to a server, breaking it in the process because a user would see the site change as they navigated. Some of us would put up a maintenance page during an update effectively just blocking all the traffic. That's certainly 'simpler', but it's also much worse for the user, and on a site that did things with data potentially risked corrupting a user's records. It was incredible that things didn't break more often. Maybe they did and we just never realised.We didn't have CSS frameworks but we certainly did have our own in-house templates, and they had separate toolchains. As time went on that toolchain mostly migrated to Wordpress and it's template builder plugins. Again, give me Tailwind over that mess.We had Core Web Vitals and SEO in the form of Urchin Stats. We had layout shift but we called it FOUC. We had kind of had srcset, but it was implemented as a set of Macromedia Dreamweaver mm_ JS image preload and swapping functions. <picture> is a lot nicer.Things are just better now. Writing web software is loads of fun. I also leverage LLMs in my code because they're awesome, but not to simplify things. I don't think the complexity is new. I just think it's visible now.

In order for me to be comfortable with a code base and consider it mine I need to have written the foundation, not merely reviewed in. Once the pillars are there, LLMs do make further development faster and I can concentrate on fun details (like tinkering with CSS or thinking about some very specific details).

reply

I find just the opposite. Before, starting from nothing was a huge impediment. Now you can have a working prototype and start iterating right away. If you figur e out that you've gone down the wrong path, there's little remorse in tossing it out and starting over.

For better or worse, everyone's been talking about the final season of Stranger Things, and its finale in particular. Reactions have been mixed across the board, but for creators Ross and Matt Duffer, things more or less ended as intended.

Leading up to the finale, fans made a petition convinced there was unseen footage held hostage by Netflix, or even a secret episode. But the brothers told Variety that no such interference or hidden episode exists, with Matt saying they've made the show “[we] wanted to make. […] There's no interference or direction at all from Netflix. They are, and always have been, incredible, and they really trust us. That's been true since season one.”



If the Duffers had their say, they'd just let Stranger Things speak for itself from now on. Unfortunately, they can't: from Joyce and Hopper discovering their classmate was Vecna to Robin and Vickie still being together, their post-finale talk has partially been about why they didn't touch on things in the final episode, or why they made the choices they did. With Vecna, for example, they basically wrote the season like the First Shadow musical laying out his origin just didn't exist, since they didn't want to confuse anyone who hadn't watched the musical. But don't worry, they're “sure” Joyce and Hopper talked about their Vecna connection offscreen, which…is something, right?

Likewise, they'd like audiences to determine for themselves whether young Henry embraced his own darkness or was ultimately manipulated by the Mind Flayer. At one point, though, they were interested in putting him in what Ross Duffer called “a Darth Vader-type situation” where he'd have reneged on the Flayer. As explained in a Netflix Q&A, that idea was scrapped after they talked with the writers and Vecna's actor Jamie Campbell Bower and settled on Vecna having to “justify everything he's done with, ‘I chose this, and I believe in this still.' Where Henry goes, it doesn't matter because he chooses the side of the Mind Flayer at the end of the day.”

The idea of ambiguity is something the Duffers really want to push for several characters—even with Eleven, they said there was “never a version” of the ending where she'd live a normal life with the others, so Mike and everyone else has chosen to believe she's alive in the other dimension rather than truly gone after sacrificing herself. And by having them believe in what could be a lie, “it was such a better way to end the story and represent the closure of this journey and their journey from children to adults,” continued Ross.

Obviously, some Stranger Things fans don't think that onscreen coyness is actually intentional or even works in the finale's favor. But until (or if) a sequel series happens, it's on them to craft their own theories and fill any holes in the Duffers' narrative that they see fit, or at least until the Duffers go and explain or rationalize something else from it.

Guests can enjoy the convenience of DFW International Airport and arriving at their hotel in 10 minutes, only two stops away from the airport on the train. After all the match action, Grapevine serves as a peaceful retreat with picturesque streets filled with boutiques, cafés, galleries, and wineries. Fans are encouraged to grab a bite at local favourites like Esparza's Restaurante Mexicano, Tolbert's Restaurant & Chili Parlor, and Willhoite's Restaurant before or after the game. 

2026 FIFA World Cup Matches at AT&T Stadium: AT&T Stadium will host nine matches: five group-stage games, two Round of 32 games, one Round of 16 match, and one semifinal. Announced match-ups include: 

Group Stage 

Knockout Rounds 

Vintage Texas Americana in Every Corner: Fans can explore Historic Main Street, hop aboard the Grapevine Vintage Railroad, step back in time at Nash Farm, catch live performances at the Palace Theatre, and sample local flavours at nine tasting rooms along the Urban Wine Trail. Food lovers will find everything from classic Texas barbecue to global cuisine, while shoppers can mix local finds with big-name brands at Grapevine Mills, home to must-see attractions like Meow Wolf Grapevine, Fieldhouse USA, and SEA LIFE Grapevine. Looking to stay active between matches? Chicken N Pickle delivers food, drinks, and fast-paced fun with America's fastest-growing sport—pickleball. 

When it's time to recharge, Grapevine offers accommodations for every kind of fan—from luxury stays at Gaylord Texan to boutique style at Hotel Vin and family-friendly favourites like Great Wolf Lodge ensuring everyone has the perfect home base for their World Cup adventure.

The tournament, which is the first to feature an expanded 48-team format, will run from 11 June to 19 July 2026 and consist of a record 104 matches.

Presidential spokesperson Ambassador Mohamed El-Shennawy said Al-Sisi welcomed the delegation and noted that selecting Egypt as the second stop for the tour reflects the country's standing on the global sporting map. The president stated that the event presents an important opportunity to promote sports tourism and culture among youth.

Egypt has already secured its place in the 2026 finals after finishing top of its qualifying group in October 2025.

Following the official tournament draw in December, the Pharaohs have been placed in Group G. They are scheduled to open their campaign against Belgium in Seattle on 15 June, followed by New Zealand in Vancouver on 21 June, and Iran in Seattle on 26 June. The FIFA delegation expressed appreciation for the meeting and praised Egypt's advanced sports infrastructure. The visiting group included former Italian international Fabio Cannavaro, winner of the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year award, alongside Javier Ignacio Cepsi Berdevsky, a director at FIFA's Zurich headquarters, and World Cup tour director Sebastian Ferrio.

According to the spokesperson, the tour is part of a historic global journey spanning 30 countries. The event celebrates the 20th anniversary of the “Trophy Tour” organised through a partnership between FIFA and Coca-Cola. Egypt is one of nine African nations to have qualified directly for the 2026 tournament, joining Algeria, Cabo Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia. The meeting was attended by Egyptian Minister of Youth and Sports Ashraf Sobhy and Egyptian Football Association President Hany Abo Rida. The sponsoring company was represented by Alexandros Kavassilas, vice president for Nigeria and North Africa operations, and Hana Haddad, general manager for Egypt and Sudan.

Sisi said he looked forward to the success of the upcoming World Cup, noting it would be the largest edition to date. He expressed his hope that the Egyptian national team would achieve positive results and reiterated his desire for Egypt to host the competition in the future. The 2026 World Cup is set to open on 11 June at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, with a match between co-hosts Mexico and South Africa.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Jude Bellingham 'knows he's going to get battered' with poor Real Madrid performances as Xabi Alonso & Thomas Tuchel urged to 'protect' England midfielder","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/jude-bellingham-real-madrid-england-thomas-tuchel-gordon-strachan/bltf015a01bd0007931","Sun, 04 Jan 2026 12:45:05 GMT","

Real Madrid and England star Jude Bellingham has been defended from criticism by pundit Gordon Strachan, who insists that both Xabi Alonso and Thomas Tuchel need to ""protect"" the midfielder. Bellingham has been at the centre of controversy at international level and has also previously been defended by Ian Wright.

Bellingham has been at the centre of international criticism and has become something of a lightning rod for those who wish to take aim at England on the international stage. Tuchel has previously said that he finds some of Bellingham's behaviour ""repulsive"", a comment he apologised for, and much was made of the midfielder's allegedly angry response to being substituted against Albania.

Despite that, Wright has issued a strong defence of Bellingham previously and, now, Strachan has echoed his words. 

Wright said in November: “They need to create this kind of controversy because there is nothing else to say until the World Cup, so it's going to continue like this until the World Cup.

“They hate the fact that they can't reach him. They hate the fact that they can't negatively influence his club career like they've done with so many others before him. A young man blessed, endowed with overflowing talent and love.”

Strachan has called on both of Bellingham's managers, at club and international level, to help protect Bellingham from the slings and arrows being launched at him.

An old-school professional, the former Manchester United and Leeds star told The Telegraph: ""The poor guy is turning up and he knows that if he plays a wee bit badly, he's gonna get battered. 

“At a club you can demand anything of a player – you are paying them a good wage. Bellingham is not coming for the money, he's not coming for publicity, he's coming to help the country do well, help his mates, his friends, his family.

“As a manager you have to protect them. If he throws his arms about – if that's what everyone is complaining about – that's nothing. I feel sorry for the kid.”

Tuchel has been asked about Bellingham's behaviour, and stopped short of defending his player, instead appearing to condemn him. 

He said after the Albania game: “I don't want to make more out of it but I stick to my words - 'behaviour is key' and respect towards the team-mates who come in. Decisions are made and you have to accept it as a player.

“Morgan Rogers was for sure not happy when he couldn't start today because he deserves to play for us and he wants to play all the time. We gave him a bit of a rest because he came with a lot of minutes for his club and played against Serbia.

“I have to review it. I saw he was not happy, I don't want to make it bigger at the moment than it is. My words stand, we are about standards, level and commitment to each other and respect to each other. We will not change or decision just because someone waves their arms.”

Real Madrid play Real Betis on Sunday. Los Blancos are currently second in La Liga, seven points behind current leaders Barcelona with a game in hand. England are currently preparing for their 2026 World Cup campaign, where they will face Croatia, Ghana, and Panama in the group stage. Bellingham will hope to be involved in every single one of those fixtures, but he has previously warned that FIFA must improve the quality of pitches compared to the Club World Cup.

He said in the summer: ""The pitches aren't great here, honestly. It's really hot, I know it's the same for everyone but I'm only saying because you asked me. The pitches aren't great at all.

""It holds up, the ball barely bounces and it's tough on the knees as well. Hopefully it's something that someone will look at, going into the World Cup next year. It's important that we protect the players as well as giving the fans a spectacle.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

After Naomi Osaka defeated Katie Swan to briefly keep Japan alive, Great Britain's Olivia Nicholls and Neal Skupski clinched the deciding mixed doubles to end the campaign for Nao Hibino, Yasutaka Uchiyama and Japan in Group play.

Naomi Osaka earned her first United Cup match win on Sunday, but it ultimately wasn't enough to keep Japan in the competition.

Originally slated to face Emma Raducanu, Osaka instead took on Katie Swan after a late British lineup change and defeated the 26-year-old 7-6(4), 6-1 in 1 hour and 53 minutes at RAC Arena. The victory briefly pulled Japan level in its tie with Great Britain after Billy Harris defeated Shintaro Mochizuki earlier in the day.

However, Great Britain clinched the tie -- and eliminated Japan -- when Olivia Nicholls and Neal Skupski defeated Nao Hibino and Yasutaka Uchiyama 7-5, 4-6, [10-7] in the deciding mixed doubles.

Osaka's victory marked her first career match-win at the United Cup and Japan's first in the event, with the nation making its debut this year.

United Cup: Scores | Standings

“Just fighting, no matter what the score was,” said Osaka when asked what she was most pleased with. “I've never played her before and she's a really tough opponent. And to have one of the first matches of the year is definitely really tough, but I'm glad to be back here. I haven't been here since 2017, so thanks for having me.”

Osaka's serve set the tone, as she won the first 10 points on her serve and 11 of the first 12. By match end, the former World No. 1 had won 78% of her first-serve points and struck six aces. The performance from the service line provided a crucial cushion given her early struggles on return, as she converted just 1 of 10 break points in the opening set.

Despite the loss, the match will stand as a career highlight for Swan, who has endured repeated injuries and setbacks throughout her career. Despite the adversity, she entered the contest with 16 ITF singles titles -- including four in 2025 -- and was a girls' singles finalist at the 2015 Australian Open.

""Obviously disappointed with the outcome, but I'm taking so many positives from the experience as a whole,"" Swan said to reporters. ""I really enjoyed the match. I relaxed into it quite fast. It was great to see that my level can compete with someone as great as Naomi.

""It's been a tough journey for me to get back to a stage like this. This time last year, I wasn't playing tennis at all.""

Swan competed in the inaugural United Cup in 2023, going 2-1 in singles with wins over Nuria Parrizas Diaz and Zoe Hives, while losing to Madison Keys. Her last WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz main-draw win came at the event, while her most recent tour-level main-draw appearance had come at Wimbledon in 2023, where she lost to Belinda Bencic.

The Briton battled throughout Sunday's match, showing resolve from the opening game. She earned the first break of the match for a 4-3 lead in the first set and saved the first eight break points she faced, but it ultimately wasn't enough to avoid a winner-take-all mixed doubles match. 

Osaka broke back to level at 5-5, claimed the first-set tiebreak 7-4 and then pulled away in the second set.

“[Winning the first set] was definitely really important,” Osaka said. “And just, I guess for my confidence, trying to just build more. So yeah, I definitely appreciated winning the first set for sure.”

Earlier, Harris had steadied Great Britain after a turbulent start to the day in Perth by defeating Mochizuki 7-6(4), 6-3. Following the announcement of Raducanu's withdrawal, Harris delivered a timely boost with a win over a player ranked well above him in the PIF ATP Rankings.

“Great atmosphere…it got me through the match,” Harris said in his on-court interview. “A lot of Brits out here. Great to get the first win for the team. Some shaky bits in there, but I managed to close it out there in the end, so I was happy with that.""

The 30-year-old rallied from 5-3 down in the opening set but failed to serve it out at 6-5. He rebounded with a strong tiebreak and, with steady encouragement from captain Tim Henman, secured the only break of the second set in the fourth game.

The victory was his first tour-level win since defeating Dusan Lajovic at Wimbledon last July.

“Having Tim on the bench, it's great having advice from someone like that,” Harris said. “You're listening every changeover, and those little bits of advice can make a difference.”

Before Osaka sealed Japan's first match win of the event, Mochizuki had been chasing it. But his effort was undone by inconsistency from the baseline. The 22-year-old hit 19 unforced errors in the first set alone and made just 40% (27 of 68) of his first serves overall, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

In the deciding mixed doubles, Nicholls and Skupski edged Hibino and Uchiyama in a 1-hour, 46-minute nailbiter to secure victory for Great Britain. The closing stages also featured tactical use of a timeout from both captains: Japan's Go Soeda called one before Nicholls served at 6-5, and Skupski promptly netted an easy volley on the following point.

Henman then returned the favour by calling a timeout of his own with Briton leading 7-6, and his doubles pair subsequently reeled off back-to-back mini-breaks before going on to clinch the tie. “It was instigated by the Japan team. They went first, but it was certainly on the radar once we got into that deciding tie-break,” revealed Great Britain captain Henman in his on-court interview. “The spirit has been so good since we arrived in Perth. Their work ethic and the camaraderie has been absolutely outstanding. My request was for them to go out there and enjoy the challenge and compete for every point.” Skupski added: “Obviously it was a very up-and-down tie-break. Both captains brought out the timeout, and I was a bit confused when it all happened, but extremely proud to get through that moment. It's a great win for GB.” Nicholls and Skupski, along with the rest of their British teammates, will now prepare for Monday's clash with Team Greece in Perth. The winner of that tie will qualify for the quarter-finals as the winner of Group E, while Japan is eliminated. “Unbelievable. We had amazing support from the crowd,” said Nicholls. “I've actually got family here who I'm staying with in Perth this week which is making it even more special. We've had amazing team spirit this week. I've really enjoyed being part of this team, so it's just incredible to get the win.”

At a time when ""memorization feels irrelevant,"" the academic institutions teaching the scions of the entertainment industry are embracing AI in different ways, from browser lockdowns to personalized chatbot avatars.  


							By

	Almost immediately after ChatGPT was first released in late 2022, alarm bells sounded in the education world about how it would negatively impact learning. That year, The Atlantic ran stories with headlines like “The College Essay Is Dead” and “The End of High School English.” The predictions were that unleashing AI to the world at large would lead to an exponential rise in cheating at school and that student essays would cease to be original.


	“I mean since day one the narrative in education has been really focused on cheating. And AI is still mostly seen as that thing that kids are using to cheat. So, you know, let's not be naive. There are lots of kids using AI to cheat,” says Leon Furze, an educational consultant and the author of Practical AI Strategies: Engaging with Generative AI in Education. But he adds, “We've got to kind of go beyond that, I think and meet the students where they're at with the technology.”

	Cut to 2025 and that is what's happening at many of Los Angeles' top private schools, where panic has been replaced with pragmatism.


	Yes, there are guardrails. Many schools carve out AI-free zones for test-taking, essay writing and other creative endeavors. “A lot more work, especially writing assignments, is now done exclusively in class,” says showrunner and writer Anthony Sparks (Bel-Air, Queen Sugar), who has a child at the prestigious Harvard-Westlake School.

	











	The same applies at L.A.'s Sierra Canyon School (where recent graduates have included Bronny and Bryce James). Says Noah B. Salomon, the school's English department chair, “For most assignments, in order to preserve training in independent critical thinking, we create an environment where students cannot use AI [such as] in-class writing, participating, graded discussions.”


	But as generative AI continues to seep into seemingly every facet of society, administrators and teachers are increasingly looking at creative ways to engage with the technology with an eye toward preparing students for the real world. 


	Last July, The Buckley School (which Laura Dern, Bret Easton Ellis and Paris Hilton once attended) held a one-week AI Intensive summer camp on campus ($1,500 for the week), where middle-school-age students could learn everything from “AI + Art” to how to “leverage machine learning to help first responders allocate resources in crisis situations.”


	At Windward School (which Josh Groban and Zoe Kazan attended), a special education and tech team has been working on helping teachers deepen their understanding of ChatGPT, Google Gemini and MagicSchool AI (an education focused AI platform).


	And at Sierra Canyon School, the administration has formed a partnership with AI education platform edYOU, which provides students with personalized chatbot avatars that can help them with everything from tutoring to tracking their coursework.

	











	Sierra Canyon's Salomon details additional ways that the school is engaging students in the use of AI. “We have asked teachers to experiment, to find ways to leverage the power of AI in their teaching and to encourage students to use AI in a way that is ethical and that does not interfere with their learning or their curiosity. For example, students in a literature class might be asked to have a conversation with ChatGPT about a particular chapter of a novel, but they will be required to use specific quotes from the novel to challenge ChatGPT's initial reading. Students might be encouraged to use AI to create quizzes on material or to have AI review an essay to offer another source of feedback on structure.”


	And for every student who wants to use AI as a crutch or shortcut, there are other students who are concerned about using it responsibly, even sparingly. “I had a 13-year-old student who asked me, ‘Even if my school teaches us how to use AI, should we?'” shares Furze. “And she was really concerned that if she starts using AI at 13 years old, that by the time she's 18, she won't be able to use her own brain anymore. There are really young students who are genuinely concerned about this. On the flip side, I'm also seeing that there's a lot of pressure with students to use AI because they think they'll be outcompeted. There's a lot of perception that, ‘if I don't use AI, the student next to me is going to use AI and they're going to do better. So I have to use it to stay competitive.'”

	











	Adds Stacie Muñoz, director of educational innovation and technology services at Oakwood School (whose alumni include Chris Pine and Lily-Rose Depp), “I think there is an assumption that all kids are using AI all the time and I will say that I have talked to many kids who are not falling in that camp and are really hesitant about AI and actually like look down upon others for using it. You know, these kids are really smart now.”


	Even so, Oakwood School is also requiring that more writing is done in-class and it's evaluating various forms of technology that can be harnessed to limit and prevent AI use, including so-called browser lockdowns on computers. “Kids can still type, but they can't access other things on their computers,” says Muñoz. She adds that, “we utilize things like Google Docs ‘Version History' checker to sort of keep an eye that kids are staying within their documents doing the work … because we're seeing that it's just so easy to default to using AI.” But Oakwood is not currently using AI checkers to evaluate whether students use the technology in completing assignments. “We actually did a professional development for teachers in a recent meeting where we took an email that I used AI to help me write and we put it through three different AI checkers and they all came up with different responses. One said no AI was used, one said about 50 percent. They all said different things. So we actually use that as an example for our teachers to say, ‘We can't actually trust AI against AI.'

	











	“And if anything,” she continues, “it's just gonna build distrust with our students. That's not a direction we're choosing to go in because there's really no proof that those work. And if anything, it's just gonna build more distrust.”


	School leaders and students are also navigating a host of other concerns around AI from thinking about whether AI will increase or diminish career prospects in certain fields (like graphic design or video game design) to looking at the environmental impact of the technology, which is dramatically increasing energy usage across the globe.” At a school like Oakwood, sustainability is really important to our students and our community,” says Muñoz. “They are thinking about the long-term effects of constant AI use on our planet.”


	For parents and tech entrepreneurs Adam Ayers and Victoria de la Fuente, who live in Los Angeles and have two young boys, the dawning of generative AI factors into their decision making around schooling. The couple (who founded social platform Doomscrollr) currently send their elder son to a Montessori school “because they're really focusing on independence, on self-learning and teachable life skills,” says de la Fuente, who is also the founder of Zillion Trillion, an education-focused Substack newsletter and podcast. More than ever, the couple want to avoid schools that put a focus on memorization, while favoring schools that lean into process-based learning. “From what I can see in the schools I've been visiting, they're still very much pushing the memorization route. It just feels like in the age of AI where they can just have vast access to all that information. It feels irrelevant,” says de la Fuente.

	











	That's something that resonates with Muñoz: “For us, it's about finding a balance of when can we insert AI appropriately without losing that human piece. It's really pushed us to work with teachers on how we can reevaluate the way we are teaching and maybe change some of our assessments a little bit to focus on more of the human elements that AI can't replicate. How do we really incentivize being human? That's a big part of our conversation.”

“Breaking Amish” star Jeremiah Raber was airlifted to a hospital with a very high, life-threatening blood sugar level and “possible liver failure.”

Raber made the reveal via TikTok Tuesday, telling his followers that he was “waiting to be life flighted to another hospital.” He also shared a selfie of himself in a hospital bed.

His blood sugar level was “993,” and the Cleveland Clinic states that blood sugar levels less than 100 are “normal fasting blood sugar levels,” while 126 or above potentially indicates that a person has diabetes.

The reality TV personality, 45, shared another TikTok post on Tuesday that showed him being taken onto a helicopter on a stretcher. 

He also posted another selfie video from a hospital bed.

Then, in an update on Saturday, Raber thanked his followers for their prayers and wrote, “I'm doing good and will be out tomorrow!”

“Stay positive, let the haters hate and live your life to the fullest! Get some rest,” one fan wrote, while another replied: “Sending healing energy.”

A third person wrote, “Take care of yourself! Heal before you [stress] about anything! Care for you because nobody else can. Know what I mean? Stay healthy. Please!”

Raber's latest health issue comes more than a year after he spent two days in the hospital for heart issues and diabetic ketoacidosis, according to InTouch Weekly.

Diabetic ketoacidosis is a “a life-threatening complication of diabetes and undiagnosed Type 1 diabetes,” according to the Cleveland Clinic. 

Raber was one of the breakout stars of TLC's “Breaking Amish” when it premiered in 2012. The docuseries followed young Amish and Mennonite adults as they left their traditional and insular culture to experience the modern world for the first time.

Following his exit from the show, Raber returned to the franchise for 2014's “Return to Amish.” He remained a part of the cast for seven seasons.

GO NEW MEXICO


go_new_mexico










 

Less than 15 minutes from Aztec Ruins National Monument in northwestern New Mexico on mostly graded gravel roads, Alien Run Mountain Bike Trail parking area provides year-round access to hiking, biking and birding. The free Bureau of Land Management recreation site has majestic views of Colorado mountain peaks to the north.

The Alien Run system, named for a purported UFO crash site, has more than 5-mile uninterrupted trail in high desert landscape. Hikers need to pay attention to avoid bikers zipping along the single-tracks that roll through badlands and slickrock. But there's plenty of room for all, and trails are marked one-way to improve the shared experience between those on two-wheels, those on two legs and those with four paws. Pets are allowed in all areas but must be under control, the BLM website says.

“The trails here provide a wide variety of experiences including playful and flowing single track, exposed sections along the tops of escarpments, slickrock play areas, and loose and rocky challenging trail with significant changes in elevation,” according to the BLM recreation website.

The area is one of Bureau of Land Management's “Backyard to Backcountry” treasures. Alien Run Trails-Super Loop was developed between the International Mountain Biking Association and the Farmington BLM office.

Near mile 4, the alleged UFO crash site is off to the left, according to the Mountain Bike Project website. 

A plaque marks the spot with claims about the UFO. Believers learn more at the Aztec tourism site, aztecnm.com/aztec/ufocrashsite.html.

The parking area includes covered picnic tables, a vault toilet and an array of tools to repair mountain bikes — but bring your own water, and you can pick up picnic supplies in Aztec. As befits BLM land, the area glows and hums throughout the night with oil extraction and natural gas activity.

Two Colorado bikers said these trails were more navigable, especially in the morning when the damp ground from recent rain and snow was still frozen, than those near Durango, which were covered with snow and ice at the end of December.

Alien Run Mountain Bike Trail has a 14-day stay limit for camping. The BLM warns the last mile of the road to the site can be slippery after rain or snow.

Home » China » Yu Menglong and the Countdown to 2026: Psychic Claims, Celebrity Silence, and an Unanswered Death

As 2025 draws to a close, the death of Chinese actor Yu Menglong remains officially unexplained, emblematic of a broader pattern of opacity that has long characterized the Chinese entertainment industry. No official explanation has been released, and no detailed investigation has been made public. What persists instead is institutional silence, accompanied by a widening constellation of unofficial narratives that now circulate largely outside the People's Republic of China.

Among overseas Chinese communities, particularly those shaped by exile, censorship fatigue, and distrust of state narratives, Yu's name has become a focal point for deeper anxieties. Discussions surrounding his death are increasingly framed through speculation, spiritual interpretation, and claims that situate the case within structural pathologies of China's celebrity system rather than an isolated tragedy. These accounts do not originate from court records or official press briefings. They emerge from informal, transnational information channels—divination blogs, livestreamed psychic sessions, encrypted chats, and audiences seeking coherence where public disclosure has ceased.

Two figures recur with notable frequency in these discussions.One is Li Jingwei, a Taiwanese blogger who practices Nadi astrology. The other is Kandis Starr, an American psychic medium who conducts live sessions using a device commonly referred to as a spirit box. Though operating in vastly different cultural and epistemological registers, both advance a shared premise: that the truth surrounding Yu Menglong's death is unlikely to surface through China's formal institutions.

On the 100th day after Yu's death, Li Jingwei conducted a second reading using Nadi astrology. Nadi astrology, a South Asian divination tradition rooted in palm-leaf manuscripts, is believed by its adherents to preserve individual life records across centuries.. Li has described it not as fortune-telling, but as an archival system of fate—an inherited ledger of human trajectories rather than a predictive exercise.

According to Li, the central image that emerged during the reading was symbolic rather than literal. She described seeing a figure whose upper body resembled a fish, while its lower half took the form of a snake. In her interpretive framework, the fish signifies surface visibility and apparent harmlessness, while the snake denotes concealment, entanglement, and coercive control.

Crucially, Li argues that the image does not implicate a single individual. Instead, it reflects a structure.In her reading, the symbolism points to a system that presents itself as orderly and benign, while operating through diffuse pressure, asymmetric dependence, and quiet enforcement beneath the surface. She links this imagery to the astrological constellation Ashlesha, traditionally associated with power exercised through contracts, obligation, and psychological leverage rather than overt violence.

Within this framework, Yu's death is described as the outcome of distributed complicity rather than a singular, decisive act.. Instructions, Li claims, were not issued openly. Responsibilities were divided. Some individuals acted; others remained passive; still others benefited indirectly. When the situation became irreversible, accountability was nowhere to be found.

Li has said that the reading suggested any evidence accessible to official institutions was eliminated at an early stage. On this basis, she concludes that no formal investigation will ever yield a public accounting—an assessment that resonates with long-standing skepticism toward internal review mechanisms in politically sensitive cases.

Instead, she points to a different trajectory.Information related to Yu's death, she argues, is more likely to surface incrementally outside China's information controls. She anticipates fragments emerging through overseas social platforms, statements from industry insiders operating beyond state jurisdiction, and commentary by independent journalists and researchers. In particular, she identifies YouTube and X as likely vectors for such disclosures, given their role in diaspora discourse and informal whistleblowing.

Timing occupies a central role in her interpretation. The readings consistently return to a window between March and June of 2026. She does not frame this period as one of official revelation, but rather as a moment when dispersed fragments may begin to cohere into a recognizable pattern.

During the reading, certain terms appeared repeatedly. These included references to drugs, poisoning, organs, population trafficking, and underground transactions. Li is careful to stress that these should not be read as verified claims. She presents them instead as symbolic indicators pointing toward a broader, transnational network of illicit exchange—one that may intersect with, but is not reducible to, Yu's death alone.

She has also warned that Yu may not be the only person affected. According to the reading, three to five additional individuals may already be entangled in comparable circumstances, their situations unresolved or not yet visible.

Parallel narratives have emerged from Kandis Starr, an American psychic medium who conducts livestreamed sessions using a spirit box device. While such practices sit well outside the evidentiary standards of journalism or law, they nonetheless command large audiences within online subcultures shaped by mistrust of official information. During a broadcast on Dec. 19, Starr stated that she received confirmation indicating Yu died on Sept. 10, a date that differs from earlier online speculation.

Starr also claimed that Yu was aware of videos depicting his alleged mistreatment. According to her account, the device suggested that some individuals involved in distributing those videos were not directly responsible for his death. When viewers referenced alleged dark-web footage, Starr reported prolonged affirmative signals, a moment that rapidly circulated in clipped form across social media.

One of her most striking claims involved surveillance. When asked whether Yu's phone had been fitted with tracking or monitoring software, Starr said the device responded immediately and continued to signal. She interpreted the sustained response as indicative of prolonged distress rather than an isolated incident.

During the same session, Starr addressed questions submitted by viewers about actress Dilraba Dilmurat. When asked whether Dilraba was in danger, Starr reported an affirmative response from the device.

A follow-up question raised the possibility of connections between Dilraba and individuals described by viewers as part of a Chinese elite or so-called royal lineage. Starr again reported sustained affirmative signals. She cautiously suggested that these might indicate familial, social, or institutional proximity rather than direct involvement.

No evidence was presented to support these claims, and they remain unverified. Nevertheless, the exchange spread rapidly across Chinese- and English-language platforms, amplifying speculation and placing additional pressure on an industry already marked by silence and fear.

Beneath these narratives lies a long-standing pattern within China's entertainment sector. Over the past two decades, multiple high-profile figures have vanished from public life due to sudden illness, psychological collapse, legal accusations, or unexplained absence. Official explanations, when offered, are often cursory and internally inconsistent.

This uncertainty has fueled demand for fortune-tellers, ritual specialists, and self-styled spiritual masters. The late Wang Lin—once patronized by celebrities and political elites alike—is frequently cited as a cautionary example. Known for theatrical rituals involving snakes and talismans, Wang later died after imprisonment and illness, his public standing destroyed.

Critics argue that such practices reflect desperation rather than belief. In traditional religious frameworks, ritual is meant to cultivate restraint, ethical clarity, and self-discipline—not to purchase protection or impunity.. When belief becomes transactional, its moral foundation erodes.

Yu Menglong's death remains officially unexplained. In the absence of transparent institutions, unofficial narratives continue to proliferate, shaped by grief, distrust, and the widespread conviction that prolonged silence is itself a form of communication.

Whether 2026 brings clarity or merely additional fragments remains uncertain. For many observers, particularly in the Chinese diaspora, the story has not concluded. It has simply migrated beyond the places where answers are typically expected to emerge.","{'href': 'https://www.visiontimes.com', 'title': 'Vision Times'}","other"

Several lawmakers are condemning President Trump after he shared a video on social media Saturday alleging Gov. Tim Walz is behind the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman.

Walz responded to the president's Truth Social post, saying it is ""dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States.""

""In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this,"" Walz said.

Hortman was shot and killed alongside her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert, on June 14, 2025, inside the family's Brooklyn Park home. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot and wounded in their Champlin home 90 minutes earlier. 

Vance Boelter, 58, faces federal charges for the shootings, including two counts of murder. He allegedly dressed as a police officer and managed to evade arrest for 40 hours.  According to prosecutors, Boelter had a hit list of lawmakers and other public officials, including staffers at Planned Parenthood. He pleaded not guilty in August.

In a statement, House DFL Leader Zack Stephenson called out Mr. Trump, calling the claims about Hortman's death ""untruthful"" and ""outrageous.""

""Tonight, Donald Trump, who couldn't be bothered to lower the flags to half staff or even say Melissa Hortman's name until now, is spreading outrageous lies about her death,"" Stephenson said. ""Here is the truth: Melissa was murdered by a right-wing, anti-abortion extremist who believed conspiracy theories about COVID. Melissa Hortman and Tim Walz were friends and allies. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying.""

Stephenson went on to say that any political leader in the state who does not condemn the president's post ""isn't fit to hold office.""

Republican state Sen. Julia Coleman also encouraged lawmakers to ""call for an end to baseless conspiracy theories.""

""We must all reject this behavior outright and refuse to tolerate it. The American people, grieving families, and the legacies of those lost deserve far better,"" Coleman said. ""Debate policies fiercely. Fight for what you believe in. But do not speculate, guess, or spread stories that are plainly false and deeply harmful. It's time to restore dignity to our political discourse.""

Several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Angie Craig and Betty McCollum, specifically called for Republican legislators to condemn Mr. Trump's post.

McCollum also demanded that the president apologize to the Hortman family, Walz and Minnesotans.

      Hey everyone and happy new year! Today I am covering sightings from Saskatchewan and wow theres a lot! The Langenburg sighting is truly amazing and I am curious to know what everyone thinks. This was fun to research and please let me know if youve ever seen anything out there! I covered a larger spectrum of time this time.
    


      The question of the most convincing UFO sighting ever recorded is complex and often depends on individual belief and the nature of the evidence. However, several incidents and testimonies have stood out as particularly compelling to many Redditors. Here are some of the most frequently cited and discussed examples:
    


      Statements from credible, high-ranking individuals have lent significant weight to the existence of UFOs, even if they don't describe a single sighting in detail.
    


Vice Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (First CIA Director): ""Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense. To hide the facts, the Air Force has silenced its personnel.""



President Jimmy Carter: ""If I become president, I will make every piece of information this country has about UFO sightings available to the public and to scientists. I am convinced that UFOs exist because I have seen one.""



Astronaut Gordon Cooper: ""I believe these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this pla...""



President Barack Obama: ""What is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there is footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are.""



      While not always fully explained, some specific sightings have garnered significant attention and even official acknowledgment of their unidentified nature.
    


Lakenheath 1956 Incident: ""The apparently rational intelligent behaviour of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of the sighting."" - This refers to a case investigated by the Condon Committee.
    


      Detailed personal accounts, especially when corroborated by other witnesses or similar reports, can be particularly compelling.
    


Rectangular Craft Sighting: ""Floating there silently about 300 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, and slowly gliding across the street, is a rectangular craft, with curved corners, and with three large dim almost organic lights on the bottom.""



Corroboration: ""I might have seen this at the end of December. I saw a single bright light low to the ground. As I got closer it was 3 lights under a rectangle. I could see the silhouette of the craft.""



Triangular Craft Sighting: [""I saw a perfect triangle in the sky with orange dots at each tip. I looked down to try and take a picture for my mom and when I looked back bottom 2 dots slowly faded out and the top one of the dots flew over my head going west at speeds I've never even seen the most advanced planes fly at.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/

Weaker Body Clocks Linked to Dementia Risk

A new study suggests that disruptions in the body's internal clock may be tied to a higher risk of dementia. Research published on December 29, 2025, in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that people with weaker and more irregular circadian rhythms were more likely to develop dementia. The study also showed that individuals whose daily activity levels peaked later in the day faced a higher risk than those who peaked earlier. While these findings reveal a strong link, they do not show that circadian rhythm changes directly cause dementia.

What Circadian Rhythms Do in the Body

Circadian rhythm refers to the body's natural timing system. It controls the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle and helps regulate key functions such as hormone release, digestion, and body temperature. This internal clock is directed by the brain and responds to environmental signals, especially light.

When circadian rhythms are strong, the body stays closely aligned with the daily cycle of light and dark. This leads to consistent patterns of sleep and activity, even when schedules or seasons change. In contrast, weaker rhythms make the body clock more sensitive to disruptions. People with less stable rhythms are more likely to shift their sleep and activity times due to changes in routine or daylight.

Aging, Circadian Changes, and Dementia

""Changes in circadian rhythms happen with aging, and evidence suggests that circadian rhythm disturbances may be a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like dementia,"" said study author Wendy Wang, MPH, PhD, of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. School of Public Health at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. ""Our study measured these rest-activity rhythms and found people with weaker and more fragmented rhythms, and people with activity levels that peaked later in the day, had an elevated risk of dementia.""

Who Took Part in the Study

The research followed 2,183 adults with an average age of 79 who did not have dementia when the study began. Among the participants, 24% were Black people and 76% were white people.

Each participant wore a small heart monitor attached to the chest for an average of 12 days. These devices tracked periods of rest and activity, allowing researchers to analyze circadian rhythm patterns. Participants were then monitored for about three years. During that time, 176 people were diagnosed with dementia.

How Researchers Measured Rhythm Strength

Scientists examined the heart monitor data using several indicators of circadian rhythm strength. One key measure was relative amplitude, which reflects the difference between a person's most active and least active times of day. Higher relative amplitude indicated a stronger and more clearly defined daily rhythm.

Participants were divided into three groups based on rhythm strength. When comparing the strongest and weakest groups, 31 of the 728 people in the high rhythm group developed dementia, while 106 of the 727 people in the low rhythm group did. After accounting for factors such as age, blood pressure, and heart disease, researchers found that those in the weakest rhythm group had nearly two and a half times the risk of dementia. Each standard deviation drop in relative amplitude was linked to a 54% increase in dementia risk.

Later Activity Peaks and Higher Risk

The timing of daily activity also appeared to matter. People whose activity peaked later in the afternoon, at 2:15 p.m. or later, had a higher risk of dementia than those whose activity peaked earlier, between 1:11 p.m.-2:14 p.m. About 7% of participants in the earlier peak group developed dementia, compared with 10% in the later peak group, representing a 45% higher risk.

A later activity peak may reflect a mismatch between the body's internal clock and environmental signals such as daylight and darkness.

Why Disrupted Rhythms Might Matter

""Disruptions in circadian rhythms may alter body processes like inflammation, and may interfere with sleep, possibly increasing amyloid plaques linked to dementia, or reducing amyloid clearance from the brain,"" said Wang. ""Future studies should examine the potential role of circadian rhythm interventions, such as light therapy or lifestyle changes, to determine if they may help lower a person's risk of dementia.""

Study Limitations

One limitation of the research is that it did not include data on sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, which could have influenced the results.
