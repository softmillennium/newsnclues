                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi expressed his aspiration for Egypt to host the FIFA World Cup in the future during a meeting with football's global governing body in Cairo on Sunday. The tournament, which is the first to feature an expanded 48-team format, will run from 11 June to 19 July 2026 and consist of a record 104 matches. The president stated that the event presents an important opportunity to promote sports tourism and culture among youth. Egypt has already secured its place in the 2026 finals after finishing top of its qualifying group in October 2025. The visiting group included former Italian international Fabio Cannavaro, winner of the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year award, alongside Javier Ignacio Cepsi Berdevsky, a director at FIFA's Zurich headquarters, and World Cup tour director Sebastian Ferrio. Egypt is one of nine African nations to have qualified directly for the 2026 tournament, joining Algeria, Cabo Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia. The meeting was attended by Egyptian Minister of Youth and Sports Ashraf Sobhy and Egyptian Football Association President Hany Abo Rida. He expressed his hope that the Egyptian national team would achieve positive results and reiterated his desire for Egypt to host the competition in the future. The 2026 World Cup is set to open on 11 June at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, with a match between co-hosts Mexico and South Africa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Luke Littler has, on the back of successfully defending his World Darts Championship title, invited Bayern Munich wonderkid Lennart Karl to join Manchester United and bring prolific frontman Harry Kane with him. Littler is a passionate Red Devils supporter and would love to see players of potential and pedigree make their way to Old Trafford in upcoming transfer windows. Littler, who continues to dominate his chosen profession at 18 years of age, knows all about the challenges of being a teen sensation. He is among those to have been impressed by the development of Karl in Germany. He already has Bundesliga and Champions League goals to his name, with there no holding the youngster back as he heads down a similar path to Barcelona superstar Lamine Yamal. Fresh from capturing a first global crown in 2025, he has repeated the trick by going back-to-back. Littler has revealed, during a discussion with Sport1, that he was contacted by Karl when making his way through another major tournament at Alexandra Palace. The Bayern starlet urged him to “keep it up” while blowing opponents away. Karl is hoping that he will have silverware to lift over the coming months, as Bayern remain in the hunt for domestic and continental crowns. Bayern may find it difficult to fend off advances if huge transfer offers are tabled. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. They need to find consistency before setting their sights that high, with Ruben Amorim struggling to get the Red Devils moving in the right direction. Littler added that the youngster can “bring Harry Kane along too!” England captain Kane, who broke his trophy duck with Bayern last season when becoming a Bundesliga title winner, has been linked with United on a regular basis across recent windows. He does have clauses in his contract that can be triggered in 2026, with it suggested that a bid of £57 million ($77m) would be enough to enter into talks. A return to the Premier League has been mooted for Spurs' all-time leading scorer - with Alan Shearer's goal record in that division still there to be shot at. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Ex-United defender Danny Simpson believes a move to Manchester could happen, saying of the options available to Kane: “I don't know where else he could go, if I'm honest. I can't see him turning Manchester United down. “He can come back, and get the goals record. He's won his trophies at Bayern now, so if he comes back and gets Manchester United back up to the top of the Premier League, he could be a Manchester United legend like when [Robin] van Persie came.” Kane has registered 115 goals for Bayern through 121 appearances. United are crying out for that kind of firepower, with Littler and Co seeing big-money summer signing Sesko find the target on just two occasions through his debut campaign in England.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MagentaTV really went all out for this World Cup. German television is rarely short of star names to talk about the World Cup. In 2022, for example, then then still-retired Toni Kroos worked with his brother Felix Kroos and a certain Michael Ballack, watching as Germany crashed and burned. Telekom's Head of TV, Arnim Butzen, had this to say about the trio: “With our team of experts for the 2026 World Cup, we are setting new standards. With Müller, Klopp, and Hummels, we've been able to attract real football personalities who will clearly express their opinions and bring the tournament closer to the fans in an entertaining way. Müller and Hummels are, of course former stars for the German national team and are very popular in Germany. They are also, incidentally, very good friends from their shared time with the national team and the three years they spent as teammates at Bayern Munich. One can expect a lot of banter and know how from the popular duo, The latter of trio, Klopp, was arguably the most popular of them all before he recently joined Rasenballsport Leipzig. He gained notoriety for his work at Mainz 05, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool FC, even coaching Hummels for quite some time. Truly, this is an all star trio of pundits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid and England star Jude Bellingham has been defended from criticism by pundit Gordon Strachan, who insists that both Xabi Alonso and Thomas Tuchel need to "protect" the midfielder. Bellingham has been at the centre of controversy at international level and has also previously been defended by Ian Wright. Bellingham has been at the centre of international criticism and has become something of a lightning rod for those who wish to take aim at England on the international stage. Tuchel has previously said that he finds some of Bellingham's behaviour "repulsive", a comment he apologised for, and much was made of the midfielder's allegedly angry response to being substituted against Albania. Wright said in November: “They need to create this kind of controversy because there is nothing else to say until the World Cup, so it's going to continue like this until the World Cup. A young man blessed, endowed with overflowing talent and love.” Strachan has called on both of Bellingham's managers, at club and international level, to help protect Bellingham from the slings and arrows being launched at him. An old-school professional, the former Manchester United and Leeds star told The Telegraph: "The poor guy is turning up and he knows that if he plays a wee bit badly, he's gonna get battered. “As a manager you have to protect them.

Tuchel has been asked about Bellingham's behaviour, and stopped short of defending his player, instead appearing to condemn him. He said after the Albania game: “I don't want to make more out of it but I stick to my words - 'behaviour is key' and respect towards the team-mates who come in. Decisions are made and you have to accept it as a player. I saw he was not happy, I don't want to make it bigger at the moment than it is. My words stand, we are about standards, level and commitment to each other and respect to each other. We will not change or decision just because someone waves their arms.” Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Los Blancos are currently second in La Liga, seven points behind current leaders Barcelona with a game in hand. England are currently preparing for their 2026 World Cup campaign, where they will face Croatia, Ghana, and Panama in the group stage. Bellingham will hope to be involved in every single one of those fixtures, but he has previously warned that FIFA must improve the quality of pitches compared to the Club World Cup. Hopefully it's something that someone will look at, going into the World Cup next year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now it's time for someone to win a fourth World Cup. World Cup 1994 wasn't a truly outstanding tournament, but it did serve up its fair share of memorable moments. Saudi Arabia's Saeed Al-Owairan scoring a legendary goal against Belgium. Yordan Letchkov's headed winner for Bulgaria against Germany. Diana Ross' penalty miss in the opening ceremony. The curious thing is that none of these involve much Brazilian brilliance. Carlos Alberto Parreira is a legendary World Cup coach because of the longevity and diversity of his career as much as this success in the United States. Parreira spent his career mixing those experiences with jobs in — and for — Brazil. He had a role on the coaching staff when they won World Cup 1970, and an interim spell as manager in 1983. When he was appointed in 1991, Brazil hadn't won the World Cup for over two decades, and the public demanded success. They also demanded entertaining football, which Parreira wasn't always able to provide. This generation of Brazilian players lacked guile, and Parreira himself favoured a more cautious style. When his name was read out as part of pre-match team announcements, many Brazilians booed. In their five-team qualification group, a strange fixture list meant they started with four away games — winning only one — and then had four home matches in a row, and therefore were always playing catch-up. Their 2-0 loss to Bolivia in La Paz, a tough away venue because of its altitude, came courtesy of two goals in the final three minutes and was considered a disaster back home, because it was Brazil's first-ever World Cup qualification loss. They eventually squeezed through to the tournament — but went into it in a state of uncertainty, amid federation involvement in selection decisions, squabbling players and inevitable disputes about bonus payments. Brazil's preparation for this World Cup was excellent. They had by far the most extensive backroom staff at the competition, a big emphasis on video analysis, and Parreira imposed strict discipline, particularly in terms of timekeeping. Even after Brazil had won the final, the players were still ordered to be back in their rooms by 11pm. Parreira found the experience of being in charge of Brazil very difficult, and had already agreed to join Spanish club Valencia going into the tournament. “There was unbearable, almost inhuman pressure bearing down on me because Brazil had not won the World Cup since 1970,” he said in Chris Jones' book World Cup Stories. “That was mentally and physically exhausting for years, even during the qualifiers.” Indeed, even when Brazil won a qualifier 6-0 against Bolivia, he received criticism for his system being too rigid. This was not the free-flowing, gloriously fluid Brazil who won World Cup 1970. But Brazil's subsequent failures, particularly in 1982, had demonstrated that approach was no longer viable. Instead, Parreira turned to a system which was generally considered more ‘European' than many Brazilians wanted, although he abandoned the disastrous use of a sweeper at World Cup 1990 and returned to a back four, the structure Brazil had popularised at World Cup 1958. Mario Santos played alongside Aldair, who came in for the injured Ricardo Rocha midway through the first game, a 2-0 win against Russia. This was a 4-4-2, sometimes considered a 4-2-2-2 because the wide players drifted inside — and also because the two holding midfielders never ventured forward. Many considered it overkill to field both Dunga and Mauro Silva but both performed their defensive jobs excellently and Dunga attempted more forward passes than is often implied, including a lovely outside-of-the-foot through ball for a Romario goal against Cameroon. Rai could provide moments of magic but was inconsistent and had been in poor form for Paris Saint-Germain. “I feel Mazinho has played well in this World Cup, and I want to take advantage of his good form,” Parreira said before the 1-0 win over the Americans. “He has good pace and will do well on the right of midfield.” But Mazinho had previously been introduced in place of either holding midfielder. He was merely a useful midfielder who started all seven games without providing a goal or an assist, and was arguably most notable for helping Branco cope with Marc Overmars in the thrilling 3-2 quarter-final win over the Netherlands. Then, up front, Brazil pretty much left Romario and Bebeto to do their own thing. After a relatively fallow period for genuine world-class Brazilian attackers, there was no question Romario was a truly exceptional goalscorer. He was unusually short for a striker (167cm/5ft 6in) and spent long periods of games looking completely disinterested, but he was a brilliant penalty-box player. “Romario is short on humility, long on talent,” as a New York Times headline read in the build-up to this World Cup. He had badly fallen out with Parreira a couple of years beforehand, after an incident when Romario was convinced to fly back to Brazil for a friendly despite being unfit, but then didn't play in the game. He was then absent from the national side for a year, before Parreira panicked that Brazil might not make it to the World Cup ahead of a literal must-win final qualification match against Uruguay. Parreira recalled Romario, who scored both goals in a 2-0 win, and from then on his place in the side was assured. It's also worth considering that this World Cup started just over a month after the tragic passing of Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, at that point Brazil's national hero. In a 3-0 defeat of Cameroon, he produced a calm one-on-one finish to make it 1-0, and in the final group game, he produced a dribble and toe-poke to catch out the Sweden 'keeper, a goal reminiscent of Ronaldo's semi-final winner against Turkey eight years later. He won the tournament's Golden Ball award for best player, then FIFA's World Player of the Year award for this year. If Brazil's approach was largely about defending with eight players and attacking with two, the problem was that the two seemed to hate each other. Romario had spent much of the previous year opining on what starting XI Parreira should pick, and this usually involved selecting his friend Edmundo. When Romario left Vasco da Gama and moved to Europe with PSV of the Netherlands, Bebeto was his replacement, making a highly controversial move from Rio de Janeiro rivals Flamengo. Bebeto helped Vasco to their first title in 15 years and was named South American Player of the Year, which annoyed Romario. They were then cast as rivals for a Brazil starting spot. Later, they were rivals in Spain: Bebeto moved to Deportivo La Coruna, while Romario joined Barcelona. They won the top goalscorer award in 1992-93 and 1993-94, respectively. In the latter season, Romario — always rattled by any kind of comparison to anyone — started calling Bebeto ‘crybaby' for his habit of complaining to referees. Many felt Bebeto should have stepped up to take it. Still, they worked brilliantly on the pitch, and when Romario was enduring his estrangement from the national side, Bebeto surprisingly lobbied for his return. This didn't stop them repeatedly teeing up one another in matches. With so much media speculation about their relationship, Brazil held a special press conference the day before the semi-final with both players, to try to show they were now on good terms. “Bebeto is a family type, stay at home. Bebeto is a much more free-flowing player than I am. My strength is, a lot of people think I'm asleep.” Amid all this, Romario's favourite, Edmundo, was excluded due to a lack of form and discipline, while a 17-year-old Ronaldo — who at this point had ‘Ronaldinho' on the back of his shirt — remained an unused substitute, but would dominate the next two World Cups. The problem was that there were fitness doubts about both. Romario lacked his usual acceleration and Baggio's touch was poor — he had one decent chance in the second half after a quick one-two, but scuffed his shot. A little like the West Germany-Argentina final four years beforehand, this was a game lacking in genuine excitement and goals, but with one clearly superior side. Most notably, Mazinho could have squared to one of three team-mates for a simple tap-in after Branco's free kick was saved, but he missed his kick completely. Later, Mauro Silva's long-range effort was spilt onto the post by goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca. Brazil winger Viola offered some excitement as an extra-time substitute with some quick footwork, but his shots were terrible. With nobody able to score in 120 minutes, penalties were required for the first time in World Cup final history. Even then, only five of the nine were converted, with Brazil's victory sealed when Baggio, utterly exhausted, sent his over the crossbar. “It was like a chess game,” said Parreira. “It was very beautiful to see people who understand football on a tactical level.” Nobody else seemed to think it was beautiful. Clearly, the defining moment was Baggio's shootout penalty. But given his attempt was a literal miss, rather than a save by Claudio Taffarel, we probably need to look elsewhere. This was probably the game of the tournament, and was settled by a genuinely outstanding strike — almost a prototype of Roberto Carlos' Tournoi de France goal three years later — that swerved dramatically, fizzed off the far post and bounced in. Branco with an absolute arrow of a free-kick from the 1994 #FIFAWorldCup! But perhaps the most-repeated moment came earlier in that game. When Bebeto sneaked in behind a Dutch defence who had completely stopped playing because Romario was in an offside position — the ‘not interfering' interpretation was relatively new — he rounded the goalkeeper, slotted into an empty net and then ran off to perform his famous ‘rocking the baby' celebration as a tribute to his newborn baby Matheus, who was two days old. Matheus went on to have a decent career, making over 100 appearances in the Portuguese top flight — although nothing compared to Mazinho's sons Thiago and Rafinha Alcantara, who have 15 major league titles between them. It's difficult to make a case for anyone else. Italy scrapped their way through to the final with an overly rigid system, thanks to the magic of Baggio. Swedish and Bulgarian players became national heroes by reaching the semi-finals, but few would make a case that those teams deserved anything more. The Dutch showed flashes of inspiration, but Brazil deservedly beat them. Brazil's only problem was that they were being compared to the country's legendary sides of 1958, 1962 and, in particular, 1970.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enzo Maresca chose against demanding a £14 million ($19m) pay-off from Chelsea when he walked out of Stamford Bridge. Maresca left Chelsea last week, with the club making a change after the Blues slipped down to fifth in the Premier League table, after a run of just one win in their last five fixtures. Now, the club are preparing for their fixture against Manchester City, with Under-21 coach Calum McFarlane set to take charge of the first-team. The Sun has reported that Maresca's decision to walk away from the Blues saw him turn his back on a potential £14m pay-off, amid reports that he had held talks with Manchester City over potentially replacing Pep Guardiola. He would have been due around £14m, having signed a five-year deal, with the option for a further year, when he joined the club from Leicester City in 2024. He was earning around £4m-per-season, and leaving after 18 months has left an immense amount of money on the table. Maresca's camp also deny any reports that he attempted to strong-arm Chelsea into handing him a new contract by leveraging City's interest in him. Those achievements will remain an important part of the Club's recent history, and we thank him for his contributions to the Club.

Maresca is also understood to be angry at suggestions that he fell out with the club's medical staff, and subsequently risked the health of first-team stars such as Cole Palmer and Reece James. He was frustrated with the amount of confrontations he was forced to have with the club's power-brokers, especially when it came to team selections and potential substitutions. Regardless, he has been tipped to make a swift return to the dugout by Premier League legend Alan Shearer. He said: "His time at Chelsea should be viewed as a successful spell for Maresca. They won the Conference League, which you'd expect, but not many thought they'd go to the Club World Cup and win. I don't think he'll struggle to get another job because of the work he's done at Chelsea and Leicester. Whether he gets one of the big ones remains to be seen. There's been talk about City, hasn't there, but it depends on if Pep Guardiola decides to leave and when, but he won't struggle for a job in England or abroad." Their model is obviously to buy young, develop them, and give them crazy long contracts with the potential to sell. I don't think you're going to win the league like that.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How to watch the Africa Cup of Nations match between Morocco and Tanzania, as well as kick-off time and team news. The clash is set to take place at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where the Atlas Lions will enjoy home support and will be expected to produce. For Morocco, this fixture represents another step in a tournament where expectations are high, given they are playing at home and have a golden generation of footballers. Coach Walid Regragui has publicly urged his squad to stay humble and avoid complacency, warning against underestimating Tanzania despite their lower ranking. For Tanzania, it is a rare opportunity to test themselves against one of Africa's elite nations on the knockout stage, with an upset set to send a massive statement. They progressed to the Round of 16 for the first time in their AFCON history, despite earning only two points in the group stage — a record low for a qualifying side.
