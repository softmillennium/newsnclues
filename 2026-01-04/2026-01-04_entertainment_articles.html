                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Breaking Amish” star Jeremiah Raber was airlifted to a hospital with a very high, life-threatening blood sugar level and “possible liver failure.” Raber made the reveal via TikTok Tuesday, telling his followers that he was “waiting to be life flighted to another hospital.” He also shared a selfie of himself in a hospital bed. His blood sugar level was “993,” and the Cleveland Clinic states that blood sugar levels less than 100 are “normal fasting blood sugar levels,” while 126 or above potentially indicates that a person has diabetes. The reality TV personality, 45, shared another TikTok post on Tuesday that showed him being taken onto a helicopter on a stretcher. He also posted another selfie video from a hospital bed. Then, in an update on Saturday, Raber thanked his followers for their prayers and wrote, “I'm doing good and will be out tomorrow!” Get some rest,” one fan wrote, while another replied: “Sending healing energy.” A third person wrote, “Take care of yourself! Raber's latest health issue comes more than a year after he spent two days in the hospital for heart issues and diabetic ketoacidosis, according to InTouch Weekly.

New look.” And fans have flooded the comment section with their thoughts. “Robert, you are the epitome of cool!” a comment reads. !,” and “I love that you're cracking yourself up in these videos.” Even the official “Top Gun” movie account reacted, writing, “Lookin good there.” The images and short clips include his time on “Dancing with the Stars” with professional dance partner Witney Carson, as well as his wildlife conservation work.

The star was honored for her 'Avatar: Fire and Ash' song at the Palm Springs Film Awards, where she said of the awards race, "There is no single best, it's only our personal best work."


							By

Miley Cyrus was celebrated for her Avatar: Fire and Ash song “Dream As One” at the Palm Springs Film Awards on Saturday, where she spoke out about a downside of Hollywood's awards season.


	Taking the stage at the Palm Springs Convention Center, the star shouted out the orchestra playing her song, teasing, “You guys did amazing — if you're available for the Oscars, that's what we're hoping for.” She also joked that the night was “truly the most elegant Palm Springs party that I have ever been to. There are fewer drag queens than I like, but I'll be stopping by Toucans on the way back to L.A. to get my fix.”

	Cyrus noted how refreshing the awards show was “without the stress of competition,” as the 12 honors are all announced in advance. “So often during awards season, we're set up as competitors, but we're meant to be a community, not opponents. There is no single best, it's only our personal best work,” she said. “Numbers can make it feel like a sport, but performance runs so much deeper than a scoreboard, because each artist, they bare their soul in a completely unique way, and every contribution leaves its own mark on history.”

	“Whether you're in or out of this industry, we all have a persona, even the ones that are rooted in authenticity, because self creation is an art form, and all of us, we perform genuinely,” she continued. “That's something that I deeply admire in both award-winning actors and actresses, and the drag queens of Toucans — they're kind of the same.”

	











	Cyrus also expressed her appreciation to support “stories like Avatar by my friend James Cameron — it's always cool to say that,” and thanked the room for “recognizing their work that I'm totally backpacking off of. They've worked on this movie for 16 years; I've been involved for like a month, and I get to go to all the same events!”

Leonardo DiCaprio was a surprise no-show at tonight's Palm Springs International Film Awards — the Oscar winner couldn't make his flight due to restrictive airspace amid a political conflict in Venezuela — but he sent in a recorded message that doubled down on the need for original movies and the theatrical experience. “I'm stuck on the East Coast,” DiCaprio said in an opening the clip following a tribute from his One Battle After Another co-stars Teyana Taylor and Chase Infiniti. I'm truly grateful to be a part of it even from the distance.” Leonardo DiCaprio Questions if "People Still Have the Appetite" for Movie Theaters DiCaprio, accepting the Desert Palm Achievement Award during a starry ceremony, then turned his attention to One Battle filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. I lived four blocks away and it's now home to one of the last VistaVision projectors on earth.

Jordan; Miley Cyrus; Ethan Hawke; Amanda Seyfried; Kate Hudson; Rose Byrne; the cast of Joachim Trier's Sentimental Value; Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein team including Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth; and Chloé Zhao's Hamnet with Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal.

Guillermo del Toro emotionally announced the passing of his brother while being honored at the Palm Springs Film Awards on Saturday. The director, on hand to receive the Visionary Award at the annual star-studded event, was joined on stage by his Frankenstein stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi and Mia Goth, as he spoke about how, at 61 years old, “I've come to believe that everybody's born with one or two songs to sing. How Hollywood Fell for Guillermo del Toro's 'Frankenstein': "I've Never in 30 Years Had This Reaction" Del Toro told the crowd at the Palm Springs Convention Center how he approached the iconic tale by “making it about fatherhood and forgiveness, because I believe that we want to be forgiven and forgive. Even a broken heart pumps the blood and keeps you going.” The filmmaker — who skipped the event's red carpet — didn't reveal his brother's name or any details about his death, but announced “I may be absent at a few functions this [awards] season, but not this one.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hallmark Channel premieres the first of five Winter Escape movies on January 3, 2026, with “Lost in Paradise” starring Lacey Chabert and Ian Harding. Here's everything we know about the making of “Lost in Paradise!” On September 24, 2025, Chabert revealed in a social media post that she had just returned from Fiji, where she spent a month filming “Lost in Paradise” with Harding. He joked in his Instagram Stories that day, “I truly can't believe @thereallacey put up with me for a month.” Chabert later posted a selfie video from her car, excitedly telling fans, “I can finally tell you about what I've been doing this past month! In the days before the film's premiere, Chabert shared more via social media and in interviews about their remote filming location, including a video montage of them filming. Turns out that adventure included conquering her fear of snakes, Chabert revealed on “Good Morning America” before the movie's premiere, explaining, “When I showed up on set, there were not one but five snakes. In addition to revealing their upcoming movie to fans on September 26, Chabert and Harding were featured in a photo posted that same day by Synthentic Cinema, the production company behind many of Chabert's recent Hallmark movies, including 2025's “She's Making a List,” 2024's “The Christmas Quest,” and 2023's “Haul Out the Holly.” When they weren't filming, the cast and crew stayed at the luxurious Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour, according to a post from Synthetic Cinema. On September 19, the company posted photos of its “Lost in Paradise” crew, writing, “A huge thank you to our incredible international crew from the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji.” The post continued, “What a team – fast, friendly, professional, and creative. And to our cast – thank you for diving headfirst into the adventure with us. “Pretty Little Liars” alum and Hallmark regular Harding also shared how much he loved filming in Fiji, posting a photo carousel on December 30 and writing that working with Chabert “was somehow even better than I imagined it.” He continued, “Thank you @syntheticcinema and @hallmarkchannel for having me, thanks to our little yet mighty crew that gave everything they had and became a fun little family for the three weeks we ‘worked' on the film. And Vinaka Fiji for welcoming us with open arms.” Overseen by popular Hallmark director Dustin Reikert, “Lost in Paradise” also features supporting cast members Lauren Gibson, Paul Hughes, Sean Miguel Perez, and James Trevena, who are all new to Hallmark. On September 19, Synthetic Cinema posted photos from what it called “the most epic Fijian wrap party ever,” hiding Chabert and Harding's faces since the movie had not yet been announced. The beachside party included food, drinks, and dancing with music from local performers. The production company's post said, “What an incredible journey – we've made friends, shared laughs, and created memories that will stay with us forever. Though it's hard to say goodbye, we know this is not the end…Fiji has a way of calling you back. A huge vinaka vakalevu to The Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour for being our home away from home and embracing us with kindness every step of the way.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

Tony Dokoupil Asserts 'CBS Evening News' Will Be Independent From Its Corporate Owner: "I Report For You" From James Gray, Ruben Östlund & Paweł Pawlikowski To Iñárritu's Tom Cruise-Starrer, 'Cliff Booth' & Judith Godrèche's Directorial Debut: 79 Films That Could Light Up Festivals In 2026 Common in the Ninth Circuit, the extrinsic test looks at comparison, context and, in a case like this, specific plot elements. “The panel affirmed the district court's conclusion that Maverick did not share substantialamounts of the original expression of “Top Guns,” and plaintiffs therefore failed to establish a triable issue as to substantial similarity, as required to establish copyright infringement, Judge Miller also stated, writing for a trio that heard the appeal last year. “The panel concluded that there was a lack of similarity in protectable elements of the article, and plaintiffs did not establish an original and protectable selection and arrangement of elements.” With the likes of thorn-in-many-a-studio-paw Marc Taboroff and studio go to lawyer Daniel Petrocelli arguing for their respective clients, the trio of Pasadena-based judges heard arguments back in early June. Additionally, Judge Miller noted that “the panel held that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Paramount on plaintiffs' claim that Paramount breached its 1983 agreement withEhud Yonay by not crediting him in the 2022 movie.” One of a couple of suits that the Joseph Kosinski directed blockbuster has faced since its 2022 release, Shosh Yonay and Yuval Yonay's breach of contract, declaratory relief, and copyright infringement action claimed “Top Guns” rights reverted to them in January 2020 under copyright statutes. They alleged the $1.5 billion box office hit violated termination rights and Paramount, Cruise and  producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and now Par owner David Ellison had no standing to make the sequel to 1986's Top Gun. Yet, as has proven the case with Superman, Jack Kirby and other copyright suits, Toberoff rarely releases a case from his jaw until there is nothing left to knaw on. “That result punishes exactly the kind of original expression copyright was designed to reward.” He went on to say: “We are evaluating all appellate options, including seeking en banc review or certiorari. This decision fundamentally misapplies the substantial similarity doctrine in ways that threaten creators across every medium and is particularly concerning in the age of AI. Sounding a lot like they did in 2024 when Judge Anderson found in their favor, Paramount kept it short and sweet. “We are pleased that the Ninth Circuit recognized that plaintiffs' claims were completely without merit, a spokesperson for the WBD bidding company said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Other holiday victors include sleeper hit 'The Housemaid' and Timothée Chalamet's 'Marty Supreme.' After a bumpy 2025, the new year is off to a good start at the domestic box office, thanks to a varied menu of holiday titles that moviegoers are continuing to feast on before schools and college resume and extended work vacations end. Indeed, New Year's weekend revenue looks to be a post-pandemic best. Disney and 20th Century will announce full details Sunday morning. It's another notch in Cameron's belt, who already directed three of the four biggest movies of all time at the global box office, led by Avatar and followed by Avatar: The Way of Water and Titanic. André Ovredal Horror Movie Gets Title, Release Date from Paramount 'Stranger Things' Finale Lights Up New Year's Box Office With $20M-$25M Haul for Cinemas And, as of Saturday, it is one of only three Hollywood movies released in 2025 to cross $1 billion after fellow Disney titles Lilo & Stitch ($1.038 billion) and the record-smashing Zootopia 2, which has grossed $1.51 billion to date since its Thanksgiving release. Zootopia 2 is expected to fall a scant seven percent in its sixth weekend to come in second with $18 million or more from 3,285 cinemas. Several other titles are also holding in exceptionally well at the New Year's weekend box office. Lionsgate and Paul Feig's well-reviewed sleeper hit The Housemaid could fall just six percent to $14 million for a domestic tally nearing $75 million. The female-skewing thriller is a major win for all involved, and particularly Sydney Sweeney. A24's high-profile period pic Marty Supreme — directed by Josh Safdie and starring Timothée Chalamet as a 1950s table tennis champion — is another holiday stand-out. It was the biggest surprise of Christmas weekend in placing second with $27.1 million. Alongside Angel Studio's faith-based David, Song Sung Blue boasts the highest audience ranking on Rotten Tomatoes (98 percent) of any Christmas title playing nationwide. Universal's Thanksgiving event pic Wicked: For Good is headed for ninth-place, while the weekend's only new nationwide opener — We Bury the Dead — may have to settle for tenth place if it can't get much past $2.7 million. Playing in 1,172 theaters, Zak Hilditch's indie zombie thriller stars Daisy Ridley, and premiered at 2025's South by Southwest. The story follows a young married woman who travels from America to Tasmania in hopes of finding her husband alive. The U.S. military botched a nearby weapons test that obliterated the population of Tasmania, creating either a pile of dead bodies or zombies that gradually become more aggressive. Brenton Thwaites, Matt Whelan, Mark Coles Smith and Kym Jackson also star in the movie, which Vertical is handling. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tony Dokoupil made his debut as CBS Evening News‘ permanent anchor on Saturday with an extended interview with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. “Great to be with you tonight, two days earlier than expected, with that major breaking news, news that could shape the year, maybe even the century,” Dokoupil said, as he introduce a half hour devoted to the U.S. invasion of Venezuela and its seizing of its leader, Nicolás Maduro. Tony Dokoupil To Anchor 'CBS Evening News' On Saturday, Two Days Earlier Than Planned Debut Does that mean we are going to see Americans on the corners of Venezuela? Are you prepared to have troops on the ground in Venezuela?” President Trump sets the terms, and ultimately he will decide what the iterations are of that.” He later said that Trump “takes nothing on the table, so what happens next will be in the hands of Venezuelans to decide, but ultimately America will benefit, security wise and with prosperity we believe the Venezuelan people can as well.” At the press conference today, President Trump seemed to indicate that both were a factor.” Of course what was done by Venezuela against American oil interests and oil companies is well understood and never should have happened. And President Trump is willing to recapture that. But it is also the security of our hemisphere.” Hegseth also was vague when Dokoupil asked whether they would seek congressional authorization “for a full-scale U.S. intervention to stabilize the country of Venezuela.” “Of course we will keep Congress involved,” he said, while insisting that the U.S. operation was a “law enforcement exercise” that did not require informing the legislative branch. Hegseth's sit down was a rather rare one with a mainstream broadcast news outlet, as he has routinely criticized the press since becoming Defense Secretary, and initiated new restrictions that led to the exit of much of the regular Pentagon press corps from the complex. “Many of the president's own supporters tonight are wondering, how is this, this time around, going to be different, and how is it in the U.S. interest?” Hegseth claimed that it was “the exact opposite.” “We spent decades and decades, purchased in blood, and got nothing economically in return. He says, first through strategic action we can ensure that we have access to additional wealth and resources … without having the spend American blood. Dokoupil was to have first taken the chair on Monday, with a planned two-week tour of American cities before returning to CBS studios in New York. But the U.S. action in Venezuela changed those plans. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Judging from this softball interview, it ain't gonna happen! If Americans can steal other countries resources per PH's quote – “He says, first through strategic action we can ensure that we have access to additional wealth and resources … without having the spend American blood.” Then, what is to stop other countries for coming for us?

Departing flights were noted to be “under a ground stop,” though arrivals have proceeded as normal or otherwise been diverted. (DiCaprio was vacationing off the coast of St. Barts with Jeff Bezos and his wife Lauren Sánchez during the New Year festivities.) The Sonoran Desert fete, which runs from Jan. 2-11, is hosting its film awards gala tonight at the Palm Springs Convention Center. PTA's rousing father-daughter adventure drama has made over $205 million at the box office worldwide and appears poised to be an Academy Award frontrunner. In the early morning hours today, President Donald Trump oversaw strikes on Venezuelan soil in a proposed invasion of the South American nation. After toppling and capturing leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, who have since arrived in New York to face charges — including of narco-terrorism conspiracy and destructive devices against the United States — Trump indicated his advisers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, would be tasked with running the country. The tactical decision has drawn harsh criticism and protests for its dubious legality, as some Democrats have branded the military incident an Iraq War deja vu. The Senate is prepared to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution to block the GOP leader from continuing its offensive in Venezuela. Variety was first to report on DiCaprio's absence.

The first was Danny Glover, a veteran sympathizer of leftist regimes in Latin America, who received $10 million from the Venezuelan government in 2008 for a film on a Haitian Revolutionary hero that still hasn't been made.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Alba locked lips with Danny Ramirez during a Mexico getaway as their romance continues to heat up. Alba wore a ball cap and tank top while leaning in to shirtless Ramirez, who rocked a pair of black swim trunks for the outing. The couple was also seen sunbathing during their romantic getaway, with Alba modeling a skin-baring thong bikini while sunning her back as Ramirez looked on. At the time, she also shared pics with her kids Honor, 17, Haven, 14, and Hayes Warren, 8, and included several inspirational quotes.

Though the pair was spotted kissing during a casual date in London in May, Ramirez wasn't publicly identified until they jetted to Cancún last summer. They've since been spotted on PDA-packed date nights in both Los Angeles and New York. In September, she and Ramirez attended the US Open with her dad, and they made their red carpet debut a month later on a group outing at the Mill Valley Film Festival in October. The “Dark Angel” alum and estranged husband Cash Warren announced their split in January, with Alba filing to end their nearly 17-year marriage the following month citing “irreconcilable differences.” The movie producer, 46, has since been seen stepping out with model Hana Sun Doerr, 25, and Seanna Pereira, 20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hailee Steinfeld teased her baby's name while showing off her pregnancy in a sweet new baby bump photo. In her 2025 roundup, the mom-to-be, 29, also shared an image of a baby onesie embroidered with “Baby Beau” and photos from her romantic May wedding to Josh Allen. “This past year — this holiday season included — has brought milestones, growth, and moments that have reshaped me in ways I'm still processing,” the “Sinners” actress wrote. “Not all of them were loud or public, but they felt meaningful. Steinfeld added that she's “become more intentional about choosing what actually feels right” in the past year and revealed that she's been “asking questions that don't necessarily require answers or actions right away, but invite clarity over time.” The actress and Buffalo Bills quarterback revealed they're expecting their first child together in a newsletter entry last month. The “Hawkeye” actress made the revelation while sharing a list of “29 moments I love this year” to mark her 29th birthday on Dec. 11 — featuring a video of Allen kissing her baby baby bump. Allen kissed her bump and the couple cuddled before turning their attention to a miniature snowman, indicating their impending arrival.

Steinfeld first sparked pregnancy rumors after appearing at the Governors Awards red carpet on Nov. 16, where she wore a pleated gray Stéphane Rolland frock that appeared to strategically obscure her stomach and midsection. One social media user commented at the time, “not to be that person but is she pregnant because this is giving hidden pregnancy dress.”</p>
