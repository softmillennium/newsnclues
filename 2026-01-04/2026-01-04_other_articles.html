                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several lawmakers are condemning President Trump after he shared a video on social media Saturday alleging Gov. Tim Walz is behind the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman. "In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this," Walz said. Hortman was shot and killed alongside her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert, on June 14, 2025, inside the family's Brooklyn Park home. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot and wounded in their Champlin home 90 minutes earlier. Vance Boelter, 58, faces federal charges for the shootings, including two counts of murder. He allegedly dressed as a police officer and managed to evade arrest for 40 hours. According to prosecutors, Boelter had a hit list of lawmakers and other public officials, including staffers at Planned Parenthood. In a statement, House DFL Leader Zack Stephenson called out Mr. Trump, calling the claims about Hortman's death "untruthful" and "outrageous." "Tonight, Donald Trump, who couldn't be bothered to lower the flags to half staff or even say Melissa Hortman's name until now, is spreading outrageous lies about her death," Stephenson said. "Here is the truth: Melissa was murdered by a right-wing, anti-abortion extremist who believed conspiracy theories about COVID. Stephenson went on to say that any political leader in the state who does not condemn the president's post "isn't fit to hold office." "We must all reject this behavior outright and refuse to tolerate it. The American people, grieving families, and the legacies of those lost deserve far better," Coleman said. But do not speculate, guess, or spread stories that are plainly false and deeply harmful. Several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Angie Craig and Betty McCollum, specifically called for Republican legislators to condemn Mr. Trump's post.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among overseas Chinese communities, particularly those shaped by exile, censorship fatigue, and distrust of state narratives, Yu's name has become a focal point for deeper anxieties. Discussions surrounding his death are increasingly framed through speculation, spiritual interpretation, and claims that situate the case within structural pathologies of China's celebrity system rather than an isolated tragedy. These accounts do not originate from court records or official press briefings. They emerge from informal, transnational information channels—divination blogs, livestreamed psychic sessions, encrypted chats, and audiences seeking coherence where public disclosure has ceased. Two figures recur with notable frequency in these discussions.One is Li Jingwei, a Taiwanese blogger who practices Nadi astrology. Though operating in vastly different cultural and epistemological registers, both advance a shared premise: that the truth surrounding Yu Menglong's death is unlikely to surface through China's formal institutions. On the 100th day after Yu's death, Li Jingwei conducted a second reading using Nadi astrology. Nadi astrology, a South Asian divination tradition rooted in palm-leaf manuscripts, is believed by its adherents to preserve individual life records across centuries.. Li has described it not as fortune-telling, but as an archival system of fate—an inherited ledger of human trajectories rather than a predictive exercise. Crucially, Li argues that the image does not implicate a single individual. Instead, it reflects a structure.In her reading, the symbolism points to a system that presents itself as orderly and benign, while operating through diffuse pressure, asymmetric dependence, and quiet enforcement beneath the surface. She links this imagery to the astrological constellation Ashlesha, traditionally associated with power exercised through contracts, obligation, and psychological leverage rather than overt violence. Within this framework, Yu's death is described as the outcome of distributed complicity rather than a singular, decisive act.. When the situation became irreversible, accountability was nowhere to be found. Li has said that the reading suggested any evidence accessible to official institutions was eliminated at an early stage. On this basis, she concludes that no formal investigation will ever yield a public accounting—an assessment that resonates with long-standing skepticism toward internal review mechanisms in politically sensitive cases. The readings consistently return to a window between March and June of 2026. She does not frame this period as one of official revelation, but rather as a moment when dispersed fragments may begin to cohere into a recognizable pattern. These included references to drugs, poisoning, organs, population trafficking, and underground transactions. Li is careful to stress that these should not be read as verified claims. She presents them instead as symbolic indicators pointing toward a broader, transnational network of illicit exchange—one that may intersect with, but is not reducible to, Yu's death alone. She has also warned that Yu may not be the only person affected. Parallel narratives have emerged from Kandis Starr, an American psychic medium who conducts livestreamed sessions using a spirit box device. While such practices sit well outside the evidentiary standards of journalism or law, they nonetheless command large audiences within online subcultures shaped by mistrust of official information. Starr also claimed that Yu was aware of videos depicting his alleged mistreatment. According to her account, the device suggested that some individuals involved in distributing those videos were not directly responsible for his death. When viewers referenced alleged dark-web footage, Starr reported prolonged affirmative signals, a moment that rapidly circulated in clipped form across social media. When asked whether Yu's phone had been fitted with tracking or monitoring software, Starr said the device responded immediately and continued to signal. She interpreted the sustained response as indicative of prolonged distress rather than an isolated incident. During the same session, Starr addressed questions submitted by viewers about actress Dilraba Dilmurat. When asked whether Dilraba was in danger, Starr reported an affirmative response from the device. A follow-up question raised the possibility of connections between Dilraba and individuals described by viewers as part of a Chinese elite or so-called royal lineage. She cautiously suggested that these might indicate familial, social, or institutional proximity rather than direct involvement. No evidence was presented to support these claims, and they remain unverified. Beneath these narratives lies a long-standing pattern within China's entertainment sector. Over the past two decades, multiple high-profile figures have vanished from public life due to sudden illness, psychological collapse, legal accusations, or unexplained absence. Official explanations, when offered, are often cursory and internally inconsistent. This uncertainty has fueled demand for fortune-tellers, ritual specialists, and self-styled spiritual masters. The late Wang Lin—once patronized by celebrities and political elites alike—is frequently cited as a cautionary example. In the absence of transparent institutions, unofficial narratives continue to proliferate, shaped by grief, distrust, and the widespread conviction that prolonged silence is itself a form of communication. It has simply migrated beyond the places where answers are typically expected to emerge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since the road ran out nearly six years ago, Supernatural fans have had one major way to reconnect with the beloved series — reruns. For quite some time, Netflix was the home to all 15 seasons of the Eric Kripke-created fantasy drama, but that all came to a screeching halt at the beginning of December. In the weeks since, Peacock has been enjoying an added boost of viewership thanks to the fan-favorite characters played by Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. And, although the streamer is home to plenty of original content for subscribers to fully dig their claws into, the spooky mystery show of yesteryear is claiming viewership numbers left and right, currently holding the number two spot on Peacock's Top 10. We won't spoil it for you here, but they essentially did everything in their power to give audiences an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Hoping to satiate the dedicated following's cries, Ackles, along with wife Danneel Ackles and Robbie Thompson, struck out to deliver a prequel series, titled The Winchesters. Although the series ran for just one season, it was a fun way to explore the lore of the Supernatural multiverse and bring characters like Dean, Loki (Richard Speight Jr.), Rowena (Ruth Connell), Bobby (Jim Beaver), and Jack (Alexander Calvert) back into the fold. Most recently, Supernatural has jumped from screen to page in a brand-new lineup of graphic novels from Dynamite Entertainment. Get your wheels turning and burn some rubber with the Winchester brothers and their beloved Impala over at Peacock where all 15 seasons of Supernatural are now streaming. Two brothers follow their father's footsteps as hunters, fighting evil supernatural beings of many kinds, including monsters, demons, and gods that roam the earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Military intelligence pondered whether UAP technology "should be acquired" and they may have alluded to black triangle UFO sightings on the continent, historic documents suggest. The Defence Intelligence Staff (the former name of Defence Intelligence, an organisation in the Ministry of Defence) was tasked with investigating "unidentified aerial phenomena" or UAP, an acronym that has also gained traction in modern times. Indeed, in a memo (dated March 4, 1997), the author spoke of "strange objects in the sky" and acknowledged that there "may be a basis in fact" before suggesting they could even pose a risk to national security. As reported by The Sunday Times, it reads: "Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact. "It could be argued that UAPs pose a potential threat to the defence of the realm since we have no idea what they are!" UAPs do not appear to use conventional reaction propulsion. "The Belgian deltas (confirmed by the country's MoD) hovered for long periods and accelerated quickly to supersonic speeds, outrunning F-16s. If this represents real technology perhaps it should be acquired." It refers, of course, to the famous British case involving personnel from the US Air Force, situated at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk. It also detailed how they could reportedly hover and travel at "considerable" speeds and referred to a French "interest" in the subject, an American "intelligence grouping" and a so-called "Moscow report". In terms of the latter, it was also implied that two scientists were "responsible" for these types of craft. In a further revealing letter, it divulged that the technology, if it was indeed real, would represent an innovation that they weren't in possession of.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The British military thought there was ‘basis in fact' to UFO sightings and wanted to get their hands on the ‘extraterrestrial' technology, previously secret files show. The documents – now in the National Archives in Kew – also reveal how Britain's most well-known UFO sighting at Rendlesham Forest was ‘confirmed' by US military personnel. One internal correspondence from March 4, 1997 reads: ‘Logic would indicate that if significant numbers are reporting seeing strange objects in the sky then there may be a basis in fact. ‘It could be argued that UAPs pose a potential threat to the defence of the realm since we have no idea what they are!' Intelligence officers appeared particularly concerned about the reports of large, silent, low-flying black triangles which came out of Belgium in their thousands between November 1989 and April 1990. ‘If this represents real technology perhaps it should be acquired.' The correspondence added that ‘some reports described objects in terms of manoeuvre, speed and shape which lie beyond our engineering knowledge and that which could be reasonably expected from hostile powers.' Dating back to December 1980, members of the US Air Force stationed at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, reported seeing unexplained lights and a craft in the forest. Witnesses, including high-ranking officers, described seeing a glowing, metallic, triangular object hovering and emitting strange beams of light. It adds: ‘In both [Rendlesham Forest and Belgian] cases the UAP apparently did not use any conventional propulsion system and could hover as well as move at considerable speed. ‘The French have always had an interest in this topic … and I am aware that there is an informal intelligence grouping in the US.' The sighting has fuelled decades of speculation and conspiracy theories ranging from alien encounters to secret military tests. One UFO expert, Philip Mantle, told Metro he is convinced something happened over those fateful nights in 1980 – but doesn't necessarily think aliens were involved. The former Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association speculated that soldiers could have come into contact with ‘strange plasma' that caused ‘electromagnetic effects'. The previously secret file also claimed to have a ‘Moscow report' that suggested ‘two military scientists are responsible for UFOs'.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research published in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology identifies specific psychological traits associated with a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. The findings suggest that individuals who perceive the world as fundamentally unjust and those who struggle with uncertain or ambiguous situations are more likely to endorse conspiratorial narratives. Psychological research into conspiracy theories has expanded significantly in recent years. While many studies focus on specific beliefs, such as those regarding climate change or public health events, fewer have examined the broader mindset that makes someone prone to these ideas. “I have long been interested in conspiracy theories, having published around 20 papers on the topic over the past decade or so. Few, if any, researchers have taken into account the ‘cover up' perspective of conspiracy believers,” study author Adrian Furnham, a professor at the Norwegian Business School. “I have also long been interested in both beliefs about justice (Just World Theory) and more recently Tolerance of Ambiguity, which I believe is neglected in the Big Five framework. They also investigated how beliefs about justice in the world interact with these personality traits. To measure conspiracy mentality, the researchers used a ten-item scale. This scale included statements about secret organizations influencing political decisions and government agencies monitoring citizens. It also included items specifically designed to assess the belief that official narratives are deliberate cover-ups. One such item asked participants if they believed politicians usually hide the true motives for their decisions. Participants also completed assessments regarding their demographic information, political views, and religious beliefs. Additionally, they completed a personality assessment known as the High Potential Trait Indicator. This tool measured six specific traits, including Adjustment, Competitiveness, Risk Approach, and Tolerance of Ambiguity. However, these demographic effects were relatively small compared to other variables. Political and religious factors played a more substantial role. Participants who identified as more religiously observant tended to have higher scores on the conspiracy mentality measure. Similarly, those who identified as politically conservative were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories than those who identified as liberal. These findings align with previous research linking certain ideological frameworks to conspiratorial thinking. Those who felt that the world is fundamentally unfair were more inclined to believe that powerful groups are secretly manipulating events. Tolerance of Ambiguity emerged as another primary factor. Participants with lower scores in this trait, meaning they feel uncomfortable with uncertainty or vagueness, were more likely to endorse conspiracy theories. The data indicates that for these individuals, conspiracy narratives might provide a sense of certainty and closure that is otherwise missing. “Important determinants of those who believe in many/all conspiracy theories is the extent to which they see Justice in the World as well as their personal discomfort with various forms of ambiguity,” Furnham told PsyPost. The study also produced results that ran contrary to common assumptions. The researchers found that a participant's level of education was not related to their likelihood of believing in conspiracy theories. Holding a university degree did not appear to buffer individuals against these beliefs. Additionally, the personality trait of Curiosity, often associated with openness to new ideas, did not show a significant relationship with conspiracy beliefs. These findings provide evidence that conspiracy theories may serve a psychological function for certain individuals. When people face uncertainty or feel a lack of control, they may experience anxiety. This helps reduce the discomfort associated with ambiguity by replacing chaos with a structured narrative of cause and effect. Conspiracy theories may validate these feelings by attributing misfortune to the actions of malevolent actors rather than random chance. Individuals with a low tolerance for ambiguity often exhibit specific cognitive patterns. This is sometimes described as a black-and-white view of the world. Conspiracy theories often present a clear distinction between “good” victims and “evil” perpetrators, which appeals to this cognitive style. The researchers note that this intolerance of ambiguity is not just a preference but a personality trait that influences how people process threats. Previous studies have shown that people who are uncomfortable with uncertainty may react more strongly to perceived threats. As with all research, there are some limitations to note. This specific demographic group may not fully represent the general population. Future research could benefit from larger, more diverse samples to verify these associations. Understanding the social dynamics of these beliefs remains a priority for future investigation. Smart, educated people are also susceptible to these narratives if they have specific personality traits. This challenges the stereotype that conspiracy theorists are simply uninformed. It points instead to deep-seated psychological needs for structure and justice. The study, “Conspiracy Theory Mentality, Injustice and Tolerance of Ambiguity,” was authored by Adrian Furnham, Stephen Cuppello, and David S. Semmelink.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wyatt posing with multiple pieces of paranormal-seeking devices that he uses to investigate strange activities. Philip Wyatt, a Buckhead, Atlanta hairdresser by trade, also has a side interest that is more unusual than, say, knitting or pickleball: He seeks spirit activity as the head of Georgia Paranormal Investigations in the United States. The volunteer group solicits clients via social media and website, though Wyatt isn't even sure calling them “clients” is proper since the group doesn't charge anything for its services. While he said he's a medium who can talk to spirits, that isn't a requirement for the other eight team members who help him with investigations. “Everyone on our team really, at some point in their lives, had paranormal experience that was a catalyst to getting into the paranormal investigation world,” he said. Tiffany Frazier, an Atlanta author of paranormal romances who once saw an unexplained shadowy figure as a child, said she sought out local groups online to help make her books more accurate. “I needed to understand how the equipment worked and do the field justice,” she said. One ghost hunting group she hung out with at a cemetery was “super rude” and seemed to be trying to “provoke” the spirits, she said. “They were respectful” to the ghosts, she said. “Philip has a knack for remaining grounded, and that's critical when investigating,” Frazier said. “People are more open-minded now than older generations,” Wyatt said. Sometimes people don't want their neighbours to know what's happening, so they request GPI arrive without identifying T-shirts. “We'll pull into their garages and shut the door before unloading equipment,” he said. And he doesn't love the way many shows portray ghosts as evil. To him, that isn't the case. 1 goal is to educate the public,” Frazier said. We're not there to make a scene.” Wyatt said the “scientific community does not consider paranormal investigation a science. Scientifically, you can't prove the human consciousness exists after bodily death. So what we're doing is based on hypotheses and theories”. “I saw this figure of a woman standing next to my bed,” he said. My mum came in and got frustrated. After that, whenever he saw a figure who wasn't supposed to be there, “I kind of ignored it. And we didn't have the Internet back then. Our tiny library didn't have books on the subject.” He grew up, moved to Atlanta and opened The Philip Wyatt Salon in Buckhead about a quarter century ago. Wyatt eventually began reading about paranormal activity. I'm interested in the science aspect of it.” His group, which he began four years ago, doesn't just take any client. They hold Zoom calls and seek more details. They have them fill out a questionnaire. Wyatt hasbeen investigating paranormal events for 15 years, a pursuit that began after personal experiences sparked his interest. People who seek GPI out often “just want to know that whatever is going on in their house, they're not imagining it”, Wyatt said. Wyatt uses different equipment to pick up abnormalities that may indicate paranormal activity. He measures unusual shifts in radiation, temperature and sound. They also set up cameras and record sound in hopes of catching video and, more commonly, voices. “We try to pick up a sound we can't hear with our own ears below human hearing range,” Wyatt said. When they arrive on a site, they tell suspected ghosts specifically that “we are here to communicate with them, not to harm them”. Their goal is to ensure the ghosts and the homeowners have an understanding and don't bother each other. Patricia Hill, who owns Kennesaw salon Patricia Hill Color Studio in a 137-year-old home, said for years, she would pick up overnight loud, unexplained bangs on security cameras. Wyatt holds a Paranormal Detector Instrument, while in the centre is a Nuclear Radiation Detector Instrument. In 2018, a piece of paper inexplicably flew off a shelf that was caught on video. Hill's research uncovered that the building was built in the 1880s by a family who owned indentured servants. She found GPI on Facebook, and Wyatt checked her salon out in 2023. Wyatt's team found so many voices the first time, they came back again for more information. Based on Wyatt's findings, Hill thought one of the servants may have been hanged on an old tree that still exists on the property. She put a cross there to honour the person who may have died. “I kid you not, it's like a weight lifted,” Hill said after GPI came to her salon. It doesn't have any mean energy. I want the spirits to be free. “I've been freaked out a few times,” he said. “It's more exhilarating after you come off the initial shock. This isn't for the faint of heart. We would love to keep you posted on the latest promotion.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural ended in 2020, but the CW series has a lasting legacy — so much so that there's still talk of whether Season 16 could ever happen. Supernatural Season 15's ending would be difficult to come back from, but if any series can accomplish it, it's this one. While nothing is set in stone, Jensen Ackles told Collider that he's currently booked and busy, but “if it happens, then let's go.” Meanwhile, Jared Padalecki told the outlet that his “single answer is yes,” but it has to be the right time for it (via Collider). Their remarks don't mean a revival or additional outing will happen any time soon, or even at all. However, such comments make it clear that a return is on the table. When identifying Supernatural‘s best installment, fans are usually divided between Season 5's “Swan Song” and Season 6's “The French Mistake.” The latter certainly captures what made the CW series so successful; its self-aware humor, willingness to challenge the status quo, and performances all elevate it to greatness. However, when it comes to the series' top-rated chapters on IMDb, Supernatural Season 5's finale comes in just above it. “Swan Song” brings five seasons' worth of storytelling together in a way that feels right, and it's one of the most devastating episodes of Supernatural to grace the screen. It also pays homage to the story and characters well, giving them emotional send-offs while working the series' signature humor in throughout. And that might have been better for the show in the long run, as much as it hurts to admit it. While “Swan Song” was a strong way to wrap up Sam and Dean's story, Supernatural‘s actual series finale is far less satisfying, and thus, more divisive. The biggest complaints about Season 15's “Carry On” have to do with the fate of Dean Winchester, who gets a pretty bleak conclusion after all is said and done. It's underwhelming after all the time put into his growth. His original ending — which saw him accepting that more was possible for him than dying on a hunt — did a better job of showing how he'd changed. As such, it was more pleasantly surprising. By contrast, “Swan Song” feels more grounded in everything Supernatural was. And looking back, it does seem as though the CW show missed an opportunity to end on an upswing — even if there were some incredible moments and episodes that happened because it continued. With that in mind, Supernatural Season 16 could deliver an even worse, third ending. Perhaps the series should learn from its “Swan Song” mistake instead and leave well enough alone. We may miss the Winchesters, but it's not worth further tarnishing their legacy to bring them back. Get access to exclusive stories on new releases, movies, shows, comics, anime, games and more!
