                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>StableChain, which is a new layer-one blockchain network built around Tether's USDT stablecoin by a company known as Stable, went live with its mainnet today, alongside the launch of its native STABLE token. Backed by crypto exchange Bitfinex, PayPal, and many others, Stable aims to focus on the key area of crypto that has gained the most demand and interest from end users, namely stablecoins (in this case, USDT specifically). The future of stablecoin payments begins now. The combined market cap of USDC and USDT alone now exceeds $250 billion, and the success of these tokens underscores a broader trend in crypto where asset issuers and fintechs build increasingly proprietary and centralized infrastructure and reject more decentralized base-layer protocols that have less relevance when so much centralization is found at other layers of the crypto technology stack anyway. The idea with Stable is to embrace this reality of stablecoin dominance in crypto by building a blockchain that is purpose-built for these centrally issued, dollar-pegged tokens from the ground up. Similarly, Circle rolled out its Arc blockchain for USDC earlier this year as a dedicated layer-one crypto network for stablecoin apps, using USDC for gas to bypass native crypto networks like Ethereum and Solana. Sony recently joined this wave too, along with countless other financial institutions and tech giants, with plans for a dollar-backed stablecoin for digital content payments. Heavy reliance on these issuer-controlled stablecoins has stripped much of crypto's decentralization down to not much more than branding or marketing. For example, U.S. Bank recently highlighted the appeal of the Stellar network's asset clawback features for its own stablecoin pilot project. These are the exact sort of third-party controls Bitcoin was originally intended to route around. Indeed, what started as a push for an ostensibly borderless, intermediary-free finance now bolsters U.S. dollar hegemony through pegged tokens while fintech giants erect walled gardens to increase their profits and user activity metrics. This path clearly diverges sharply from Bitcoin's roots. In Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 whitepaper and other early writings, the vision centered on a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminated trusted third parties: no inflation at will, no transaction blocks, no asset grabs. Launches like Stable, Arc, and Coinbase's Base blockchain reveal how the industry has pivoted toward efficiency over sovereignty to the point where the line between crypto and fintech is becoming increasingly blurred. Due to the longstanding reliance alternative crypto networks like Ethereum have had on stablecoins and other key points of centralization, it's unclear what their value propositions will be if the likes of Tether, Circle, Coinbase, and other major, centralized players in the crypto space can push users over to their own proprietary platforms. That said, there are some who are sounding the alarm regarding this crisis of purpose in crypto, as indicated by the controversy regarding an Ethereum Foundation researcher's exit for fintech giant Stripe's stablecoin play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading around $90,500 as U.S. stocks closed, bitcoin was lower by about 1% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum's ether ETH$3,147.71 slipped slightly lower, but outperformed a bit and climbed to its strongest relative price against BTC in more than a month. Other notable outperformers were privacy-focused Zcash ZEC$414.59 and institutional-centered blockchain Canton Network (CC), both booking double-digit gains. While the crypto action was muted, long duration government bond yields spiked amid fears of trouble in Japanese bonds spilling over to the other markets. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield surged to 4.19%, its highest level in about three months, while U.K. and other European countries' government debt also sold off. Meanwhile, the Japanese 10-year bond yield kept climbing towards 2%, a level not seen in almost two decades. This week's key event will be the year's last Federal Reserve meeting. While a 25 basis-point cut is fully baked into expectations, messaging about further trajectory or other liquidity measures could stir up volatility on Wednesday. "Any easing in financial conditions or further weakening in the US dollar could provide tailwinds, while any hawkish surprise around the pace or extent of policy accommodation from the Federal Reserve could amplify downside pressure on crypto markets," LMAX market strategist Joel Kruger said in a note. While the S&P 500 is trading near record highs, BTC is stuck rangebound, highlighting a deepening divergence between crypto and traditional risk assets that points to relative weakness, they pointed out in a Monday report. All those factors add up to a fragile setup into the year-end, Bitfinex analysts argued. Disclosure & Polices: CoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin price today: gains to $90.8k as Fed cut bets remain firm Make sure you own this 'structural winner', BofA says S&P 500: Bull flag to new highs? Up 20%+ in a single week: Wall Street's most overlooked semiconductor breakout Intercontinental Exchange just valued Polymarket at $9 billion. Let that sink in for a second. A prediction market platform that didn't even exist in mainstream consciousness three years ago is now worth more than some Fortune 500 companies. This isn't just another crypto company getting a big valuation. Polymarket's success reveals something crucial: some financial markets literally cannot exist without blockchain. Partnerships stretching from Wall Street to the UFC. It's about infrastructure that enables entirely new kinds of markets. Prediction markets always had one massive problem. You and I want to bet on Wednesday's Fed decision. Someone needs to hold our cash. Then they need to figure out who was right. At every step, we're trusting them not to mess it up or disappear. When the outcome happens, winners get paid automatically. No trust required because the code handles it. Traditional financial systems genuinely cannot replicate this. Blockchain doesn't just improve this process - it fundamentally changes what's possible. You're betting on Fed policy, not worrying whether your stake just lost 15% because crypto crashed overnight. But you still get instant settlement, zero geographic restrictions, and fees measured in cents not dollars. No bank account verification taking three weeks. No "sorry, we don't operate in your country." Literally pennies compared to $25-50 for traditional international transfers that take days. A huge portion of Polymarket's volume comes from crypto prediction markets themselves. Will the SEC approve spot ETH ETFs? They're not casual bettors - they're sophisticated crypto investors hedging real positions and making serious size bets. That money doesn't stay isolated. Economic prediction markets become more efficient. All because crypto traders showed up first and brought capital with them. After Polymarket spent $112 million acquiring CFTC-licensed infrastructure, they processed about $6 billion just in H1 2025. Crypto markets drove a meaningful chunk of that volume. Polymarket isn't just using crypto infrastructure anymore. It's starting to move crypto markets. When Polymarket odds shift dramatically on something like Bitcoin ETF approval, crypto prices move before any official news drops. The platform has become this real-time probability engine that institutional traders actually watch now. They're not just buying prediction market technology. They're acquiring access to market sentiment data that traditional finance doesn't have. Wall Street is buying blockchain-generated market intelligence to make traditional investment decisions. X integrated Polymarket directly into its platform. Regulators are learning to distinguish between "speculative crypto stuff" and "blockchain infrastructure serving legitimate purposes." You simply cannot build these markets on traditional infrastructure. Polymarket's $9 billion valuation isn't really about what they've done. It's about what Wall Street now believes is possible. Traditional finance is recognizing that blockchain enables entirely new market categories. Not improved versions of existing markets - genuinely new things that couldn't exist before. We're watching fundamental infrastructure questions get answered in real time. How should modern financial markets actually work? What does "global access" really mean? Who needs to be trusted and why? Polymarket proved you can build serious financial infrastructure on blockchain that works better than traditional alternatives. Now that institutional players see it working at scale, the relationship between prediction markets and crypto infrastructure will only deepen. The question isn't whether blockchain matters for financial markets anymore. The question is which markets get rebuilt on blockchain infrastructure next.</p>

Ondo Finance, a tokenized Treasury protocol, today joined the Blockchain Association to help advance pro-innovation digital asset policies in the US.

The move comes after Ondo concluded an SEC investigation, clearing the path for its expansion in tokenized asset operations. The platform tokenizes real-world assets to bring institutional-grade finance onchain while maintaining regulatory compliance through alignment with SEC practices.

The Blockchain Association advocates for the US digital asset industry through partnerships and regulatory submissions. The organization recently provided recommendations to the CFTC for clarifying perpetual derivative contracts and developing innovation-friendly pilots for tokenized collateral.

These recommendations emphasize including non-custodial infrastructure and stablecoins in CFTC pilots for tokenized collateral to enhance settlement efficiency, aligning with Ondo's focus on tokenized asset operations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This kind of volatility leaves many investors puzzled, wondering what they should do. Most specifically, many ask themselves what the best altcoins are to buy in a situation like this. As it turns out, the best answer to this question is given by DeepSnitch AI, in two different (though related) senses. First, because DeepSnitch AI is an AI-powered business intelligence tool that helps you answer investment questions, including “what are the best altcoins to buy now?” Second, because DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy now. On December 4, the giant crypto exchange Kraken announced a new special VIP service, targeted to its Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) clients. The program will provide high-touch services to wealthy individuals, family offices and private clients, including trading insights, but also “extraordinary experiences” such as Formula 1, cultural events and intimate meet-ups. If you are asking yourself, “What does this have to do with me at all, I'm not a UHNW person?”, the answer is that it actually has a lot to do (if you're not asking yourself that… congratulations!). The reason is that these programs attract new capital in big numbers, and that benefits your portfolio, even if you are not a UHNW person. As 2026 comes in, and big investors pour in more money, it is a good time to think of a few breakout altcoin picks that, who knows, might one day give you a Kraken VIP membership. DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy now because it has greater growth potential than virtually any other crypto, whether already in the market or in presale. This is due to its combination of an impressive AI-powered tool with real-life utility and a massive target market. The system is composed of five AI agents (3 of which are already alive and thinking) that transform crypto data into business intelligence. Those hundreds of millions of crypto holders that can't afford to have a 24/7 Kraken VIP advisor will nonetheless have an AI tool that will guide them every day. That DeepSnitch AI is the next likely crypto eruption is being increasingly realised by many, as its presale numbers show. In just the second stage, more than $675k has been raised. The entry price is still only $0.02629, and on top of that, you get a 50% or 100% if you buy at least $2,000 or $5,000, respectively. SUI was launched one year ago, trading at $4.22. By January 4, it had reached an all-time high of $5.35, but then started to descend throughout the year (with ups and downs), and is now trading at about $1.61. This downtrend, however, is due to a certain extent to the general trend in the crypto market as a whole. And there are signs of some rotation from big Layer-1 coins like ETH and SOL to mid-tier ones, which should push prices up. This can be seen by comparing the price of FLX with its market cap, since the coin entered exchanges almost 3 years ago. The best altcoins to buy today are those that can thrive next year based on utility and adoption. DeepSnitch AI is the best example of that. That places Flair among the best altcoins to buy. Its unparalleled combination of an incredibly useful tool with a massive adoption potential. This article is not intended as financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since joining Crypto Valley VC (CV VC), a Swiss-based venture capital firm that backs blockchain-based startups, as Head of Investment for Africa in November 2024, Jarryd Kennedy has been at the centre of the firm's push to spot businesses using blockchain technology to solve everyday problems across fintech, payments, and data infrastructure on the continent. His experience gives him a dealmaker's discipline and a technology-first lens, helping him identify use cases where blockchain reduces friction, improves trust and builds real economic infrastructure rather than hype. In 2022, CV VC launched a $20 million Africa Blockchain Fund, which has invested in 13 early-stage Web3 startups across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Egypt, and Ghana, including Nigerian podcast-hosting platform Jamit, South African crypto investment startup Altify, Kenyan Web3 agritech Shamba Records, and South African neobank Kasi. The firm's investment strategy writes direct cheques and backs early-stage startups from its accelerator. Through CV Labs, CV VC selects 7–9 startups to participate in a cohort each year, providing them with mentorship and growth strategy consultations. It also writes $500,000 follow-on cheques for its portfolio startups. I spoke with Kennedy for this week's Ask an Investor to understand his career, what it takes to lead CV VC's African team, and global investor appetite for African blockchain products. What brought you into Web3 venture capital, and which past roles mattered most? My entry into the Web3 venture capital ecosystem has been shaped by a decade of experience across investment banking, M&A, and private equity, with roles spanning London, New York, and South Africa. The bulk of my career has been at Deutsche Bank, gaining exposure to Telco, Media and Technology (TMT) across capital markets and M&A. That experience was pivotal because it gave me a deep appreciation for how technology can drive inclusion and development in emerging markets. Importantly, throughout my career, there has been an enduring focus on technology: I have always viewed it as a tool to revolutionise monolithic, legacy systems, enabling the creation of more efficient outcomes. That is what ultimately drew me to Web3: I saw blockchain as an evolution in the global technology stack that could enable new structures for decentralised ownership, efficient value exchange, transparent governance, and the removal of intermediaries, thereby lowering barriers to entry and creating entirely new economic models. At CV VC, I lead our venture investments across Africa, applying that same technology-oriented lens to early-stage startups that are building transformative real-world solutions by utilising blockchain technology. What does being CV VC's Head of Investment for Africa mean from an operational lens? At CV VC, no two days are the same. On a typical day, I split my time across three areas: pipeline, portfolio, and investors. Thereafter, we evaluate investment pitches and assess new opportunities through a data-driven lens to benchmark their performance. On the portfolio side, I work closely with founders across our African investment portfolio, with a mix of relationship-building, hands-on support, and facilitating connections to other ecosystem participants. Finally, on the investor front, we are consistently engaged with investors to report on progress with the goal of leveraging investor expertise to bolster that progress, creating a flywheel of value creation across the ecosystem. Across all three areas, staying sharp on market trends and emerging utility is important. This encompasses diving into data, strategic analysis, or contributing to knowledge-building efforts, which helps shape global understanding of blockchain's real-world impact on the continent. Why is there a gap between usage and investor appetite? Investors are not necessarily focused on crypto itself, but on the broader capability of blockchain technology to improve upon legacy technology stacks and to create new structures for ownership, value exchange, governance, and the removal of intermediaries. The investment case for blockchain has never been stronger. Blockchain is creating this ubiquity for the exchange of value on the internet, enabling an economic value layer which is democratised and globally accessible. Encouragingly, we see blockchain adoption rates which are reminiscent of early internet adoption, and the blockchain economy has never been stronger. Investor capital remains cautious, not just in Africa, but also across the rest of the world, which is mostly a reflection of heightened global uncertainty driven predominantly by geopolitical factors. CV VC has kept writing cheques into African Web3 teams while others pull back. We're not just investing in trends; we're backing determined founders who are building infrastructure, improving access, and bringing trust to systems that need it most. Despite global funding fluctuations, innovation hasn't stopped; founders are still building, and the use cases for blockchain in multiple sectors are more relevant than ever. How do accelerator programmes like CV Labs and ecosystem grants fit into your Africa strategy? Ultimately, it's about catalysing innovation that can flourish long after the initial investment. In Africa, where markets are often fragmented and infrastructure is still evolving, accelerators play a crucial role in strengthening local capabilities and expanding access to global networks. They allow us to identify promising talent early, provide tailored support, and help founders scale solutions that are contextually relevant and often globally competitive. Besides being highly beneficial for founders and the ecosystem at large, the accelerator is ultimately an additional mechanism used to deploy equity cheques alongside our traditional direct venture strategy. Investors benefit through an extended due diligence exercise and favourable risk-reward profiles given the early entry point. Which African sectors best match CV VC's thesis on trust and decentralisation? Our investment theme revolves around three key areas and applies to startups from any continent: first, applications built directly on blockchains. Second, we prioritise startups using blockchain to drive broader tech and social megatrends. Third, we also strongly consider service providers and infrastructure players that support the broader blockchain ecosystem. Beyond that, we see unique applications across the technology-enabled subset of agriculture, media, climate, property, mobility, healthcare, education, identity, gaming, and HR. Additionally, we see a focus on blockchain infrastructure development, including developer tooling and business-to-business (B2B) applications. Given the global risk-off mood, are investors still cautious about Web3 in Africa? There is still some caution among investors when it comes to Web3 in Africa. This caution can be attributed to investors allocating capital based on a spectrum of risk, where blockchain, as an emerging technology and Africa, as an emerging market, are perceived as higher risk and therefore draw increased caution. Having said this, many investors are intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology and its specific applications for the African continent, and appetite is growing. Investors are watching closely as African founders demonstrate real utility using blockchain to solve core issues like financial inclusion, identity, remittances, and land ownership provenance. We believe that as more success stories emerge from the continent, confidence will follow. Our role at CV VC is to be early in that cycle to back the builders today who will shape the narrative of tomorrow. Regulatory clarity is essential for economic competitiveness in the Web3 space. Well-defined policies attract risk-tolerant venture capital, as we've seen in Africa's leading all-sector VC hubs of Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa. Many African lawmakers are pushing to replace fragmented oversight with clearer frameworks. TechCabal is a future-focused publication that speaks to African innovation and technology in depth</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The MSTR stock is up almost 2% today, rebounding from last week's closing price. Michael Saylor's Strategy, previously MicroStrategy, has made another weekly Bitcoin purchase despite concerns that it may need to sell some of its BTC holdings in a prolonged bear market. In a press release, the company announced that it acquired 10,624 BTC for $962.7 million at an average price of $90,615 per Bitcoin and has achieved a BTC yield of 24.7% year-to-date (YTD). Strategy's SEC filing shows that the company made this latest purchase with net proceeds from the sales of its MSTR and STRD stock. As CoinGape reported, Saylor hinted at the BTC purchase in his conventional X post. Strategy continues to accumulate more BTC despite concerns that it may sell at some point, considering the current market conditions. The company's CEO, Phong Le, had previously stated that they might need to sell to fund dividend payments if the mNAV drops below 1x. However, the company has since set up a $1.44 billion USD reserve, which Phong Le clarified means that they do not need to sell for the next three years. The USD reserve is expected to cover around 21 months of dividend and interest payments, with plans to further increase the reserves over time. Meanwhile, Strategy's announcement of this latest purchase comes amid a rebound in the Bitcoin price. Yahoo Finance data show the stock has climbed above $180 and is trading around $182, up almost 2% from last week's close of $178. In an X post, SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci described Saylor as “the man” for his company's Bitcoin accumulation efforts. He noted that the Strategy founder built a USD backstop and then got back to selling equity to buy BTC, which further strengthens the balance sheet. Scaramucci also mentioned that the equity sales are accretive but very “smart” for his company's balance sheet and the overall Bitcoin market. Strategy's largest purchase this year came in July when it bought 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion. ‘More Orange Dots': Michael Saylor's Strategy Buys 10,624 Bitcoin Amid Sell-Off Concerns originally appeared on CoinGape</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To understand the opportunities and the risks, we roped Brenton Nicker, Business Development Manager for Binance, one of Africa's leading voices in crypto and blockchain innovation. From how crypto fits into a diversified portfolio to why Africa is a rising frontier, Brenton breaks it all down with clarity and authority. Cryptocurrency is no longer a buzzword reserved for tech bros and traders glued to price charts. It has woven its way into mainstream banking, luxury retail, global payments, and how young investors think about wealth. Africa, in particular, is becoming one of the most exciting regions for blockchain adoption with a young population, high mobile penetration, and increasing appetite for digital alternatives in economies marked by volatility. Glamour: What is cryptocurrency in simple terms, and why has it drawn global interest? Brenton Naicker: Cryptocurrency is essentially digital money secured by blockchain technology, meaning every transaction is transparently recorded and nearly impossible to alter. It has captured global interest because it offers a new, decentralised way to store and transfer value without relying on banks while opening the door to high-growth opportunities in an evolving tech ecosystem. Glamour: What has fueled crypto's rise over the past decade? Brenton: It's been a mix of technological innovation and economic shifts. Faster payments, easier cross-border transfers, inflation concerns, and the rise of digital lifestyles have all contributed. Brenton: Treat crypto as a high-growth, high-risk satellite investment rather than the foundation of your portfolio. It works best when balanced with equities, bonds, and real estate, acting as a modern diversifier for long-term strategy. Brenton: Depending on how it's used, crypto can be all three. In that context, crypto can serve as a digital store of value and sometimes a hedge but its speculative price swings mean investors must remain conscious of risk. Glamour: Why is Africa considered the next frontier for blockchain innovation? Brenton: Africa has a young population, high mobile adoption, and underdeveloped financial infrastructure which makes it primed for blockchain-driven solutions. From mobile payments to digital identity systems, the continent is positioned to leapfrog outdated structures and adopt new technology faster than many developed markets. Glamour: How are African governments responding to the crypto economy? Overall, the trend is moving toward clearer guidelines as governments recognise crypto's economic potential. Glamour: What blockchain use cases are emerging beyond trading? Brenton: We're seeing tokenised real estate, digital art authentication, supply chain tracking, decentralised finance (DeFi), and even luxury goods verification. These applications show that blockchain's value extends far beyond speculation and is transforming multiple industries. Glamour: What are the biggest risks in crypto, and how can investors mitigate them? Brenton: Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and project failures are still major risks. Mitigation comes from diversifying across established assets, using reputable platforms, avoiding hype-driven projects, and investing only what you can afford to risk. Glamour: How can investors safeguard their digital assets? Brenton: Start with trusted exchanges, enable two-factor authentication, and store long-term assets in hardware wallets. Avoid public Wi-Fi, use strong passwords, and stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Glamour: How important is regulation for crypto's future? Clear frameworks encourage institutions to participate, which strengthens the entire ecosystem. Glamour: How is crypto influencing the luxury sector? Glamour: Could tokenisation redefine how affluent investors see ownership? Tokenisation allows investors to own fractions of premium assets such as art, real estate, or fine wine without needing massive upfront capital. It democratises access and enables global liquidity, reshaping modern wealth-building. Brenton: Expect deeper institutional adoption, stronger regulation, more stable markets, and mainstream real-world use cases. Crypto will shift from a niche, speculative asset to an integrated part of traditional finance. Glamour: What advice would you give first-time investors entering crypto? Stick to reputable assets and avoid making emotional decisions.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference after Wednesday's decision is expected to be critical for markets. Bank of America said that it expects Powell to hint at “reserve management purchases.” If Powell goes for a rate cut, it would be the third straight cut, despite incomplete economic data due to a government shut down that delayed key reports, including the latest jobs numbers. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has managed to push back over $91,000 after rebounding from lows in the mid-$80,000s.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF gained over 46% per year since inception, but the average dollar made only 11% annually. If you'd made a lump-sum investment in iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF IBIT at the time of its Jan. 5, 2024, inception, you'd be sitting pretty. Of course, investors didn't all pile in on day one and double their money. Rather, they came on their own timetable, investing varying amounts, in the months that followed: All told, investors pumped around $63 billion into the ETF through Nov. 26, 2025. Given that, the question becomes how those investors fared as a group once we account for the timing and magnitude of the purchases and sales they made over that period. To address that, I compiled the ETF's daily assets and net flows from its inception through Nov. 26, 2025. While that's good in absolute terms, it's a fraction of the ETF's 46% total return over that period, the shortfall owing to mistimed purchases and sales. To put that 11.2% annual dollar-weighted return in perspective: Cash earned 4.7% per year over this span; investment-grade US bonds 5.3% annually; US stocks 23.3% a year; and the US 60% stocks/40% bonds portfolio 15.7% per year. The ETF made nearly 60% of its dollar gains (around $4.2 billion) in the first 66 days of its life, during which it gained more than 65%. Its daily net assets averaged around $4.8 billion during this period. It's made around $3 billion in the days since, but that was spread across a much larger asset base ($49.2 billion in average daily net assets), reflecting the ETF's less meteoric return over that span (around 24% cumulatively, or 13.2% per year). To further illustrate how timing affected the return of the average dollar, I also estimated the ETF's dollar-weighted returns from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Jan. 5, 2025, and at one-month intervals thereafter (that is, from inception through Feb. 5, 2025, inception through March 5, 2025, and so forth). You can find those estimated dollar-weighted returns for each period, and the corresponding total return, in the chart below. The gap stayed wide over the forward-extended periods (longest being inception through Nov. 26, 2025), during which total returns moderated while assets kept flooding in. Second is the growth of derivatives and multiple-leg trades, where large institutional investors use the ETF to arbitrage price differences between bitcoin futures and spot bitcoin or use the ETF to hedge options positions as derivatives and structured notes referencing iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF soared. While such trades can appear uneconomic if you view just one leg. (that is, longing the ETF), they can confer profits to these institutions in total, or hedge risks. Third are in-kind transfers, in which large holders of physical bitcoin exchange it for shares of the ETF. The ETF was approved for these transfers in July 2025 and since then has conducted exchanges worth over $3 billion with various large crypto investors. (It's worth noting that the second and third factors wouldn't apply just to this ETF, but any other scenario in which the dollars originated from, or went to, vehicles other than mutual funds and ETFs. In those circumstances, we would have visibility into the fund or ETF's dollar-weighted returns, but not the other vehicle that was the source of, or destination for, asset flows.) The ETF has done its job--it has tracked bitcoin almost perfectly and thus notched excellent total returns since inception. Those investors can't very well be called skittish: The ETF has received positive net flows on 80% of trading days since inception, meaning investors have come and largely stayed put. If not, it will likely continue to lag. It's also a reminder to be wary of narratives. The ETF's launch was heralded as a milestone in the “democratization” of crypto markets, with some arguing the surge of assets from retail investors would push bitcoin's price higher still. While bitcoin has indeed risen in the time since, it saw its biggest gains in the ETF's infancy, before it had amassed a lot of assets. The following table provides the net assets and estimated daily net flow figures incorporated into my estimate of iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF's dollar-weighted return from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Nov. 26, 2025. The estimated daily net flows incorporated into the calculation sum to figures that closely approximate what BlackRock reported in its quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filings from inception through Sept. 30, 2025 (the date of its most recent periodic report), as shown below. Similarly, my estimates for how much investors made (or lost) in dollar terms over time matched what BlackRock reported in aggregate, albeit with some quarter-to-quarter timing differences. All told, I estimated that shareholders had amassed $26.8 billion in net income and gains from its Jan. 5, 2024, inception through Sept. 30, 2025, which nearly matched what BlackRock reported ($26.9 billion).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite Donald Trump's pro-crypto rhetoric, the administration's new strategy document makes no direct mention of crypto, Bitcoin, or blockchain technology.

While these areas are indeed high-priority on the global stage, the narrow focus contrasts sharply with Trump's increasingly vocal promises regarding crypto. But China is getting into it very big right now,” he added. Even though the new security strategy omits any mention of crypto, Trump has continued to advance crypto-friendly policies. These business expansions have coincided with the administration's decisions to scale back or drop several major regulatory actions involving crypto. Following his election, Bitcoin and other global digital assets surged, with reports claiming the Trump family's net worth increased by hundreds of millions of dollars. Trump Media & Technology Group, which recently expanded into crypto, fell 5% on Dec. 2 and is now down roughly 70% since the inauguration. World Liberty Financial's governance token has also declined, sliding roughly 50% since its September launch. Trump has repeatedly cast Bitcoin and digital assets as tools of national power, especially in competition with China. The absence in such a big document leaves room for uncertainty. “Kinda wild seeing crypto completely missing from that list tbh,” wrote one user. “Feels like they're pretending blockchain isn't already woven into half the new tech stack.” Major jurisdictions, including the EU, have already integrated digital-asset policy into their national strategies — many want the U.S. to ensure they are keeping pace. But in the National Security Strategy released today, there isn't a single word about BTC, ETH, or blockchain.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy information commissioner, Emily Keaney, said in a statement on Friday that the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had asked the Home Office for “urgent clarity on this matter so we can assess the situation and consider our next steps.” RFR is used to match images captured from CCTV, mobile phone footage, dashcam/video doorbell footage or social media with those on the Police National Database. An estimated 25,000 searches are run every month to catch potential criminals at large. However, the report found that, “in a limited set of circumstances the algorithm is more likely to incorrectly include some demographic groups in its search results.” “However, it's disappointing that we had not previously been told about this, despite regular engagement with the Home Office and police bodies as part of our wider work to hold government and the public sector to account on how data is being used in their services,” she added. “While we appreciate the valuable role technology can play, public confidence in its use is paramount, and any perception of bias and discrimination can exacerbate mistrust. The Home Office said in its report that it had purchased a new algorithm on the back of the test's findings, adding that it “can be used at settings with no significant demographic variation in performance.” System failures have been known for some time, yet these were not shared with those communities affected, nor with leading sector stakeholders,” it said in a statement. The APCC said that such technologies need to be robustly and independently assessed before being deployed, and feature ongoing oversight during operations, with clear accountability to the public when things go wrong. Policing cannot be left to mark its own homework,” it added.</p>

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. After the NFT boom imploded, you would be forgiven for thinking that tokenised digital artworks no longer exists (see our explainer on What are NFTs? It's just that brands might not be calling them that after the term became bound up with cryptocurrency speculation. Take the recent Marvel Masterpieces Avengers: Asprey Studio Collection. Billed as Marvel's first fine art sculptures, the collection features physical models of 60 Marvel characters in sterling silver, and they're complemented by corresponding digital artwork. Just don't call them NFTs; they're "dynamic digital art". Asprey says each digital work in the Marvel Masterpieces Avengers: Asprey Studio Collection is based on a single panel from early Marvel comic books but reimagined in 3D. Its team sculpted them by hand layer-by-layer using digital clay modelling and then animated them frame by frame. “Each digital artwork is ‘alive',” says Alastair Walker, Chief Creative Officer at Asprey. The average person spends 27 seconds looking at art, so we wanted to have the digital artwork look slightly different each time you see it.” As for the physical sculptures, these were created by master silversmiths at the Asprey Studio Atelier in Kent, through a multi-stage process combining traditional silversmithing with modern techniques, the studio says.Alongside the main collection, Captain America (above), Iron Man, Thor, and Thanos have also been produced as one-off metre-tall sculptures. The pieces are intended to tap into recent interest in comic-derived imagery in fine art, as demonstrated by Jeff Koons's Hulk polychrome bronze sculptures. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. Pieces will be on view at Asprey Studio's gallery in Mayfair, London, until February 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's national security strategy, outlining his administration's priorities, released on Friday, instead said the “core, vital national interests” of the US revolved around artificial intelligence and quantum computing. “We want to ensure that US technology and US standards — particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing — drive the world forward,” the administration said. CIA Deputy Director Michael Ellis also said in May that crypto was “another area of technological competition where we need to make sure the United States is well-positioned against China and other adversaries.” There is, however, one section of the document that states that Trump wants to preserve and grow “America's financial sector dominance” by using the country's “leadership in digital finance and innovation” to ensure market liquidity and security, which could be a hint at crypto. Trump helped the stablecoin-regulating GENIUS Act become law and has signed executive orders creating a crypto task force and banning a central bank digital currency, while also overseeing federal agencies' abandonment of many crypto-related enforcement actions. The administration has also established a Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile, comprising forfeited digital assets, while the government is exploring “budget-neutral” methods of acquiring more. It asked NATO countries to spend 5% of their GDP, up from the current 2%, which would mean heightened government borrowing that would drive up inflation, making it harder for central banks to cut interest rates. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision this week is what is driving crypto markets, with many hoping for a cut that historically spurs investors to make riskier bets. The market is expecting interest rates to drop when the Fed meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, with CME's FedWatch showing nearly 88.5% betting on a 25 basis point cut.
