                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists hunted dark matter and solar neutrinos with one of the largest experiments yet. While the neutrinos likely appeared, dark matter results couldn't be confirmed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A record-breaking investigation, using a particle detector a mile underground in South Dakota, may have revealed new insights about dark matter, the mysterious substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe. "This quest is to try to solve this huge problem, this huge missing piece that we have in terms of understanding our universe," Rick Gaitskell, head of the particle astrophysics group at Brown University and part of the LZ research team, told Live Science. The team suspected that the detection signature of these particles could be similar to that predicted by certain models of dark matter, but needed to spot the solar neutrinos to know for sure. Before the experiment, which took 417 days to perform between March 2023 and April 2025, the detector's sensitivity was upgraded to search for rare interactions with fundamental particles. A cylindrical chamber filled with liquid xenon was the theater for action. Researchers could watch for either WIMPs or neutrinos colliding with the xenon, either of which produces flashes of photons, along with positively charged electrons. This knowledge will help future studies avoid false detections of dark matter. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Physics discoveries typically must reach a confidence level called "5 sigma" to be considered valid. The new work achieved 4.5 sigma — a considerable improvement over sub-3-sigma results reported in two detectors last year. And that was especially notable given that boron-8 detections happen only about once a month in the detector, even when monitoring 10 tons of xenon, Gaitskell said. "If you take a nucleus, it is possible for dark matter to come in and actually simultaneously scatter from the entire nucleus and cause it to recoil," Gaitskell explained. So it's those coherent, nuclear recoils that we're looking for." The team did not detect this signature in their experiment. Another, longer run will begin in 2028, when the detector is expected to collect results for a record-breaking 1,000 days. Longer runs give researchers a better chance of catching rare events. The detector will hunt not only for more solar neutrino or WIMP interactions but also other physics that may fall outside the Standard Model of particle physics said to describe most of the environment around us. Strange gamma-rays spark bold claims, but scientists urge caution —Mysterious glow at the Milky Way's center could reshape a major cosmic theory Gaitskell emphasized that the role of science is to keep pushing forward even when "negative" results arise. "One thing I've learned is, don't ever assume that nature does things in the way that you think it should, exactly," said Gaitskell, who has been studying dark matter for more than four decades. "There are plenty of elegant [solutions] that you would say, 'That's so beautiful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The actor opens up about abandoning logic, embracing instinct, and stepping into the world of unexplained phenomena for his most haunting role yet. The trailer of Bhay: The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery is out, offering a chilling first look at Karan Tacker's latest and most challenging transformation. Known for immersing himself into characters rooted in real-life events — from Khakee: The Bihar Chapter to Special Ops — Tacker now takes on the role of India's first certified paranormal investigator, Gaurav Tiwari. Stepping into Gaurav Tiwari's world meant recreating the life of a figure who cracked several of India's most unnerving paranormal cases — from haunted properties to inexplicable disturbances that even experts struggled to decode. Yet, the most lingering mystery remains Tiwari's own death at 29, a case that continues to spark speculation and unanswered questions. He reportedly spent months studying archived footage, interviews, case reports, and recordings from Tiwari's expeditions — ranging from abandoned hotels to alleged possession sites — to capture the essence of a man driven by both curiosity and compassion. It's mainly because this paranormal genre doesn't allow you to lean on the comfort of logic. So this role made me confront my own ideas of fear, conviction, and vulnerability. I hope the trailer has that effect on people and leaves them intrigued for what's to come.” Directed with an eye for atmospheric tension, the series blends real-life accounts with dramatic interpretation, promising a grounded yet unsettling dive into India's paranormal landscape. Bhay – The Gaurav Tiwari Mystery, inspired by true events, is set to premiere on 12 December on Amazon MX Player, marking one of the platform's most ambitious paranormal originals to date.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trailer opens with intense field investigations, showing unexplained activities, spirits lurking, and a desperate struggle to capture evidence. Gaurav, who started his career as a pilot before a life-changing experience led him to the paranormal world, spent his life chasing things most people considered as fantasy. This is where Kalki Koechlin's character, author and journalist Irene Venkat, takes over. He shared that portraying a real-life figure who genuinely believed in the forces he dealt with, and who met such an unsettling end, was incredibly intense. “Filming his story shook me in ways I didn't expect; he was someone who wanted to be understood and acknowledged," Tacker said. His life was filled with doubt, pressure, and real danger, yet he never stopped chasing the truth.” ​Kalki Koechlin was equally drawn to the emotional depth of her character. Speaking about playing Irene Venkat, she noted that the journey is one of seeing past assumptions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A man claims he was abducted by aliens who harvested his sperm in a series of “mind boggling” encounters. Julius Shields, from Missouri in the US, believes the extraterrestrials' planned to use his sperm to breed hybrid beings, adding that he'd be "curious to see what happens" – hoping his offspring would seek him out at some point in the future. A being “with three tentacles” started tapping on his window, leaving him frozen in shock, he said. Unsettled, he began sleeping in a different room. Soon after, though, he started having disturbing, vivid dreams. He believes the aliens performed sexual experiments on him. He said: “It got more sexual because there was a full week straight where I was having wet dreams every night. Julius believes the extraterrestrials were taking his sperm and using it to breed hybrid human-alien babies. Years later, he started speaking with his uncle who also claimed to have had similar dreams. Julius believes he may now have half-alien children somewhere out there. He went on: “Give it maybe another 10 years or so and then I'm curious to see what happens. British clairvoyant Philip Kinsella famously said he was probed by reptilian aliens in 1989. He was levitating and moving through the rooms of his home, before being strapped naked to a board and probed by the extra-terrestrials, he claimed. Earlier this year, scientists revealed they are incredibly close to discovering the existence of life outside our solar system. They found two specific chemicals in a distant planet's atmosphere that can only be manufactured by actual life. "Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach," said Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy's Professor Nikku Madhusudhan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Israeli space security chief Haim Eshed has reaffirmed his startling claim that US President Donald Trump was aware of a secret 'galactic federation' of extraterrestrials—and reportedly came close to disclosing the truth. In an interview with Hebrew-language daily Yediot Aharonot, Eshed said that governments of the United States and Israel have, for years, maintained contact with alien life. According to him, the two countries signed a 'contract' with a so-called Galactic Federation, granting extraterrestrials permission to conduct experiments on Earth, ndtv.com reported. Eshed claimed the cooperation even extends to an alleged joint base—hidden deep beneath the surface of Mars—where American astronauts and alien representatives supposedly meet. According to Eshed, the aliens cautioned against disclosure, arguing that humanity was not yet ready. A highly decorated former general and respected academic, Eshed ran Israel's national space security programme for nearly 30 years. Eshed's latest statements align with a growing wave of public fascination with UFOs, a renewed scientific interest in unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), and official declassifications of UAP-related documents in several countries. In this context, he said, it gave him confidence to go public. Some analysts argue the story reflects more science fiction than credible evidence. For example, one critique highlights the practical difficulties in concealing a secret base on Mars or in ensuring a former president would remain silent—particularly someone like Trump, who is known for his extensive use of social media, according to IFLScience. Even within Israel's space establishment, voices of caution were raised. According to one senior figure, Eshed's public disclosure may have 'gone too far,' though his previous service and reputation mean he cannot be automatically dismissed as a crank. What appears undisputed is this: in December 2020, the interview published in Yediot Aharonot revived long-standing speculation about extraterrestrial contact. Yet, key elements remain unverified—including any physical evidence of alien contact, details of the supposed Mars base, or documents confirming a pact between the Galactic Federation and national governments. Neither the US government nor Israeli authorities has issued any confirmation or detailed rebuttal. If Eshed's account is valid, the implications would be profound—rewriting man's understanding of humanity's place in the cosmos and of decades-long government secrecy. As societies become more open to considering the possibility of alien life and UAPs, figures like Eshed may gain attention even without hard proof—though they may also find themselves on the fringes of mainstream science.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Boys creator Eric Kripke is fond of bringing back actors from his other hit show, Supernatural. In previous seasons of Prime Video's violent superhero series, we've seen appearances from Supernatural alums Jim Beaver, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and even Jensen Ackles, but Kripke has saved the biggest Supernatural reunion of all for the final season of The Boys by adding Ackles' co-star and fellow Winchester brother, Jared Padalecki, into the mix. Ackles and Padalecki haven't acted alongside each other since Supernatural wrapped in 2020 after 15(!) In the season 5 trailer for The Boys, we get a little tease of Ackles' revived Soldier Boy and Padalecki's secret character, who may play a key role or be killed hilariously within minutes. When we last left Billy Butcher and the gang in season 4, Homelander had been trying to consolidate control and grasp political power with the help of Sister Sage. This plan inevitably worked, and presidential candidate Robert Singer was framed for Victoria Neuman's death. Butcher was the one who took her out after being shot full of supe-enhancing drugs. Martial law was then declared, and everyone started to fall into Homelander's homicidal grasp. The Boys' morale was already dire when Butcher revealed he was dying, but it got worse when they were either scattered or captured under Homelander's new regime. All this sets up a bloody endgame in Season 5, where The Boys feel they have nothing to lose by trying one last time to rid the world of Homelander and Vought once and for all. Here's an official The Boys Season 5 synopsis from Prime Video: “It's Homelander's world, completely subject to his erratic, egomaniacal whims. Hughie, Mother's Milk, and Frenchie are imprisoned in a ‘Freedom Camp.' Annie struggles to mount a resistance against the overwhelming Supe force. But when Butcher reappears, ready and willing to use a virus that will wipe all Supes off the map, he sets in motion a chain of events that will forever change the world and everyone in it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Please report any issues or inconsistencies here. The Pure Heart Collective sits on a busy stretch of Ventura Boulevard, the facade painted in a soothing shade of lavender, with a sign advertising “psychic and astrology readings,” as well as yoga, healing classes and meditation. Once home to the Liberate Emporium, a metaphysical supply store, this building was already a hub of spiritual activity when Wendy L'Belle-Tividad took it over 10 months ago. L'Belle-Tividad is pale, almost luminescent, an effect enhanced by her bright blond hair and her wardrobe of flowing, white and pale pink garments. Any skeptic would find themselves disarmed by her soft smile and twinkling voice, and her tendency to address everyone as “angel.” With a list of clients that includes both A-list celebrities and struggling artists, L'Belle-Tividad not only helps people sort out their emotional lives but also offers what she calls “creative sessions” — readings to help people work through their ideas and projects. But I didn't come for a creative session. Not sure where I fell on the spectrum between “cynic” and “believer” myself, I found myself anxious as L'Belle-Tividad sat me down for a reading. My eyes watered as I fixed them to her forehead. “You have a lot of light around you,” she said, her eyes seeming unfocused as she rested her vision on a candle flickering to the left of me. “You're at odds with some things in your life and you're trying to figure out which direction to go,” she said. “You sometimes start things and then don't finish all the way because you're not sure which direction to go. Someone had offered me a job, in an industry I was conflicted about. “I think you might do it, my angel. “Your energy goes in a very interesting angle to that space. Because the job was at a tech company. L'Belle-Tividad doesn't refer to herself as a psychic. Rather, she prefers to be called a “ball of light” or “God's helper,” mystifying phrases unburdened by the conventional stigmas. In 2023, I listened to an interview L'Belle-Tividad gave on “Otherworld,” a podcast about supernatural encounters hosted by Jack Wagner. Her daughter, Harmony Tividad, formerly one-half of the band Girlpool, had drawn many of the young creatives in her orbit into the yurt in L'Belle-Tividad's backyard in Sherman Oaks, where she once regularly held group readings. But I was just now putting the pieces together — and trying to book my own appointment. When you quite literally accept the cards that life has already dealt you, the story of what may lay ahead practically tells itself. “We ended up closing my books for a year and a half because it felt too overwhelming,” L'Belle-Tividad says. “It was, like, 2024 and they were booking me for 2027.” Since Wagner's podcast, the mysterious “clairvoyant” has been repeatedly sought after. She's been featured in Nylon, Interview and Office magazines. This year, Lizzo, one of her several celebrity clients, invited a New York Magazine journalist to sit in on one of their readings for a profile of the pop artist. So much so that she was able to move her spiritual practice out of the yurt in her backyard and into the building on Ventura last January. “It was such an act of faith, because, you know, we're in the middle of this incredible disaster.” The furnishings are as eclectic as the woman herself: A pink couch in one corner has four bowing swans affixed to each corner. A ceramic red-haired mermaid sits in the corner of her spacious bathtub. She has two of them, with lacy white- and pink-colored garments bursting out the sliding doors. “I don't know how else to explain it. When I visit, she and her husband, Vince Tividad, have just moved in with their two dogs, Heaven and Dove. On this day, they're also watching Harmony's dog, Dragon, a mouthy attention-seeker who interrupts our conversation multiple times. “Do I need to go into your field and see what's going on?” L'Belle-Tividad asks Dragon when the dog starts barking again. “Do I need to find out what's happening with you? L'Belle-Tividad has been reading people and animals now for nine years, but what she calls her “Kundalini awakening” happened in 2013. “It's like having a lot of electricity move through your body. The electricity was so intense, she says, she often had to sleep in epsom salt to soothe her body. “She had always had incredible intuition when I was younger, and we'd always make jokes about her being psychic,” says Harmony. “That was something that was common in the discourse of our household: ‘She's doing her psychic thing, you know. But it wasn't normal for her mom to be “channeling metaphysical data,” says Harmony. She remembers her mom suddenly acquiring a “strange breadth of knowledge” on subjects she had no expertise in. She remembers out-of-the-ordinary electrical occurrences happening in her mother's wake, like lights suddenly going out. Her mom was, they say, deep-trance channeling. “I was a philosophy minor in college, and I'd researched a lot of different philosophical leanings and things. There was no doubt about it,” he says. L.A.-based artist Amanda Maciel Antunes opens up another realm to talk to the famed erotics writer and diarist — 45 years after her death. It was before Girlpool had taken off. “And within like a month, we were in NME for the first time ever and that was our first write-up.” The first reading L'Belle-Tividad gave was to a group of three of her friends, more than three years after her awakening. “Within time, I found out I did not have to go into this deeper trance state to get information, that I could use a lot less energy, and just touch people's hands, and get information, and go into their field,” she says. For my own reading, L'Belle-Tividad walked me into her office, a small space in the back of the Pure Heart Collective that is decorated excessively in soft pinks. She dabbed some oil on the inside of my wrists — a special concoction her mother Diane makes called Wolf Oil, which you can buy at the collective for $45. She closed her eyes and held my hands, and then she focused her gaze on a flickering candle. At the risk of perpetuating a silly cliche, it's not uncommon to hear people in Los Angeles refer to their psychics or mediums as casually as they refer to their therapists or masseuses. On every main street you can find a neon sign advertising psychic services. “No other community on the face of the globe has given rise to half as many mystic, philosophical, psychological, occult, consciousness-raising, therapeutic and alternative creeds as 20th century L.A.,” The Times wrote in 1988. This “customary affinity for the socially bizarre” — as the New York Times put it in a 1976 article on SoCal's “flourishing” psychics — has been a curiosity for those who come from colder coasts. Is there something about the sun that makes you more susceptible to supernatural influence? Today, L'Belle-Tividad suggests a donation in the range of $400 to $1,000. L'Belle-Tividad was born in Mission Hills, at least 50 years ago, although she won't disclose her exact age. (“Can you just say I'm ageless?” she asks.) Her mom was born in Hermosa Beach. She doesn't remember any preoccupation with psychics or mediums growing up. She made her own greeting cards, which she sold to Fred Segal, and then worked in TV commercials as a creative assistant for some time. She met Vince, a bass player, about 31 years ago, at the House of Blues. “I don't know how else to explain it. “I was sitting at a table, and I turned around, there was this beautiful girl sitting behind me, and I said, ‘Do you always sneak up on people? “And she goes, ‘No, I just felt safe here,' or something like that.” Harmony was born a couple years later. It was Harmony who encouraged her mom to start doing readings. People started sending L'Belle-Tividad celebrity clients, most of whom prefer to remain anonymous. They do include A-list actors and musicians. “I was not, like, always super into psychics,” Lizzo tells me over the phone. “I didn't want them to tell me anything negative…. [But with Wendy] it's not just somebody looking in a crystal ball being like ‘and then this is gonna happen to you.' Lizzo says that in their first session, L'Belle-Tividad appeared to know things about her that no one could have known — information about herself that was not on the internet. In the years since, Lizzo has booked countless appointments. “My music video for ‘Still Bad' that I released earlier this year was in the woods,” says Lizzo. “Before it came out, she was like, ‘I see you in the woods. And I was like, ‘Yeah, girl, how did you know that? Vienna Pouliot, a “helper” and apprentice at the Pure Heart Collective, describes L'Belle-Tividad as a “beautiful bubbly fairy” whose secondary power is in cultivating long-lasting relationships with her clients. “[A nonbeliever] came into the intuition class, and the person that they were paired with was actually able to completely see what their partner had done the day before,” she says. “They thought they were just kind of being imaginative, and then they ended up describing to a T what this person, who they never met, did the day before.” L'Belle-Tividad believes everyone has innate intuitive ability, but that the realities of contemporary life — a 9-to-5 job, screen addictions, long commutes — have dulled our senses. Tommy Bruce, a music manager at Full Stop Management, which manages top talent like Harry Styles, Tate McRae, John Mayer and U2, has been a client of L'Belle-Tividad for five years. Wendy's currency [among] people of note is … it wouldn't work if she ever shared anything with anyone. I don't know if I believed that or not — still, the promise made me comfortable enough to ask L'Belle-Tividad about an extremely painful and private event in my life that happened many years ago, the details of which I cannot remember, in my own reading. What I can tell you is that she seemed to know details about what happened that no one else could have known. I don't know if what she said was true. What I do know is that it felt true. I allowed myself, in that moment, to let go of the shame and guilt I felt over this painful event in my life. The skeptics in my life believe L'Belle-Tividad may just be really good at collecting information about people, gleaning details from other readings and our demographic data. Creatives tend to be very chatty and have a hard time keeping secrets. When L'Belle-Tividad first entered my field, she asked, “Have you finished your book yet?” I hadn't told her about the book I was writing, but it was an easy guess to make: I am a 30-something writer in Los Angeles. There are also some things in my reading that she got wrong. She told me I had a knack for languages. She told me I would find myself living in France some day; I had actually been thinking about moving to Spain. And she described my maternal grandmother as “chatty.” This simply was never the case with my late grandmother, a stoic woman who preferred silent company. But perhaps it's a quality she's acquired in the afterlife. Tasbeeh Herwees is a writer born and raised in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No matter how Sunday's bracket reveal went, a few fan bases were going to have gripes. And despite their best (or as Notre Dame fans might argue, worst) efforts, this year's version of the College Football Playoff committee fueled plenty of them. ESPN is in an uncomfortable spot full of conflicts of interest: It owns the rights to the College Football Playoff. It can sell advertising on the rankings shows each Tuesday night. The event benefits from good matchups and big-market teams but must be fair and operate with integrity. But that's a whole other conspiracy theory.) The likelihood of a grand conspiracy might be unlikely. But it's going to be easy for fans to connect the dots of this year's Playoff field to larger storylines swirling around the sport. Let's have some fun with the best ones: The SEC and Big Ten Championship Games were built for a postseason that no longer exists. Having your two best teams — well, usually — crash into each other for 60 minutes while other Playoff contenders sit at home makes no sense. It didn't score until the third quarter, when Georgia already led 21-0. And the Tide stayed put at No. The committee has talked about not penalizing teams for playing games that others didn't have to play. 4 team, lost by 27 and dropped below Notre Dame, who didn't play? But it's a game built into the SEC's 10-year, $3 billion television rights agreement with ESPN, and it makes well into the eight digits for the conference. It would affect that deal, possibly stripping ESPN of the most valuable individual game in its SEC television deal. And though there might be complaining, it's unlikely there will be lots of momentum to change the event. But it very conspicuously placed James Madison at No. 25 in last week's rankings, setting up a clear scenario for the game: Virginia would be in if it won. Duke almost certainly would be out if it won. The ACC has already had a brutal few years. Florida State and Clemson have been loudly saber-rattling about leaving the league and in March, settled litigation against the league with lowered exit fees and a changed revenue distribution model that benefited teams who win on the field. When the 12-team Playoff was designed, it seemed almost impossible for a major conference to be left out. But it could have happened this year, and it took a late reversal from the committee on how it viewed idle Miami and Notre Dame. Every power conference would struggle with an existential crisis if it missed the field in the four-team era. And having a Playoff without one of the major conferences represented would reflect poorly on the sport. Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said it would be a “disservice to the sport” to leave out Texas because it played Ohio State and lost. He also said any future nonconference matchups would be “up for discussion.” It was a fair point, even if there's another side to the coin: There's a huge upside to winning big nonconference matchups. They usually go a long way with the committee, which traditionally looks down on teams that schedule a plate of cupcakes in nonconference play. It's one thing for Texas to be left out of the Playoff because it lost on the road to Ohio State. But Miami played Notre Dame, won, and could be left out of the Playoff in favor of the Irish anyway? Cue an offseason of “why play the games” debate. Duke's players and coaches were adamant after beating Virginia on Saturday night: They deserved to make the field. But the ACC putting forth a five-loss champion with losses to Illinois (by 26 points), Tulane, Georgia Tech, UConn, and Virginia put the committee in an impossible position. The committee seemed to make its choice last week, placing James Madison at No. Whether James Madison belonged in the Top 25 is more questionable. There will be detractors who look at the lopsided betting lines for Tulane (+17.5) at Ole Miss and James Madison (+21.5) at Oregon and argue they don't belong. But the committee clearly felt more comfortable choosing a one-loss Group of 6 champion (whose only loss was close to eight-win Louisville) over a five-loss ACC champion that reached the title game by winning a five-way tiebreaker. The weekly Playoff rankings reveal doesn't need to exist. But it exists for no other reason than to provide ESPN with a compelling piece of content on Tuesday nights in the fall when there's little alternative. And every show needs a compelling season finale, right? In 2023, there was the Florida State plot twist. This year, the committee told us week after week it believed Notre Dame was better than Miami. It was somewhat defensible in the first rankings. Notre Dame looked like a wrecking ball. Instead, it kept Notre Dame ahead, separated by just one team: BYU. Then, with Notre Dame feeling confident and safely in the vast majority of mock brackets, the committee pulled a switcheroo. Notre Dame AD Pete Bevacqua told ESPN it felt like they had the rug pulled out from under them. And if you choose to believe in this theory, how could anyone argue?
