                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Humans are one step closer to traveling at faster-than-light speeds. In a surprising paper, scientists say they've nailed down a physical model for a warp drive, which flies in the face of what we've long thought about the crazy concept of warp speed travel: that it requires exotic, negative forces. To best understand what the breakthrough means, you'll need a quick crash course on the far-out idea of traveling through folded space. The colloquial term “warp drive” comes from science fiction, most famously Star Trek. Star Trek suggests that this extraordinary power alone pushes the ship at faster-than-light speeds. Scientists have been studying and theorizing about faster-than-light space travel for decades. One major reason for our interest is pure pragmatism: without warp drive, we're probably never making it to a neighboring star system. The closest such trip is still four years long at light speed. Our current understanding of warp speed dates back to 1994, when a now-iconic theoretical physicist named Miguel Alcubierre first proposed what we've called the Alcubierre drive ever since. “By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it,” Alcubierre wrote in his paper's abstract, “motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible.” Essentially, an Alcubierre drive would expend a tremendous amount of energy—likely more than what's available within the universe—to contract and twist space-time in front of it and create a bubble. Alcubierre describes spacetime expanding on one side of the ship and contracting on the other, thanks to that enormous amount of energy and a requisite amount of exotic matter—in this case, negative energy. Some scientists have criticized the Alcubierre drive, however, because it requires too much mass and negative energy for humans to ever seriously construct a warp-based propulsion system. NASA has been trying to build a physical warp drive through Eagleworks Laboratories for most of the last decade, but hasn't yet made any significant strides. Plus, Alcubierre himself has endorsed the new model, which is like having Albert Einstein show up to your introductory physics class. Here's a helpful video in which Sabine Hossenfelder, a Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, breaks down the findings: Of course, there's one gigantic caveat here: The concept in this paper is still in the “far future” zone of possibility, made of ideas that scientists still don't know how to construct in any sense. “While the mass requirements needed for such modifications are still enormous at present,” the APL scientists write, “our work suggests a method of constructing such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.” Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two-masted schooner was fully intact—a rarity in Great Lakes shipwreck finds. A team of five divers descended over 300 feet into Lake Ontario's dark waters near Toronto and found much more than they were dreaming of. The divers discovered a two-masted schooner sitting upright, with both masts still fully intact, in what the Ontario Underwater Council called an “extraordinary state of preservation for a Great Lakes vessel.” After some preliminary investigation, the team believes the ship may come from an under-documented period of Great Lakes shipbuilding, sometime between 1800 and 1850. “It took us a few moments to calm ourselves down because it's overwhelming finding a pristine wreck that is all in one piece,” Heison Chak, the president of the Ontario Underwater Council, told the CBC. We saw two—both masts were standing, which is pretty rare. A fiber-optic cable survey of the lake from Buffalo to Toronto alerted experts to an anomaly sitting on the lakebed, leading experts to surmise it could be the Rapid City vessel, an 1884-built schooner lost in 1917. Now, though, they don't think it can be that recent a wreckage. James Conolly, Trent University archaeologist and diver, said there were features that just weren't common for ships built after 1850, a period that experienced a bit of a technological leap for Great Lakes ships. Post-1850s ships had metal rigging, whereas the one found is rope-rigged. “This is deep enough that I don't think anyone's been on it,” Chak said. “I think we're the first group and that joy was just overwhelming.” Charles Beeker, a Great Lakes shipwreck expert and professor at Indiana University, told the CBC it's too early to say the vessel is from 1800 to 1850. “I don't want to diminish the value of it,” he said. “Where a wreck might once have survived intact for centuries,” Conolly said, “we now have only decades to study it before biological and environmental factors take their toll.” “We don't know, but if it is really that era,” Chak said, “from 1800 to 1850, I think we will have even more celebration because we hit the jackpot where there is very little history or studied documented material about shipwrecks, ships, or shipbuilding in that era.” Tim Newcomb is a journalist based in the Pacific Northwest.

On a video call in early September, Sarah Tabrizi first saw the data that she and other researchers studying Huntington's disease had been chasing for decades: compelling evidence that a gene-targeting therapy could slow the relentless progression of the neurodegenerative brain disorder. Before these results, “I was beginning to get a little bit worried that maybe, by the time people develop symptoms, that it was going to be too late to treat”, says Tabrizi, a neurologist who directs the Huntington's Disease Centre at University College London. “It's a giant step forward,” says Tabrizi, who was the trial's lead scientific adviser. The first-in-class gene therapy — called AMT-130 and developed by uniQure, a biotechnology company in Amsterdam — uses a harmless virus to deliver strands of genetic material into affected brain regions. On a standard rating scale used to assesses motor and cognitive functions and other measures of daily living, the scores of participants receiving the high dose dropped by just 0.38 points over three years. After digesting the findings, Tabrizi and her close collaborator Ed Wild, a fellow neurologist at University College London, shared what Wild describes as a “massive hug”. But, after that, it was right back to the daily demands of patient care and research. “We're like an episode of The West Wing: it's always, ‘What's next? Next for Tabrizi and Wild are leading roles in evaluating five other huntingtin-lowering therapies in clinical development, along with several others poised to enter human trials soon. “Sarah is amazing,” says Hugh Rickards, a neuropsychiatrist at the University of Birmingham, UK. You name a disease-modifying therapy in HD — she's got her hand on it somewhere.” Plus, “she's one of the nicest people you'll ever meet”, says Samuel Frank, a neurologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who, like Rickards, has worked with Tabrizi on Huntington's trials. Only four years ago, another promising huntingtin-targeted therapy, tominersen, faltered in late-stage trials. Overall, the drug failed to improve people's outcomes compared with those of the control group and it came with dangerous side effects at higher doses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Vitamin Shot Given at Birth Prevents Lethal Brain Bleeds, but More Parents Are Opting Out Vitamin K injections have prevented deadly brain bleeds in infants for more than 60 years. New research shows refusal rates have recently jumped nearly 80 percent The cause: vitamin K deficiency—a condition that is almost entirely preventable with a simple shot given at birth. According to new research published today in JAMA, the rate of vitamin K shot refusals has risen nearly 80 percent in the U.S. between 2017 and 2024. The trend comes at a time of growing vaccine hesitancy and science denial. Wellness influencers have fueled skepticism by characterizing the vitamin K shot as unnecessary and questioning its lab-made ingredients, even though they are found in many routine injections.

Without the shot, as many as one in 60 babies are at risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding, which can cause permanent brain damage or death. “We know unequivocally that infants that don't receive vitamin K are at significantly higher risk of getting serious bleeding,” Scott says. His study did not directly measure whether the increase in refusals has led to more bleeding events. Some online influencers suggest that parents can use oral vitamin K as an alternative to the injection. But Scott says that approach is less reliable—oral vitamin K is less effective at preventing bleeds because it's not absorbed as readily. The shot itself carries minimal risk, and adverse reactions are rare. Loyal, who works at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital and has also researched vitamin K refusal, emphasizes that the shot differs fundamentally from a vaccine because it doesn't target a microorganism—it simply supplies an essential vitamin. Although the risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding may seem low, Loyal says, “it's not zero—and why take a chance when we know there is a safe preventative measure?” Christina Szalinski is a freelance science writer who covers life sciences and health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While horoscopes and New Age crystals often provide clear answers to the first two questions, the last one on that list can get complicated sometimes. Type O positive uses a different antigen altogether (known as the rhesus, or Rh, factor), and Type O negative has none of the above. All of this complexity is encoded into proteins by out ABO gene, located on our ninth chromosome. While interesting in and of themselves, antigens become especially important when it comes to donating blood to and receiving blood from others. This is whytype O negative blood is seen as the universal donor type—because it has neither of the A or B antigens nor the Rh(D) antigen, there is virtually no risk of rejection. But even rarer blood types than O negative exist. There are fifty people on the entire planet with Rh-negative blood, nicknamed “golden blood,” which is completely devoid of Rh antigens. And there is only one individual known to have Gwada negative blood, which was only discovered earlier this year. While O negative is only found in 7% of the global population, researchers who tested the blood of patients and donors in a Thai hospital have now discovered yet another new type that runs through the veins of only three known individuals (it was found in one patient and two donors). “ABO discrepancies were distinct between donors and patients even in the same ethnicity,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the journal Transfusion and Apheresis Science. Additionally, the B(A) individuals identified in this study carried identical genetic alterations that differed from all antecedent alleles of the B(A) phenotype.” The researchers saw four alleles—alternative forms of certain genes at the same location on a chromosome—on the B(A) type that differed from alleles associated with other blood type and created B(A). Mutations like this had previously been seen in many ethnicities, including individuals from other parts of Asia, but it was the first time such a phenomenon was ever recorded in the Thai population. There could be more blood types out there that remain undiscovered, and more individuals with those extremely rare blood types. Further research may find more of either, and this discovery is proof that blood typing is not so simple as ABO.

The ship was laden with 10 years' worth of gold, silver, and gems, tribute from Spanish colonies in Latin America headed back to the Spanish king. Experts have now pulled up the first pieces from the ship, including coins, a cannon, and porcelain cups. where it laid dormant for hundreds of years. An estimated 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones were aboard the ship, the result of 10 years of taxation saved up before the fleet's planed voyage back to Spain.

(2025)Cite this article Organometallic reagents are essential in organic synthesis, with organolithium compounds being most widely used. However, as lithium becomes less abundant and increasingly expensive, organosodium compounds have emerged as promising alternatives, but their use in organic synthesis is limited by their poor solubility in organic solvents, the need for pre-activated sodium sources and the necessity for highly anhydrous conditions. Here we report a mechanochemical protocol for the direct generation of organosodium compounds from cheap and shelf-stable sodium lumps and readily available organic halides under bulk, solvent-free conditions. These reactions generate an array of organosodium compounds in minutes, without special precautions against moisture or temperature control. These nucleophiles can be used directly for one-pot nucleophilic addition reactions with electrophiles and nickel-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Furthermore, this mechanochemical approach enables the sodiation of inert C–F bonds in organic fluorides. This method is anticipated to drive progress in sodium-based synthetic chemistry. Organolithium compounds have played a dominant role as carbon nucleophiles, Brønsted bases and precursors for a variety of other organometallic reagents in organic synthesis for over 100 years (Fig. Their widespread use is attributed to their relatively high stability in organic solvents, coupled with well-established methods for their preparation5,6. However, from a sustainability standpoint, there is an increasing demand for alternatives to lithium, which is becoming both less abundant and more expensive7. The growing demand for lithium-ion batteries is expected to further intensify competition for lithium resources8,9,10. a, Comparison between organolithium compounds and organosodium compounds. b, Previous work involving mechanochemical activation of sodium metal. c, Direct mechanochemical synthesis of organosodium compounds through ball milling. E+, electrophile; SCXRD, single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Sodium, another s-block metal, is much more earth abundant than lithium (crustal abundance 22,700 ppm versus Li abundance 18 ppm)11 and is therefore an attractive candidate for replacing lithium to explore sustainable organic synthesis (Fig. The first reports of organosodium chemistry emerged in the 1850s, pioneered by J. A. Wanklyn24, but substantial challenges exist that have prevented the widespread adoption of organosodium reagents within the field of organic synthesis25,26,27,28,29. First, the highly reactive nature of organosodium reagents makes them incompatible with many solvents, including ethers, which can react via C‒H and C‒O activation, and even aromatic solvents such as toluene and benzene29. Only alkane solvents (for example hexanes) can be considered genuinely inert towards organosodiums, but the poor solubility of organosodium reagents in hydrocarbon solvents often causes substantial problems, limiting the potential for widespread application. Second, while direct metallation of organic halides with metallic sodium is an attractive and straightforward synthetic method, it has severe drawbacks: (1) traditional solution-based methods involving direct metallation of organic halides with metallic sodium suffer from a severe side reaction, Wurtz coupling, where the newly formed organosodium (RNa) reacts with unreacted organohalide (RX) to form the homocoupling product R‒R and sodium halide (NaX)30; (2) reactions often require a large excess of sodium lumps or unstable, expensive pre-activated sodium sources such as sodium dispersion13,17. To avoid Wurtz coupling, the mainstream method to prepare organosodiums is Li–Na exchange, by reacting organolithium (RLi) with sodium tert-butoxide (NaOtBu) to generate RNa and LiOtBu in a hydrocarbon solvent (usually hexanes), driven by the poor solubility of RNa in these solvents (see above)31. This Li–Na exchange still requires Li, which eliminates the sustainability merit of organosodiums. The need for rigorously dry and deoxygenated organic solvents and relatively complex setups involving inert-gas atmospheres presents additional practical drawbacks. Mechanochemical organic synthesis using ball-milling techniques has emerged as a new methodology to carry out organic synthesis under solvent-free conditions32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43. The advantages of this protocol include reduced solvent waste, fast reaction kinetics and operational simplicity under ambient conditions. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that vigorous mechanical agitation can activate zero-valent metals by removing the unreactive surface oxide layer and increasing the reactive surface area44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53. These mechanochemically activated, zero-valent metals readily undergo metal–surface reactions with organic halides to produce the corresponding organometallic species efficiently51. Surprisingly, by utilizing this strategy, organometallic compounds previously thought to be synthesizable only in solution have been successfully prepared under mechanochemical conditions, including Grignard reagents54,55,56,57, organozinc58,59,60, organocalcium61,62,63, organomanganese64,65, organobarium66 and organolithium reagents67. However, the direct mechanochemical synthesis of organosodium compounds has yet to be explored. Recently, mechanochemical activation of sodium lumps has been utilized for highly efficient ammonia-free Birch reduction and the preparation of a sodium anion complex (Fig. Building on these successful results, we envisioned that a mechanochemical protocol could offer a practical and efficient solution to address the challenges associated with conventional solution-based methods for the preparation and application of organosodium compounds in synthetic chemistry. In this Article, we report a mechanochemical generation of organosodium compounds from various organic halides and commercially available, cheap and stable sodium lumps and their application to organic synthesis (Fig. This protocol can be performed under ambient conditions without the need for pre-activated sodium metal, large amounts of anhydrous organic solvents or complex synthetic procedures that require precautions against moisture and strict temperature control. Furthermore, these rapid reactions complete within minutes. This is likely to be due to the mechanical activation of sodium metal in situ. The resulting organosodium species readily react with a wide range of electrophiles in a one-pot mechanochemical process. Nickel-catalysed direct cross-coupling of organosodium compounds with aryl halides also proceeded under mechanochemical conditions. Additionally, this mechanochemical strategy was applicable to the direct sodiation of poorly soluble aromatic halides as well as organic fluorides, which are unreactive towards sodiation under conventional solution-based conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis and NMR spectroscopy studies were successfully performed to confirm the identity of the key mechanochemically generated organosodium intermediates. Overall, the present study provides a synthetic platform centred on organosodium compounds, which has the potential to replace conventional organolithium-based synthesis with a more sustainable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach. We initially attempted the generation of organosodium species through the reaction of bromobenzene (1a) with sodium lumps using a Retsch MM400 mixer mill (5 ml stainless-steel milling jar with one stainless-steel ball; ball diameter: 10 mm). The mineral oil on the sodium lumps was removed by wiping them with a paper towel, before the lumps were cut into pieces approximately 4–5 mm in width and depth. Subsequently, the sodium-metal pieces were weighed and introduced into the jar, followed by addition of 1a under atmospheric conditions. After optimization (see Supplementary Table 1 for details), we established the following mechanochemical protocol for generating organosodium compounds (Fig. 2): ball milling of 1a (2.0 equiv.) and sodium lumps (4.4 equiv.) in the presence of n-hexane (4.4 equiv.) as a liquid additive for efficient grinding was conducted for 5 min. The jar was opened in air and N-benzylideneaniline 2a (1.0 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. The jar was then quickly closed (without any inert gas purging) and a second phase of ball milling was conducted for 5 min, yielding the desired amine 3a in excellent yield (87%). The scope of the aromatic halides and electrophiles using this one-pot, two-step mechanochemical protocol is shown in Fig. Phenylsodium could also be generated from chlorobenzene, and subsequent reaction with 2a produced 3a in 85% yield. Organosodium species were prepared from various alkylated aryl halides (1b–1f) and reacted with 2a smoothly to produce the corresponding amines (3b–3f) in moderate to excellent yields (50–91%). Biphenyl bromides (1g and 1h) were also readily metallated, and subsequent reaction with 2a afforded 3g and 3h in 53 and 61% yields, respectively. Aryl halides bearing trimethylsilyl, dimethylamino and methoxy groups were compatible with this reaction, and the corresponding amines (3i–3k) were obtained in moderate to high yields (34–73%). We tested the generation of organosodium compounds from sterically hindered aryl bromides such as mesityl bromide (1l) and 2-bromo-1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (1m). Mesityl sodium was efficiently generated, and subsequent nucleophilic addition to 2a proceeded to give 3l in 90% yield. A more sterically hindered aryl halide 1m also underwent direct sodiation under mechanochemical conditions to afford the desired product 3m in 45% yield. N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)aniline (2b) also reacted with the mechanochemically generated aryl sodium compound, 4-tolyl sodium, to give 3n in 66% yield. Conditions: 1 (2.0 mmol), Na (4.4 mmol), n-hexane (4.4 mmol) and electrophile (1.0 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. a15 min for first step. b15 min for first step and 30 min for second step. dFirst step: 1 (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2 mmol) and n-hexane (2.2 mmol) for 5 min. Second step: dry ice (excess) for 30 min. eFirst step: 1 (2.5 mmol), Na (5.0 mmol) and n-hexane (5.0 mmol) for 5 min. Second step: Ar–Cl (1.0 mmol), NiCl2(dppe) (0.10 mmol). iPr, isopropyl; tBu, tert-butyl; TMS, trimethylsilyl; pin, pinacol. In addition to imines as trapping reagents, aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes also smoothly reacted with mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds to afford the corresponding alcohols (3o–3s) in moderate to excellent yields (56–81%). Methyl benzoate could also be used as an electrophile and the desired tertiary alcohol 3t was obtained in 97% yield. Nucleophilic additions to aromatic ketones also proceeded rapidly, providing the corresponding alcohols (3u–3x) in moderate to excellent yields (42–80%). Additionally, various aromatic ketones (3y–3aa) were successfully prepared by reactions between organosodium compounds and Weinreb amides in good to excellent yields (65–85%). Morpholine amides were also reactive with the organosodium compounds, and the desired ketone 3ab and aldehyde 3ac were obtained in 53 and 67% yields, respectively. Reactions of dimethylphenyl silane (HSiMe2Ph) with the organosodium compounds bearing biphenyl and fluorene moieties provided the corresponding silylated products 3ad and 3ae in 92 and 89% yields, respectively. Mechanochemically generated phenylsodium could be trapped by dry ice, and benzoic acid 3af was obtained in 83% yield. The feasibility of mechanochemical nickel-catalysed cross-coupling reaction with organosodium compounds was also investigated70. Following catalyst optimization (see Supplementary Table 2 for details), we found that NiCl2(dppe) (dppe, 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) was an ideal catalyst for this reaction, and the cross-coupling between phenylsodium and 2-chlorolonapthalene gave the corresponding coupled product 3ag in 43% yield. In our substrate scope studies, side products such as homocoupled products of organic halides were not detected. Unfortunately, unlike aryl halides, alkyl halides proved difficult to use in one-pot, two-step reactions, and the desired products were not obtained. This was probably due to rapid decomposition of the reactive alkyl sodium intermediates formed during the metallation step. To address this limitation, we explored one-pot, one-step transformations in which the electrophile was introduced at the start of the reaction, enabling trapping of the reactive organosodium intermediate as soon as it was formed (Fig. Pleasingly, we found that employing this Barbier-type approach, a reaction between 1-chlorohexane, sodium lumps and imine 2a proceeded smoothly to provide the corresponding amine 3ah in 95% yield. Shorter and branched primary alkyl chlorides could also be used for this reaction, and the desired products 3ai and 3aj were obtained in 87 and 90% yields, respectively. Reactions using secondary and tertiary alkyl chlorides produced the corresponding amines 3ak and 3al in 63 and 18% yields, respectively. Fortunately, morpholine amides were also compatible under these strongly reducing conditions, enabling nucleophilic acyl substitution with n-butyl sodium to deliver the corresponding ketones (3am–3ap) in 42–66% yield. Nucleophilic addition to cyclopropyl phenyl ketone also readily proceeded and alcohol 3aq was obtained in 70% yield. Aldehyde electrophiles were also compatible, enabling access to secondary alcohol products (3ar–3at) in moderate to good yields (55–60%). Additionally, mechanochemical borylation of in situ-generated primary alkyl sodium species provided the corresponding boronic esters 3au and 3av in yields of 75 and 62%, respectively (in the latter case, 5% of Wurtz-type homocoupled product was detected as a minor side product). Conditions: 1 (2.0 mmol), Na (4.4 mmol), n-hexane (4.4 mmol) and electrophile (1.0 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. aAddition of n-hexane (4.4 mmol). b1 (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2–4.0 equiv.) and iPrO–B(pin) (2.0 mmol). iPr, isopropyl; tBu, tert-butyl; pin, pinacol. We also applied this operationally simple one-pot, one-step protocol to reactions using aryl sodium compounds (Fig. Under our optimized conditions, both 4-chlorotoluene and 4-tert-butylbromobenzene reacted with morpholine amides to furnish the corresponding ketones 3ab and 3aw in 76 and 74% yields, respectively. Nucleophilic additions of aryl sodium compounds to aldimine 2a and 4-tert-butylbenzaldehyde were also investigated, and the desired products 3b and 3o were successfully obtained in 77 and 40% yields, respectively. One-pot, one-step borylations were applied to 4-bromotoluene and 4-bromoanisole to deliver boronic esters 3ax and 3ay in 64 and 56% yields, respectively. These results are comparable to the corresponding one-pot, two-step reactions (Fig. To underline the practical utility of our developed mechanochemical protocol, we investigated its use in preparative-scale reactions (Fig. 4-Tolyl sodium was successfully prepared on a 12-mmol scale under mechanochemical conditions, and its nucleophilic addition to aldimine 2a gave 3b without any decrease in efficiency (96%, 1.582 g) compared to small-scale synthesis. Likewise, a one-pot, one-step reaction between 1-chlorobutane and 4-benzoylmorpholine was also carried out on a gram scale to furnish 3am in 69% yield. These results underscore the practical utility of this protocol. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. See Supplementary Section 4 for full details. To further expand the range of synthetically accessible organosodium compounds, we explored C–H sodiation of heteroaromatic arenes using a mechanochemically generated sodium amide (Fig. We were delighted to find that sodium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (NaTMP) could be generated by the reaction between phenylsodium and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMPH), and employed to deprotonate benzothiophene. Subsequent addition to aldimine 2a proceeded smoothly to afford 3az in 97% yield. Benzofuran and 1-methylindole were also deprotonated by mechanochemically generated NaTMP and the resulting organosodium compounds reacted with aldimine 2a to produce 3ba and 3bb in good yields. Aldehyde and Weinreb amide electrophiles could also be employed as electrophiles, delivering the corresponding alcohol (3bc) and ketone (3bd) products in yields of 93 and 85%, respectively. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. Conditions: 1a (1.0 mmol), Na (2.2 mmol), n-hexane (2.2 mmol), TMPH (1.0 mmol), 1 (1.0 mmol) and electrophile (0.5 mmol) in a stainless-steel ball-milling jar (5 ml) with a stainless-steel ball (10 mm). Ball milling (30 Hz) was carried out. See Supplementary Section 3F for full details. To highlight the synthetic utility of our developed mechanochemical protocol, we applied it to synthesize the drug molecule orphenadrine, an anticholinergic agent used to treat painful muscle spasms (Fig. After minor optimization, the generation of phenylsodium, followed by nucleophilic addition to 2-methylbenzaldehyde under mechanochemical conditions, afforded the intermediate 3q in 86% yield. Subsequent alkylation and reduction with LiAlH4 yielded orphenadrine in 85% yield over two steps. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. TMPH, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine; THF, tetrahydrofuran; r.t., room temperature. See Supplementary Section 6 for full details. Due to the high basicity of organosodium species, the scope of available solvents is limited to simple hydrocarbon solvents. Therefore, aryl halides containing a large π-conjugated system, which are often sparingly soluble in such solvents, are difficult to directly sodiate under conventional solution-based conditions. For example, 1-bromo-3,5-diphenylbenzene (1be) is poorly soluble in n-hexane, and an attempted solution-state sodiation followed by addition to cyclopropyl phenyl ketone did not afford the desired product 3be (Fig. By contrast, we were delighted to find that our mechanochemical protocol was successfully able to deliver alcohol 3be in excellent yield (89%), highlighting the potential of this approach to access organosodium compounds that cannot be accessed via conventional solution-based reactions. a, Generation of organosodium compounds from a poorly soluble halide and nucleophilic addition to ketone. b, Generation of organosodium compounds from an organofluoride and nucleophilic addition to 2a. c, Various Na-meditated transformations of C–F bonds. Isolated yields are reported as percentages. Integrated 1H NMR spectroscopy yields are shown in parentheses. See Supplementary Section 5 for details. In a similar vein, we also explored the generation of organosodium species from organic fluorides via inert C–F bond cleavage (Fig. Direct metallation of organofluorine compounds is challenging because it involves breaking a strong C–F bond, and reports on the direct sodiation of fluoroarenes with unactivated sodium lumps are lacking73. Indeed, an attempted solution-phase (n-hexane) sodiation of fluorobenzene followed by addition of aldimine (2a) resulted in no product formation. On the other hand, we discovered that phenylsodium was rapidly generated from fluorobenzene in 5 min under mechanochemical conditions, and subsequent nucleophilic addition to aldimine 2a furnished 3a in 96% yield. We found that other sodium-meditated transformations via C–F bond activation were feasible under mechanochemical conditions (Fig. For example, sodiation of 4-fluorobiphenyl also proceeded smoothly, and nucleophilic addition to phenyl ethyl ketone produced 3u in 59% yield. Likewise, fluoroarenes bearing trimethylsilyl (TMS) and methyl groups could also be successfully sodiated, and nucleophilic substitutions with Weinreb amides afforded the corresponding ketones 3bf and 3bg in 76 and 53% yields, respectively. A Barbier-type reaction between [1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl(morpholino)methanone and 1-fluoropentane afforded 3bh in 35% yield. 4-Tolyl sodium could be generated from 4-fluorotoluene and reacted with HSiMe2Ph to give the silylation product 3bi in 70% yield. Finally, to offer unambiguous evidence for the mechanochemical generation of the Na‒C bond during our reactions, we attempted to isolate and characterize a mechanochemically generated organosodium compound. For these structural studies, we selected a model aromatic organosodium bearing a lipophilic tert-butyl substituent, which we hoped would ensure sufficient hydrocarbon solubility to enable crystallization. Given that organosodium compounds are well known to form poorly soluble aggregates74 that could hamper their study by SCXRD, we also introduced a neutral amine ligand, namely N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ,Nʹ-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDTA), to break up these aggregates and form a soluble compound, allowing for crystallization. Accordingly, under an argon atmosphere, 3-chloro-tert-butylbenzene and 2.2 equiv. of Na metal were ball milled with 2.2 equiv. of n-hexane according to our standard optimized conditions (Fig. The crude product was treated with 0.6 equiv. of PMDTA solution in n-hexane followed by filtration to remove NaCl. Concentration followed by crystallization from n-hexane solution at −35 °C afforded a dimeric PMDTA-coordinated organosodium compound [Na(μC-3-tBu-C6H4)(κ3-N,Nʹ,Nʹ-PMDTA)]2 (4) (28% yield based on 1-(tert-butyl)-3-chlorobenzene). The single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure of 4 is shown in Fig. 8b, featuring two bridging phenyl groups, with Na‒C bond lengths within the range 2.61–2.65 Å. Solution state characterization of 4 was also performed by 1H, 13C and 23Na NMR spectroscopy in d12-cyclohexane. The 23Na NMR spectrum of 4 features a broad signal at –14.90 ppm (line width at half height LW1/2 approximately 10 ppm), which matches reported Na+ cation signals69. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 clearly exhibits a characteristic pattern of four protons consistent with a 1,3-disubstituted phenyl group, and the PMDTA remains coordinated (Fig. The 13C NMR spectrum (d12-cyclohexane) of 4 features a Na‒Csp2 quaternary carbon signal at 195.1 ppm similar to other PMDTA-ligated aryl sodium complexes described in the literature75. The NMR spectra indicate that the SCXRD structure of 4 persists in solution in cyclohexane—this is particularly important in organo-alkali metal chemistry, where fast equilibria are often prevalent, such as ligand coordination–dissociation and deprotonation–reprotonation. The isolation and characterization of 4 unambiguously supports the formation of a Na‒C bond during the mechanochemical sodiation reactions in our methodology. a, Mechanochemical synthesis of [3-(tert-butyl)phenyl]sodium followed by ligation with PMDTA and crystallization to afford [Na(μC-3-tBu-C6H4)(κ3-N,Nʹ,Nʹ-PMDTA]2 (4). b, Single-crystal X-ray structure of 4.

Organosodium compounds have garnered substantial attention as promising, sustainable alternatives to organolithium reagents. However, their practical and widespread application in organic synthesis has been hindered by the lack of efficient generation methods using easy-to-handle sodium sources and their limited solubility in organic solvents. This study demonstrates that a mechanochemical protocol can overcome these challenges, enabling rapid synthesis of a wide range of organosodium compounds, including aryl, primary, secondary alkyl and benzylic examples from inexpensive, abundant sodium lumps and organic halides within minutes, without the need for large volumes of solvents or complex inert-gas techniques. The resulting mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds react smoothly with various electrophiles in a one-pot manner (either stepwise or Barbier-type conditions), negating any requirement to isolate the organosodium intermediates. The operational simplicity of the procedure, in particular the ability to proceed without exclusion of air is especially noteworthy, substantially lowering the barrier for synthetic chemists to make and apply these reagents. Notably, this method facilitated the direct sodiation of poorly soluble halides, which are typically unreactive to sodiation under solution-based conditions. Furthermore, the study revealed that the sodiation of organofluorides, which are generally inert in solution, could be achieved via C–F bond cleavage under mechanochemical conditions. These findings highlight the effectiveness of this mechanochemical approach in expanding the accessible scope of organosodium chemistry. Finally, the isolation and characterization of mechanochemically generated organosodium compounds by single-crystal X-ray analysis and NMR spectroscopy was performed, providing unambiguous support for the key organosodium species proposed in this methodology. Given the increasing demand for organosodium compounds, this efficient and straightforward mechanical strategy is expected to advance the development of sodium-based synthetic chemistry, contributing to more sustainable syntheses of value-added molecules. Sodium lumps (4.4 equiv.) were cut into small pieces (approximately 4–5 mm in width and depth) and weighed in air after wiping off the mineral oil on them with paper. These were then added into a milling jar (5 ml) with a ball (10 mm diameter). An organic halide (2.0 equiv.) and n-hexane (4.4 equiv.) were added to the jar. After the jar was closed without purging with inert gas, it was placed in the ball mill (Retsch MM400, 30 Hz). After grinding for 5 min, the jar was opened in air and charged with an electrophile (1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) The jar was then closed without purging with inert gas, and was placed in the ball mill (Retsch MM400, 30 Hz). After grinding for 5 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl and extracted with EtOAc (30 ml × 3). The solution was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, typically EtOAc/n-hexane, typically 0–10:90) to give the corresponding product.

Controlled multimode wave propagation can enable more space-efficient photonic processors than architectures based on discrete components connected by single-mode waveguides. Instead of defining discrete elements, one can sculpt the continuous substrate of a photonic processor to perform computations through multimode interference in two dimensions. Here we designed and demonstrated a device with a refractive index that can be rapidly reprogrammed across space, allowing arbitrary control of wave propagation. The device, a two-dimensional programmable waveguide, uses parallel electro-optic modulation of the refractive index of a slab waveguide with about 104 programmable spatial degrees of freedom. We implemented neural network inference on benchmark tasks with up to 49-dimensional vectors in a single pass, without digital pre-processing or post-processing. Theoretical and numerical analyses further indicated that two-dimensional programmable waveguides may offer not only a constant-factor reduction in device area but also a scaling benefit, with the area required growing as N1.5 rather than N2. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained widespread adoption across many domains ranging from computer vision to natural language processing1. The size of DNN models has been increasing exponentially over the past decade, leading to exponentially increasing energy costs for running them. Limits to energy costs now impose a practical constraint on how large models can be2, strongly motivating the exploration of alternative and energy-efficient computing approaches for executing DNNs, with a computational cost that is typically dominated by that of matrix–vector multiplications (MVMs). Optical neural networks, particularly those integrated on photonic chips that specialize in performing MVMs with optics instead of electronics, are one promising candidate approach3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The dominant paradigm for designing integrated photonic neural networks is to construct networks of discrete, programmable photonic components, such as Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), microring resonators or phase-change memory cells, connected by single-mode waveguides10. However, the maximum vector size, N, supported by chips using this approach has so far been restricted (Supplementary Table 1) to sizes far below what is necessary for optics to deliver an energy-efficiency advantage (N ≳ 1,000)11,12,13,14. The scale of such chips has been limited by at least two factors. Second, individual optical components are rather bulky owing to the comparably large optical wavelength and the often weak programmability of optical materials. On top of that, substantial portions of the chip's area need to be dedicated to sprawling interconnection regions comprising well-isolated waveguides. We could achieve far greater spatial efficiency if we treated the entire chip as a blank slate with refractive index distribution, n(x, z), as a function of space, which we could arbitrarily and reprogrammably sculpt, instead of building the integrated photonic neural network from discrete components15,16,17,18,19,20. This study addressed a central challenge: how to make a photonic chip with a programmable refractive index distribution, ideally without the integration complexity of introducing electronic wiring. In conventional nanophotonic chips, n(x, z) is controlled by etching away material in lithographically defined regions and is fixed at fabrication time. Although inverse-designed chips21 realizing MVMs with fixed matrices can be made19, we generally would like to be able to program the matrix. Photorefractive crystals were explored several decades ago as a means to implement programmable linear operations with slab waveguides22,23 but fell out of favour because the small achievable refractive index modulation (10−4) meant that even centimetre-scale waveguides were unable to perform large-scale operations. Additionally, phase-change materials have recently been demonstrated to realize arbitrary refractive index distributions24,25 but suffer from a limited number of rewrite cycles (4,000 in ref. 26) and high loss (greater than 2.8 dB mm−1 in refs. 25,26). Here we introduce a photonic chip with a waveguide that is fully programmable in two dimensions: a two-dimensional (2D) programmable waveguide. The chip uses massively parallel electro-optic modulation to program n(x, z) across ~10,000 individual regions of a lithium niobate slab waveguide. We trained multimode photonic structures within the chip that perform neural network inference (Fig. 1). The structures realized by our 2D-programmable waveguide are similar to inverse-designed nanophotonic devices19,21; they are computer-optimized 2D metastructures that control multimode wave propagation. A distinguishing feature of our device is its programmability, setting it apart from typical inverse-designed photonic devices, which are fixed after manufacturing. We achieve programmability optically, decoupling the electronic wiring for programming from the photonic chip; a pattern of light shone on top of our device creates a spatially varying refractive index modulation Δn(x, z) in the slab waveguide. This is achieved by using the principle of photoconductive gain27,28 to induce a refractive index modulation via the strong electro-optic effect in lithium niobate. In our study, we show how we can train the refractive index distribution so that the complex wave propagation through the device performs a desired neural network inference (Fig. a, The fundamental unit of an artificial neural network (a layer) transforms an input vector into an output vector via a trainable matrix multiplication. b, Analogous to a neural network layer, the 2D-programmable waveguide linearly transforms an input optical field into an output optical field via wave propagation through a lithium niobate slab waveguide with 2D refractive index modulation Δn(x, z) that can be continuously and arbitrarily programmed (up to practical limits on resolution and maximum modulation; Supplementary Information sections 1C,D). This refractive index modulation, which is directly set by the illumination pattern projected onto the device (shown in green), is trained so that wave propagation through the waveguide performs machine learning tasks (handwritten-digit classification shown here as an example). c, Simulated wave intensity in the slab waveguide, which shows that the neural network computation is performed with complex multimode wave propagation. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the machine learning process using the device. In machine learning, data are often encoded in vector form, \({\bf{x}}_{l}\), and processed via programmable matrices W and activation functions f in ‘layers': \({\bf{x}}_{l+1}=f(W{\bf{x}}_{l})\) (illustrated in Fig. 1a). We amplitude-encoded the machine learning input data \({\bf{x}}_{l}\) into the one-dimensional (1D) input optical field distribution, E(x, z = 0) (Fig. 1b), which serves as the initial condition for programmable wave propagation described by the following partial differential equation: A solution of the equation is shown in Fig. The refractive index distribution of the slab waveguide, n(x, z) = n0 + Δn(x, z), has two contributions: a spatially uniform part, n0, which is the refractive index of the waveguide when no programming light is impinging on it, and a programmable part that is induced by electro-optic modulation, Δn(x, z), loosely corresponding to the programmable matrix weights W. After the optical field has propagated through the device, we measured its intensity, Iout(x) ∝ ∣E(x, z = L)∣2, at the output facet and binned it to produce the output vector, \({\bf{x}}_{l+1}\), for the machine learning task. Figure 2 shows how patterns of light program the refractive index modulation, Δn(x, z). First, the device converts the projected pattern of light into a spatially varying quasi-static electric field. Second, the electro-optic waveguide changes its refractive index Δn(x, z) in response to this electric field. Our device is an electro-optic waveguide coated by a photoconductive film and sandwiched between a pair of electrodes with an oscillating bias voltage applied across them. The lithium niobate waveguide locally changes its refractive index via the Pockels effect, owing to the spatially varying bias electric field. In our device, the largest refractive index modulation is approximately 10−3, limited by the geometry of the material stack and a safety margin to prevent dielectric breakdown (Supplementary Information section 1C). The refractive index modulation in our device can take on continuous values by continuously varying the intensity of the projected pattern. a, The 2D-programmable waveguide consists of a nanophotonic stack of four layers: a conductive silicon substrate that doubles as the ground electrode, a Z-cut lithium niobate (in red) slab waveguide with silicon dioxide cladding (in white), a photoconductive layer for optical control of the refractive index and a gold electrode. b,c, Electrical circuit models of the 2D-programmable waveguide in regions with (c) and without (b) illumination. There is a voltage division between the photoconductor and the slab waveguide, with impedances, Zpc and Zwg, respectively. e, Experimental realization of a Y-branch splitter on the 2D-programmable waveguide, which splits the input light into two equal output beams. The projected pattern (in green) directly corresponds to the induced refractive index modulation (in grey). We projected illumination patterns across a 9 mm × 1 mm area, achieving a pixel resolution of 9 μm × 9 μm. (Limits to the spatial resolution are discussed in Supplementary Information section 1C.) This configuration enabled us to control the refractive index distribution, n(x, z), with 10,000 degrees of freedom (see Supplementary Information section 3A for our calculation of the parameter count) and update the entire distribution at a rate of 3 Hz. To maximize the refractive index modulation, we set the amplitude of the oscillating bias voltage across the electrodes to be up to 1,000 V. Given that complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor electrode backplanes can only support spatially programmable voltages of around 10 V, our use of photoconductive gain was essential for achieving large electro-optic modulation. This approach allowed us to apply a large voltage to a single unpatterned electrode and realize controllable high voltages at virtual electrodes via the patterned illumination27,28. Owing to the large impedance of the device, less than 1 mW of electrical power was dissipated across its active area at the highest voltages. To illustrate the operating principle of our device, we projected a pattern in the shape of a Y-branch splitter onto the 2D-programmable waveguide (Fig. 2a). The refractive index modulation was approximately proportional to the projected pattern, Δn(x, z) ∝ I(x, z) (Fig. 2e), up to spatial smoothing and a weak nonlinearity owing to voltage division. We coupled a single input Gaussian beam into the device using a beam shaper and measured the intensity of the output light with a camera, as shown in Fig. 2e. Because we used an oscillating bias voltage to drive the device, the induced refractive index pattern also oscillated in time. Therefore, measurements of the output intensity (and of the optical inputs, if not continuous wave) must coincide with the driving voltage peaking. We discuss approaches to overcome this limitation and further details on the experimental set-up in Methods. We next applied the 2D-programmable waveguide to perform machine learning tasks: vowel classification29 and Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten-digit classification30. Both tasks are used as benchmarks in studies of similar on-chip optical neural networks, providing useful points of comparison3,6,20. The vowel classification dataset29 comprises formant frequencies extracted from audio recordings of spoken vowels by various speakers. The task was to predict which of the seven vowels is spoken, given a 12-dimensional input vector of formant frequencies. We divided the dataset into a training set and a test set, comprising 196 (75% of the dataset) and 63 (25%) samples, respectively. Figure 3 presents our experimental results on performing vowel classification with the 2D-programmable waveguide. For readout, we measured the intensity at the output facet with a camera and binned the camera pixels into seven different regions, with each region corresponding to a specific vowel. Thus, as shown in the simulated intensity distribution, ∣E(x, z)∣2, in Fig. 3b, the device learned to use complex multimode wave propagation to direct most power towards the region corresponding to the correct vowel. Further details on output decoding and the overall computational model of our optical neural network demonstrations are provided in Supplementary Information section 5A. a, Overview of the approach. The task involved predicting a spoken vowel, here ‘er', from a 12-dimensional input vector representing formant frequencies extracted from audio recordings. The 2D-programmable waveguide was trained to take in this input vector and output a seven-dimensional vector with a one-hot encoding format that indicates the predicted vowel. b, Left: the input vector was amplitude-encoded into 12 Gaussian spatial modes to produce the initial optical field distribution. Right: the experimentally measured output intensity was binned by calculating the total power within equally sized spatial bins to produce the seven-dimensional output vector. c, Illustration of physics-aware training, a hybrid in situ–in silico backpropagation algorithm, which we used to train the parameters of the 2D-programmable waveguide. d, Test accuracy as a function of epoch. e, Evolution of the trainable parameters (projected patterns) at different stages of training. The refractive index distribution to implement vowel classification was learned using physics-aware training31, a modified backpropagation algorithm (Fig. 3c). The hybrid in situ–in silico nature of the algorithm allows for efficient training even in the presence of both imperfect models and experimental noise (Supplementary Information section 3C). Initially, a purely physics-based model (using equation (1)) provided qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the experimental results. The remaining discrepancies were largely removed with data-driven refinements to the physics-based model (Supplementary Information section 4). Using physics-aware training, we trained the 2D-programmable waveguide for a total of 300 epochs, which took approximately 1 h on the experimental set-up (Fig. 3d). Figure 3e shows the evolution of the initially uniform illumination pattern into a complex pattern that resembles the refractive index distributions found in inverse-designed photonic devices. Figure 4 presents the experimental results on MNIST handwritten-digit classification. We divided the MNIST dataset in the standard manner into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. We downsampled each MNIST image to 7-by-7 pixels and then flattened it to a 49-dimensional input vector. a, We performed MNIST handwritten-digit classification with the 2D-programmable waveguide. Each image from the MNIST dataset was electronically downsampled and reshaped to a 49-dimensional vector. We trained the device to perform machine learning on this high-dimensional input vector with the same procedure as the vowel classification task (Fig. 3). b, The confusion matrix was derived from evaluations on the test dataset comprising 10,000 images. After ten epochs of training, the system achieved 86% accuracy on the test dataset. To train the refractive index distribution to perform MNIST classification, we followed the same procedure used for the vowel classification task (Fig. 3). The 2D-programmable waveguide processed the 49-dimensional input vector to produce a ten-dimensional output vector that corresponds to the ten possible digits (more details in Supplementary Information section 5C). 4b, the system achieved 86% accuracy on the test dataset after ten epochs of training, which took about 10 h on the experimental set-up. This falls 4% short of the 90% accuracy that a one-layer digital neural network achieves on this downsampled MNIST classification task, likely because of imperfect modelling and experimental drifts. Nevertheless, this result demonstrates that complex wave propagation in our device can be harnessed to perform computations comparable to that of a single-layer neural network with a 49 × 10 matrix of trainable parameters. We turn to a discussion of the theoretical size scaling of different on-chip photonic processors. Integrated photonics can be used to implement matrices of size N × N using circuits of width much wider than ~Nλ0 (N well-isolated waveguides, where λ0 is the free-space wavelength) and length greater than ~Nλ0/Δnprog (N π-phase shifters)32,33. Because the programmable refractive index Δnprog is often very small, this limits circuits to be either very long or operate on low-dimensional inputs. One might intuitively expect that the length Lz of 2D-programmable waveguides would also need to scale as ~Nλ0/Δnprog, just as it does for the aforementioned circuit approaches for universal linear transformations on chip32. In this section, we present the analytical and numerical results showing that, beyond the constant-factor improvement in spatial footprint by avoiding single-mode waveguides, 2D-programmable waveguides may offer a different size scaling. Our analytical argument, presented in detail in Supplementary Information section 8A,B, investigates the amount of phase shift necessary to optically implement a given unitary transformation of dimension N in a programmable multimode waveguide. (More precisely, for any given unitary, one can always find a generator with elements that have a root-mean-square (r.m.s.) This suggests an exciting possibility. High-dimensional optical matrix–vector multipliers based on interference may require much less propagation distance through phase shifters than commonly assumed. This property of unitary matrices has recently34 been exploited to show that in three-MZI meshes, the average length of phase shifters can scale as \(1/\sqrt{N}\), but universal MZI meshes by construction have a circuit depth that scales as N, independent of how short the individual phase-shifter elements are. However, in 2D-programmable waveguides, this insight can potentially lead to large practical benefits because the devices effectively consist entirely of phase shifters, with nothing else constraining the total system length. The intuitive core of the mathematical argument is that if one needed a full π-phase shift per phase shifter, the required device length would scale as Nλ0/Δnprog, but because the required phase shift goes as \(\pi /\sqrt{N}\), the total required length scales as \(N{\lambda }_{0}/(\sqrt{N}\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}})=\sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}}\). We analytically found a refractive index distribution, Δnprog(x, z), with a magnitude (or, equivalently, length) that scales only as \(\sqrt{N}\) (as measured by the r.m.s. Our construction is similar to the one presented by Larocque and Englund17 in that it couples the modes of a multimode waveguide but crucially differs by implementing parallel global couplings rather than a sequence of pairwise mode couplings, thereby achieving better scaling. Our analytical argument relies on strong approximations. We used coupled-mode theory under a rotating wave approximation to calculate the propagation of unidirectional scalar waves in a perturbed multimode waveguide. To validate our theory, we present the results from numerical simulations that make far fewer assumptions. We simulated unidirectional scalar waves in a perturbed multimode waveguide (Supplementary Information section 8D). Our analytical argument only shows that the r.m.s. of the refractive index distribution scales as \(\sim \sqrt{N}\). However, in practical devices, it is usually the maximum value of the refractive index change that is limited. Our simulations show that even with a strictly imposed maximum value of the programmable refractive index strength, unitaries can be implemented accurately over a propagation distance that scales as \(\sim \sqrt{N}\). We emphasize that our analytical argument permits completely general dense unitary matrices. This length scaling is surprising in part because fundamental geometric considerations in linear optical devices suggest that the length required to perform arbitrary operations on N modes is proportional to Nλ0 (refs. 35,36). Our theory, showing that \({L}_{z} \sim \sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{{\rm{prog}}}\) is sufficient to perform universal optical operations on N modes, implies a different length scaling but does not contradict the bound by Miller35 unless N is very large, often ≫1,000 using common values (Supplementary Information section 8D). Therefore, our result suggests that there is a large practical regime in which the better-than-linear length scaling can be exploited to create universal optical processors with modest programmability or short propagation distances. However, we note that the length-scaling argument does not directly apply to the device used in our experiments because our scaling result assumes guided modes in the x direction, whereas our experiments were performed in a slab waveguide wide enough that light was effectively unguided. It is nonetheless the case that one could, as far as we can tell without having explicitly performed these experiments, realize devices and experiments that satisfy the assumptions of the theory (see discussion in Supplementary Information section 8D). For example, we simulated a multimode waveguide with a modest width of 0.3 mm, length of 5 mm and a refractive index programmability no larger than Δnprog = 5 × 10−3 with 500-nm resolution, and showed that such a waveguide can realize a 200 × 200-dimensional unitary with high fidelity (Fig. A device measuring 1.5 mm in width and 11 mm in length, with the same programmable refractive index magnitude and resolution, should be able to realize arbitrary unitaries with dimensions as high as 1,000 × 1,000. a, We considered a weak refractive index profile Δnprog(x, z) embedded into a step-index multimode waveguide with profile nwg(x). As light propagated through the perturbed waveguide, its N eigenmodes interacted with each other, as described by the coupled-mode theory. b, Vectors \(\bf{a}\) are encoded in the modal amplitudes of the input electric field. Given a unitary matrix Utarget, we analytically determined the refractive index perturbation Δnprog(x, z) embedded in the step-index waveguide (Supplementary Information section 8B) or via in silico inverse design (Supplementary Information section 8C). We verified that after propagation through the multimode waveguide, the modal amplitudes transformed according to Urealized ≈ Utarget. The separation between unitaries realized with high versus low fidelity is well described by the line \({L}_{z}=\sqrt{N}{\lambda }_{0}/\Delta {n}_{\max }\). We introduced and demonstrated a 2D-programmable photonic processor comprising a lithium niobate slab waveguide with a refractive index distribution, n(x, z), that can be continuously programmed. The device design enables programming by parallel electro-optic modulation with approximately 10,000 degrees of freedom. We used our chip to perform neural network inference by training the refractive index distribution and consequently the multimode wave propagation through the chip. To train the device, we developed a physics-based model of the behaviour of the chip, along with a data-driven refinement, allowing the model to be sufficiently accurate that it supports backpropagation-based training31. The predominant approach to building integrated photonic neural networks is to fabricate large arrays of discrete components connected by single-mode waveguides10. In contrast, we adopted the conceptual approach of using wave propagation in distributed spatial modes15,16,17,18,19,23,37 and experimentally validated the theoretical predictions16,17,37 that this approach will be more space-efficient. Our prototype chip was able to perform neural network inference with input vectors of dimension up to 49, which is larger than the capability of the neural network photonic chips reported in previous studies3,6,8,9,20,38,39,40 and more space efficient than any of these chips based on networks of discrete components (see Supplementary Information section 6 for a detailed comparison). This large input dimension enabled us to use our chip to perform MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a single pass through the chip and without using any digital electronic parameters. One of the most promising applications of our approach is in reducing the energy cost of neural network inference, which remains (and is likely to remain) dominated by linear MVM. There exists a breakeven point beyond which optical devices could outperform electronic hardware on this metric, owing to the more favourable energy scaling with dimension N (optics: E ~ N; electronics: E ~ N2) (refs. 11,12,13,14). Reaching this regime requires high-dimensional operations. At low N, the overhead cost from analogue-to-digital conversion and optical–electronic transduction outweighs the benefits, with estimates placing the breakeven point around N = 1,000, far beyond what is currently possible on a single chip. We derived a theoretical scaling law (Supplementary Information section 8) describing how the dimension of possible MVMs in a 2D-programmable waveguide scales with the device dimensions and the refractive index change. Surprisingly, the device length only needs to scale as \(\sqrt{N}\), better than the most common approaches of designing photonic circuits32,33. This result may enable all-optical matrix–vector multipliers with a dimension exceeding the breakeven point of energy efficiency. The development of such devices would make hybrid neural network architectures, in which analogue optics performs the linear operations and electronic circuits implement the nonlinearities, energy-competitive, changing the energy scaling of neural network inference. To conclude, we believe that our device concept, with its ability to programmably control multimode wave propagation, may create new opportunities in the broader fields of optical computing and optical information processing10,14,41. Although our study has focused on machine learning, our device could also be used to solve integral equations42 and combinatorial optimization problems43. More broadly, our chip is essentially an arbitrary (passive) photonic device that can be reconfigured on demand. Any photonic device that can be specified as an inhomogeneous refractive index distribution can be realized. Such devices can even be learned directly and effectively by performing inverse design21 but in situ in real time. Our concept will potentially enable the development of reprogrammable photonic simulators supporting new studies of bound states in the continuum44 and topological photonics45 and applications in engineering. It may ultimately even be possible to make a device that combines programmable linear wave propagation (this study), programmable nonlinear wave propagation15,18,46,47 (a natural extension of this study to having programmable χ(2)(x, z) (ref. 48)) and programmable gain/loss (demonstrated in ref. 20), giving rise to a reconfigurable on-chip platform capable of realizing almost every functionality we have in free-space optics. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 1, we started our fabrication processes from a thin-film lithium niobate wafer purchased from NANOLN. It was a p-type silicon wafer with a substrate conductivity of 0.01–0.05 Ω cm, 2 μm of silicon dioxide deposited via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and 700 nm of Z-cut MgO-doped lithium niobate that was wafer-bonded with the ion-cut technique. We diced small pieces from the wafer using a DISCO Dicing Saw for further processing. We deposited an additional 1 μm of silicon dioxide via PECVD as a cladding, followed by another deposition of 4 μm of silicon-rich silicon nitride, which was the photoconductive layer, via PECVD. We alternated pulses of high-frequency and low-frequency power during deposition to minimize film stress using 160-W low-frequency pulses for 12 s and 200-W high-frequency pulses for 8 s. Next, we evaporated electrodes onto the chip using a CVC SC4500 E-gun Evaporation System. We first evaporated 10 nm of titanium as an adhesion layer and then 5 nm of gold. The tape acted as a mask, preventing deposition closer than around 1 mm to the edges, thereby increasing the path length between the top electrode and substrate through air. To minimize coupling losses into the waveguide, we used an Allied MultiPrep Polisher to polish the waveguide facets. We polished using silicon carbide paper of successively finer grain size, starting at 3 μm and then moving to 1 μm and 0.5 μm. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, we used the transverse magnetic mode of the slab waveguide, with an optical electric field that is also oriented in the y direction. The thickness of the lithium niobate layer was chosen for single-mode operation (Supplementary Information section 1A). To maximize the refractive index modulation, it is beneficial to have a thicker photoconductor and a thinner silicon dioxide cladding (Supplementary Information section 1B). The silicon dioxide cladding was chosen to be sufficiently thick to ensure low propagation loss. Thus, we balanced these tradeoffs to arrive at the device geometry shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. The device has a propagation loss of <1 dB cm−1 at a wavelength of 1,550 nm (Supplementary Information section 1E). To maximize the refractive index contrast of the slab waveguide between the bright (illuminated) and dark regions, it is important to design the photoconductor to have high dark resistance and low bright resistance. We characterized the refractive index modulation as a function of the intensity of the projected pattern with an off-axis holography set-up (Supplementary Information section 1C). The maximum refractive index modulation that we achieved in this study was approximately 10−3. We show in Supplementary Fig. 3 that this can be increased to beyond 4 × 10−3 by using a photoconductor layer that is twice as thick (8 μm) and by further optimizing the photoconductive properties. In Supplementary Information section 7B, we also discuss how the refractive index modulation can be further increased by switching to a different material for the waveguide core. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, the experimental set-up can be roughly divided into five units: (1) an optical beam shaper to create spatially varying 1D electric field inputs for the 2D-programmable waveguide; (2) a projector to create a programmable illumination pattern that controls the refractive index distribution inside the waveguide; (3) a butt-coupling set-up to couple light in and out of the 2D-programmable waveguide; (4) a high-voltage source to apply an oscillating bias voltage across the electrodes of the 2D-programmable waveguide; and (5) a camera to measure the intensity of the output beam. We note that the experimental set-up relies on more free-space optical components than usual for an integrated photonics experiment. This is a direct consequence of our decision to keep the fabrication of the device simple, without lithographically defined structures for this initial proof-of-concept demonstration. We envision that a more compact, fully integrated version of the 2D-programmable waveguide could be built by integrating on-chip lithium niobate modulators and detectors and a micro-light-emitting-diode display (Supplementary Information section 7D). In this section, we provide an overview of the key components and functionalities of the experimental set-up. For a more detailed description, including photographs of the optical set-up and specifics on the components, such as part numbers and manufacturers, see Supplementary Information section 2. The free-space beam shaper allows for the realization of arbitrary input optical fields E(x, z = 0) up to a spatial resolution of 2 μm and over a distance of 600 μm. In this experiment, we used the beam shaper to create both simple input fields, such as a single Gaussian beam for the Y-branch splitter demonstration, and more complex input fields for the machine learning demonstrations. This flexibility also enabled us to freely vary the encoding of input vectors into the optical field. For instance, we varied the width of the input modes and adjusted their spacing, which was tailored to each machine learning task. Finally, because the beam shaper is capable of shaping both the amplitude and phase of the input field, it was also used to calibrate the 2D-programmable waveguide (Supplementary Information section 4B). The design of the beam shaper that we built closely follows that of a previous study49, which also programmably shapes the input light coupled into slab waveguides. The core working principle of the beam shaper is to create spatially varying phase gratings on a 2D-phase spatial light modulator50 (SLM; Meadowlark Optics UHSP1K-850-1650-PC8). We varied the amplitude and relative positions of these phase gratings to control the input optical field E(x, z = 0). A lens after the SLM performed a Fourier transform that separated the diffraction maxima of the phase gratings, and a spatial filter selected the first-order diffraction maximum. Finally, an optical relay system (comprising lenses 2 and 3, as shown in Extended Data Fig. The projector set-up was designed to create a high-resolution programmable illumination pattern over a large field of view. We used a digital micromirror device (DMD; Vialux V-7000) with a resolution of 1,024 × 768 pixels and a pixel pitch of 13.7 μm. The DMD was illuminated with green light (525 nm) from an LED. The focal length of the tube lenses was chosen to demagnify the image of the DMD by a factor of 1.5, resulting in a projected pattern on the surface of the 2D-programmable waveguide with dimensions of 9.1 mm × 6.8 mm, with each individual pixel of the projected pattern measuring 9 μm × 9 μm. Because the complex wave propagation spans a distance of 1 mm in the x direction, in practice, we used only a 9.1 mm × 1 mm region of the projected pattern to control the wave propagation in the 2D-programmable waveguide. Finally, although the DMD provides only binary modulation, we achieved continuous refractive index modulation by applying pulse-width modulation to the illumination pattern. This is feasible because the DMD can be switched on and off at a rate of 20 kHz, much faster than the resistance–capacitance time constant of the device, which is about 10 Hz. To maximize the electro-optic effect in lithium niobate, we used high voltages of about 1 kV. We created sinusoidal voltages with an arbitrary function generator and amplified the voltage with a Trek 2220 high-voltage amplifier, which has a voltage gain of 200× and is capable of outputting voltages of up to 2 kV. We electrically contacted the device using high-voltage-rated probe arms with BeCu probe tips; one probe tip was put in contact with the gold electrode on top of the device, whereas a grounded probe tip touched the silicon substrate (Supplementary Fig. We used an a.c. frequency of 10 Hz for the experiments shown in Fig. 2 and 26 Hz for the experiments shown in Figs. Future modifications can enable d.c. operation, such as using an alternative cladding material that is more conductive or by increasing the dark resistivity of the photoconductor (Supplementary Information section 1B). To measure the output of the computation performed by our device, we imaged the output facet of the device with an infrared camera (Allied Vision Goldeye CL-033). We built a 4f relay with a magnification factor of 5.3, allowing us to image the intensity distribution at the output facet, Icamera(x, y), with a resolution of 2.8 μm per pixel and a field of view of 1.7 mm in the x direction. We defined a small range of y to be the region of interest and integrated the intensity over this range to obtain the 1D intensity output of the 2D-programmable waveguide: \({I}_{{\rm{out}}}(x)=| E(x,z=L){| }^{2}=\mathop{\int}\nolimits_{{y}_{\min }}^{{y}_{\max }}{I}_{{\rm{camera}}}(x,y){\rm{d}}y\). We used an exposure time on the order of 500 μs, chosen to be much shorter than the period of the a.c. voltage, which was approximately 40 ms.

Devices were fabricated from thin-film lithium niobate on insulator wafers consisting of a heavily doped p-type silicon substrate with a resistivity of 0.01 to 0.05Ω ⋅ cm, a 2 μm PECVD silicon dioxide layer, and 700 nm Z-cut MgO-doped lithium niobate bonded by ion-cutting. After dicing, we deposited 1 μm of SiO2 cladding and 4 μm of silicon-rich SiN (photoconductive layer) by PECVD with alternating plasma pulses to minimize stress. Electrodes were formed by evaporating 10 nm Ti and 5 nm Au, with tape masking to prevent breakdown at chip edges. Waveguide facets were polished using progressively finer abrasives to reduce coupling loss. The setup consists of five key units: (1) a beamshaper to generate spatially varying one-dimensional optical inputs to the 2D-programmable waveguide, (2) a digital micromirror projector to impose a programmable illumination pattern controlling the refractive-index distribution, (3) butt-coupling optics to couple light in and out of the device, (4) (not shown) a high-voltage source applying oscillating fields across the electrode and conductive silicon wafer, and (5) an infrared camera to record the output intensity profile. The beamshaper provides full amplitude and phase control of input fields, while the projector enables spatial refractive-index modulation with continuous pixel-values via pulse-width modulation.

While plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are poor antigen-presenting cells at steady state, myeloid DCs (mDCs), which include DC1s, DC2s and DC3s, are specialized in T cell priming. To generate unbiased human DC atlases, we integrated DCs from 13 tumor tissues across 40 datasets to create a pDC + mDC-VERSE (DC-VERSE) and an mDC-VERSE single-cell RNA-sequencing compendium. We characterized DC subsets and ‘states' across these tissues. Most studied tumors contained CD207+ DCs, a subset of CD1c+ DCs, whose expansion inversely correlated with tumor CD8+ resident memory T cells, T cell clonality and the survival of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Similarly to CCR7+ mDCs (a common state of DC1s, DC2s and DC3s), we found that CD207+ DCs were a common state of DC2s and DC3s. Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic and immunohistofluorescence analyses of human carcinomas demonstrated that lymphocytes and most DCs were enriched within the tumor stroma, while CD207+ DCs were mostly embedded within tumor nests. These DC-VERSEs provide a robust resource available to the scientific community on DCs in health and pathology.

Synthesizing perceivable artificial neural inputs independent of typical sensory channels remains a fundamental challenge in developing next-generation brain−machine interfaces. Establishing a minimally invasive, wirelessly effective and miniaturized platform with long-term stability is crucial for creating research methods and clinically meaningful biointerfaces capable of mediating artificial perceptual feedback. Here we demonstrate a miniaturized, fully implantable transcranial optogenetic neural stimulator designed to generate artificial perceptions by patterning large cortical ensembles wirelessly in real time. Experimentally validated numerical simulations characterized light and heat propagation, whereas neuronal responses were assessed by in vivo electrophysiology and molecular methods. Cue discrimination during operant learning demonstrated the wireless genesis of artificial percepts sensed by mice, where spatial distance across large cortical networks and sequential order-based analyses of discrimination predicted performance. These conceptual and technical advances expand understanding of artificially patterned neural activity and its perception by the brain to guide the evolution of next-generation all-optical brain−machine communication.

Electrocorticography uses non-penetrating electrodes embedded in flexible substrates to record electrical activity from the surface of the brain. To use the technology to develop minimally invasive, high-bandwidth brain–computer interfaces, it will be necessary to improve the number of recording channels and the scalability of devices, which could be achieved by merging electrodes and electronics onto a single substrate. Here we report a 50-μm-thick, mechanically flexible micro-electrocorticography brain–computer interface that integrates a 256 × 256 array of electrodes, signal processing, data telemetry and wireless powering on a single complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor substrate. The device contains 65,536 recording electrodes, from which we can simultaneously record a selectable subset of up to 1,024 channels at a given time. Our chip is wirelessly powered, and when implanted below the dura, it can communicate bidirectionally with an external relay station outside the body. We show that the device can provide chronic, reliable recordings for up to two weeks in pigs and up to two months in behaving non-human primates from the somatosensory, motor and visual cortices, decoding brain signals at high spatiotemporal resolution.

(a) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of titanium nitride electrode. (b) Frequency response across different gain configurations from a representative 16×16 recording. Note that gain is programmed through a single back-end amplifier that is shared by all pixels. Error bars indicate standard error (SE), and dashed rectangle marks the effects of boxcar sampling (flat band gains: 53.7 ± 0.20 dB, 57.2 ± 0.21 dB, 60.7 ± 0.20 dB, 64.2 ± 0.19 dB, values: mean ± SD. (c) Histogram of normalized channel gain variation for each recording mode (16×16 mode: 100 ± 5.1%, 32×32 mode: 100 ± 4.8%, values: mean ± SD. (d) Frequency response across different high-pass (HP) filter configurations from a representative 16×16 recording. (e) Input-referred noise (IRN) spectrum averaged over representative pixels (n = 10) for each recording mode. (f) Histogram of channel IRN for each recording mode, integrated from 10 Hz to 4 kHz (16×16 mode: 7.68 ± 3.11 μVRMS, 32×32 mode: 16.51 ± 6.85 μVRMS, values: mean ± SD. (a) We presented static colored natural images, while the monkey maintained fixation (120 ms presentation time per image, 15 images per trial, 1200 ms inter-trial period). Each image (10°×10°) was centered 3° to the right and below the fixation spot. (b) Model architecture: Pre-processed stimuli (184 × 184 pixels) and neuronal responses were used to train a neural predictive model, which takes images as an input and outputs an estimate of the underlying neuronal activity. We passed the images through a ConvNext model, pre-trained on an image classification task to obtain image embeddings, that is a shared feature space. We then computed the neuronal responses by passing the feature activations through a transformer-based readout followed by a non-linearity stage. (c) Explainable variance, a measure of response reliability to natural images, plotted against the model's predictive performance (correlation between prediction and average neural response to repeated presentations) of all 144 channels (explainable variance 0.24 ± 0.09, and correlation to average 0.69 ± 0.14. values: mean ± SD). Only channels with an explainable variance greater than or equal to 0.1 are included in these analyses. (d) Spatial map of explainable variance across the recording array (same layout as in Fig. (e) Same as (d), but showing the model's predictive performance (correlation to average neural response). (f) Schematic illustrating optimization of maximally exciting images (MEIs). A random starting image was iteratively optimized to elicit maximal activity for each in-silico channel, revealing the visual features to which that channel is selective. Three example MEIs from areas V1, V2, and V4 are shown. (g) MEIs for all 144 channels across the array which reliably responded to repeated image presentations. MEIs in area V1 are characterized by oriented Gabor filters, while the channels overlying area V2 and V4 exhibit more complex, color opponent feature tuning.

Dot-triggered-average responses of all channels after wavelet transformation (central frequency 64 Hz). Dot-triggered-average responses of all channels after wavelet transformation (central frequency 128 Hz). Dot-triggered travelling waves used for decoding stimuli location. The travelling waves are computed from the γ-band (30–90 Hz) signals recorded from 32 × 32 spatially dense channels at a pitch of 26.5 μm × 29 μm. The spatiotemporal sequence of these travelling waves, measured within each dot presentation, is used to predict the current location of the dot stimuli presented to the subject.
