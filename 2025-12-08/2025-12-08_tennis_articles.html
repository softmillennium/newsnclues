                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul ended his 2025 season in New York. “I don't usually start playing practice matches or points until about two weeks before I leave for Australia. This year with Garden Cup, I've started playing two weeks ago! “I don't usually start playing practice matches or points until about two weeks before I leave for Australia. This year with Garden Cup, I've started playing two weeks ago! This year with Garden Cup, I've started playing two weeks ago! “I've been super fired up about it,” Paul told me over the phone, driving back from practice. This year with Garden Cup, I've started playing two weeks ago! Where fellow players have carved out lengthy trips to the Maldives, Paul has stayed close to home, taking in the South Florida sun and allowing only a few days in the Bahamas for a proper vacation.“Hey, my life is a vacation, you know?” Paul said with a laugh. “Between training and fishing, I don't need too much.”Beneath the easygoing attitude, Paul burns with purpose, aiming to pick up where he left off from a stellar six-month stretch. He reached back-to-back Grand Slam quarterfinals and earn his Top 10 debut, but was at Roland Garros when Paul heard a pop in his foot. Though he played through it to earn a career-high ranking of No. 8, he competed in just four more tournaments before shutting down his season in Flushing Meadows.Refusing to give into disappointment or FOMO, the 28-year-old followed his friends' results on social media and quietly transitioned from recovery to heavy training—aiming to build muscle and cardio strength for next season and beyond. “Between training and fishing, I don't need too much.”Beneath the easygoing attitude, Paul burns with purpose, aiming to pick up where he left off from a stellar six-month stretch.

You push the boundaries that much more, and push yourself that much harder...I'm excited for those things, where you get to a ball in a match you probably wouldn't get to in practice...In everything I do, I just love competing and it's the whole reason why I started playing the sport. “Earlier in my career, I felt like I was struggling with injuries a little bit,” reflected Paul, who still managed a third straight Top 20 finish despite missing the fall swing. So, I looked at this as an opportunity to get a little extra rest and gear up for the second half of my career. I'm more excited to get back into playing than ever. It's been motivational.”Fueled by his favorite CELSIUS energy drink, Paul has been feeling Peach Vibes in more ways than one this fall.“We as tennis players always complain that the season is too long and the tour should stop after the Open, and that's pretty much what I did. Let me tell you, it's not that bad!” he joked.“Most other sports do a really good job of giving their athletes time to build muscle and prepare for a grueling season. I feel like I've been able to get a good routine going, and I want to be able to go into Australia and feel good about everything throughout the entire year.” So, I looked at this as an opportunity to get a little extra rest and gear up for the second half of my career.

He entered the Brisbane International in addition to his usual Adelaide appearance, setting up a full calendar before arriving in Melbourne for the Australian Open.“For me, it's not really the travel out there as much as competing,” Paul explained. I'm jealous of all the people competing more than anything else.”Throughout an intense pre-season, Paul is still making time to get into the holiday spirit—putting up Christmas trees for himself and fiancée Paige Lorenze and planning an annual watch of 1983's A Christmas Story—but has largely left the wedding plans to his better half.

She has the best taste for that kind of stuff. I think it's going to be an absolutely amazing wedding, I'm so excited.”But first, Paul will head back to New York to celebrate a different union, one that promises to reconnect him with his competitive fire.“You can play matches in practice and say that you're pushing yourself hard, but there's nothing that pushes you the way playing a real match does,” Paul told me, his car coming to a stop. I'm excited for those things, where you get to a ball in a match you probably wouldn't get to in practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A host of top stars gave a little insight into several of their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivals by taking on our ‘Naughty or Nice' cake game. Eight players, including Top 10 stars Felix Auger-Aliassime, Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton, placed photos on ‘naughty' donuts or ‘nice' donuts to reflect their own judgements on rivals including ATP No. 1 Club members Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic. So did our participants turn harshly on their on-court foes, or does the ATP Tour locker room remain a place of camaraderie and harmony? Watch the video below to find out, but let's just say that several judges seemed to have their own unique definitions of both ‘naughty' and ‘nice'. Watch Tennis Players Place Each Other On The 'Naughty Or Nice' Cake: Gabriel Diallo's decision was swayed by the Spanish star's tattoos, while Auger-Aliassime declared Alcaraz ‘nice' due to him having an almost constant smile on his face. When it came to judging Djokovic, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina played it safe: “I don't want any trouble with him”, laughed the Spaniard, perhaps in fear of some future on-court retribution from the 101-time tour-level champion. “He did 20 underarm serves against me in two matches,” said the Frenchman of Bublik.
