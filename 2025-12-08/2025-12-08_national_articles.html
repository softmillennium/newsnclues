We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? On Sunday night, President Donald Trump took to the stage in Washington, DC to host the annual Kennedy Center Honors. Presidents traditionally attend the awards, although Trump declined to do so in his first term. Kimmel has never hosted the Kennedy Center Honors, although he appeared onstage in 2014 as part of a tribute to David Letterman. Kimmel has, however, hosted the Oscars, and Trump appears to have decided that the Kennedy Center Honors are his equivalent. More importantly, Kimmel has been a vocal Trump critic, and Trump, in his turn, has been vocal in his hatred of Kimmel. In September, their feud climaxed when Kimmel was briefly suspended from his ABC talk show, in an apparent bid for Trump's favor by Disney-ABC, after the comedian falsely suggested that Charlie Kirk's assassin was associated with MAGA. (In fairness to Trump, his line “many of you are miserable, horrible people,” delivered directly to the audience in apparent earnest, was genuinely quite funny.) The power of sitting in the Oval Office, now redesigned to his liking as he reshapes the White House and flirts with declaring foreign wars, is not quite enough for Trump. He also has to be a good TV star. It is this clumsy muscling for approval, in many ways, that characterizes this phase of MAGA: the sense that since the right cannot naturally command the cultural cachet that the left has won, they will have to take it for themselves, with political might or with cold hard cash. Right-wing social media networks have never gone mainstream among elite audiences the way Twitter did at its peak, so instead of building a new one, Musk simply bought it. Then he remade it as a place where racial slurs are acceptable, but use of the word “cis” is grounds for banning. Kimmel's brief ousting shows another version of this strategy. As the conservative essayist Tanner Greer explained to Vox's Zack Beauchamp in September, right-wing figures thought Kimmel's false claims about Kirk's assassin were just as offensive as an anti-Black Lives Matter statement would have been during the George Floyd protests of 2020. They also knew they didn't have the public support it would take to create an outcry against Kimmel from the ground up. What they had, instead, was the president. “They remember 2020, and they feel like if Jimmy Kimmel had gone against Black Lives Matter, he would've been taken off the air without the state,” Greer told Vox. “And we don't have that same activist network [as the left], but we do have the state. And so we should try to create the same sort of structural cultural change that was imposed upon us in the Great Awokening.” After spending a decade decrying the left as a bunch of social media bullies ruling by public shaming and cancellation, the right is attempting to match the left's cultural power through the objectively much harsher mechanisms of threatening heavy fines and jail time. It takes fervent supporters to win over every branch of government, as the right has. Trump's core supporters are famously committed, and he won the popular vote in 2024. Their movement has real adherents, and it has made real inroads among the edgy-hip hugely popular outsiders of popular culture, where the Joe Rogans and the Theo Vons live. But they still don't have the thing Trump craves most of all, which is mainstream, middle-of-the-culture approval. Trump was a TV star, but he was never popular enough to get a job hosting the Oscars: too weird, too mean and racist, too liable to go off script and say something that made bad headlines. So instead he became president, fired the board of the government's central cultural institution, and installed himself as head and de facto host instead. The ultimate college experience is social and Southern. The world is aging out of killing one another. From Trader Joe's totes to Starbucks Bearista cups, low-end items carry more meaning in the affordability era.</p>

Club for Growth president David McIntosh says deep-pocketed conservative political group ‘will be there to back up' President Donald Trump's push for red states to redraw congressional maps to create more GOP-leaning districts. President Donald Trump and allied groups are turning up the heat on Indiana Republican state senators who are resisting the president's push for the red state to pass congressional redistricting. The Indiana Senate reconvened on Monday, three days after the state House approved a new map championed by Trump that would create two more right-leaning congressional districts in the solidly red Midwestern state, where the GOP currently controls seven of Indiana's nine U.S. House seats. The action in Indiana comes after the Supreme Court last week cleared the way for GOP-dominated Texas to use its newly redrawn map, which creates five more right-leaning House seats. And it marks the latest front in Trump's aggressive national campaign to reshape congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when Republicans will likely face traditional political headwinds as they defend their razor-thin House majority. The GOP-controlled Indiana House, meeting in the Statehouse — seen in a file photo from 2017 — on Friday passed along party lines a congressional redistricting plan pushed by President Donald Trump. Indiana Senate Republican leader Rodric Bray has repeatedly said there wasn't enough support in the chamber to move forward with redistricting. The state Senate split 19-19 last month in a proxy vote. Soon, he will have a Primary Problem, as will any other politician who supports him in this stupidity," Trump warned in a recent social media post. Bray, in announcing that the state Senate would reconvene to take action on redistricting, said "the issue of redrawing Indiana's congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state." A final vote by the state Senate is likely on Thursday. President Donald Trump, seen pointing at the White House on Oct. 10, 2025, is targeting Indiana Republican lawmakers who are not supportive of his congressional redistricting push. Trump has been twisting elbows in his attempt to make Indiana the latest Republican-controlled state to change their congressional maps. The president has called state lawmakers and Vice President JD Vance visited the state twice earlier this autumn to discuss redistricting. "Why would a REAL Republican vote against this when the Dems have been doing it for years??? If they stupidly say no, vote them out of office — They are not worthy — And I will be there to help! And in a separate post, Trump highlighted nine state Senate Republicans who have yet to announce their position on the new map, saying they "need encouragement to make the right decision." While Trump recently called Braun "a good man," he has warned he "must produce on this, or he will be the only Governor, Republican or Democrat, who didn't." But Braun, pointing to the president, has touted that he is "committed to standing with him on the critical issue of passing fair maps in Indiana to ensure the MAGA agenda is successful in Congress." Mike Braun, seen speaking during a press conference on Oct. 30, 2025, supports President Donald Trump's push for congressional redistricting. Meanwhile, the Trump-aligned conservative outside political group the Club for Growth Action and other groups have dished out big bucks to run ads in Indiana supporting redistricting, and along with Turning Point Action, will target Republican state lawmakers opposed to the new map. Club for Growth President David McIntosh sent out a "FINAL WARNING" to Bray, warning that "failure to get this done means you and any other opposition will be defeated and removed from office in your next election." And Turning Point Action on Friday held a rally at the state Capitol, where Braun spoke, to put pressure on Indiana Senate Republicans to support redistricting. Trump, by championing rare but not unheard of mid-decade redistricting, is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Texas, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. State lawmakers in GOP-dominated Florida this week took the first steps towards passing a redistricting measure, and right-leaning Kansas is also mulling redrawing its map. Two federal judges in Texas last month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state couldn't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. But the Supreme Court on Thursday gave a big thumbs up to the Lone Star State's new congressional map. That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which would counter the passage earlier this year in Texas of a new map that aims to create up to five right-leaning House seats. Gavin Newsom speaks during an election night press conference at a California Democratic Party office Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025, in Sacramento. Gavin Newsom, who is considered a likely 2028 Democratic presidential contender, steered his state's push for redistricting. Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting. And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge last month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? If you've followed the Supreme Court's recent presidential power cases, you know there's no mystery surrounding the Court's eventual decision in Trump v. Slaughter, a case asking if President Donald Trump may fire several high-ranking federal officials who are protected from being terminated by federal law. All six members of the Court's Republican majority are devout acolytes of the “unitary executive,” a legal theory that claims the president may fire nearly anyone who leads a federal agency. Though the justices heard oral argument in the Slaughter case on Monday morning, that argument is largely political theater preceding the Court's inevitable decision that Slaughter may be fired permanently. While on its face the Slaughter case is a case about presidential power, a few key justices signaled that they are comfortable giving Trump the power he seeks in this case because the Court will itself remain a check on the president. Under this new vision, Congress's power to create “independent” agencies that enjoy some insulation from the president must yield to a more powerful executive. And the executive's authority over these agencies must, in turn, yield to a more powerful Supreme Court. Ninety years ago, in Humphrey's Executor v. United States (1935), the Supreme Court held that Congress may sometimes create federal agencies, led by multimember boards, that act with a degree of autonomy from the president. By law, FTC commissioners may only be fired “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” The “unitary executive” theory, meanwhile, claims that Humphrey's Executor was wrongly decided. And thus Trump must have the power to fire any agency leader who wields power that is “executive” in nature. Monday's oral argument in Slaughter left little doubt that all six of the Court's Republicans — all of whom have signed onto decisions embracing this unitary executive theory in the past — share Scalia's view of the Constitution. Chief Justice John Roberts even referred to Humphrey's Executor as a “dried husk.” The Court's GOP majority really hates that nine-decade-old decision. While it's not entirely clear what those words mean, Justice Brett Kavanaugh apparently takes them very seriously. During the argument, he told Solicitor General John Sauer that he has “concerns” about giving Trump full control over the Fed. So, if the president could fire Fed governors, he could pressure them to boost the economy during an election year, giving the president a temporary political advantage with consequences that may not be felt until after the president leaves office. Similarly, Justice Samuel Alito asked about so called “Article I courts,” such as the US Tax Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which adjudicate cases just like any other judicial body, but that are technically not part of the judicial branch (which is created by Article III of the Constitution). In a related vein, Roberts asked whether a hypothetical agency that spends most of its time adjudicating individual cases, but that occasionally wields “executive” power, must be fully controlled by the president. Recall that this theory derives from a line in the Constitution giving all “executive power” to the president. There is considerable evidence, however, that the framers did not have a firm grasp on what powers are “executive” in nature when they wrote the Constitution. The Republican justices have held, for example, that the power to prosecute crimes is a “quintessentially executive function.” But, in the early United States, federal prosecutions were often led by private attorneys or by lawyers appointed by judges. So even if you accept the premise of the unitary executive — that Trump must have full control over all officials who do “executive” things — no one really knows what sort of government functions qualify as “executive.” This might seem like a difficult problem for the Court's unitary executive stans to overcome, but several of the Republican justices offered a simple solution to this problem: They can just rule however they want in Slaughter, because if another case comes up in the future where they want to limit the president's power, they can just rule differently in that case. At one point, he asked Sauer to suggest language that the Court could insert into its Slaughter opinion that would leave harder questions arising under the unitary executive unresolved. Of course, as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, kicking the can down the road in this way can't work forever. So long as Trump is president, this shift in power may not matter. Both Justice Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, however, floated a separate solution to this problem: If a future president ever does something the justices don't like, the justices can just veto it. For what it is worth, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh seemed to disagree slightly about how they should exercise this veto. Gorsuch wants to revive something called the Nondelegation Doctrine, which the Court briefly used in 1935 to veto two laws giving broad power to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, before abandoning Nondelegation for the next nine decades. Kavanaugh, meanwhile, would rely on the “major questions doctrine,” a legal doctrine that permits the justices to veto any presidential decision they decide is too consequential. This major questions doctrine is brand new and has only ever been used against one president: Joe Biden. They would give the president full control over who leads federal agencies, but also give themselves a veto power over anything the president does with those agencies. Trump will almost certainly win the power to fire Slaughter. So long as Trump is president, this shift in power may not matter. The Republican justices have largely acted as rubber stamps for nearly anything Trump wants to do. You can now place bets on elections, wars, and deportations. According to Trump's new national security strategy, America is done with “democracy promotion”… except in Europe. The Court's Texas decision is a victory for Republicans, and it is a terrible blow to all gerrymandering plaintiffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alina Habba, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, resigned Monday as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, following an appeals court ruling finding that she was serving in her position unlawfully. Habba, a staunch defender of Trump as his attorney and on the campaign trail, said she will step down to protect “the stability and integrity of the office which I love.” “But do not mistake compliance for surrender,” she wrote in a statement shared on X. It isn't clear who will lead the US attorney's office following her resignation. CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. In a statement shared on X soon after Habba's announcement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will seek further review of the ruling deeming Habba's appointment unlawful and that she will return to the position if it's reversed. Habba's announcement comes one week after a a panel of appellate judges from the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals found the Trump administration violated the law when it used of a series of maneuvers to install her in the position after failing to win Senate support. On Sunday, Habba told CNN at the Kennedy Center Honors that the office would be “making an announcement soon.” “I think, obviously, it's a big problem what we have going on. Habba was the first of Trump's US attorney appointments to face a legal court challenge, but since then three other US attorneys were found to be serving unlawfully. The maneuver of tapping a series of acting US attorneys, judges have said, would allow a presidential appointee to serve without Senate confirmation indefinitely. Judges across the country have made similar rulings, including against Lindsey Halligan, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who brought the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The US attorneys serving Nevada and the Central District of California were also found to be serving illegally. Habba is the first to resign her position. The court rulings have left some prosecutors unsure of how to move forward in cases.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Congress is moving to limit the Pentagon's ability to pull forces out of Europe and South Korea, easing concerns among allied governments. The 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, finalized by House and Senate negotiators and released Sunday evening, keeps force presence at roughly its current levels in both regions. It states that the U.S. cannot reduce its forces in Europe below 76,000 without submitting an assessment and certifying to Congress that such a move would not harm U.S. or NATO security interests. The bill places restraints on reductions below 28,500 in South Korea. Any drawdown would require the Pentagon to assure Congress that deterrence against North Korea would not be weakened, confirm that allies were consulted, and provide both a national security justification and an assessment of regional impact. The bill places restraints on reductions below 28,500 in South Korea. These limits follow reports that the Pentagon had considered reducing forces in Europe and South Korea and even relinquishing the SACEUR position. Whether those ideas reflected genuine planning or were intended as pressure on allies to invest more in their own defenses, U.S. leaders have recently signaled they are stepping back from such moves even without congressional restrictions. During a meeting last week with U.S. national security officials and European leaders, American officials told their counterparts that Europe must be prepared to bear the brunt of NATO's defense responsibilities by 2027, three European officials familiar with the meeting told Fox News Digital. The U.S. plans to hold onto the SACEUR position but will offer some other senior NATO military posts to European nations, officials said. They also noted that Washington has no near-term plans for major troop reductions in Europe. We are committed to working through NATO coordination mechanisms to strengthen the alliance and ensure its long-term viability as European allies increasing take on responsibility for conventional deterrence and defense in Europe," Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said in response. It states that the U.S. cannot reduce its forces in Europe below 76,000 without submitting an assessment and certifying to Congress that such a move would not harm U.S. or NATO security interests. Earlier this year, the Army pulled a rotating brigade stationed largely in Romania back to the United States, prompting European allies to question whether that move might signal the beginning of broader U.S. force drawdowns on NATO's eastern flank. The bill authorizes $400 million for Ukranian security next year. The bill also includes $400 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative over two years and an amendment specifying when the Pentagon may reclaim equipment purchased for Ukraine but not yet delivered: only when the equipment is urgently needed for an ongoing or imminent U.S. contingency operation and failing to use it would risk loss of life or critical mission failure. This provision follows the Pentagon's decision earlier this year to pause delivery of certain U.S.-funded military equipment to Ukraine. Over the weekend, War Secretary Pete Hegseth described South Korea and several European nations as "model allies." "Model allies that step up, like Israel, South Korea, Poland, increasingly Germany, the Baltics and others, will receive our special favor," he said at the Reagan National Defense Forum. "Allies that still fail to do their part for collective defense will face consequences." This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

BRUSSELS (AP) — A top European Union official on Monday warned the United States against interfering in Europe's affairs and said only European citizens can decide which parties should govern them. European Council President António Costa's remarks came in reaction to the Trump administration's new national security strategy, which was published on Friday and paints European allies as weak, while offering tacit support to far-right political parties. The document, which was praised by Russia, formalizes in writing months of Trump administration criticism of EU policy and perceived restrictions on free speech that started with a lecture to European allies in Germany in February by U.S. Vice President JD Vance. It's “good” that the strategy depicts European countries as an ally, but “allies don't threaten to interfere in the domestic political choices of their allies,” Costa said. “What we can't accept is the threat of interference in European political life. Fabian Zuleeg, chief executive at the European Policy Centre think tank, said that stridently nationalist parties in Europe will be emboldened by the strategy document and “will intensify efforts to hollow out the EU from within.” “Pro-European liberal forces need to finally wake up: Trump's America is not an ally, but an adversary to Europe's freedoms and fundamental values. The strategy was also critical of European free speech and migration policy. U.S. allies in Europe face the “prospect of civilizational erasure,” the document said, raising doubts about their long-term reliability as American partners. We view accusations regarding this more as ideology than strategy.” It breaks starkly from the course set by U.S. President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which sought to reinvigorate Washington's alliances. It comes as the U.S. seeks an end to Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine, a goal that the national security strategy says is in Washington's vital interests. But the text makes clear that the U.S. wants to improve its relationship with Russia after years of Moscow being treated as a global pariah, and ending the war is a core U.S. interest to “reestablish strategic stability with Russia.” “The objective in this strategy is not a fair and durable peace. We are sticking with NATO's joint analysis.” Trump and his NATO counterparts noted, in a summit statement in June, “the long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security.” However, Hille insisted that “in view of the great security policy challenges, trans-Atlantic cooperation is now and will be in the future of central significance for our common security.” Geir Moulson contributed to this report from Berlin.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump confirmed on Monday he plans to sign an executive order preempting artificial intelligence regulations at the state level with his more hands-off federal policy. “We are beating ALL COUNTRIES at this point in the race, but that won't last long if we are going to have 50 States, many of them bad actors, involved in RULES and the APPROVAL PROCESS.” Critics worry the deregulation push could allow AI companies to evade accountability should their tools harm consumers. The fast-moving AI category is already subject to little oversight as it extends into more areas of life — from personal communications and relationships to health care and policing. But leaders in Silicon Valley such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have argued that navigating a patchwork of state regulations could slow down innovation and affect America's competitiveness in the global AI race, which they say will have implications for the economy and national security. The draft order closely mirrored that tech argument, stating it was designed to “enhance America's global AI dominance through a minimally burdensome, uniform national policy framework for AI.” It directed the US attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force to challenge state AI laws and preempt them with Trump's more lax federal policy, according to a copy viewed by CNN. In his Monday Truth Social post, Trump reiterated that sentiment, saying, “You can't expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something,” and adding that under such a model, “AI WILL BE DESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY!” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC on Monday that Trump had reviewed “something close to a final” draft of the order over the weekend. “There are some states that want to regulate these companies within an inch of their lives, and when they make a misstep, fine the heck out of them,” Hassett said. “This executive order that he's promised to come out is going to make it clear that there's one set of rules for AI companies in the US.” Trump renews effort to block states from regulating AI, raising alarms about safety Congress killed an earlier attempt by Republicans to prevent states from regulating AI in July. The US Senate voted nearly unanimously to remove a 10-year moratorium on the enforcement of state artificial intelligence regulations from Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill before it passed. Weeks later, the Trump administration released a Silicon Valley-friendly AI action plan, a package of initiatives and policy recommendations that largely centered on scaling back AI regulation to promote US competitiveness. The idea of blocking states from regulating AI has received broad pushback in recent months amid a string of reports highlighting risks of the technology causing delusions or contributing to self-harm among users, or exposing children to sexualized, adult material. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the effort “federal government overreach” in a post on X last month. “Stripping states of jurisdiction to regulate AI is a subsidy to Big Tech and will prevent states from protecting against online censorship of political speech, predatory applications that target children, violations of intellectual property rights and data center intrusions on power/water resources,” he said. “We cannot afford to spend the next decade with Big Tech in the driver's seat, steering us toward massive job losses, surveillance pricing algorithms that jack up the cost of living, and data centers that are skyrocketing home energy bills.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Rep. Jasmine Crockett filed Monday to run for US Senate from Texas in 2026, according to a list posted by the state Democratic Party, entering the race on the same day that a potential rival, Colin Allred, ended his bid. State Republicans' unprecedented mid-decade redistricting this summer upended the House map, while a contentious GOP Senate primary has emboldened Democrats in the 2026 race for Republican Sen. John Cornyn's seat. Earlier Monday, Allred, a former Texas Democratic representative, announced that he was ending his Senate campaign and would instead run to once again represent the Lone Star State in Congress. CNN previously reported that Crockett asked Allred to drop out of the race, and has cited a poll in some conversations that shows her in strong shape. “I needed to try and decide what I thought would be best for the state, for the party in a time and in a year where there is so much at stake,” he told CNN. Texas State Sen. James Talarico, who elevated his profile during clashes over the Republican redistricting effort this summer, will also run in the Democratic Senate primary. He joined the race in September and has quickly topped Allred's fundraising numbers. “Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.” Crockett, meanwhile, has spent weeks floating a potential Senate bid, making calls and sounding out potential supporters, as Democrats game out a reshuffled slate for 2026. Crockett and Rep. Marc Veasey, a fellow Dallas Democrat dealing with the gerrymandered breakup of his current seat, discussed sequencing on Monday for him to file in her district shortly after she submits her Senate paperwork. Monday's shake-up injects fresh intrigue to a Texas Senate race that has already been marked by high drama. It's an open question, though, which contender gives the party its best shot. “To me, going through a bruising primary, and in Texas, we have a runoff – and we would certainly have a runoff in this case – was not in the best interest of the state or the party,” Allred told CNN on Monday. “This new district deserves representation that has been present in the tough moments, including throughout the redistricting fight, instead of parachuting back when another campaign doesn't work out,” Johnson said in a statement. “Families here are dealing with rising costs, housing pressures, and real economic strain. They deserve someone with a strong record in Democratic collaboration and support.” Rep. Joaquin Castro, who was involved in discussions about running for Texas attorney general but chose to seek reelection, said Crockett should run for Senate “if that's where her heart is and that's where her mind is.”</p>

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors and praised Sylvester Stallone, Kiss, Gloria Gaynor, Michael Crawford and George Strait, the slate of honorees he helped choose, as being “legendary in so many ways.” Since returning to office in January, Trump has made the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which is named after a Democratic predecessor, a touchstone in a broader attack against what he has lambasted as “woke” anti-American culture. Trump said Saturday that he was hosting “at the request of a certain television network.” He predicted the broadcast scheduled for Dec. 23 on CBS and Paramount+, would have its best ratings ever. Trump skipped the honors altogether during his first term. Asked how he got ready for the gig, Trump said as he moved along the red carpet with his wife, first lady Melania Trump, that he “didn't really prepare very much.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said his boss “is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight.” Lutnick arrived with his wife, a member of the Kennedy Center's board. He also talked up each artist in prerecorded videos that played before their tributes. And he said it was a “fantastic” night. “Well, we're really having a good time tonight,” Trump said. “So many people I know in this audience. Strait is a leader in the world of country music and Crawford, a Tony Award-winning actor, is best known for starring in “Phantom of the Opera,” the longest-running show in Broadway history. Trump said persistence is a trait shared by the honorees, several of whom had humble beginnings. “But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.” “I know so many of you are persistent,” Trump said in his opening. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. During the tribute to Kiss, a lone red guitar that emitted smoke was placed on stage in remembrance of Frehley, who was known for having a smoke bomb in his instrument. The program closed with a rousing performance by Cheap Trick of Kiss' “Rock and Roll All Nite” that brought the audience to its feet. “This is an amazing event,” he said on the red carpet. “But you're caught up in the middle of it. Crawford also said it was “humbling, especially at the end of a career.” Gaynor said it “feels like a dream” to be honored. “To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,” she said after arriving. Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who performed for Gaynor, called her a dear friend. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who elected him chair. Asked Sunday night about a possible renaming, Trump said it would be up to the board. Still, he joked at one point about the “Trump Kennedy Center.” Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face to face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate. During Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were “too woke.” He said Sunday that about 50 names were whittled down to five. While Stallone is one of Trump's Hollywood ”special ambassadors” and has likened Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear. Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Trump was “out for himself” and criticized Trump for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism. Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were “terrorists.” But after Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity. “If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.”</p>

Ankehitriny, mba hiarovana ny rohivoahary tahaka izao — sy hamonjena ireo biby anisan'ny mahavariana indrindra eto an-tany — dia mila fomba fiasa mavitrika kokoa. Raha sendra mahita biby dia any an'ala ianao eto Madagasikara, matetika tsy misy any an-kafa mihitsy eto an-tany izany biby izany. Madagasikara, izay nosy lehibe iray any atsinanan'i Afrika, dia efa voasaraka tamin'ny tany hafa nandritra ny an-tapitrisa taona, ka nanome fotoana lava ho an'ny biby eto hiova ho karazana vaovao. Tamin'ny alina mangatsiaka iray tamin'ny volana Septambra, amin'ny fiafaran'ny ririnina eto Madagasikara, dia nandeha an-tongotra tao anaty alan'i Ambohitantely aho niaraka tamin'i Fandresena Rakotoarimalala, mpikaroka manao doktorà ao amin'ny Oniversiten'Antananarivo izay mianatra momba ny tanalahy ao amin'ilay faritra arovana. Fa rehefa tratran'ny hazavan'ny jiro izy ireo, dia miseho fotsifotsy izy ireo, ka lasa mora hita lavitra. Nandeha moramora izahay tao anaty ala, nitsilo ny ravinkazo tamin'ny jironay no sady nandroaka moka sy bibikely mitangorona eo amin'ny hazavana. Nisy fotoana, sendra nahita trandraka izahay — biby mandady misy tsilo tahaka ny sora kely — nivezivezy tao anaty ala. Isaky ny metatra vitsivitsy, i Rakotoarimalala — izay efa nantsoina hoe Mpanjakavavin'ny tanalahy — dia mijanona ka manondro zavatra fotsifotsy miraikitra amin'ny ravina. Ny ankamaroany dia karazana tanalahy “Perinet” tanora, izay kely vatana ary manana hoditra maitso toy ny emeraoda. Nahita tarondro “à cornes-globes” maromaro koa izy, karazana tandindomin-doza, izay manana loha miendrika telozoro. Ny mason'izy ireo dia mety samy mijery amin'izay jereny avy. Tao anatin'ny ora vitsivitsy monja tamin'iny alina iny, nahita tanalahy mihoatra ny 60 izahay, avy amin'ny karazany telo samihafa. Ary io habetsahana io no iray amin'ireo antony maha-zava-dehibe ny fiarovana an'i Ambohitantely, hoy Rakotoarimalala, izay mianatra momba ny fahasalaman'ny tanalahy sy ny génétique-n'izy ireo ao amin'ilay faritra arovana. Eto Madagasikara sy amin'ireo firenena mahantra maro hafa, tsy nahitana fahombiazana loatra ireo faritra arovana ireo. Matetika ny olona tsy manan-tsafidy afa-tsy ny miankina amin'ny ala mba hivelomany, na arovana ara-dalàna aza ireo hazo ireo na tsia. Tsy mba tahak'izany Ambohitantely: Tantanin'ny fikambanana tsy miankina antsoina hoe Madagascar National Parks (MNP) ilay faritra, ka nahavita nampihena ny fanapahana hazo ao anatiny, satria lavitra ny tanàna be olona ilay ala. Kely ihany koa ilay faritra arovana, ka mora kokoa ny manaraha-maso azy. Fa na izany aza dia tsy voa antonka tanteraka ny fiarovana ilay faritra. Ary matetika loatra dia miparitaka tsy voafehy ireo afo. Tamin'ny taona 2022 irery, dia may ny ampahatelon'ny ala sisa tavela, araka ny filazan'i Jacquis Andonahary, botanista ao amin'ny fikambanana fiarovana ny tontolo ianainana ao an-toerana antsoina hoe Association Vahatra, izay miasa ao amin'ny faritra arovana. Ny fiovan'ny toetrandro, etsy ankilany, dia vao mainka mampitombo herin'ity loza ity. “Mihalava ny fotoanan'ny main-tany, ka lasa betsaka kokoa ny zavatra afaka mirehitra,” hoy i Steve Goodman, mpikaroka ao amin'ny Field Museum of Natural History sy filoha lefitry ny Vahatra. Ny fiovan'ny toetrandro dia mahatonga ny zavamaniry ho mora mirehitra amin'ny faritra maro maneran-tany, na ao anatin'ny faritra arovana na tsia. Tsotra ny fomba ataon'izy ireo: mamboly hazo betsaka. Sarotra anefa ny manome toky fa ho velona ireo hazo novolena. Nanao fikarohana i Andonahary tao anaty ala mba hahafantarana hoe inona avy ireo hazo mitombo ao sy inona ireo toe-javatra ilainy (karazan-tany, hazavana, sns). Avy eo, nanangona voa ny Vahatra sy ireo mponina, namelona azy ireo tao amin'ny toeram-pambolena zana-kazo, ary nametraka ireo zana-kazo teny amin'ny sisin'ny ala sisa tavela, nanisy zezika hanatsarana azy. Tena zava-bita lehibe izany, satria matetika tsy mahomby ny fambolen-kazo. Rehefa voavoly ireo hazo, dia ireo mpikaroka sy ny mponina no miezaka miaro azy tsy ho may. Manana kitapo misy rano entina an-damosina ihany koa izy ireo izay azon'izy ireo ampiasaina hamonoana afo. Zava-dehibe kokoa, ny Vahatra sy ny MNP dia nametraka andalana roa mitovy manodidina an'i Ambohitantely, antsoina hoe aroafo — tany malama tsy misy ahitra afaka mirehitra, izay tsy tokony hahafahan'ny afo mandalo. Vahaolana tsotra io, izay efa nampiasain'ny olona, anisan'izany ireo foko teratany any Etazonia, Kanada, ary Aostralia, nandritra ny taonjato maro hifehezana ny fiparitahan'ny afo. Ilay afo hitako tamin'iny alina iny tamin'ny volana Septambra dia tsy tonga tao Ambohitantely mihitsy — noho ireo ezaka ireo. Novonoin'ireo mpamono afo miasa ao amin'ny MNP ilay afo, araka ny filazan'i Ricky Tiavina Rakotonindrina, mpiasa ao amin'ny MNP izay mitantana ilay faritra arovana. Fa mazava ho azy, mbola hisy indray ny afo hafa. Ka ny fanontaniana ankehitriny dia hoe: ho ampy ve ireo ezaka hiarovana ilay faritra arovana — sy ireo harena rehetra ao anatiny anisan'izany ireo harena mety mbola tsy hita?

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Republicans in key battleground U.S. House districts are working to contain the political fallout that may come when thousands of their constituents face higher bills for health insurance coverage obtained through the Affordable Care Act. For a critical sliver of the Republican majority, the impending expiration of what are called enhanced premium tax credits after Dec. 31 is a pressing concern as they potentially face headwinds in a 2026 midterm election that will be critical to President Donald Trump's agenda. Mackenzie is part of a bipartisan group that has been pressing for an eleventh-hour compromise, advocating for an extension of the tax credits that tries to fix perceived flaws and bring down health care costs. “I think that we need to deal with the reality of where we are now and even if you have a broken system, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't provide or offer relief to individuals who are dealing with those high costs right now,” Mackenzie said in an interview with The Associated Press. Democrats have been laying the groundwork, starting with this fall's shutdown fight, to make the health care issue a focus of next year's campaigns. In Washington, Republicans from competitive House districts have authored or signed onto bills that would temporarily extend the tax credits. A new bipartisan proposal unveiled Thursday has drawn support from roughly 15 Republicans and 20 Democrats so far. “I have 40,000 people in my district who rely on this health care and doing nothing to prevent a spike in their premiums is wrong,” said U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a sponsor of the plan. Thirteen Republicans — including Mackenzie — signed a letter in late October to the House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., encouraging the temporary extension of the tax credits, saying letting them “lapse without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.” Johnson hasn't committed to a short-term extension vote before Jan. 1 and has dismissed the looming premium increases as affecting a small percentage of Americans. More than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, including farmers, business owners and other self-employed people who don't have other health insurance options through their work. Many benefit from subsidies that lower their out-of-pocket cost. Those subsidies include the enhanced premium tax credits, which were added and then extended under Democratic President Joe Biden when his party was the majority in Congress. Some Republicans — including Mackenzie — couch their support for an extension with the caveat that changes must be made. U.S. Rep. Kevin Kiley, one of the California Republicans whose districts have been redrawn to favor a Democrat, sponsored a bill to extend the tax credits for two years. His bill would also impose an income eligibility cap to exclude higher earners. Kiley said the current system isn't working, but there's not enough time to make systematic reforms before millions of Americans “just suddenly pay double on their premiums.” “The kind of election we're going to have in the midterms in multiple districts is going to be decided by one or two points. U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the House Republicans' campaign arm, said the tax credits won't be “decisive” in next year's election when other things are likely to be on voters' minds. “The number one issue across the country is affordability and health care is a key part of that,” DelBene said. The Congressional Budget Office projects that 3.8 million more people will be uninsured in 2035 if the tax credits aren't extended. The expiration of the tax credits means enrollees will see annual premiums more than double — from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to health care research nonprofit KFF. A primary field of Democrats is shaping up for the nomination to challenge Mackenzie. One of those Democrats, Ryan Crosswell, said rising insurance costs are a “breaking of promises” by Trump, Republicans and Mackenzie. Another Democrat, Carol Obando-Derstine, called the impending expiration a “crisis of (Mackenzie's) own making.” He won his race last year by 1 percentage point, or about 4,000 votes. One of those 20,000 people in Mackenzie's district is Patrick Visconti, who switched to a low-premium, high-deductible plan because he couldn't afford to keep his plan with a premium that is more than doubling from under $200 to over $500 a month. But I can't get anything for $200,” Visconti said. Lynn Weidner, a home care worker in Mackenzie's district who works nearly 80 hours a week, said her $400 premium will increase to $680.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Defense Authorization Act text was released Sunday night, coming after a few days' delay as key provisions were being hashed out between the chambers after passing their own separate versions earlier this year. The release of the bill text was slated for Thursday, but that timeline was delayed as lawmakers worked to resolve sticking points on various policy issues. It is one of the only bills that must pass Congress each year. It often gets last-minute additions and votes on hundreds of amendments on the floor, many of which do not make it into the final legislation, as they often have little or nothing to do with national security. Included in the legislation is a repeal of the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force related to Iraq, which granted the president authority to use military force without issuing a formal declaration of war. The repeal will now make it harder for presidents to bypass Congress on military actions. Also in the NDAA is a provision from Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) that caused headaches for House leaders last week. Stefanik's amendment requires the FBI to notify Congress if candidates for federal office are under investigation. If passed, service members will receive a 3.8% pay raise in the NDAA. There will also be a limit on outbound U.S. investments in China. Lawmakers came close to imposing restrictions last year, but that effort collapsed thanks to interference from Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO and former Trump adviser. This is likely to cause some disagreement among members due to wariness over the impact on the technology sector, but supporters have argued it is a necessary step for national security. Notably, the NDAA does not include language to expand in vitro fertilization treatment for service members. Johnson opposed including an expansion, previously saying Congress should not get involved in legislating on IVF. He did leave the door open on a possible compromise for another piece of legislation in the future this past week, with a spokesperson saying the speaker is “supportive of access to IVF when sufficient pro-life protections are in place, and he will continue to be supportive when it is done responsibly and ethically.” The defense bill also does not include the ROAD to Housing Act, which was a legislative priority for Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC). In a statement on Sunday, Hill said he shares Trump's goal to expand housing and that the Financial Services Committee will “advance solutions” this month to “tackle housing cost and access challenges” for people. The House-passed NDAA in September blocked War Secretary Pete Hegseth's reversal of a separate base-renaming effort for nine Army posts, which was directed by Congress in 2020. But those provisions are no longer in the NDAA released Sunday, per House Republican leadership aides. House Republicans are celebrating the NDAA, saying it will carry out Trump's “peace through strength” agenda. Republicans are touting that the bill saves taxpayers $20 billion. Johnson highlighted that the bill codifies 15 of Trump's executive orders and ends “woke ideology” at the Pentagon in a statement on Sunday. “Under President Trump, the U.S. is rebuilding strength, restoring deterrence, and proving America will not back down,” Johnson said. “I'm eager to send this to President Trump's desk so we can give our military the tools they need to remain the most ready, capable, and lethal force in the world,” Rogers said in a statement. The Washington Examiner reached out to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS), House Armed Services Committee ranking member Adam Smith (D-WA), and Senate Armed Services Committee ranking member Jack Reed (D-RI) for comment.</p>
